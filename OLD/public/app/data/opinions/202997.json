The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed an Immigration Judge's (IJ's) denial of\n\nKannkosal Ouk's claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).             Ouk,1 a\n\nnative and citizen of Cambodia, now petitions this court for review\n\nof the BIA's denial of his asylum claim.2          Because a reasonable\n\nfact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that Ouk has met his\n\nburden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum, we deny Ouk's\n\npetition for review. However, we also note several deficiencies in\n\nthe IJ's formulation of his credibility findings.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The IJ found Ouk credible.           Therefore, we relate the\n\nfacts of the case as he testified to them.\n\n          Before leaving Cambodia in May 2003, Kannkosal Ouk was\n\nemployed as a pharmacist by the Cambodian Ministry of Health, in\n\nthe capital city of Phnom Penh.    Ouk was also an active member of\n\nthe Sam Rainsy Party, a leading opposition party in Cambodia.           He\n\ntestified that his duties as a party member included speaking with\n\nco-workers and others about the party, and recruiting them for\n\nmembership.   He   testified   that     this   involvement   led   to   two\n\n\n\n     1\n      Ouk's wife, Phallikasreymoon Hun, and his son, Kosalvisal\nOuk, both natives and citizens of Cambodia, are derivative\napplicants for asylum, based on Kannkosal Ouk's application.\n     2\n      Ouk does not seek review of the BIA's denial of withholding\nof removal or protection under the CAT.\n\n                                  -2-\n\finstances of persecution against him, which occurred in the lead-up\n\nto the 2003 Cambodian general elections.\n\n            First, in January 2003, as Ouk left work, he was met by\n\ntwo men on a motorcycle, wearing civilian clothing; Ouk testified\n\nthat the men had threatening demeanors and that one of them\n\nappeared to have a gun at his waist, under his shirt.        The men\n\nfollowed Ouk closely as he drove home on his motorcycle, and\n\neventually the men motioned for Ouk to follow them.     The men led\n\nOuk to a secluded area near a temple and, upon arriving, told Ouk\n\nthat if he did not stop supporting the Sam Rainsy Party, \"he\n\n[would] have a problem.\"\n\n            The second incident occurred about one month later, in\n\nFebruary 2003. Again, Ouk was riding his motorcycle in the evening\n\nwhen two men, also on a motorcycle, ordered him to follow them to\n\nthe Olympic Stadium.    In a secluded area near the stadium, the two\n\nmen confronted Ouk, pushed his motorcycle to the ground, pointed\n\ntheir guns at Ouk, and asked him why he continued his involvement\n\nwith the Sam Rainsy Party when he had already been warned to cease\n\nhis activity.    The men pushed Ouk to the ground, and began beating\n\nand kicking him.    They hit him on the nose with a gun, and he lost\n\nconsciousness.     He woke up about an hour later and, realizing his\n\nmotorcycle no longer worked, walked home, pushing the motorcycle\n\nwith him.   He did not seek medical care for his injuries.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            Ouk testified that he \"strongly believe[d]\" that the men\n\nwho attacked him on both occasions were members of the secret\n\npolice of the ruling Cambodian People's Party. However, he did not\n\nexplain the reasons for this belief or offer any corroborating\n\nevidence.\n\n            Alarmed by the attack, Ouk, his wife, and young son fled\n\nto a nearby village.           Ouk did not return to his job after the\n\nattack. The family sought tourist visas from the United States and\n\nentered with inspection at Los Angeles, CA, on May 23, 2003, three\n\nmonths after the second incident.             Ouk filed for asylum within the\n\none-year time limit.\n\n            The Immigration Judge denied Ouk's asylum application and\n\nhis other attendant claims, finding that Ouk did not show that the\n\nattacks     against    him     were    \"[g]overnmentally    orchestrated   or\n\ncondoned,     rather    than    just    isolated     incidents   of   violence\n\nperpetrated by thugs who were in disagreement with the respondent's\n\npolitical philosophy.\" The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial in a brief\n\ndecision, on the grounds that the harm Ouk suffered did not amount\n\nto past persecution, and that his claim of future persecution was\n\nundermined by the lack of an objective basis for his belief that\n\nhis assailants were from the government's secret police.              The BIA\n\nalso refused Ouk's request to consider evidence regarding Cambodian\n\ngun control policy, because he failed to submit the evidence to the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fIJ.3   Ouk now seeks review of the BIA's decision denying his asylum\n\nclaim.\n\n                                           II.\n\n                  We review the BIA's denial of asylum for substantial\n\nevidence, and accept the BIA's findings of fact if they are\n\nsupported by \"'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.'\"               Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d\n\n335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)).           We will reverse the decision below only if \"any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"         8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).          Where, as here, \"the BIA's\n\ndecision adopts portions of the IJ's opinion,\" this court will\n\nreview \"those portions of the IJ's opinion that the BIA has\n\nadopted.\"         Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                  The petitioner carries the burden of proof to establish\n\nhis eligibility for asylum.              Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262\n\n(1st       Cir.    2005).     He   can   meet    this    burden   by   proving   past\n\npersecution,          which   gives      rise    to     an   inference   of   future\n\npersecution, or by establishing a well-founded fear of persecution\n\non account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\n\n       3\n      Ouk, in his reply brief, seeks review of the BIA's refusal to\nconsider this new evidence. Because he did not raise the issue in\nhis opening brief, however, it is deemed waived. See United States\nv. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[I]ssues raised for the\nfirst time in an appellant's reply brief are generally deemed\nwaived.\").   We also deem the other issues raised by Ouk in his\nreply brief to be waived, for the same reason.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fparticular social group, or political opinion. Id. \"To qualify as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\"   Nelson v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d\n\n258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n\n          Thus, our review of the decision below regarding whether\n\nOuk suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution is highly circumscribed.     We can only reverse if the\n\nevidence compels the opposite conclusion.     In this case, because\n\nOuk recounted only one instance of physical abuse, for which he did\n\nnot seek medical treatment, a conclusion of past persecution is not\n\ncompelled.   See, e.g., Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263 (evidence that\n\npetitioner was beaten twice by state police was insufficient to\n\ncompel the conclusion that petitioner suffered past persecution).\n\nSimilarly, because Ouk presented only his own conclusory opinion to\n\nsupport his belief that the men who attacked him were government\n\nagents, the record does not compel us to conclude that he has a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.4       See Harutyunyan v.\n\n\n     4\n      This is not to say that an asylum applicant's testimony\nalone, recounting his belief that government agents attacked him,\nif found credible, would be an insufficient basis for a grant of\nasylum in the first instance, assuming the other requirements for\nasylum were met. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii) (\"The testimony\nof the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant's\nburden without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies\nthe trier of fact that the applicant's testimony is credible, is\npersuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate\nthat the applicant is a refugee.\"). In contrast, given our limited\nstandard of review on appeal, neither the reports by human rights\norganizations of the Cambodian government's inaction with respect\nto politically motivated violence nor Ouk's slim evidence of\n\n                               -6-\n\fGonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[P]ersecution always\n\nimplies some connection to government action or inaction.\").\n\n          Though we deny Ouk's petition for review of his asylum\n\nclaim, we also note significant short-comings in the Immigration\n\nJudge's opinion with regard to his credibility findings.5      These\n\ndeficiencies, however, do not impact our decision to deny Ouk's\n\npetition for review because, given that the IJ ultimately found Ouk\n\nto be credible, we have based our denial on the facts as presented\n\nby Ouk.\n\n          The IJ stated several times in his oral decision that he\n\nfound Ouk to be credible, yet he simultaneously questioned the\n\n\"plausibility\" of various events recounted by Ouk. At one point in\n\nthe decision, the IJ stated:\n\n          While I do find that there are aspects of the\n          respondent's testimony which I find curious\n          and troubling, to which I will address myself\n          shortly, I have no basis upon which to find\n          the respondent other then [sic] credible.\n\nAfter questioning why Ouk did not receive medical care after the\n\nattack on him, the IJ stated:\n\n\n\ngovernment-led persecution compels the reversal of the denial of\nhis asylum claim as to future persecution.\n     5\n      Ouk characterizes these deficiencies as both an infirmity in\nthe IJ's credibility finding and as a due process violation.\nBecause he does not offer any legal basis for maintaining that the\ndeficiencies constitute a due process violation, that claim is\nwaived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\nby some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                -7-\n\f            Once again, I want to be clear that I have no\n            basis for evaluating this testimony and\n            concluding the respondent to be non-credible.\n            Rather, in my evaluation I don't really\n            believe it to be plausible nor is it\n            convincing.\n\n\nBy making these statements, the IJ provided a muddled analysis of\n\nOuk's credibility.   The plausibility of a respondent's story is a\n\nfactor that impacts the IJ's overall credibility finding.     See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) (a credibility determination may be\n\nbased on a variety of factors, including \"the inherent plausibility\n\nof the applicant's or witness's account\").       Therefore, it is\n\ncontradictory to maintain, as the IJ did here, that, as to one\n\nindividual testimonial element, a respondent's testimony is both\n\ncredible and not plausible.\n\n            We also point out a second, similar malady in the IJ's\n\ndecision.     The IJ stated that, while it was \"possible\" that\n\npetitioner spoke with co-workers and others about the Sam Rainsy\n\nParty and attempted to recruit them, it was \"simply not convincing\n\nthat the respondent would take such a chance with co-workers who\n\ncould expose him to superiors and cause the loss of his employment\n\nor some other impediment to the advancement of his career.\"   It is\n\nambiguous whether the IJ was making a finding specific to the\n\nparticulars of Ouk; if so, his findings would have had more\n\nstrength if he had explained why, in this particular case, it is\n\nunconvincing that Ouk himself would take such a risk.   In failing\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fto articulate the particularized basis for his finding, the IJ's\n\nconclusion could be read as making a broad generalization that no\n\none, including Ouk, would risk his employment in order to advocate\n\nfor a political viewpoint or party. Such a statement is, on its\n\nface, simply incorrect.         Indeed, at the heart of many successful\n\nasylum claims is a person who takes extraordinary risks in order to\n\nadvance   a    political   or   social   cause   to   which   he   is   deeply\n\ncommitted.     An IJ is free to find an asylum applicant's testimony\n\nnot credible because he does not believe the applicant would take\n\nthe risks he alleges to have taken, but \"the IJ must, if he or she\n\nchooses to reject [petitioner's] testimony as lacking credibility,\n\noffer a specific, cogent reason for [the IJ's] disbelief.\" Gailius\n\nv. I.N.S., 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).        The IJ here did not do so.\n\n                                     III.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we deny Ouk's petition for\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Ouk,<sup>[1]</sup> a native and citizen of Cambodia, now petitions this court for review of the BIA's denial of his asylum claim.<sup>[2]</sup> Because a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that Ouk has met his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum, we deny Ouk's petition for review.

Therefore, we relate the facts of the case as he testified to them.</p>\n<p>Before leaving Cambodia in May 2003, Kannkosal Ouk was employed as a pharmacist by the Cambodian Ministry of Health, in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Ouk was also an active member of the Sam Rainsy Party, a leading opposition party in Cambodia.

The plausibility of a respondent's story is a factor that impacts the IJ's overall credibility finding. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) (a credibility determination may be based on a variety of factors, including \"the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness's account\"). Therefore, it is contradictory to maintain, as the IJ did here, that, as to one individual testimonial element, a respondent's testimony is both credible and not plausible.</p>\n<p>We also point out a second, similar malady in the IJ's decision. The IJ stated that, while it was \"possible\" that petitioner spoke with co-workers and others about the Sam Rainsy Party and attempted to recruit them, it was \"simply not convincing that the respondent would take such a chance with co-workers who could expose him to superiors and cause the loss of his employment or some other impediment to the advancement of his career.\" It is ambiguous whether the IJ was making a finding specific to the particulars of Ouk; if so, his findings would have had more strength if he had explained why, in this particular case, it is unconvincing that Ouk himself would take such a risk. In failing to articulate the particularized basis for his finding, the IJ's conclusion could be read as making a broad generalization that no one, including Ouk, would risk his employment in order to advocate for a political viewpoint or party. Such a statement is, on its face, simply incorrect. Indeed, at the heart of many successful asylum claims is a person who takes extraordinary risks in order to advance a political or social cause to which he is deeply committed. An IJ is free to find an asylum applicant's testimony not credible because he does not believe the applicant would take the risks he alleges to have taken, but \"the IJ must, if he or she chooses to reject [petitioner's] testimony as lacking credibility, offer a specific, cogent reason for [the IJ's] disbelief.\" <i>Gailius v.

Blaya, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, Peter Keisler, Acting Attorney General, and Anthony W. Norwood, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge, and OBERDORFER,<sup>[**]</sup> Senior District Judge.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed an Immigration Judge's (IJ's) denial of Kannkosal Ouk's claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Ouk,<sup>[1]</sup> a native and citizen of Cambodia, now petitions this court for review of the BIA's denial of his asylum claim.<sup>[2]</sup> Because a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that Ouk has met his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum, we deny Ouk's petition for review. However, we also note several deficiencies in the IJ's formulation of his credibility findings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The IJ found Ouk credible. Therefore, we relate the facts of the case as he testified to them.</p>\n<p>Before leaving Cambodia in May 2003, Kannkosal Ouk was employed as a pharmacist by the Cambodian Ministry of Health, in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Ouk was also an active member of the Sam Rainsy Party, a leading opposition party in Cambodia. He testified that his duties as a party member included speaking with co-workers and others about the party, and recruiting them for membership. He testified that this involvement led to two instances of persecution against him, which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> occurred in the lead-up to the 2003 Cambodian general elections.</p>\n<p>First, in January 2003, as Ouk left work, he was met by two men on a motorcycle, wearing civilian clothing; Ouk testified that the men had threatening demeanors and that one of them appeared to have a gun at his waist, under his shirt. The men followed Ouk closely as he drove home on his motorcycle, and eventually the men motioned for Ouk to follow them. The men led Ouk to a secluded area near a temple and, upon arriving, told Ouk that if he did not stop supporting the Sam Rainsy Party, \"he [would] have a problem.\"</p>\n<p>The second incident occurred about one month later, in February 2003. Again, Ouk was riding his motorcycle in the evening when two men, also on a motorcycle, ordered him to follow them to the Olympic Stadium. In a secluded area near the stadium, the two men confronted Ouk, pushed his motorcycle to the ground, pointed their guns at Ouk, and asked him why he continued his involvement with the Sam Rainsy Party when he had already been warned to cease his activity. The men pushed Ouk to the ground, and began beating and kicking him. They hit him on the nose with a gun, and he lost consciousness. He woke up about an hour later and, realizing his motorcycle no longer worked, walked home, pushing the motorcycle with him. He did not seek medical care for his injuries.</p>\n<p>Ouk testified that he \"strongly believe[d]\" that the men who attacked him on both occasions were members of the secret police of the ruling Cambodian People's Party. However, he did not explain the reasons for this belief or offer any corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p>Alarmed by the attack, Ouk, his wife, and young son fled to a nearby village. Ouk did not return to his job after the attack. The family sought tourist visas from the United States and entered with inspection at Los Angeles, CA, on May 23, 2003, three months after the second incident. Ouk filed for asylum within the one-year time limit.</p>\n<p>The Immigration Judge denied Ouk's asylum application and his other attendant claims, finding that Ouk did not show that the attacks against him were \"[g]overnmentally orchestrated or condoned, rather than just isolated incidents of violence perpetrated by thugs who were in disagreement with the respondent's political philosophy.\" The BIA affirmed the IJ's denial in a brief decision, on the grounds that the harm Ouk suffered did not amount to past persecution, and that his claim of future persecution was undermined by the lack of an objective basis for his belief that his assailants were from the government's secret police. The BIA also refused Ouk's request to consider evidence regarding Cambodian gun control policy, because he failed to submit the evidence to the IJ.<sup>[3]</sup> Ouk now seeks review of the BIA's decision denying his asylum claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the BIA's denial of asylum for substantial evidence, and accept the BIA's findings of fact if they are supported by \"`reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>Njenga v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201296\"><a href=\"/opinion/201296/njenga-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 338 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> <i>INS v.

We will reverse the decision below only if \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B). Where, as here, \"the BIA's decision adopts portions of the IJ's opinion,\" this court will review \"those portions of the IJ's opinion that the BIA has adopted.\" <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The petitioner carries the burden of proof to establish his eligibility for asylum. <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201655\"><a href=\"/opinion/201655/bocova-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 262 (1st Cir.2005). He can meet this burden by proving past persecution, which gives rise to an inference of future persecution, or by establishing a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>Id.</i> \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Thus, our review of the decision below regarding whether Ouk suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution is highly circumscribed. We can only reverse if the evidence compels the opposite conclusion. In this case, because Ouk recounted only one instance of physical abuse, for which he did not seek medical treatment, a conclusion of past persecution is not compelled. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263 (evidence that petitioner was beaten twice by state police was insufficient to compel the conclusion that petitioner suffered past persecution). Similarly, because Ouk presented only his own conclusory opinion to support his belief that the men who attacked him were government agents, the record does not compel us to conclude that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[P]ersecution always implies some connection to government action or inaction.\").</p>\n<p>Though we deny Ouk's petition for review of his asylum claim, we also note significant short-comings in the Immigration Judge's opinion with regard to his credibility findings.<sup>[5]</sup> These deficiencies, however, do not impact our decision to deny Ouk's petition for review because, given that the IJ ultimately found Ouk to be credible, we have based our denial on the facts as presented by Ouk.</p>\n<p>The IJ stated several times in his oral decision that he found Ouk to be credible, yet he simultaneously questioned the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> \"plausibility\" of various events recounted by Ouk. At one point in the decision, the IJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote>While I do find that there are aspects of the respondent's testimony which I find curious and troubling, to which I will address myself shortly, I have no basis upon which to find the respondent other then [sic] credible.</blockquote>\n<p>After questioning why Ouk did not receive medical care after the attack on him, the IJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Once again, I want to be clear that I have no basis for evaluating this testimony and concluding the respondent to be non-credible.
