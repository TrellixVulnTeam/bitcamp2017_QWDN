Petitioner Xiang Xing Gao, a\n\nnative and citizen of the People's Republic of China, petitions for\n\nreview of a final order of removal of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA), which denied his petition for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nAn Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Gao was not credible and that\n\nhe had failed to establish either past persecution or a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. The BIA summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision, but subsequently granted a motion to reopen the\n\nproceedings.    On remand, the IJ again found Gao not credible and\n\nfound that Gao had not met his burden.   The BIA summarily affirmed\n\nthe IJ's decision.   We affirm the BIA and deny the petition.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           On or about January 17, 2000, Gao entered the United\n\nStates using fraudulent documents procured through a \"snakehead,\"\n\nto whom Gao had paid $45,000.   Gao filed an application for asylum\n\non November 3, 2000, claiming both that his wife had been forcibly\n\nsterilized and that he had been persecuted for his Roman Catholic\n\nfaith.    On February 15, 2001, Gao was served with a Notice to\n\nAppear, and on November 2, 2001, Gao appeared before an IJ on his\n\nasylum claim.\n\n           Gao was the only person to testify at the hearing before\n\nthe IJ.   Gao testified that he was born in the village of Liu Shiu\n\nin the Fujian Province of China and lived most of his life there.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fHe and his wife married in 1977 and had one son in 1978.        They had\n\na second son in 1980, but he died in 1981.         Gao testified that\n\nfollowing the birth of his second son, his wife had an IUD\n\ninserted, which he subsequently paid a private doctor to remove.\n\nGao testified that he and his wife then went into hiding at his\n\ncousin's house in Jiangsu Province for several years. While there,\n\nGao and his wife had a third child in 1983.        Gao testified that\n\nwhen his wife became pregnant with their fourth child, they were\n\nforced to move back to his village because they did not have a\n\nvalid birth permit.\n\n           Gao testified that after the birth of their fourth child,\n\nin 1985, his wife went into hiding at her mother's house, fearing\n\nthat she would be required to submit to sterilization. He asserted\n\nthat when the local government authorities found out about the\n\nbirth, they came to his house to arrest his wife, and, not finding\n\nhis wife, they arrested him instead.        He further testified that\n\nafter his arrest, his mother contacted his wife to suggest that she\n\nsubmit to sterilization in order to secure his release, which she\n\ndid.\n\n           Gao also testified to incidents when local officials\n\npurportedly harassed him for adhering to the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nHe claimed that he was first contacted about this in 1997, and that\n\nin 1998, officials threatened him with imprisonment if he continued\n\nto   practice   Catholicism.   Gao   also   testified   that   officials\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdestroyed first the cross, then the entire church, that he had\n\ncontributed to building.\n\n            Following this testimony, the IJ issued an oral decision\n\ndenying Gao asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe CAT.    The IJ first found that the documents Gao submitted to\n\ncorroborate his testimony should be given \"very little weight,\n\nvirtually none.\"      Gao had not authenticated his documents, and\n\nfraudulent documentation from his region of China was relatively\n\ncommon. Moreover, Gao had failed to establish a foundation for the\n\ndocuments and, in particular, had not established that medical\n\nreports documenting a sterilization were related to his wife.\n\n            The IJ then found Gao not credible. She found that Gao's\n\ntestimony was not consistent with the U.S. State Department's\n\nProfile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for China, which\n\nindicated that officials employed relatively little coercion in\n\nenforcing the one-child policy.             The IJ also found that Gao\n\nappeared to be economically motivated, that a sterilization fifteen\n\nyears prior was an unlikely impetus for Gao's departure in 2000,\n\nand that Gao had testified inconsistently about his motivations for\n\nleaving China.\n\n            As to Gao's claim of religious persecution, the IJ found\n\nthat stern lectures did not amount to past persecution, and that\n\nGao   had   failed   to   establish    a    well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution, particularly since it appeared that he could live in\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJiangsu Province, where he apparently had lived for several years\n\nwith no problems.\n\n            On October 10, 2002, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision.     On January 3, 2003, Gao filed a motion to reopen the\n\nproceedings, on the basis of seven new documents, including one\n\nthat purported to be a notice dated September 2002 from the\n\nVillagers Committee in Gao's native village ordering Gao to present\n\nhimself or be subject to severe punishment for his religious\n\nactivities.     On April 30, 2003, the BIA granted the motion to\n\nreopen, finding that although most of the documents could have been\n\npresented at the original hearing, the September 2002 Villagers\n\nCommittee notice was evidence \"central to his claim\" that was\n\nunavailable at the time of the November 2001 hearing.\n\n            On November 13, 2003, the same IJ heard additional\n\ntestimony related to the Villagers Committee notice and Gao's claim\n\nof religious persecution.   Gao testified that he had led a \"parade\n\nof Virgin Mary\" in a neighboring village, about an hour's walk\n\naway.   Gao initially testified that this parade had taken place on\n\nAugust 15, 1998, but he later corrected himself and stated that the\n\nparade had been on August 15, 1985.    Gao also testified that local\n\nofficials arrested him and warned him not to practice Catholicism.\n\nHe initially indicated that this arrest had occurred on May 21,\n\n1995, but he later stated that it had been on May 21, 1998.     Gao\n\nalso testified that a local priest had been jailed for three or\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffour years, and that because Gao was a \"Roman Catholic Church\n\ncoordinator\" in his village, he expected that local officials would\n\n\"come after\" him also.\n\n            On March 15, 2004, the IJ issued another decision finding\n\nGao not credible and denying the relief sought.              The IJ noted in\n\nparticular the inconsistencies in Gao's testimony about the dates\n\nof   crucial   events.     The   IJ    also   expressed    doubts   about    the\n\nauthenticity of the September 2002 notice, inasmuch as it had not\n\nbeen authenticated, it gave a date for the religious parade that\n\ndid not agree with Gao's later testimony, and Gao had never\n\nexplained why local village officials would suddenly be concerned\n\nabout a parade that had taken place years ago in a village an\n\nhour's walk away.\n\n            The IJ found that the various warnings, interrogations,\n\nand brief detentions described by Gao, even if true, did not amount\n\nto   past   persecution.     The      IJ   also   found   that   Gao   had   not\n\nestablished a well-founded fear of future persecution because\n\n(1) such claims were belied by his wife's continuing to practice\n\nCatholicism in their village without incident; (2) the September\n\n2002 notice was not credible; (3) any imprisonment of the local\n\npriest did not reflect the potential treatment of individual\n\nparishioners; and (4) Gao and his family could reasonably relocate\n\nto an area such as Jiangsu Province, where they had experienced no\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\freligious problems.         On August 17, 2005, the BIA again summarily\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision.\n\n                                          II.\n\n              Gao makes several claims on appeal.            First, Gao claims\n\nthat the BIA violated his due process rights in summarily affirming\n\nthe IJ's March 2004 decision, when that decision did not explicitly\n\naddress Gao's forced sterilization claim.            Second, Gao claims that\n\nthe IJ erred in finding him not credible on both his forced\n\nsterilization and religious persecution claims.               Third, Gao claims\n\nthat the IJ erred in finding that the events he described did not\n\namount   to    past    religious    persecution      and    that     Gao   had   not\n\nestablished a well-founded fear of religious persecution.                         We\n\nconsider      only    the   first   two    claims;   because       we   find     that\n\nsubstantial      evidence     supports      the   IJ's     adverse      credibility\n\ndeterminations, we do not reach Gao's other challenges to the IJ's\n\nfindings.\n\n              First, as to the due process point, Gao failed to argue\n\nbefore the BIA that there was anything improper in the IJ's not\n\nexplicitly addressing the forced sterilization claim in the March\n\n2004 decision.        As a result, under the doctrine of exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to consider this\n\nclaim.     Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nIn his brief to this court, Gao points to three sentences in his\n\nbrief to the BIA that refer to his forced sterilization claim.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fWhile these sentences may have sufficed to preserve the claim on\n\nthe merits, nowhere in these sentences or elsewhere did Gao make\n\nhis procedural point.      Gao's due process claim is one of \"mere\n\n'procedural    error[],'    which   the   BIA   plainly   [could   have]\n\naddress[ed],\" Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 762 (1st Cir. 1992),\n\nand hence Gao cannot raise it for the first time here.1\n\n          We thus proceed to consider Gao's claims on the merits.\n\nTo be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that he is a\n\n\"refugee.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).   To do so, an alien must show\n\n\"persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"       Id. § 1101(a)(42)(A).   One who has\n\nbeen \"forced . . . to undergo involuntary sterilization . . . shall\n\nbe deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.\"\n\nId. § 1101(a)(42)(B).      The BIA interprets this provision to also\n\napply to the spouses of those involuntarily sterilized. See Tai v.\n\nGonzales, 423 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).          The alien bears the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       In any event, this claim lacks merit. Gao had a full and\nfair opportunity to present evidence on the forced sterilization\nclaim at his first hearing, and it is clear from the record that\nthe IJ intended to rely on her decision on that claim from the\ninitial hearing. It was entirely reasonable for the IJ to do so,\ngiven that the document that formed the basis for the reopening of\nthe proceedings related only to the religious persecution claim.\nGao was not in any way deprived of \"a meaningful opportunity to be\nheard\" on his forced sterilization claim. See Choeum v. INS, 129\nF.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                    -8-\n\fburden of proof for establishing his eligibility for asylum.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).\n\n            We review the BIA's factual determinations, including\n\ncredibility       determinations,           under   the   deferential   substantial\n\nevidence standard.           Dhima v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      Such determinations must stand \"unless any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also Dhima, 416 F.3d at 95.                          Where\n\nthe BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ, we review the\n\nIJ's decision as if it were that of the BIA.                 Albathani v. INS, 318\n\nF.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Substantial evidence supports the IJ's determination that\n\nGao did not testify credibly that his wife was involuntarily\n\nsterilized, and that Gao therefore failed to establish persecution\n\non that basis.         To begin with, the IJ found that Gao's documentary\n\nevidence failed even to establish that his wife had in fact been\n\nsterilized, in that there was nothing to show that the medical\n\nreports Gao submitted were related to his wife.                  Moreover, none of\n\nthe   documents        Gao   submitted       were    authenticated.         Given    the\n\ngovernment       reports     about    widespread      fabrication     and    fraud   in\n\ndocuments originating from Gao's region of China, it was reasonable\n\nfor   the   IJ    to    require      some    form   of    authentication     for    such\n\ndocuments before finding that they corroborated his testimony. See\n\nLin v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f               The IJ noted that Gao's testimony was inconsistent with\n\nthe U.S. State Department report, which \"did not find any cases of\n\nphysical force actually employed in connection with abortion or\n\nsterilization\" in Fujian Province.              But the IJ did not rely on the\n\nState       Department   report   alone.        The   IJ   also   found   that   Gao\n\ntestified inconsistently about his reasons for departing China.\n\nGao   primarily      testified    that     he    left      because   of   religious\n\npersecution, but he also testified: \"[M]y financials become [sic]\n\nvery poor, and so all my child[ren] drop out of school[,] so I\n\n[was] really mad about the government[,] so I tell my wife, I say\n\nI better find some other way to leave the country.\"                         The IJ\n\nreasonably found that Gao appeared to have been economically\n\nmotivated to come to the United States, and that this weighed\n\nagainst his credibility.2          Furthermore, any suggestion on Gao's\n\npart that he was motivated by his wife's forced sterilization was\n\nbelied by the fact that this had supposedly happened fifteen years\n\nbefore he departed China.         Thus, substantial evidence supports the\n\n\n\n\n        2\n       In affirming the IJ's decision, we do not rely on any\nreasoning that mere debt to snakeheads establishes that an alien is\nprimarily motivated by his financial situation and thus is not\ncredible in his testimony about grounds for asylum. Poor aliens\nshould not be deemed not credible simply because they pay large\nsums to enter the United States.     While the IJ mentioned Gao's\ndebt, the remaining evidence cited by the IJ provides far stronger,\ndirect support for her conclusion that Gao came to the United\nStates not because of any purported persecution, but because of his\nfinancial situation. See Ziu v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 202, 205 (1st\nCir. 2005).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fIJ's adverse credibility determination and her determination that\n\nGao failed to establish that his wife was involuntarily sterilized.\n\n          Substantial evidence also supports the IJ's finding that\n\nGao did not testify credibly about religious persecution.   The IJ\n\nprimarily relied upon the inconsistencies in Gao's testimony,\n\nparticularly as to the dates of key events.       Gao provides no\n\nexplanation for these inconsistencies, but merely tries to label\n\nthem \"minor\" and \"incidental.\" It was not a \"minor\" inconsistency,\n\nhowever, for Gao to testify first that he led a religious parade on\n\nAugust 15, 1998, and then to state that the parade actually had\n\ntaken place thirteen years earlier, on August 15, 1985. Similarly,\n\nGao first testified that he was interrogated on May 21, 1995, but\n\nhe then switched the date to May 21, 1998.   In both cases, he gave\n\neach version of the testimony at least twice, so the discrepancies\n\ncannot be attributed to inadvertent slips. Moreover, the date that\n\nGao settled on for the parade, 1985, did not agree with the date on\n\nthe Villagers Committee notice that Gao relied on to establish a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.     We have no trouble finding\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the IJ's refusal to believe Gao's\n\ntestimony on religious persecution.\n\n          Because we find that substantial evidence supports the\n\nIJ's finding that Gao was not credible and that he therefore failed\n\nto establish any evidence of persecution, we need not reach Gao's\n\nother challenges to the IJ's findings.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                    -12-\n\f",

He further testified that\n\nafter his arrest, his mother contacted his wife to suggest that she\n\nsubmit to sterilization in order to secure his release, which she\n\ndid.\n\n           Gao also testified to incidents when local officials\n\npurportedly harassed him for adhering to the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nHe claimed that he was first contacted about this in 1997, and that\n\nin 1998, officials threatened him with imprisonment if he continued\n\nto   practice   Catholicism.   Gao   also   testified   that   officials\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdestroyed first the cross, then the entire church, that he had\n\ncontributed to building.\n\n            Following this testimony, the IJ issued an oral decision\n\ndenying Gao asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe CAT.    The IJ first found that the documents Gao submitted to\n\ncorroborate his testimony should be given \"very little weight,\n\nvirtually none.\"      Gao had not authenticated his documents, and\n\nfraudulent documentation from his region of China was relatively\n\ncommon. Moreover, Gao had failed to establish a foundation for the\n\ndocuments and, in particular, had not established that medical\n\nreports documenting a sterilization were related to his wife.\n\n            The IJ then found Gao not credible. She found that Gao's\n\ntestimony was not consistent with the U.S. State Department's\n\nProfile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for China, which\n\nindicated that officials employed relatively little coercion in\n\nenforcing the one-child policy.             The IJ also found that Gao\n\nappeared to be economically motivated, that a sterilization fifteen\n\nyears prior was an unlikely impetus for Gao's departure in 2000,\n\nand that Gao had testified inconsistently about his motivations for\n\nleaving China.\n\n            As to Gao's claim of religious persecution, the IJ found\n\nthat stern lectures did not amount to past persecution, and that\n\nGao   had   failed   to   establish    a    well-founded   fear   of   future\n\npersecution, particularly since it appeared that he could live in\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJiangsu Province, where he apparently had lived for several years\n\nwith no problems.\n\n            On October 10, 2002, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision.     On January 3, 2003, Gao filed a motion to reopen the\n\nproceedings, on the basis of seven new documents, including one\n\nthat purported to be a notice dated September 2002 from the\n\nVillagers Committee in Gao's native village ordering Gao to present\n\nhimself or be subject to severe punishment for his religious\n\nactivities.     On April 30, 2003, the BIA granted the motion to\n\nreopen, finding that although most of the documents could have been\n\npresented at the original hearing, the September 2002 Villagers\n\nCommittee notice was evidence \"central to his claim\" that was\n\nunavailable at the time of the November 2001 hearing.\n\n            On November 13, 2003, the same IJ heard additional\n\ntestimony related to the Villagers Committee notice and Gao's claim\n\nof religious persecution.   Gao testified that he had led a \"parade\n\nof Virgin Mary\" in a neighboring village, about an hour's walk\n\naway.   Gao initially testified that this parade had taken place on\n\nAugust 15, 1998, but he later corrected himself and stated that the\n\nparade had been on August 15, 1985.    Gao also testified that local\n\nofficials arrested him and warned him not to practice Catholicism.\n\nHe initially indicated that this arrest had occurred on May 21,\n\n1995, but he later stated that it had been on May 21, 1998.     Gao\n\nalso testified that a local priest had been jailed for three or\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffour years, and that because Gao was a \"Roman Catholic Church\n\ncoordinator\" in his village, he expected that local officials would\n\n\"come after\" him also.\n\n            On March 15, 2004, the IJ issued another decision finding\n\nGao not credible and denying the relief sought.              The IJ noted in\n\nparticular the inconsistencies in Gao's testimony about the dates\n\nof   crucial   events.     The   IJ    also   expressed    doubts   about    the\n\nauthenticity of the September 2002 notice, inasmuch as it had not\n\nbeen authenticated, it gave a date for the religious parade that\n\ndid not agree with Gao's later testimony, and Gao had never\n\nexplained why local village officials would suddenly be concerned\n\nabout a parade that had taken place years ago in a village an\n\nhour's walk away.\n\n            The IJ found that the various warnings, interrogations,\n\nand brief detentions described by Gao, even if true, did not amount\n\nto   past   persecution.     The      IJ   also   found   that   Gao   had   not\n\nestablished a well-founded fear of future persecution because\n\n(1) such claims were belied by his wife's continuing to practice\n\nCatholicism in their village without incident; (2) the September\n\n2002 notice was not credible; (3) any imprisonment of the local\n\npriest did not reflect the potential treatment of individual\n\nparishioners; and (4) Gao and his family could reasonably relocate\n\nto an area such as Jiangsu Province, where they had experienced no\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\freligious problems.         On August 17, 2005, the BIA again summarily\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision.\n\n                                          II.\n\n              Gao makes several claims on appeal.            First, Gao claims\n\nthat the BIA violated his due process rights in summarily affirming\n\nthe IJ's March 2004 decision, when that decision did not explicitly\n\naddress Gao's forced sterilization claim.            Second, Gao claims that\n\nthe IJ erred in finding him not credible on both his forced\n\nsterilization and religious persecution claims.               Third, Gao claims\n\nthat the IJ erred in finding that the events he described did not\n\namount   to    past    religious    persecution      and    that     Gao   had   not\n\nestablished a well-founded fear of religious persecution.                         We\n\nconsider      only    the   first   two    claims;   because       we   find     that\n\nsubstantial      evidence     supports      the   IJ's     adverse      credibility\n\ndeterminations, we do not reach Gao's other challenges to the IJ's\n\nfindings.\n\n              First, as to the due process point, Gao failed to argue\n\nbefore the BIA that there was anything improper in the IJ's not\n\nexplicitly addressing the forced sterilization claim in the March\n\n2004 decision.        As a result, under the doctrine of exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to consider this\n\nclaim.     Olujoke v.

It was entirely reasonable for the IJ to do so,\ngiven that the document that formed the basis for the reopening of\nthe proceedings related only to the religious persecution claim.\nGao was not in any way deprived of \"a meaningful opportunity to be\nheard\" on his forced sterilization claim.

Where\n\nthe BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ, we review the\n\nIJ's decision as if it were that of the BIA.                 Albathani v.

To begin with, the IJ found that Gao's documentary\n\nevidence failed even to establish that his wife had in fact been\n\nsterilized, in that there was nothing to show that the medical\n\nreports Gao submitted were related to his wife.                  Moreover, none of\n\nthe   documents        Gao   submitted       were    authenticated.         Given    the\n\ngovernment       reports     about    widespread      fabrication     and    fraud   in\n\ndocuments originating from Gao's region of China, it was reasonable\n\nfor   the   IJ    to    require      some    form   of    authentication     for    such\n\ndocuments before finding that they corroborated his testimony. See\n\nLin v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201056\"><a href=\"/opinion/201056/lin-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f               The IJ noted that Gao's testimony was inconsistent with\n\nthe U.S. State Department report, which \"did not find any cases of\n\nphysical force actually employed in connection with abortion or\n\nsterilization\" in Fujian Province.              But the IJ did not rely on the\n\nState       Department   report   alone.        The   IJ   also   found   that   Gao\n\ntestified inconsistently about his reasons for departing China.\n\nGao   primarily      testified    that     he    left      because   of   religious\n\npersecution, but he also testified: \"[M]y financials become [sic]\n\nvery poor, and so all my child[ren] drop out of school[,] so I\n\n[was] really mad about the government[,] so I tell my wife, I say\n\nI better find some other way to leave the country.\"                         The IJ\n\nreasonably found that Gao appeared to have been economically\n\nmotivated to come to the United States, and that this weighed\n\nagainst his credibility.2          Furthermore, any suggestion on Gao's\n\npart that he was motivated by his wife's forced sterilization was\n\nbelied by the fact that this had supposedly happened fifteen years\n\nbefore he departed China.         Thus, substantial evidence supports the\n\n\n\n\n        2\n       In affirming the IJ's decision, we do not rely on any\nreasoning that mere debt to snakeheads establishes that an alien is\nprimarily motivated by his financial situation and thus is not\ncredible in his testimony about grounds for asylum. Poor aliens\nshould not be deemed not credible simply because they pay large\nsums to enter the United States.     While the IJ mentioned Gao's\ndebt, the remaining evidence cited by the IJ provides far stronger,\ndirect support for her conclusion that Gao came to the United\nStates not because of any purported persecution, but because of his\nfinancial situation. See Ziu v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201619\"><a href=\"/opinion/201619/ziu-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205 (1st\nCir. 2005).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fIJ's adverse credibility determination and her determination that\n\nGao failed to establish that his wife was involuntarily sterilized.\n\n          Substantial evidence also supports the IJ's finding that\n\nGao did not testify credibly about religious persecution.   The IJ\n\nprimarily relied upon the inconsistencies in Gao's testimony,\n\nparticularly as to the dates of key events.       Gao provides no\n\nexplanation for these inconsistencies, but merely tries to label\n\nthem \"minor\" and \"incidental.\" It was not a \"minor\" inconsistency,\n\nhowever, for Gao to testify first that he led a religious parade on\n\nAugust 15, 1998, and then to state that the parade actually had\n\ntaken place thirteen years earlier, on August 15, 1985. Similarly,\n\nGao first testified that he was interrogated on May 21, 1995, but\n\nhe then switched the date to May 21, 1998.   In both cases, he gave\n\neach version of the testimony at least twice, so the discrepancies\n\ncannot be attributed to inadvertent slips. Moreover, the date that\n\nGao settled on for the parade, 1985, did not agree with the date on\n\nthe Villagers Committee notice that Gao relied on to establish a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution.     We have no trouble finding\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the IJ's refusal to believe Gao's\n\ntestimony on religious persecution.\n\n          Because we find that substantial evidence supports the\n\nIJ's finding that Gao was not credible and that he therefore failed\n\nto establish any evidence of persecution, we need not reach Gao's\n\nother challenges to the IJ's findings.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fThe petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                    -12-\n\f</pre>",
