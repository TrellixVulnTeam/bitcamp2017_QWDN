The Appellant, Perez Y\n\nCia. De Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Perez\") appeals from the district\n\ncourt's    order      granting    Robert    Fyffe's       unopposed   motion   for\n\n$206,687.15 in custodia legis expenses that he incurred while\n\nacting as substitute custodian to the M/V RIO NEVERI.1                  Concluding\n\nthat Perez's objections to the award of expenses were untimely, we\n\naffirm.\n\nI.           BACKGROUND\n\n             The events leading up to this action begin with the\n\narrest by creditors of the M/V RIO NEVERI.                      On July 6, 1998,\n\nLubricantes Venoco Internacional, C.A. (\"Venoco\") filed a Verified\n\nComplaint in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico initiating an in rem action against the M/V RIO NEVERI\n\nand   an   in   personam       proceeding       against   its   owners,   Lima-Sol\n\nShipowners      and   Shipco     Marine   Management.        Venoco's     complaint\n\nalleged that the defendants owed it $50,000 for goods provided and\n\nservices rendered and sought the seizure and arrest of the RIO\n\nNEVERIS to enforce its maritime lien.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Perez's notice of appeal states that Perez is appealing from\nthe district court's March 30 order awarding Fyffe $14,369.42 and\nfrom the district court's December 6 order awarding Fyffe\n$206,687.15 in custodia legis expenses. However, in its appellate\nbrief, Perez makes no mention of, or argument regarding, the March\n30 order. As a result, we consider the issue waived. Pratt v.\nUnited States, 129 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 1997)(\"It is firmly\nsettled in this circuit that arguments not advanced and developed\nin an appellant's brief are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                          -2-\n\f            Shortly after filing the complaint, Venoco moved for\n\nappointment of a substitute custodian.    Venoco requested the court\n\nto name Robert Fyffe as substitute custodian in lieu of the U.S.\n\nMarshals.    The court granted the motion.   As substitute custodian\n\nFyffe was responsible for the supervision and safekeeping of the\n\nvessel. Venoco, as arresting party, assumed responsibility for the\n\nexpenses Fyffe incurred while acting as substitute custodian.     As\n\nmandated by law, Venoco also deposited $10,000 with the U.S.\n\nMarshals to cover the required insurance premiums.     See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1921(a)(1)(E) (1994 & Supp. VI).2\n\n            On July 30, 1998, Perez intervened in the action claiming\n\na maritime lien for ship repair and services totaling $250,000.3\n\nAfter conferring with Venoco, Perez agreed to divide the substitute\n\ncustodian expenses proportionally according to each party's claim.\n\nBecause Perez's claim was larger, Perez agreed to pay 80 percent of\n\nFyffe's expenses.\n\n            On August 28, 1998, the U.S. Marshals seized the RIO\n\nNEVERI and placed the vessel in Fyffe's custody.   Less than a month\n\nlater, on September 21, 1998, during Hurricane George, the RIO\n\n\n\n     2\n      28 U.S.C. § 1921(a)(1)(E) provides that the United States\nmarshal shall routinely collect, and a court may tax as costs, fees\nfor the keeping of seized property including the costs of\ninsurance.\n     3\n      A host of other parties intervened as well, including the RIO\nNEVERI's crew, the ship's agent and the Puerto Rico Port Authority.\nTheir claims are not relevant to the current dispute.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fNEVERI broke loose from her moorings and grounded in the mud in San\n\nJuan Harbor. The parties scuffled over who was responsible for the\n\nexpenses related to refloating the vessel.                   Neither Perez nor\n\nVenoco was willing to front the money for the refloating and Fyffe\n\nwas unable to obtain funds from any other source.               Perez and Venoco\n\nalso stopped paying Fyffe's expenses, believing his negligence had\n\nallowed the RIO NEVERI to run aground.\n\n                 On December 10, 1998, the United States, upon its own\n\nmotion, was authorized to refloat and secure the vessel.                         For\n\nreasons not clear on the record, however, the United States took no\n\naction to refloat the vessel and the RIO NEVERI remained grounded\n\nuntil Fyffe obtained a court order to begin salvage operations in\n\nJuly 1999.          It is undisputed that the parties agreed that the\n\n$130,000 fee payable to the salvor, Dimitrious Kalogerakis, would\n\nbe   paid    from    the   proceeds   of   the   sale   of   the   vessel   as    an\n\n\"administrative cost.\"         Kalogerakis successfully salvaged the RIO\n\nNEVERI and returned the vessel to its mooring.\n\n                 The RIO NEVERI's grounding resulted in the bringing of\n\ntwo separate court actions in the District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico, Frontier Insurance Company v. Lubricantes Venoco\n\nInternacional, C.A., et. al., Civ. No. 99-1292 and Perez Y Cia. de\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc. v. Fyffe, Civ. No. 99-2055.                In both actions the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the grounding of the RIO NEVERI was a\n\nresult      of    negligence   and    claimed    damages     arising   from      the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fnegligence.     In October 1999, Perez moved to consolidate the two\n\nactions with the in rem action against the RIO NEVERI.                   Judge\n\nFuste, the judge presiding over the in rem action, denied the\n\nmotion to consolidate.      Perez did not appeal from the denial.\n\n             Because the owners of the RIO NEVERI had not stepped\n\nforward to     claim the vessel and pay the lienors, the court ordered\n\nthe vessel's sale.      While at the time of its arrest the RIO NEVERI\n\nhad been appraised for $1,600,000, her value had significantly\n\ndepreciated because of the considerable damage she had sustained\n\nfrom the grounding.        The sale of the RIO NEVERI netted only\n\n$163,000.4     On March 15, 2000, the court approved the sale and\n\nordered that each of the parties interested in the sale proceeds\n\n\"shall file a separate motion containing an invoice in the form of\n\na verified claim for payment as custodia legis expenses\" within\n\nthirty days from the date of the order.        Almost immediately, Perez\n\nand   Venoco    filed   separate   motions   requesting    custodia      legis\n\nexpenses of $84,836.66 and $20,481.28 respectively.           Prior to the\n\nconfirmation of the sale, Fyffe had submitted to the court a motion\n\nrequesting $60,478.12 from the proceeds of the sale to cover the\n\nadditional     expenses   he   allegedly     incurred     related   to     the\n\nreflotation of the vessel.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      The actual sale price of the vessel was $148,000. However,\nthis was augmented by a $15,000 deposit forfeited by an earlier,\ndefaulting bidder.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          On March 30, 2000, the court issued a \"final order\"\n\ndistributing the sale proceeds.       As previously agreed to by the\n\nparties, Kalogerakis, the salvage operator who refloated the RIO\n\nNEVERI, received $130,000.   The U.S. Marshal received $10,630.58\n\nfor insurance coverage that it was required by statute to maintain\n\nbut that Venoco and Perez had failed to pay.    A.L. Burbank received\n\n$8,000 for the incidental advertising expenses related to the sale\n\nof the vessel. Fyffe received the remaining $14,369.42. The court\n\nfurther ordered:\n\n          The balance of the custodial expenses incurred\n          by Robert Fyffe will be paid by the plaintiff\n          and the intervening plaintiffs in any amount\n          to be agreed by the parties or further\n          disposed of by the court after April 14, 2000.\n\n          It is further ORDERED that this case is\n          closed, subject to any further adjustment on\n          claims needing court intervention after April\n          14, 2000, and without prejudice of a hearing\n          to resolve any arising dispute.\n\n\n          In response to the order of distribution, Perez, joined\n\nby Venoco, filed a motion for reconsideration \"of such part of the\n\nfinal order or distribution of sale proceeds awarding Robert Fyffe\n\n$14,369.42 of the sales proceeds.\" The motion was denied. Neither\n\nPerez nor Venoco opposed the portion of the order that required\n\nFyffe's remaining expenses to be paid by Venoco, Perez, and the\n\nother intervening plaintiffs.\n\n          On April 14, 2000, within the 30 day period specified in\n\nthe March 15, 2000 order, Fyffe submitted a verified claim for\n\n                                -6-\n\fadditional custodia legis expenses in the amount of $206,687.15.\n\nFyffe    requested   that   the   court   declare     the     plaintiff   and\n\nintervening plaintiffs \"jointly liable to Fyffe for his fees and\n\nexpenses\" and \"severally liable to each other for contribution in\n\nproportion for [sic] their respective claims.\"              In response, the\n\nUnited States filed a motion supporting Fyffe's claim for custodia\n\nlegis expenses.      The government submitted that the plaintiff and\n\nintervening plaintiffs \"are jointly and severally liable to Fyffe\n\n. . . for Fyffe's custodia legis expenses . . . .\"               Fyffe also\n\nfiled a motion requesting an extension of time to oppose Perez's\n\nand Venoco's requests for custodia legis expenses.             Neither Perez\n\nnor Venoco filed an opposition to Fyffe's request nor did either\n\nparty request an evidentiary hearing.\n\n           On December 6, 2000, after nearly eight months had\n\nelapsed since Fyffe's additional claim was filed, the court granted\n\nFyffe's unopposed request for expenses.5      Within days, Perez moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the court's December 6 order. Fyffe replied\n\nto the motion claiming, inter alia, that Perez had waived its right\n\nto contest the appropriateness of the expenses or the calculation\n\nby failing to oppose his April 14 motion.           On April 3, 2001, the\n\n\n\n     5\n      The disposition of this claim appears to have resolved the\nremaining outstanding claims in the case, leaving the December 6\norder as final and appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\nAccording to the docket, as of December 6, 2000, all the parties\nclaims had been addressed and orders entered disposing of remaining\nmatters. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcourt denied Perez's motion.         This appeal timely followed.           See\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(B)(i).\n\nII.             DISCUSSION\n\n                The central issue is whether, after allowing Fyffe's\n\nclaim     for    additional   expenses   to   which   Perez   had   filed   no\n\nopposition, the district court abused its discretion in denying\n\nPerez's motion for reconsideration.6            Fyffe insists that Perez\n\nwaived its arguments objecting to the district court's award of\n\nexpenses when it failed to timely oppose Fyffe's request and that\n\nthe district court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to\n\nreconsider the matter.\n\n                Generally, claims not timely made during the pendency of\n\na case, and raised for the first time thereafter in a motion for\n\nreconsideration, are deemed waived on appeal.            DiMarcoi-Zappa v.\n\nCabanillas, 238 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"To the extent that\n\nappellants' reconsideration motion sought to raise an argument\n\n\n\n      6\n      We assume Perez's motion for reconsideration was brought\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) as a motion to alter or amend the\njudgment. See Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 n.3 (1st Cir.\n1997)(stating \"regardless of how it is characterized, a post-\njudgment motion made within ten days of the entry of judgment that\nquestions the correctness of a judgment is properly construed as a\nmotion to alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\").\nRule 59(e) does not provide a vehicle for a party to present\narguments that \"could and should have been presented to the\ndistrict court prior to the judgment.\" Id. at 16. Perez does not\nappeal from the district court's denial of its motion for\nreconsideration but from the district court's December 6, 2000,\norder granting Fyffe's motion for custodia legis expenses. See also\nn.1, supra.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwaived at the trial stage, it must necessarily fail.\"); CMM Cable\n\nRep, Inc. v. Ocean Front Props., Inc., 97 F.3d 1504, 1526 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (finding no merit in appellant's argument that its arguments\n\nwere   preserved   because    they    were     advanced   in    a   motion    for\n\nreconsideration).       As we have explained before, appealing parties\n\ncannot claim error based on matters which the district court and\n\nthe other parties did not have timely chance to consider.               See CMM\n\nCable, 97 F.3d at 1526 (citing McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950\n\nF.2d 13, 22 & n.7 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n           Perez's arguments were not timely raised during the\n\nproceedings    below.      Since    1966,    the   Federal     Rules   of   Civil\n\nProcedure have applied to actions in Admiralty.              See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 1; Rule A, Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime\n\nClaims.   While the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set forth the\n\nrules for calculating specified time limits, it is the local rules\n\nof the district courts that establish the time frames within which\n\nparties must respond to motions.            See Viqueira v. First Bank, 140\n\nF.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).        Under the local rules of the District\n\nof Puerto Rico, Perez had ten days after service of the motion\n\nwithin which to file an opposition to Fyffe's motion requesting\n\nadditional custodia legis expenses. D.P.R. Loc. R. 311.5; see also\n\nViqueira, 140 F.3d at 16.          It did not do so.      The local rule is\n\nunambiguous.    See United States v. Fray, 145 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    Throughout the in rem proceeding, the parties adhered to\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthis ten-day rule or, in appropriate circumstances, requested an\n\nextension of time for filing responses.             Perez did neither here.\n\nIn any event, Perez concedes that the objections first made in its\n\nmotion for reconsideration, filed after the court had allowed\n\nFyffe's additional claim and filed many months after Fyffe had\n\nfiled that claim, were well out of time.\n\n            Perez further concedes that matters presented for the\n\nfirst time in a motion for reconsideration are not timely raised\n\nnor are they ordinarily deemed to be preserved for appellate\n\nreview.     However, Perez contends that we should entertain his\n\nobjections because the district court exercised its discretion to\n\nreview them, thus impliedly excusing their untimeliness.7                  See\n\nQuest    Med.,   Inc.   v.   Apprill,   90   F.3d   1080,   1087   (5th   Cir.\n\n1996)(stating that if a district court exercises its discretion to\n\nconsider issues raised for the first time in a post-trial brief\n\nthen the issues may be considered to have been properly raised\n\nbelow).\n\n            Whatever can be said for Perez's theory, it is of no help\n\nto Perez here.     The record in no way supports Perez's suggestion\n\nthat, after Perez moved for reconsideration, the district court\n\n\n     7\n      We note that Perez presents this argument only in its Reply\nBrief. Normally, arguments raised for the first time in a reply\nbrief come too late to meet the requirement that appellate\narguments must be briefed. Frazier v. Bailey, 957 F.2d 920, 932 n.\n14 (1st Cir. 1992). While we reject Perez's argument as lacking in\nmerit, Perez's failure to have included it in its main brief may\nconstitute a separate ground for rejection.\n\n                                    -10-\n\factually considered the motion on its merits.          The district court,\n\nwithout     comment,     summarily      denied    Perez's      motion      for\n\nreconsideration.       Perez   argues   that   \"[i]t   is   clear   that   the\n\nDistrict Court accepted Perez's excuses[] because it took almost\n\nthree (3) months       for the District Court to finally deny Perez's\n\nmotion for reconsideration.\"       We see no reason why the passage of\n\nthree months between the submission of the reconsideration motion\n\nand the district court's ruling thereon should be taken to indicate\n\nthe court's consideration of the merits of the motion.                     Most\n\nlikely, the court was simply busy with other matters.\n\n           As a further reason for us to find the district court had\n\ndecided the reconsideration motion on the merits, Perez points out\n\nthat the court allowed it to reply to Fyffe's opposition to the\n\nmotion. But again there is no reason why this isolated fact should\n\nbe taken to indicate that the court decided to excuse Perez's\n\nuntimeliness and delve into the merits of Perez's objections to\n\nFyffe's claim.   Fyffe asserted in his opposition to Perez's motion\n\nfor reconsideration that Perez's arguments were untimely and had,\n\ntherefore, been waived.        By permitting a reply the district court\n\nsuggested no more than that it sought to be fair and allow Perez to\n\ncounter Fyffe's waiver argument or tender whatever other excuse it\n\ncould.    There is nothing to show that the district court actually\n\nreached the merits of Perez's objections to Fyffe's expense claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           In extraordinary circumstances, courts have recognized an\n\nexception to the raise-or-waive rule.       DiMarcoi-Zappa, 238 F.3d at\n\n34.   Exceptions have been allowed where a waived argument is \"'so\n\ncompelling as virtually to insure appellant's success,'\" and a\n\n\"'gross miscarriage of justice'\" would result from our failure to\n\naddress it.     Am. Auto. Mfr. Ass'n v. Comm'r, Mass. Dep't Envtl.\n\nProt., 31 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Johnston v. Holiday\n\nInns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1979)); see also Grenier v.\n\nCyanamid Plastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667, 678 (1st Cir. 1996). Perez's\n\nsituation does not fit within this unusual and narrow category of\n\nexceptions.     See Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1196\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he exceptions are few and far between, and\n\nappellate discretion should not be affirmatively exercised unless\n\nerror is plain and the equities heavily preponderate in favor of\n\ncorrecting it.\"); Ondine Shipping Corp. v. Cataldo, 24 F.3d 353,\n\n356 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"this is a long-odds exception that must be\n\napplied sparingly\").\n\n           The arguments Perez now presents against the court's\n\nallowance of Fyffe's expenses are far from being so compelling as\n\nto virtually insure their success.          Perez contends that it was\n\nwrong for the district court to award custodia legis expenses\n\nwithout first holding an evidentiary hearing.          In Perez's view, a\n\nhearing   was   required   since   Perez   \"attacked   the   veracity   and\n\nreasonableness of Fyffe's claims.\"         But before issuing its order\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthe district court had no way to know that Perez attacked the\n\nveracity and reasonableness of the claims since Perez had not filed\n\nan opposition to them.   There is no pro forma requirement that, in\n\neach and every case, a district court hold an evidentiary hearing\n\nprior to awarding custodia legis expenses.8   Taino Lines, Inc. v.\n\nM/V Constance Pan Atl., 982 F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1992).   The local\n\nrules of the district court make clear that an unopposed motion\n\nwill be considered and decided without a hearing, unless otherwise\n\ndirected by the court.    D.P.R. Loc. R. 311.9.   It was not plain\n\nerror for the court to rule without a hearing in the circumstances\n\nas they appeared at the time.   Id.\n\n          Perez also contends that the district court was without\n\nauthority in the in rem proceeding to award custodia legis expenses\n\nin excess of the sale proceeds. Perez proffers Forscht Associates,\n\nInc. v. Transamerican ICS, Inc., 821 F.2d 1556 (11th Cir. 1987),\n\nfor the proposition that once the proceeds of the sale of the RIO\n\nNEVERI were exhausted, \"the unpaid custodia legis fees must become\n\nthe object of a separate action for breach of contract lodged by\n\nthe substitute custodian.\"   But Forscht does not stand for such a\n\nproposition.   To the contrary, the Forscht court concluded that a\n\nsubstitute custodian could seek payment through the in rem action\n\n\n\n     8\n      Contrary to Perez's argument, the local admiralty rules for\nthe District of Puerto Rico do not mandate that a district court\nhold a hearing prior to awarding expenses. LAR(e)(12)(d) provides\nonly that a district court \"may\" schedule a hearing.\n\n                                -13-\n\for through an action for breach of contract.   Id. at 1562; see also\n\nCertain Underwriters at Lloyds v. Kenco Marine Terminal, 81 F.3d\n\n871, 872 (9th Cir. 1995) (ordering parties to split custodia legis\n\nexpenses in excess of sale proceeds as part of in rem proceeding).\n\n            Perez's remaining arguments attack the correctness of the\n\nunderlying award of expenses and the district court's refusal to\n\ntransfer Fyffe's claim for expenses to the collateral litigation.\n\nAs already discussed, the district court was entitled to resolve\n\nthe matter of custodia legis expenses in the in rem proceeding.   As\n\nto Perez's claims that the district court erred when it awarded\n\nFyffe $206,687.15 in custodia legis expenses and Perez's companion\n\nrequest for this court to vacate the December 6, 2000 order, we\n\nfind no plain error in the district court's award.       See Town of\n\nNorwood v. New England Power Co., 202 F.3d 408, 417 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)(\"It is normally not error at all, let alone plain error, for\n\na court to ignore a possible claim or defense that a party fails to\n\nproffer or pursue.\").\n\n            For like reasons, we can detect no \"gross miscarriage of\n\njustice.\"   See Am. Auto Mfr. Ass'n, 31 F.3d at 26.   It should have\n\ncome as no surprise to Perez that it was at risk of being held\n\npartially responsible for the remaining custodia legis expenses.\n\nIt is a well-established tenet of admiralty law that the arresting\n\nplaintiff and the intervening plaintiffs share in the costs of\n\nmaintaining the res until resolution of the case.     See Beauregard\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fInc. v. Sword Servs. L.L.C., 107 F.3d 351, 353 (5th Cir. 1997);\n\nKenco, 81 F.3d at 873; Forscht, 821 F.2d at 1561; see also D.P.R.\n\nLAR (e)(11)(b).    Perez agreed to divide the custodian and security\n\nfees with Venoco in its August 4, 1998 motion requesting an\n\ninterlocutory sale of the vessel.            Nor should it have been a\n\nsurprise to Perez that the custodia legis expenses in excess of the\n\nsale   proceeds    were   awarded   by     Judge   Fuste    in    the   in   rem\n\nproceedings.   Judge Fuste indicated that he intended to review and\n\naward expenses in the in rem proceeding when he specifically\n\nrequested   that   the    parties   submit   claims   for    custodia     legis\n\nexpenses in his March 15 order approving the sale of the RIO\n\nNEVERI. Perez and Venoco submitted their own expense requests even\n\nthough it was evident that the proceeds from the sale of the vessel\n\nwould be nearly exhausted by the salvage operator's claim and the\n\nU.S. Marshal's fees.      Nor should it have been a surprise to Perez\n\nwhen the expenses were actually awarded against it.               In his March\n\n30 order, Judge Fuste explicitly stated that the balance of the\n\ncustodial expenses incurred by Fyffe would be paid by Venoco, Perez\n\nand the other intervening plaintiffs either as agreed to by the\n\nparties \"or further disposed of by the court.\"                   Unaccountably,\n\nPerez remained mute, even after Fyffe submitted, on April 14, 2000,\n\nhis verified claim for additional custodia legis expenses.                   Even\n\nafter the United States filed a motion supporting Fyffe's claim for\n\nexpenses, and Fyffe filed motions requesting an extension of time\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fto oppose Perez's and Venoco's claims for custodia legis expenses,\n\nPerez   did   nothing   to   indicate    its   opposition.   In   these\n\ncircumstances, we find no miscarriage of justice such as would\n\nwarrant reopening the judgment of the district court.\n\nIII.      CONCLUSION\n\n          The district court's order granting Fyffe's unopposed\n\nmotion for custodia legis expenses is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f",

(\"Perez\") appeals from the district\n\ncourt's    order      granting    Robert    Fyffe's       unopposed   motion   for\n\n$206,687.15 in custodia legis expenses that he incurred while\n\nacting as substitute custodian to the M/V RIO NEVERI.1                  Concluding\n\nthat Perez's objections to the award of expenses were untimely, we\n\naffirm.\n\nI.           BACKGROUND\n\n             The events leading up to this action begin with the\n\narrest by creditors of the M/V RIO NEVERI.                      On July 6, 1998,\n\nLubricantes Venoco Internacional, C.A. (\"Venoco\") filed a Verified\n\nComplaint in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico initiating an in rem action against the M/V RIO NEVERI\n\nand   an   in   personam       proceeding       against   its   owners,   Lima-Sol\n\nShipowners      and   Shipco     Marine   Management.        Venoco's     complaint\n\nalleged that the defendants owed it $50,000 for goods provided and\n\nservices rendered and sought the seizure and arrest of the RIO\n\nNEVERIS to enforce its maritime lien.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Perez's notice of appeal states that Perez is appealing from\nthe district court's March 30 order awarding Fyffe $14,369.42 and\nfrom the district court's December 6 order awarding Fyffe\n$206,687.15 in custodia legis expenses. However, in its appellate\nbrief, Perez makes no mention of, or argument regarding, the March\n30 order. As a result, we consider the issue waived.

Venoco requested the court\n\nto name Robert Fyffe as substitute custodian in lieu of the U.S.\n\nMarshals.    The court granted the motion.   As substitute custodian\n\nFyffe was responsible for the supervision and safekeeping of the\n\nvessel. Venoco, as arresting party, assumed responsibility for the\n\nexpenses Fyffe incurred while acting as substitute custodian.     As\n\nmandated by law, Venoco also deposited $10,000 with the U.S.\n\nMarshals to cover the required insurance premiums.     See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1921(a)(1)(E) (1994 & Supp. VI).2\n\n            On July 30, 1998, Perez intervened in the action claiming\n\na maritime lien for ship repair and services totaling $250,000.3\n\nAfter conferring with Venoco, Perez agreed to divide the substitute\n\ncustodian expenses proportionally according to each party's claim.\n\nBecause Perez's claim was larger, Perez agreed to pay 80 percent of\n\nFyffe's expenses.\n\n            On August 28, 1998, the U.S. Marshals seized the RIO\n\nNEVERI and placed the vessel in Fyffe's custody.   Less than a month\n\nlater, on September 21, 1998, during Hurricane George, the RIO\n\n\n\n     2\n      28 U.S.C. § 1921(a)(1)(E) provides that the United States\nmarshal shall routinely collect, and a court may tax as costs, fees\nfor the keeping of seized property including the costs of\ninsurance.\n     3\n      A host of other parties intervened as well, including the RIO\nNEVERI's crew, the ship's agent and the Puerto Rico Port Authority.\nTheir claims are not relevant to the current dispute.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fNEVERI broke loose from her moorings and grounded in the mud in San\n\nJuan Harbor. The parties scuffled over who was responsible for the\n\nexpenses related to refloating the vessel.                   Neither Perez nor\n\nVenoco was willing to front the money for the refloating and Fyffe\n\nwas unable to obtain funds from any other source.               Perez and Venoco\n\nalso stopped paying Fyffe's expenses, believing his negligence had\n\nallowed the RIO NEVERI to run aground.\n\n                 On December 10, 1998, the United States, upon its own\n\nmotion, was authorized to refloat and secure the vessel.                         For\n\nreasons not clear on the record, however, the United States took no\n\naction to refloat the vessel and the RIO NEVERI remained grounded\n\nuntil Fyffe obtained a court order to begin salvage operations in\n\nJuly 1999.          It is undisputed that the parties agreed that the\n\n$130,000 fee payable to the salvor, Dimitrious Kalogerakis, would\n\nbe   paid    from    the   proceeds   of   the   sale   of   the   vessel   as    an\n\n\"administrative cost.\"         Kalogerakis successfully salvaged the RIO\n\nNEVERI and returned the vessel to its mooring.\n\n                 The RIO NEVERI's grounding resulted in the bringing of\n\ntwo separate court actions in the District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico, Frontier Insurance Company v. Lubricantes Venoco\n\nInternacional, C.A., et. al., Civ. No. 99-1292 and Perez Y Cia. de\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc. v. Fyffe, Civ. No. 99-2055.                In both actions the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the grounding of the RIO NEVERI was a\n\nresult      of    negligence   and    claimed    damages     arising   from      the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fnegligence.     In October 1999, Perez moved to consolidate the two\n\nactions with the in rem action against the RIO NEVERI.                   Judge\n\nFuste, the judge presiding over the in rem action, denied the\n\nmotion to consolidate.      Perez did not appeal from the denial.\n\n             Because the owners of the RIO NEVERI had not stepped\n\nforward to     claim the vessel and pay the lienors, the court ordered\n\nthe vessel's sale.      While at the time of its arrest the RIO NEVERI\n\nhad been appraised for $1,600,000, her value had significantly\n\ndepreciated because of the considerable damage she had sustained\n\nfrom the grounding.        The sale of the RIO NEVERI netted only\n\n$163,000.4     On March 15, 2000, the court approved the sale and\n\nordered that each of the parties interested in the sale proceeds\n\n\"shall file a separate motion containing an invoice in the form of\n\na verified claim for payment as custodia legis expenses\" within\n\nthirty days from the date of the order.        Almost immediately, Perez\n\nand   Venoco    filed   separate   motions   requesting    custodia      legis\n\nexpenses of $84,836.66 and $20,481.28 respectively.           Prior to the\n\nconfirmation of the sale, Fyffe had submitted to the court a motion\n\nrequesting $60,478.12 from the proceeds of the sale to cover the\n\nadditional     expenses   he   allegedly     incurred     related   to     the\n\nreflotation of the vessel.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      The actual sale price of the vessel was $148,000. However,\nthis was augmented by a $15,000 deposit forfeited by an earlier,\ndefaulting bidder.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          On March 30, 2000, the court issued a \"final order\"\n\ndistributing the sale proceeds.       As previously agreed to by the\n\nparties, Kalogerakis, the salvage operator who refloated the RIO\n\nNEVERI, received $130,000.   The U.S. Marshal received $10,630.58\n\nfor insurance coverage that it was required by statute to maintain\n\nbut that Venoco and Perez had failed to pay.    A.L. Burbank received\n\n$8,000 for the incidental advertising expenses related to the sale\n\nof the vessel. Fyffe received the remaining $14,369.42. The court\n\nfurther ordered:\n\n          The balance of the custodial expenses incurred\n          by Robert Fyffe will be paid by the plaintiff\n          and the intervening plaintiffs in any amount\n          to be agreed by the parties or further\n          disposed of by the court after April 14, 2000.\n\n          It is further ORDERED that this case is\n          closed, subject to any further adjustment on\n          claims needing court intervention after April\n          14, 2000, and without prejudice of a hearing\n          to resolve any arising dispute.\n\n\n          In response to the order of distribution, Perez, joined\n\nby Venoco, filed a motion for reconsideration \"of such part of the\n\nfinal order or distribution of sale proceeds awarding Robert Fyffe\n\n$14,369.42 of the sales proceeds.\" The motion was denied. Neither\n\nPerez nor Venoco opposed the portion of the order that required\n\nFyffe's remaining expenses to be paid by Venoco, Perez, and the\n\nother intervening plaintiffs.\n\n          On April 14, 2000, within the 30 day period specified in\n\nthe March 15, 2000 order, Fyffe submitted a verified claim for\n\n                                -6-\n\fadditional custodia legis expenses in the amount of $206,687.15.\n\nFyffe    requested   that   the   court   declare     the     plaintiff   and\n\nintervening plaintiffs \"jointly liable to Fyffe for his fees and\n\nexpenses\" and \"severally liable to each other for contribution in\n\nproportion for [sic] their respective claims.\"              In response, the\n\nUnited States filed a motion supporting Fyffe's claim for custodia\n\nlegis expenses.      The government submitted that the plaintiff and\n\nintervening plaintiffs \"are jointly and severally liable to Fyffe\n\n. . . for Fyffe's custodia legis expenses . . . .\"               Fyffe also\n\nfiled a motion requesting an extension of time to oppose Perez's\n\nand Venoco's requests for custodia legis expenses.             Neither Perez\n\nnor Venoco filed an opposition to Fyffe's request nor did either\n\nparty request an evidentiary hearing.\n\n           On December 6, 2000, after nearly eight months had\n\nelapsed since Fyffe's additional claim was filed, the court granted\n\nFyffe's unopposed request for expenses.5      Within days, Perez moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the court's December 6 order. Fyffe replied\n\nto the motion claiming, inter alia, that Perez had waived its right\n\nto contest the appropriateness of the expenses or the calculation\n\nby failing to oppose his April 14 motion.           On April 3, 2001, the\n\n\n\n     5\n      The disposition of this claim appears to have resolved the\nremaining outstanding claims in the case, leaving the December 6\norder as final and appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\nAccording to the docket, as of December 6, 2000, all the parties\nclaims had been addressed and orders entered disposing of remaining\nmatters. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcourt denied Perez's motion.         This appeal timely followed.           See\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(B)(i).\n\nII.             DISCUSSION\n\n                The central issue is whether, after allowing Fyffe's\n\nclaim     for    additional   expenses   to   which   Perez   had   filed   no\n\nopposition, the district court abused its discretion in denying\n\nPerez's motion for reconsideration.6            Fyffe insists that Perez\n\nwaived its arguments objecting to the district court's award of\n\nexpenses when it failed to timely oppose Fyffe's request and that\n\nthe district court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to\n\nreconsider the matter.\n\n                Generally, claims not timely made during the pendency of\n\na case, and raised for the first time thereafter in a motion for\n\nreconsideration, are deemed waived on appeal.

Civ.\n\nP. 1; Rule A, Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime\n\nClaims.   While the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set forth the\n\nrules for calculating specified time limits, it is the local rules\n\nof the district courts that establish the time frames within which\n\nparties must respond to motions.

Under the local rules of the District\n\nof Puerto Rico, Perez had ten days after service of the motion\n\nwithin which to file an opposition to Fyffe's motion requesting\n\nadditional custodia legis expenses. D.P.R. Loc. R. 311.5; see also\n\nViqueira, 140 F.3d at 16.          It did not do so.      The local rule is\n\nunambiguous.    See United States v.

Throughout the in rem proceeding, the parties adhered to\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthis ten-day rule or, in appropriate circumstances, requested an\n\nextension of time for filing responses.             Perez did neither here.\n\nIn any event, Perez concedes that the objections first made in its\n\nmotion for reconsideration, filed after the court had allowed\n\nFyffe's additional claim and filed many months after Fyffe had\n\nfiled that claim, were well out of time.\n\n            Perez further concedes that matters presented for the\n\nfirst time in a motion for reconsideration are not timely raised\n\nnor are they ordinarily deemed to be preserved for appellate\n\nreview.     However, Perez contends that we should entertain his\n\nobjections because the district court exercised its discretion to\n\nreview them, thus impliedly excusing their untimeliness.7                  See\n\nQuest    Med.,   Inc.   v.

The record in no way supports Perez's suggestion\n\nthat, after Perez moved for reconsideration, the district court\n\n\n     7\n      We note that Perez presents this argument only in its Reply\nBrief. Normally, arguments raised for the first time in a reply\nbrief come too late to meet the requirement that appellate\narguments must be briefed. Frazier v. Bailey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578605\"><a href=\"/opinion/578605/kevin-frazier-v-edward-n-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 932 n.\n14 (1st Cir. 1992). While we reject Perez's argument as lacking in\nmerit, Perez's failure to have included it in its main brief may\nconstitute a separate ground for rejection.\n\n                                    -10-\n\factually considered the motion on its merits.          The district court,\n\nwithout     comment,     summarily      denied    Perez's      motion      for\n\nreconsideration.       Perez   argues   that   \"[i]t   is   clear   that   the\n\nDistrict Court accepted Perez's excuses[] because it took almost\n\nthree (3) months       for the District Court to finally deny Perez's\n\nmotion for reconsideration.\"       We see no reason why the passage of\n\nthree months between the submission of the reconsideration motion\n\nand the district court's ruling thereon should be taken to indicate\n\nthe court's consideration of the merits of the motion.                     Most\n\nlikely, the court was simply busy with other matters.\n\n           As a further reason for us to find the district court had\n\ndecided the reconsideration motion on the merits, Perez points out\n\nthat the court allowed it to reply to Fyffe's opposition to the\n\nmotion. But again there is no reason why this isolated fact should\n\nbe taken to indicate that the court decided to excuse Perez's\n\nuntimeliness and delve into the merits of Perez's objections to\n\nFyffe's claim.   Fyffe asserted in his opposition to Perez's motion\n\nfor reconsideration that Perez's arguments were untimely and had,\n\ntherefore, been waived.        By permitting a reply the district court\n\nsuggested no more than that it sought to be fair and allow Perez to\n\ncounter Fyffe's waiver argument or tender whatever other excuse it\n\ncould.    There is nothing to show that the district court actually\n\nreached the merits of Perez's objections to Fyffe's expense claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f           In extraordinary circumstances, courts have recognized an\n\nexception to the raise-or-waive rule.

Exceptions have been allowed where a waived argument is \"'so\n\ncompelling as virtually to insure appellant's success,'\" and a\n\n\"'gross miscarriage of justice'\" would result from our failure to\n\naddress it.

Perez contends that it was\n\nwrong for the district court to award custodia legis expenses\n\nwithout first holding an evidentiary hearing.          In Perez's view, a\n\nhearing   was   required   since   Perez   \"attacked   the   veracity   and\n\nreasonableness of Fyffe's claims.\"         But before issuing its order\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fthe district court had no way to know that Perez attacked the\n\nveracity and reasonableness of the claims since Perez had not filed\n\nan opposition to them.

The local\n\nrules of the district court make clear that an unopposed motion\n\nwill be considered and decided without a hearing, unless otherwise\n\ndirected by the court.    D.P.R. Loc. R. 311.9.   It was not plain\n\nerror for the court to rule without a hearing in the circumstances\n\nas they appeared at the time.   Id.\n\n          Perez also contends that the district court was without\n\nauthority in the in rem proceeding to award custodia legis expenses\n\nin excess of the sale proceeds.

To the contrary, the Forscht court concluded that a\n\nsubstitute custodian could seek payment through the in rem action\n\n\n\n     8\n      Contrary to Perez's argument, the local admiralty rules for\nthe District of Puerto Rico do not mandate that a district court\nhold a hearing prior to awarding expenses.

Auto Mfr. Ass'n, 31 F.3d at 26.   It should have\n\ncome as no surprise to Perez that it was at risk of being held\n\npartially responsible for the remaining custodia legis expenses.\n\nIt is a well-established tenet of admiralty law that the arresting\n\nplaintiff and the intervening plaintiffs share in the costs of\n\nmaintaining the res until resolution of the case.

Perez agreed to divide the custodian and security\n\nfees with Venoco in its August 4, 1998 motion requesting an\n\ninterlocutory sale of the vessel.            Nor should it have been a\n\nsurprise to Perez that the custodia legis expenses in excess of the\n\nsale   proceeds    were   awarded   by     Judge   Fuste    in    the   in   rem\n\nproceedings.   Judge Fuste indicated that he intended to review and\n\naward expenses in the in rem proceeding when he specifically\n\nrequested   that   the    parties   submit   claims   for    custodia     legis\n\nexpenses in his March 15 order approving the sale of the RIO\n\nNEVERI. Perez and Venoco submitted their own expense requests even\n\nthough it was evident that the proceeds from the sale of the vessel\n\nwould be nearly exhausted by the salvage operator's claim and the\n\nU.S. Marshal's fees.      Nor should it have been a surprise to Perez\n\nwhen the expenses were actually awarded against it.               In his March\n\n30 order, Judge Fuste explicitly stated that the balance of the\n\ncustodial expenses incurred by Fyffe would be paid by Venoco, Perez\n\nand the other intervening plaintiffs either as agreed to by the\n\nparties \"or further disposed of by the court.\"                   Unaccountably,\n\nPerez remained mute, even after Fyffe submitted, on April 14, 2000,\n\nhis verified claim for additional custodia legis expenses.                   Even\n\nafter the United States filed a motion supporting Fyffe's claim for\n\nexpenses, and Fyffe filed motions requesting an extension of time\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fto oppose Perez's and Venoco's claims for custodia legis expenses,\n\nPerez   did   nothing   to   indicate    its   opposition.   In   these\n\ncircumstances, we find no miscarriage of justice such as would\n\nwarrant reopening the judgment of the district court.\n\nIII.      CONCLUSION\n\n          The district court's order granting Fyffe's unopposed\n\nmotion for custodia legis expenses is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f</pre>",
