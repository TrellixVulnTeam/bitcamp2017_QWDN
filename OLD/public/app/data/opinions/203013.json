Espinosa on brief for petitioner.\n     Douglas E. Ginsburg, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, and Ari Nazarov, Trial Attorney, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           November 5, 2007\n\n______________\n*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f          Per Curiam.     The petitioner, Aquíles de Jesús Rincón-\n\nBedoya, challenges a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) denying his applications for withholding of removal and for\n\nprotection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT).   Discerning no error, we deny the petition for judicial\n\nreview1 and uphold the BIA's removal order.\n\n          The petitioner formerly taught physical education at the\n\nColegio Padre Majaleta, a school in his native Colombia.          He left\n\nhis homeland on May 4, 2003, and entered the United States at\n\nMiami, Florida, using forged travel documents.         He was apprehended\n\nimmediately and, on May 8, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS) charged him with being an alien who by fraud or\n\nmisrepresentation had sought to procure admission into the United\n\nStates in violation of section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).           The INS\n\nalso charged him, under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the INA, with\n\nfailing to possess a valid entry document at the time of his\n\nadmission.   Id. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).\n\n          As   events   unfolded,   the   petitioner    made   conflicting\n\nstatements concerning his reasons for fleeing Colombia.               For\n\nexample, on May 4, 2003, he stated to an immigration officer that\n\nhe had departed because his father-in-law had been kidnaped and his\n\n\n     1\n      Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Attorney General\nPeter D. Keisler has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzales as the respondent herein.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwife had been threatened over the telephone. He voiced a belief\n\nthat he would be harmed if he returned to Colombia.                            Three days\n\nlater, however, he stated during a \"credible fear\" interview that\n\nboth he and his wife had been threatened, and that the threats to\n\nhis wife flowed from her relationship with him.                           He attributed\n\nthose threats to disparaging remarks that he purportedly had made\n\nto his students about a local guerilla group.\n\n               During that interview, the petitioner mentioned that his\n\nfather-in-law        had    been    kidnaped        for    political    or    ideological\n\nreasons.       In the same interview, he claimed, for the first time,\n\nthat he had been assaulted while in Colombia.                     He said that two men\n\non a motorcycle approached him, threw him to the ground, and\n\nthreatened his life.           He again expressed a fear that he would be\n\nkilled if he returned to Colombia.\n\n               In    due    season,     the    authorities         instituted      removal\n\nproceedings.          The petitioner conceded removability and cross-\n\napplied for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.\n\nIn    an    attached    statement,      he     rehearsed        the   comments     that   he\n\nsupposedly      had     made   to   his      students,       recounted       the   menacing\n\ntelephone       calls      supposedly     received         by   his   wife,    and   again\n\ndescribed the motorcyclists' purported assault on his person.                             He\n\nalso       revised   his    story     about     his       father-in-law's      kidnaping,\n\nclaiming that it was motivated both by economic reasons (because\n\nhis    father-in-law        might     prove     to    be    a   munificent     source     of\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f\"protection money\") and by political animus (because his father-in-\n\nlaw shared the petitioner's political views).\n\n          On July 1, 2005, a hearing was held before an immigration\n\njudge (IJ).     The petitioner testified that he had worked at a\n\nschool and had spoken out against the guerillas while addressing\n\nhis students.    He also testified about his run-in with the men on\n\nthe motorcycle, recounting that they threatened him and used\n\nobscenities.    This time around, however, he admitted that they did\n\nnot harm him physically.      When cross-questioned, he expressed\n\nuncertainty about why he did not mention being threatened and\n\nassaulted during his original immigration interview.          Finally, he\n\nconceded that his father-in-law's kidnaping and the threats made to\n\nhis wife had more to do with his father-in-law's business than with\n\nanybody's politics.2\n\n          The petitioner's testimony was fuzzy as to how well he\n\nwas able to communicate with the immigration officer during his\n\ninitial interview.     At first, he intimated that there was no\n\nSpanish-language   interpreter   present   and   that   the   immigration\n\nofficer was not himself proficient in conversational Spanish.\n\n\n\n     2\n      In the course of his testimony, the petitioner stated that he\nhad belonged to various groups while in Colombia, including one\ncalled the Sports Movement of Vienta. His testimony about that\ngroup's political status was vague and, therefore, we treat that\nmembership as immaterial to his petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMoments later, however, he stated that he \"believe[d]\" that he and\n\nthe immigration officer \"did get the communication straight.\"\n\n            Following the hearing, the IJ ordered the petitioner's\n\nremoval and, concomitantly, denied his entreaties for withholding\n\nof removal and protection under the CAT. Citing his inconsistent\n\nstatements and the utter absence of any independent corroboration,\n\nthe IJ found the petitioner not credible.              Given that finding, the\n\npetitioner was unable to carry his burden of proof on either of his\n\nrequests for relief.\n\n            The petitioner pursued an administrative appeal.                      On\n\nNovember 29, 2006, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision.                     It noted\n\nthat the petitioner had neither provided any convincing explanation\n\nfor his inconsistent statements nor furnished any corroborative\n\nevidence.\n\n            The    petitioner    then    filed     this   timely     petition    for\n\njudicial review. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2).\n\n            We start with the standard of review.                   In the case at\n\nhand, the BIA endorsed, and relied upon, the findings of the IJ,\n\nwhile adding its own supporting views.               In that sort of situation,\n\nwe review in tandem the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.                    Ouk\n\nv.   Gonzales,     464   F.3d   108,    110   (1st    Cir.    2006);   Romilus   v.\n\nAshcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            That    review      proceeds      in   line      with    the   familiar\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.                Under that rubric, the BIA's\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdecision must be upheld as long as it is \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"   INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).           This is\n\na deferential standard; it allows a reviewing court to reverse the\n\nBIA's determination of a relevant fact \"only when the record\n\nevidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary\n\ndetermination.\"      Aguilar-Solís v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            This case involves a subset of the substantial evidence\n\nrule dealing with the credibility of witnesses.            When the agency\n\nhas made an adverse credibility determination based on specific\n\nfindings, a reviewing court must treat that determination with\n\nconsiderable respect.      See Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21-22\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    Even so, the court's role is not reduced to that of a\n\nrubber    stamp.      To   be    supportable,     an   adverse   credibility\n\ndetermination must be accompanied by particularized and persuasive\n\nfindings, expressly articulated or easily inferable from context,\n\nsufficient to give it weight. Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115,\n\n121 (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining that \"an IJ must offer a specific\n\nand cogent rationale for disbelieving the alien\"); El Moraghy v.\n\nAshcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that appellate\n\ndeference   on     credibility   questions   in    immigration    cases   \"is\n\nexpressly conditioned on support in the record, as evidenced by\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fspecific     findings\").          Moreover,       an        adverse     credibility\n\ndetermination cannot rest on trivia but, rather, must rest on\n\ndiscrepancies       that   involve     matters    of       consequence.      Pan   v.\n\nGonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir. 2007); Bojorques-Villanueva v.\n\nINS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           An alien's credible testimony, standing alone, may be\n\nsufficient     to    sustain     his    burden        of    proof     even   without\n\ncorroboration.       See Pan, 489 F.3d at 86; see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(b).    But when an IJ supportably determines that an alien's\n\ntestimony lacks veracity, that adverse credibility determination\n\ndivests the testimony of probative force and the testimony may,\n\ntherefore, be disregarded or discounted.               See Pan, 489 F.3d at 86;\n\nNikijuluw,    427    F.3d   at   121.         Thus,    an    adverse    credibility\n\ndetermination may prove fatal to an alien's claim for withholding\n\nof removal or other relief.              Pan, 489 F.3d at 86; Stroni v.\n\nGonzales, 454 F.3d 82, 89 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             Against this backdrop, we turn to the legal framework\n\nsurrounding this case.         We start with withholding of removal.\n\n           In order to establish eligibility for withholding of\n\nremoval, an alien has the burden of proving that it is more likely\n\nthan not that his life or freedom will be threatened were he\n\nrepatriated.    See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b); see also Pan, 489 F.3d at\n\n85-86.     If the alien provides credible evidence that he has\n\nsuffered past persecution on one of five enumerated grounds, it may\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fbe presumed the he will be persecuted in the future should he\n\nreturn to his homeland.     See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i).         The five\n\nenumerated grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\na particular social group, and political opinion.             See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42);   8   C.F.R.   §    208.16(b)(2);   see   also    Da   Silva   v.\n\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           To constitute persecution, \"a person's experience must\n\nrise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000); see Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005) (finding that two\n\nincidents, occurring more than twenty-five months apart, were\n\ninsufficient \"to suggest that the petitioner was systematically\n\ntargeted for abuse on account of his political beliefs\").                   In\n\nshort, a finding of persecution requires more than the happening of\n\none or two disagreeable events.\n\n           In the case at bar, the petitioner's primary argument is\n\nthat the IJ's evaluation of his credibility was incorrect.                  He\n\nmaintains that his testimony should have been credited and that it\n\nsufficed to prove all the elements necessary to entitle him to\n\nrelief.   In his view, his experience with the local guerilla group\n\nqualifies as past persecution and, thus, creates the basis for a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n           We disagree.         The petitioner's argument assumes the\n\nveracity of his testimony — testimony that both the IJ and the BIA\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\ffound unworthy of credence. That adverse credibility determination\n\nis fully supportable: the petitioner's statements about material\n\nmatters were markedly inconsistent at crucial points. Furthermore,\n\nthese inconsistencies were not adequately explained.                    The adverse\n\ncredibility determination was, therefore, unimpugnable. See, e.g.,\n\nMewengkang v. Gonzales, 486 F.3d 737, 740 (1st Cir. 2007); Dhima v.\n\nGonzales, 416 F.3d 92, 96 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           To be sure, the petitioner argues with considerable\n\nfervor   that    the      IJ    and    the    BIA    incorrectly     appraised      his\n\ncredibility.    But this is sound and fury, signifying very little.\n\nIf an alien is to prevail under the substantial evidence standard,\n\n\"the administrative record, viewed in its entirety, must compel the\n\nconclusion   that      he      is   [eligible      for    the   requested   relief].\"\n\nAguilar-Solís,      168     F.3d      at   569.      In    this   instance,    it    is\n\ntransparently clear that, on whole-record review, the petitioner\n\ncannot pass this daunting test.\n\n           The remainder of the case is child's play. Stripping the\n\npetitioner's (incredible) testimony out of the equation, there is\n\nsimply no way that a reasonable adjudicator could find either past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.                        Thus,\n\nthe claim for withholding of removal founders.\n\n           The petitioner's CAT claim need not detain us.                    In order\n\nto establish eligibility for protection under the CAT, an alien\n\nmust prove a likelihood that he will be tortured if returned to his\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fcountry of origin.           See Stroni, 454 F.3d at 89-90.                  He may\n\ndemonstrate this likelihood by providing evidence of past torture.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(3)(i).\n\n            If there is any evidence of torture here — a question we\n\ndo not reach — that evidence is washed away by the adverse\n\ncredibility      determination.            Since   that   determination     must   be\n\nrespected, see text supra, the CAT claim topples.\n\n            In this venue, the petitioner also advances a due process\n\nclaim.   This claim is poorly developed but, as best we can tell, he\n\nargues   that     he   was    unable       to   communicate   clearly     with     his\n\ninterlocutors during at least one of his interviews and that this\n\ninability caused the IJ to determine that his statements were\n\ninconsistent.      Building on this foundation, he maintains that the\n\nBIA violated his due process rights by failing to take into\n\naccount,    or   to    address,      the    IJ's   reliance   on    these   alleged\n\nmiscommunications.\n\n            This      is   wishful    thinking.       There   is    no   mechanical\n\nchecklist for BIA decisions.           For aught that appears here, the BIA\n\nreviewed the whole of the record, applied the appropriate standard\n\nof review, and satisfactorily explained its decision.                    No more was\n\nexigible.\n\n            The petitioner's attempt to rely on Haoud v. Ashcroft,\n\n350 F.3d 201 (1st Cir. 2003), is unavailing.                       There, the BIA\n\naffirmed without opinion an IJ's decision to deny asylum.                    Id. at\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f204.   In doing so, the BIA disregarded a relevant precedent that\n\nhad been decided between the time of the IJ's ruling and the time\n\nof its ruling, notwithstanding that the petitioner had brought the\n\nprecedent to the BIA's attention.       Id.    This court remanded,\n\nholding that the BIA may not use the affirmance without opinion\n\nprocedure,    8   C.F.R.   §   1003.1(e)(4),   without   giving   due\n\nconsideration to its own precedents.    Haoud, 350 F.3d at 207-08.\n\n          The petitioner's case is unlike Haoud in obvious ways.\n\nHere, the BIA did not use the affirmance without opinion procedure\n\nat all but, rather, wrote a reasoned opinion of its own.   Moreover,\n\nit did not overlook a controlling precedent.     Consequently, Haoud\n\nis inapposite and we therefore dismiss the petitioner's due process\n\nclaim as unfounded.\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deny the petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f",

Discerning no error, we deny the petition for judicial\n\nreview1 and uphold the BIA's removal order.\n\n          The petitioner formerly taught physical education at the\n\nColegio Padre Majaleta, a school in his native Colombia.          He left\n\nhis homeland on May 4, 2003, and entered the United States at\n\nMiami, Florida, using forged travel documents.         He was apprehended\n\nimmediately and, on May 8, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS) charged him with being an alien who by fraud or\n\nmisrepresentation had sought to procure admission into the United\n\nStates in violation of section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).           The INS\n\nalso charged him, under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the INA, with\n\nfailing to possess a valid entry document at the time of his\n\nadmission.   Id. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).\n\n          As   events   unfolded,   the   petitioner    made   conflicting\n\nstatements concerning his reasons for fleeing Colombia.               For\n\nexample, on May 4, 2003, he stated to an immigration officer that\n\nhe had departed because his father-in-law had been kidnaped and his\n\n\n     1\n      Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Attorney General\nPeter D. Keisler has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzales as the respondent herein.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwife had been threatened over the telephone. He voiced a belief\n\nthat he would be harmed if he returned to Colombia.                            Three days\n\nlater, however, he stated during a \"credible fear\" interview that\n\nboth he and his wife had been threatened, and that the threats to\n\nhis wife flowed from her relationship with him.                           He attributed\n\nthose threats to disparaging remarks that he purportedly had made\n\nto his students about a local guerilla group.\n\n               During that interview, the petitioner mentioned that his\n\nfather-in-law        had    been    kidnaped        for    political    or    ideological\n\nreasons.       In the same interview, he claimed, for the first time,\n\nthat he had been assaulted while in Colombia.                     He said that two men\n\non a motorcycle approached him, threw him to the ground, and\n\nthreatened his life.           He again expressed a fear that he would be\n\nkilled if he returned to Colombia.\n\n               In    due    season,     the    authorities         instituted      removal\n\nproceedings.          The petitioner conceded removability and cross-\n\napplied for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.\n\nIn    an    attached    statement,      he     rehearsed        the   comments     that   he\n\nsupposedly      had     made   to   his      students,       recounted       the   menacing\n\ntelephone       calls      supposedly     received         by   his   wife,    and   again\n\ndescribed the motorcyclists' purported assault on his person.                             He\n\nalso       revised   his    story     about     his       father-in-law's      kidnaping,\n\nclaiming that it was motivated both by economic reasons (because\n\nhis    father-in-law        might     prove     to    be    a   munificent     source     of\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f\"protection money\") and by political animus (because his father-in-\n\nlaw shared the petitioner's political views).\n\n          On July 1, 2005, a hearing was held before an immigration\n\njudge (IJ).     The petitioner testified that he had worked at a\n\nschool and had spoken out against the guerillas while addressing\n\nhis students.    He also testified about his run-in with the men on\n\nthe motorcycle, recounting that they threatened him and used\n\nobscenities.    This time around, however, he admitted that they did\n\nnot harm him physically.      When cross-questioned, he expressed\n\nuncertainty about why he did not mention being threatened and\n\nassaulted during his original immigration interview.          Finally, he\n\nconceded that his father-in-law's kidnaping and the threats made to\n\nhis wife had more to do with his father-in-law's business than with\n\nanybody's politics.2\n\n          The petitioner's testimony was fuzzy as to how well he\n\nwas able to communicate with the immigration officer during his\n\ninitial interview.     At first, he intimated that there was no\n\nSpanish-language   interpreter   present   and   that   the   immigration\n\nofficer was not himself proficient in conversational Spanish.\n\n\n\n     2\n      In the course of his testimony, the petitioner stated that he\nhad belonged to various groups while in Colombia, including one\ncalled the Sports Movement of Vienta. His testimony about that\ngroup's political status was vague and, therefore, we treat that\nmembership as immaterial to his petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMoments later, however, he stated that he \"believe[d]\" that he and\n\nthe immigration officer \"did get the communication straight.\"\n\n            Following the hearing, the IJ ordered the petitioner's\n\nremoval and, concomitantly, denied his entreaties for withholding\n\nof removal and protection under the CAT. Citing his inconsistent\n\nstatements and the utter absence of any independent corroboration,\n\nthe IJ found the petitioner not credible.              Given that finding, the\n\npetitioner was unable to carry his burden of proof on either of his\n\nrequests for relief.\n\n            The petitioner pursued an administrative appeal.                      On\n\nNovember 29, 2006, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision.                     It noted\n\nthat the petitioner had neither provided any convincing explanation\n\nfor his inconsistent statements nor furnished any corroborative\n\nevidence.\n\n            The    petitioner    then    filed     this   timely     petition    for\n\njudicial review. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2).\n\n            We start with the standard of review.                   In the case at\n\nhand, the BIA endorsed, and relied upon, the findings of the IJ,\n\nwhile adding its own supporting views.               In that sort of situation,\n\nwe review in tandem the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.                    Ouk\n\nv.

See Pan, 489 F.3d at 86; see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(b).    But when an IJ supportably determines that an alien's\n\ntestimony lacks veracity, that adverse credibility determination\n\ndivests the testimony of probative force and the testimony may,\n\ntherefore, be disregarded or discounted.               See Pan, 489 F.3d at 86;\n\nNikijuluw,    427    F.3d   at   121.         Thus,    an    adverse    credibility\n\ndetermination may prove fatal to an alien's claim for withholding\n\nof removal or other relief.

We start with withholding of removal.\n\n           In order to establish eligibility for withholding of\n\nremoval, an alien has the burden of proving that it is more likely\n\nthan not that his life or freedom will be threatened were he\n\nrepatriated.    See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b); see also Pan, 489 F.3d at\n\n85-86.     If the alien provides credible evidence that he has\n\nsuffered past persecution on one of five enumerated grounds, it may\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fbe presumed the he will be persecuted in the future should he\n\nreturn to his homeland.     See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i).         The five\n\nenumerated grounds are race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\na particular social group, and political opinion.             See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42);   8   C.F.R.   §    208.16(b)(2);   see   also    Da   Silva   v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201398\"><a href=\"/opinion/201398/da-silva-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           To constitute persecution, \"a person's experience must\n\nrise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"\n\nNelson v.

In\n\nshort, a finding of persecution requires more than the happening of\n\none or two disagreeable events.\n\n           In the case at bar, the petitioner's primary argument is\n\nthat the IJ's evaluation of his credibility was incorrect.                  He\n\nmaintains that his testimony should have been credited and that it\n\nsufficed to prove all the elements necessary to entitle him to\n\nrelief.   In his view, his experience with the local guerilla group\n\nqualifies as past persecution and, thus, creates the basis for a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n           We disagree.         The petitioner's argument assumes the\n\nveracity of his testimony — testimony that both the IJ and the BIA\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\ffound unworthy of credence. That adverse credibility determination\n\nis fully supportable: the petitioner's statements about material\n\nmatters were markedly inconsistent at crucial points. Furthermore,\n\nthese inconsistencies were not adequately explained.                    The adverse\n\ncredibility determination was, therefore, unimpugnable. See, e.g.,\n\nMewengkang v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202828\"><a href=\"/opinion/202828/mewengkang-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740 (1st Cir. 2007); Dhima v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201733\"><a href=\"/opinion/201733/dhima-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           To be sure, the petitioner argues with considerable\n\nfervor   that    the      IJ    and    the    BIA    incorrectly     appraised      his\n\ncredibility.    But this is sound and fury, signifying very little.\n\nIf an alien is to prevail under the substantial evidence standard,\n\n\"the administrative record, viewed in its entirety, must compel the\n\nconclusion   that      he      is   [eligible      for    the   requested   relief].\"\n\nAguilar-Solís,      168     F.3d      at   569.      In    this   instance,    it    is\n\ntransparently clear that, on whole-record review, the petitioner\n\ncannot pass this daunting test.\n\n           The remainder of the case is child's play. Stripping the\n\npetitioner's (incredible) testimony out of the equation, there is\n\nsimply no way that a reasonable adjudicator could find either past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.                        Thus,\n\nthe claim for withholding of removal founders.\n\n           The petitioner's CAT claim need not detain us.                    In order\n\nto establish eligibility for protection under the CAT, an alien\n\nmust prove a likelihood that he will be tortured if returned to his\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fcountry of origin.           See Stroni, 454 F.3d at 89-90.                  He may\n\ndemonstrate this likelihood by providing evidence of past torture.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(3)(i).\n\n            If there is any evidence of torture here — a question we\n\ndo not reach — that evidence is washed away by the adverse\n\ncredibility      determination.            Since   that   determination     must   be\n\nrespected, see text supra, the CAT claim topples.\n\n            In this venue, the petitioner also advances a due process\n\nclaim.   This claim is poorly developed but, as best we can tell, he\n\nargues   that     he   was    unable       to   communicate   clearly     with     his\n\ninterlocutors during at least one of his interviews and that this\n\ninability caused the IJ to determine that his statements were\n\ninconsistent.      Building on this foundation, he maintains that the\n\nBIA violated his due process rights by failing to take into\n\naccount,    or   to    address,      the    IJ's   reliance   on    these   alleged\n\nmiscommunications.\n\n            This      is   wishful    thinking.       There   is    no   mechanical\n\nchecklist for BIA decisions.           For aught that appears here, the BIA\n\nreviewed the whole of the record, applied the appropriate standard\n\nof review, and satisfactorily explained its decision.                    No more was\n\nexigible.\n\n            The petitioner's attempt to rely on Haoud v. Ashcroft,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200742\"><a href=\"/opinion/200742/haoud-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2003), is unavailing.                       There, the BIA\n\naffirmed without opinion an IJ's decision to deny asylum.                    Id. at\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f204.   In doing so, the BIA disregarded a relevant precedent that\n\nhad been decided between the time of the IJ's ruling and the time\n\nof its ruling, notwithstanding that the petitioner had brought the\n\nprecedent to the BIA's attention.       Id.    This court remanded,\n\nholding that the BIA may not use the affirmance without opinion\n\nprocedure,    8   C.F.R.   §   1003.1(e)(4),   without   giving   due\n\nconsideration to its own precedents.    Haoud, 350 F.3d at 207-08.\n\n          The petitioner's case is unlike Haoud in obvious ways.\n\nHere, the BIA did not use the affirmance without opinion procedure\n\nat all but, rather, wrote a reasoned opinion of its own.   Moreover,\n\nit did not overlook a controlling precedent.     Consequently, Haoud\n\nis inapposite and we therefore dismiss the petitioner's due process\n\nclaim as unfounded.\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deny the petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f</pre>",
