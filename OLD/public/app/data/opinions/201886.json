In this immigration case, the\n\npetitioner, Edward Dirk Nikijuluw, asserts that he is a religious\n\nrefugee from his native Indonesia. An Immigration Judge (IJ) found\n\nthat       the    petitioner's       claim       of   religious   persecution    lacked\n\nsubstance and ordered him removed.                        The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) upheld the IJ's order.                       The petitioner now seeks\n\njudicial review. After careful consideration, we deny the petition\n\nfor review.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n                                        Background\n\n                  The    petitioner    is    a    fifty-two     year   old   citizen   of\n\nIndonesia who lawfully entered the United States on September 8,\n\n2001 as a non-immigrant visitor for business purposes.                           By its\n\nterms, his B-1 visa permitted him to remain in the United States\n\nuntil October 7, 2001.               See generally 22 C.F.R. § 41.31(a) (1998).\n\nThe petitioner overstayed his visa without securing the appropriate\n\nauthorization           from   the    Immigration        and   Naturalization   Service\n\n(INS).1          Consequently, the INS charged him with remaining longer\n\nthan permitted, see 8 U.S.C. § 237(a)(1)(B), and instituted removal\n\nproceedings.            The petitioner conceded removability but cross-filed\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the\n\n\n       1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\nabolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004). For simplicity's sake, we refer throughout to the INS.\n\n                                             -2-\n\fConvention Against Torture (CAT).           He claimed in substance that,\n\nwhile in Indonesia, radical Muslims had persecuted him and his\n\nfamily (at a bare minimum, the petitioner and his parents, wife,\n\nand children subscribe to the Christian Protestant faith).2\n\n              The petitioner pointed to three specific incidents which,\n\nin his view, established his claim of religious persecution.\n\nFirst,   he    expressed   his   belief    that   Muslims   were   behind   the\n\ndisappearance of his eldest daughter, whose whereabouts have been\n\nunknown since 2001.        Second, he alleged that Muslims set fire to\n\nthe church to which he belonged in November of 1999.                Third, he\n\naverred that because he sometimes held religious services in his\n\nhome, he received at least three anonymous threats and unknown\n\npersons stoned the house.\n\n              An INS asylum officer interviewed the petitioner as part\n\nof an investigation into his application and, finding that his\n\naccount of what had transpired in Indonesia lacked veracity,\n\nreferred his case to the immigration court.           After an evidentiary\n\nhearing, the IJ concluded that the petitioner had failed to carry\n\nthe burden of proof on any of his asserted claims, in part because\n\nthe petitioner's testimony regarding past incidents of alleged\n\npersecution was not credible.       The IJ provided specific and cogent\n\nreasons to support this conclusion.\n\n\n     2\n      The petitioner also implied in his testimony (although the\nrecord does not explicitly so state) that his siblings are\nChristian Protestants.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           To begin, the IJ found no evidence that the disappearance\n\nof the petitioner's daughter had anything whatever to do with her\n\nreligious affiliation.    In fact, the credible evidence indicated\n\nthat the daughter had become a Muslim and had attempted to persuade\n\nher family to accept that religion.\n\n           In all events, the petitioner's testimony about this\n\nincident was wildly inconsistent.      For example, on his asylum\n\napplication he wrote that his daughter had been seduced by a\n\nfanatic Muslim, but during his interview he claimed that she had\n\nvanished during a series of riots that included attacks on his\n\nchurch.   Later still, he stated that he did not know why or how his\n\ndaughter had disappeared.     There was also an intimation in the\n\nrecord that the petitioner's daughter may simply have run away with\n\nher boyfriend after she had begun performing as a night club\n\nsinger.\n\n           As to the second incident, it was clear that fire had\n\nconsumed the petitioner's church in November of 1999.        The IJ\n\nnoted, however, that the church was in the process of being rebuilt\n\nand that the church community continued openly to hold regular\n\nworship services.\n\n           In the same vein, the IJ cited the Department of State\n\nCountry Report on Human Rights Practices for 2002 (the Country\n\nConditions Report) as evidence that the petitioner's claims of\n\nreligious persecution were overblown.       The Country Conditions\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fReport explained that the Indonesian constitution \"provides for\n\nevery resident to adhere to their respective religion and to\n\nperform their religious duties in accordance with their religion\n\nand faith.\"    It also vouchsafed that the Indonesian government\n\ngenerally respected this constitutional provision and officially\n\nacknowledged Protestantism as one of several recognized religions.\n\nFinally, the Country Conditions Report indicated that, by 2002,\n\nincidents targeting churches were \"much less frequent than in\n\nprevious years.\"\n\n           The IJ also considered, and rejected, the petitioner's\n\ntestimony regarding the anonymous threats and the stoning of his\n\nhome.   He observed that the petitioner had failed to mention these\n\nincidents to the asylum officer.   While the statement attached to\n\nhis asylum application recounted threats of stone-throwing, it did\n\nnot mention that such an event had actually occurred.   On the basis\n\nof these omissions, the IJ found that the petitioner had failed to\n\nestablish by credible testimony that the stone-throwing incident\n\nhad taken place.\n\n           Overall, the IJ evaluated the petitioner's assertions as\n\n\"general, meager and weak\" and concluded that the petitioner had\n\nnot carried his burden of establishing religious persecution.    To\n\nbuttress this conclusion, the IJ noted that the petitioner had\n\nlived, worked, and raised a family in Indonesia, for the most part\n\nwithout incurring any religious hostility.    The IJ further noted\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fthat       the   petitioner's    family,    including   his     wife,   children,\n\nparents, and siblings, remained in Indonesia and that there was no\n\nevidence that any family member had been a victim of religious\n\npersecution at any time after the petitioner's entry into the\n\nUnited States. Finally, the IJ noted that the petitioner had never\n\nbeen arrested, detained, threatened, or put in harm's way by the\n\nIndonesian government or any of its agents on account of his\n\nreligious beliefs.\n\n                 Consistent with these findings, the IJ denied the cross-\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder CAT; ordered the petitioner removed; and designated Indonesia\n\nas the country of removal.            The BIA upheld the IJ's decision,\n\nconcluding        that   the   petitioner   had   failed   to    establish   past\n\npersecution, a well-founded fear of future persecution, or a\n\nsufficient likelihood that he would be subjected to torture upon\n\nhis return to Indonesia.          This timely petition for judicial review\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n                 We start — and end — with the denial of the petitioner's\n\napplication for asylum.3            In reviewing the BIA's denial of an\n\n\n       3\n      It is well established that \"issues adverted to in a\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\" United States v. Zannino, 895\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990); accord Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d\n75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004) (enunciating the same principle in the\n\n                                       -6-\n\fasylum application, we examine its findings of fact, including its\n\ncredibility determinations, to ascertain whether those findings are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.           See Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005); Da Silva v. Ashcroft,\n\n394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).           Under this highly deferential\n\nstandard, we must accept the BIA's findings so long as they are\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992).     Absent an error of law, we can overrule the BIA's\n\nensuing decision only if the evidence \"points unerringly in the\n\nopposite direction.\"       Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n           The petitioner bears the burden of establishing that he\n\nqualifies for asylum.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); see also\n\nMakhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004).         To qualify\n\nas a refugee within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct, an asylum seeker must show that he cannot return to his home\n\ncountry   \"because    of   persecution    or   a   well-founded   fear   of\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\"          8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).    Upon a satisfactory showing of past persecution,\n\n\nimmigration context).     Here, the petitioner has devoted his\nappellate brief exclusively to his asylum claim and has failed to\ndevelop any argument supporting either his claim for withholding of\nremoval or his claim for protection under CAT. Consequently, we\ndeem those claims abandoned.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fa rebuttable presumption arises that a petitioner's fear of future\n\npersecution is well-founded.   Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 79.\n\n          The Immigration and Nationality Act provides no precise\n\ndefinition of \"persecution.\"     The case law, however, is more\n\ninformative.   We have held that past persecution requires that the\n\ntotality of a petitioner's experiences add up to more than mere\n\ndiscomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\n\nSee, e.g., Bocova, 412 F.3d at 263; Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258,\n\n263 (1st Cir. 2000).   Moreover, persecution \"always implies some\n\nconnection to government action or inaction.\"       Harutyunyan v.\n\nGonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir. 2005).      Thus, an applicant\n\nqualifies for asylum only when he suffers persecution that is the\n\ndirect result of government action, government-supported action, or\n\ngovernment's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct.\n\nId.\n\n          It is transparently clear that in order to establish\n\nrefugee status, an alien must support his claim of persecution\n\nthrough credible testimony.    Credible testimony, standing alone,\n\nmay be adequate to sustain the alien's burden of proof.         See\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir. 2004).    But if the\n\nproffered testimony is not credible, it may be either disregarded\n\nor sharply discounted, depending on the circumstances.    See, e.g.,\n\nLaurent, 359 F.3d at 64; see also Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d\n\n565, 570-71 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f           Commensurate          with     the      importance        of     credibility\n\ndeterminations in immigration cases, an IJ must offer a specific\n\nand cogent rationale for disbelieving the alien.                          El Moraghy v.\n\nAshcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir. 2003); Gailius v. INS, 147\n\nF.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).             In this instance, the IJ's findings\n\neasily pass through that screen.                 Since the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination     is         supported     by      substantial       evidence,       the\n\npetitioner's testimony cannot carry the day — and the record\n\ncontains   little       of     substance,       apart     from    the      petitioner's\n\ntestimony, that might serve to corroborate his story or otherwise\n\nto shore up his asylum application.\n\n           Even    if    we     were     to     leave     to   one   side     the    IJ's\n\ndetermination that the petitioner's tales were not worthy of\n\ncredence and accept the petitioner's testimony as true, he still\n\nwould not have offered sufficient evidence to establish persecution\n\nwithin the meaning of our precedents.               At most, the petitioner has\n\nsuffered sporadic private discrimination — and there is no evidence\n\nthat such discrimination (if, indeed, it occurred) was sponsored,\n\nsupported, or condoned by the government.                  We explain briefly.\n\n           The    evidence       related      to    the    disappearance        of   the\n\npetitioner's daughter was extremely sketchy.                     There is nothing in\n\nthe record — other than the petitioner's unfounded suspicions — to\n\nsuggest that the daughter's disappearance stemmed from some sort of\n\nreligious jihad, much less that the Indonesian government conspired\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fin, or condoned her disappearance.                   The other evidence is no more\n\ncompelling; even assuming that radical Muslims burned down the\n\nchurch and stoned the petitioner's house in retaliation for the\n\nholding of weekday worship services, there is no proof connecting\n\nthese isolated acts of private discrimination with the Indonesian\n\nauthorities. Moreover, the other undisputed facts — e.g., that the\n\nchurch   is    being      rebuilt,      that      the    congregation          continues     to\n\nfunction openly, and that the petitioner's Christian relatives have\n\nbeen   able    to    live     tranquilly       in    Indonesia      —    comprise       strong\n\nevidence      that      the   government          was    not   involved        in     whatever\n\ndiscrimination the petitioner may have experienced.                            Consequently,\n\nwe find no basis for disturbing the BIA's conclusion that the\n\npetitioner failed to show past persecution.\n\n              The only remaining issue is whether, independent of any\n\npresumption arising out of past persecution, the petitioner has\n\nshown a well-founded fear of future persecution.                          The IJ and the\n\nBIA answered this question in the negative.                      The record does not\n\nallow us to quarrel with that answer.\n\n              In     order    to      show    a     well-founded        fear     of     future\n\npersecution,        a    petitioner      must       satisfy    both       subjective        and\n\nobjective components.           He must \"not only harbor a genuine fear of\n\nfuture   persecution,           but    also       must   establish        an    objectively\n\nreasonable     basis      for    that    fear.\"          Laurent,       359    F.3d    at   65.\n\nCredibility aside, the petitioner's testimony that he fears harm\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\fshould he return to Indonesia arguably satisfies the subjective\n\ncomponent.   Thus, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the objective\n\ncomponent.\n\n           An objectively reasonable fear of future persecution\n\nexists if a reasonable person in the petitioner's circumstances\n\nwould fear persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\n\nAguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.        In a highly analogous case, this\n\ncourt determined that a petitioner could not establish a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution when her family lived safely in\n\nthe country of deportation and there was neither record evidence\n\nnor   significant   support    in   State   Department   reports    for    the\n\npetitioner's   claim   of     likely   future   persecution.       Zheng    v.\n\nGonzales, 416 F.3d 97, 101 (1st Cir. 2005).        Here, as in Zheng, the\n\npetitioner's family members (most of whom share his religious\n\naffiliation) continue to live peaceably in his native land and\n\nthere is no probative evidence that the petitioner will be harmed\n\nshould he return.      The Country Conditions Report states that\n\nincidents of violence against Christians in Indonesia are in\n\nsignificant decline. To cinch matters, the petitioner's Indonesian\n\nchurch community is rebuilding the destroyed house of worship and\n\ncontinues to hold regular services.         While a reasonable person in\n\nthe petitioner's position might fear encountering some private\n\nhostility in a majority Muslim country on account of his Christian\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fProtestant beliefs, the record does not make manifest any objective\n\nbasis for a fear of future persecution.\n\n                                 III.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n           We need go no further.     Because the petitioner failed to\n\nadduce   credible   and   probative   evidence   showing   either   past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, the BIA's\n\nrejection of his application for relief stands on solid ground.\n\nAccordingly, the petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n           So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

The petitioner overstayed his visa without securing the appropriate authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Consequently, the INS charged him with remaining longer than permitted, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 237(a)(1)(B), and instituted removal proceedings. The petitioner conceded removability but cross-filed for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). He claimed in substance that, while in Indonesia, radical Muslims had persecuted him and his family (at a bare minimum, the petitioner and his parents, wife, and children subscribe to the Christian Protestant faith).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner pointed to three specific incidents which, in his view, established his claim of religious persecution. First, he expressed his belief that Muslims were behind the disappearance of his eldest daughter, whose whereabouts have been unknown since 2001. Second, he alleged that Muslims set fire to the church to which he belonged in November of 1999. Third, he averred that because he sometimes held religious services in his home, he received at least three anonymous threats and unknown persons stoned the house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An INS asylum officer interviewed the petitioner as part of an investigation into his application and, finding that his account of what had transpired in Indonesia lacked veracity, referred his case to the immigration court. After an evidentiary hearing, the IJ concluded that the petitioner had failed to carry the burden of proof on any of his asserted claims, in part because the petitioner's testimony regarding past incidents of alleged persecution was not credible. The IJ provided specific and cogent reasons to support this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, the IJ found no evidence that the disappearance of the petitioner's daughter had anything whatever to do with her religious affiliation. In fact, the credible evidence indicated that the daughter had become a Muslim and had attempted to persuade her family to accept that religion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the petitioner's testimony about this incident was wildly inconsistent. For example, on his asylum application he wrote that his daughter had been seduced by a fanatic Muslim, but during his interview he claimed that she had vanished during a series of riots that included attacks on his church. Later still, he stated that he did not know why or how his daughter had disappeared. There was also an intimation in the record that the petitioner's daughter may simply have run away with her boyfriend after she had begun performing as a night club singer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second incident, it was clear that fire had consumed the petitioner's church in November of 1999. The IJ noted, however, that the church was in the process of being rebuilt and that the church community continued openly to hold regular worship services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, the IJ cited the Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2002 (the Country Conditions Report) as evidence that the petitioner's claims of religious persecution were overblown. The Country Conditions Report explained that the Indonesian constitution \"provides for every resident to adhere to their respective religion and to perform their religious duties in accordance with their religion and faith.\" It also vouchsafed that the Indonesian government generally respected this constitutional provision and officially acknowledged Protestantism as one of several recognized religions. Finally, the Country Conditions Report indicated that, by 2002, incidents targeting churches were \"much less frequent than in previous years.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ also considered, and rejected, the petitioner's testimony regarding the anonymous threats and the stoning of his home. He observed that the petitioner had failed to mention these incidents to the asylum officer. While the statement attached to his asylum application recounted threats of stone-throwing, it did not mention that such an event had actually occurred. On the basis of these omissions, the IJ found that the petitioner had failed to establish by credible testimony that the stone-throwing incident had taken place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overall, the IJ evaluated the petitioner's assertions as \"general, meager and weak\" and concluded that the petitioner had not carried his burden of establishing religious persecution. To buttress this conclusion, the IJ noted that the petitioner had lived, worked, and raised a family in Indonesia, for the most part without incurring any religious hostility. The IJ further noted that the petitioner's family, including his wife, children, parents, and siblings, remained in Indonesia and that there was no evidence that any family member had been a victim of religious persecution at any time after the petitioner's entry into the United States. Finally, the IJ noted that the petitioner had never been arrested, detained, threatened, or put in harm's way by the Indonesian government or any of its agents on account of his religious beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with these findings, the IJ denied the cross-application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT; ordered the petitioner removed; and designated Indonesia as the country of removal. The BIA upheld the IJ's decision, concluding that the petitioner had failed to establish past persecution, a well-founded fear of future persecution, or a sufficient likelihood that he would be subjected to torture upon his return to Indonesia. This timely petition for judicial review followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start &#8212; and end &#8212; with the denial of the petitioner's application for asylum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In reviewing the BIA's denial of an asylum application, we examine its findings of fact, including its credibility determinations, to ascertain whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <i>See Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Da Silva v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). Under this highly deferential standard, we must accept the BIA's findings so long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Absent an error of law, we can overrule the BIA's ensuing decision only if the evidence \"points unerringly in the opposite direction.\" <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner bears the burden of establishing that he qualifies for asylum. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); <i>see also Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2004). To qualify as a refugee within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an asylum seeker must show that he cannot return to his home country \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). Upon a satisfactory showing of past persecution, a rebuttable presumption arises that a petitioner's fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration and Nationality Act provides no precise definition of \"persecution.\" The case law, however, is more informative. We have held that past persecution requires that the totality of a petitioner's experiences add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment. <i>See, e.g., Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263; <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000). Moreover, persecution \"always implies some connection to government action or inaction.\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, an applicant qualifies for asylum only when he suffers persecution that is the direct result of government action, government-supported action, or government's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is transparently clear that in order to establish refugee status, an alien must support his claim of persecution through credible testimony. Credible testimony, standing alone, may be adequate to sustain the alien's burden of proof. <i>See Settenda v. Ashcroft,</i> 377 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir.2004). But if the proffered testimony is not credible, it may be either disregarded or sharply discounted, depending on the circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64; <i>see also Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 570-71 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commensurate with the importance of credibility determinations in immigration cases, an IJ must offer a specific and cogent rationale for disbelieving the alien. <i>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir.1998). In this instance, the IJ's findings easily pass through that screen. Since the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, the petitioner's testimony cannot carry the day &#8212; and the record contains little of substance, apart from the petitioner's testimony, that might serve to corroborate his story or otherwise to shore up his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to leave to one side the IJ's determination that the petitioner's tales were not worthy of credence and accept the petitioner's testimony as true, he still would not have offered sufficient evidence to establish persecution within the meaning of our precedents. At most, the petitioner has suffered sporadic private discrimination &#8212; and there is no evidence that such discrimination (if, indeed, it occurred) was sponsored, supported, or condoned by the government. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence related to the disappearance of the petitioner's daughter was extremely sketchy. There is nothing in the record &#8212; other than the petitioner's unfounded suspicions &#8212; to suggest that the daughter's disappearance stemmed from some sort of religious jihad, much less that the Indonesian government conspired in, or condoned her disappearance. The other evidence is no more compelling; even assuming that radical Muslims burned down the church and stoned the petitioner's house in retaliation for the holding of weekday worship services, there is no proof connecting these isolated acts of private discrimination with the Indonesian authorities. Moreover, the other undisputed facts &#8212; e.g., that the church is being rebuilt, that the congregation continues to function openly, and that the petitioner's Christian relatives have been able to live tranquilly in Indonesia &#8212; comprise strong evidence that the government was not involved in whatever discrimination the petitioner may have experienced. Consequently, we find no basis for disturbing the BIA's conclusion that the petitioner failed to show past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining issue is whether, independent of any presumption arising out of past persecution, the petitioner has shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ and the BIA answered this question in the negative. The record does not allow us to quarrel with that answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to show a well-founded fear of future persecution, a petitioner must satisfy both subjective and objective components. He must \"not only harbor a genuine fear of future persecution, but also must establish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear.\" <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 65. Credibility aside, the petitioner's testimony that he fears harm should he return to Indonesia arguably satisfies the subjective component. Thus, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the objective component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An objectively reasonable fear of future persecution exists if a reasonable person in the petitioner's circumstances would fear persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572. In a highly analogous case, this court determined that a petitioner could not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution when her family lived safely in the country of deportation and there was neither record evidence nor significant support in State Department reports for the petitioner's claim of likely future persecution. <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> 416 F.3d 97, 101 (1st Cir.2005). Here, as in <i>Zheng,</i> the petitioner's family members (most of whom share his religious affiliation) continue to live peaceably in his native land and there is no probative evidence that the petitioner will be harmed should he return. The Country Conditions Report states that incidents of violence against Christians in Indonesia are in significant decline. To cinch matters, the petitioner's Indonesian church community is rebuilding the destroyed house of worship and continues to hold regular services. While a reasonable person in the petitioner's position might fear encountering some private hostility in a majority Muslim country on account of his Christian Protestant beliefs, the record does not make manifest any objective basis for a fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because the petitioner failed to adduce credible and probative evidence showing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, the BIA's rejection of his application for relief stands on solid ground. Accordingly, the petition for judicial review is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-296, &#167; 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. &#167; 291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of Homeland Security<i>See Lattab v.

Absent an error of law, we can overrule the BIA's ensuing decision only if the evidence \"points unerringly in the opposite direction.\" <i>Laurent v.

Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2004). To qualify as a refugee within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an asylum seeker must show that he cannot return to his home country \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). Upon a satisfactory showing of past persecution, a rebuttable presumption arises that a petitioner's fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>Makhoul,</i> 387 F.3d at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration and Nationality Act provides no precise definition of \"persecution.\" The case law, however, is more informative. We have held that past persecution requires that the totality of a petitioner's experiences add up to more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment. <i>See, e.g., Bocova,</i> 412 F.3d at 263; <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000). Moreover, persecution \"always implies some connection to government action or inaction.\" <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2005). Thus, an applicant qualifies for asylum only when he suffers persecution that is the direct result of government action, government-supported action, or government's unwillingness or inability to control private conduct. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is transparently clear that in order to establish refugee status, an alien must support his claim of persecution through credible testimony. Credible testimony, standing alone, may be adequate to sustain the alien's burden of proof. <i>See Settenda v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201166\"><a href=\"/opinion/201166/settenda-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2004). But if the proffered testimony is not credible, it may be either disregarded or sharply discounted, depending on the circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 64; <i>see also Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 570-71 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commensurate with the importance of credibility determinations in immigration cases, an IJ must offer a specific and cogent rationale for disbelieving the alien. <i>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200506\"><a href=\"/opinion/200506/el-moraghy-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1998). In this instance, the IJ's findings easily pass through that screen. Since the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, the petitioner's testimony cannot carry the day &#8212; and the record contains little of substance, apart from the petitioner's testimony, that might serve to corroborate his story or otherwise to shore up his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to leave to one side the IJ's determination that the petitioner's tales were not worthy of credence and accept the petitioner's testimony as true, he still would not have offered sufficient evidence to establish persecution within the meaning of our precedents. At most, the petitioner has suffered sporadic private discrimination &#8212; and there is no evidence that such discrimination (if, indeed, it occurred) was sponsored, supported, or condoned by the government. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence related to the disappearance of the petitioner's daughter was extremely sketchy. There is nothing in the record &#8212; other than the petitioner's unfounded suspicions &#8212; to suggest that the daughter's disappearance stemmed from some sort of religious jihad, much less that the Indonesian government conspired in, or condoned her disappearance. The other evidence is no more compelling; even assuming that radical Muslims burned down the church and stoned the petitioner's house in retaliation for the holding of weekday worship services, there is no proof connecting these isolated acts of private discrimination with the Indonesian authorities. Moreover, the other undisputed facts &#8212; e.g., that the church is being rebuilt, that the congregation continues to function openly, and that the petitioner's Christian relatives have been able to live tranquilly in Indonesia &#8212; comprise strong evidence that the government was not involved in whatever discrimination the petitioner may have experienced. Consequently, we find no basis for disturbing the BIA's conclusion that the petitioner failed to show past persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only remaining issue is whether, independent of any presumption arising out of past persecution, the petitioner has shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ and the BIA answered this question in the negative. The record does not allow us to quarrel with that answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to show a well-founded fear of future persecution, a petitioner must satisfy both subjective and objective components. He must \"not only harbor a genuine fear of future persecution, but also must establish an objectively reasonable basis for that fear.\" <i>Laurent,</i> 359 F.3d at 65. Credibility aside, the petitioner's testimony that he fears harm should he return to Indonesia arguably satisfies the subjective component. Thus, we focus the lens of our inquiry on the objective component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An objectively reasonable fear of future persecution exists if a reasonable person in the petitioner's circumstances would fear persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572. In a highly analogous case, this court determined that a petitioner could not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution when her family lived safely in the country of deportation and there was neither record evidence nor significant support in State Department reports for the petitioner's claim of likely future persecution. <i>Zheng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201746\"><a href=\"/opinion/201746/zheng-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2005). Here, as in <i>Zheng,</i> the petitioner's family members (most of whom share his religious affiliation) continue to live peaceably in his native land and there is no probative evidence that the petitioner will be harmed should he return. The Country Conditions Report states that incidents of violence against Christians in Indonesia are in significant decline. To cinch matters, the petitioner's Indonesian church community is rebuilding the destroyed house of worship and continues to hold regular services. While a reasonable person in the petitioner's position might fear encountering some private hostility in a majority Muslim country on account of his Christian Protestant beliefs, the record does not make manifest any objective basis for a fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because the petitioner failed to adduce credible and probative evidence showing either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, the BIA's rejection of his application for relief stands on solid ground. Accordingly, the petition for judicial review is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-296, &#167; 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. &#167; 291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of Homeland Security<i>See Lattab v.

Here, the petitioner has devoted his appellate brief exclusively to his asylum claim and has failed to develop any argument supporting either his claim for withholding of removal or his claim for protection under CAT.
