Myrna Gómez-Pérez (\"Gómez\"),\n\na former window distribution clerk at the United States Postal\n\nService (\"USPS\") in Dorado and Moca, Puerto Rico, sued the USPS and\n\nthe Postmaster General, John Potter, in his official capacity. She\n\nalleged, inter alia, that her supervisors retaliated against her\n\nfor filing an equal opportunity employment complaint with the USPS,\n\nand that this retaliation constituted a violation of the federal-\n\nsector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 633a.      The district court granted summary\n\njudgment for the USPS and Potter on the ground that they were\n\nentitled to sovereign immunity.        Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 2006 WL\n\n488060 (D.P.R. Feb. 28, 2006).\n\n          On appeal, we held that the district court had erred in\n\nfinding sovereign immunity applicable, as Congress has waived\n\nsovereign immunity for the USPS.    Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 476 F.3d\n\n54, 56-57 (1st Cir. 2007).    We affirmed summary judgment for the\n\nUSPS and Potter, however, upon deciding that Congress did not\n\nintend for § 633a to include a cause of action for retaliation for\n\nfiling an age-discrimination complaint.       Id. at 60.   The Supreme\n\nCourt granted certiorari and reversed, holding that Congress did\n\nindeed intend such a cause of action in § 633a, and remanded to us\n\nfor further proceedings.   Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 128 S. Ct. 1931,\n\n1943 (2008).   The Court expressed no disapproval of our holding on\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          In light of the Supreme Court's unequivocal conclusion\n\nthat § 633a includes a cause of action for retaliation, and the\n\ncontinued viability of our holding on sovereign immunity, we vacate\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the USPS\n\nand Potter.   We also vacate Part II(B) of our opinion, 476 F.3d at\n\n57-60, and remand the case to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court and\n\nPart II(A) of our opinion.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
