Gilberto Gierbolini-Ortiz, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Melba N. Rivera Camacho on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Camille L. Velez-Rive,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Dino Trubiano, Assistant Regional\nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            October 7, 2004\n\f      Per Curiam. Claimant William Gonzalez-Rodriguez appeals from\n\nthe judgment of the district court affirming the denial of Social\n\nSecurity    disability    benefits.          He   raises    essentially   three\n\narguments in support of his appeal, and we reject these arguments\n\nfor the following reasons.\n\n      1.   Mental Impairment.         In support of the argument that his\n\nmental impairment is disabling, claimant primarily relies on the\n\nconsultative examination performed by Dr. Rivera.              Claimant argues\n\nthat this evaluation shows debilitating limitations and that these\n\nlimitations have been confirmed in the notes from his treatment at\n\nthe Carolina Mental Health Center. What claimant ignores, however,\n\nis   the   fact   that   both   the    consultative    examination     and    his\n\ntreatment occurred after his insured status had expired.                     As a\n\nresult, these sources are of limited value in determining the\n\nextent of claimant's mental impairment prior to the expiration of\n\nthis status.      See Evangelista v. Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices, 826 F.2d 136, 140 n.3 (1st Cir. 1987) (the issue is\n\nwhether or not the claimant is incapacitated as of the date his\n\ninsured status expires).\n\n      Further, during the period of time when claimant was insured,\n\nthe only evidence of a mental impairment is the intake evaluation\n\nconducted at the mental health center in December 1997.                      This\n\nevaluation indicates that claimant, in the relevant time frame, was\n\nsuffering from only a mild mental condition.               Claimant responds to\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthis evidence by arguing that the administrative law judge (ALJ)\n\nwas interpreting raw medical data in deciding to credit the Global\n\nAssessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 66.               However, the GAF\n\nrating system (and the explanation provided by DSM IV concerning\n\nhow the system works) simply is not raw medical data; rather, the\n\nsystem provides a way for a mental health professional to turn raw\n\nmedical     signs    and     symptoms   into      a    general   assessment,\n\nunderstandable      by   a   lay   person,   of   an   individual's      mental\n\nfunctioning.     See Howard v. Commissioner of Social Security, 276\n\nF.3d 235, 241 (6th Cir. 2002) (noting that a GAF score may be of\n\n\"considerable help\" to an ALJ in formulating a claimant's mental\n\nRFC).\n\n     The fact that claimant did not receive any treatment for his\n\nmental impairment during his insured status is evidence that this\n\nimpairment was not bothersome enough to require treatment.                  See\n\nIrlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955 F.2d\n\n765, 769 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (gaps in the medical record\n\nare evidence that a claimant's complaints are not as severe as\n\nalleged).    And, although the ALJ accepted for the sake of argument\n\nthat claimant did have the limitations found by the non-examining\n\nclinical    psychologist,      the   ALJ's   ultimate     finding   --     that\n\n\"[m]entally, the claimant was able to perform unskilled work tasks\n\nwithout significant limitations\" -- was supported by substantial\n\nevidence.     That is, the ALJ was not required to conclude that\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fclaimant's mental condition imposed any significant limitations on\n\nhim during the relevant time.\n\n       2.   The Vocational Expert's Testimony.           As pointed out by\n\nclaimant, the response of the vocational expert (VE) to the ALJ's\n\nsecond hypothetical containing the mental limitations imposed by\n\nthe non-examining clinical psychologist is not clear.               However,\n\neven assuming that claimant's interpretation of the VE's answer is\n\ncorrect, this does not help claimant, since the ALJ made the\n\nsustainable    finding    that   claimant's    anxiety   disorder   did   not\n\nsignificantly limit his ability to perform simple tasks. Thus, the\n\nfirst hypothetical posed by the ALJ -- which did not contain any\n\nmental restrictions -- has substantial support in the record, and,\n\nin response to this hypothetical, the VE listed jobs that claimant\n\ncould perform.\n\n       Claimant's only other objection to the ALJ's hypothetical is\n\nthat the ALJ did not include as a limitation Dr. Cruz's opinion\n\nthat   claimant   could    not   drive.       Claimant   argues   that    this\n\nlimitation would prevent him from working as a messenger or porter\n\nbecause such work involves driving.           Claimant, however, cites no\n\nsupport for this argument, and, in any event, claimant does not\n\ncontend that his inability to drive would prevent him from working\n\nas a clerk, the third job mentioned by the VE.\n\n       3. Complaints of Pain. Claimant's primary complaints of pain\n\nconcern his chest and back.       As for the extent of the chest pain,\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fclaimant contends that it is disabling because any exertion brings\n\non the pain, and due to the pain, he cannot lift even a gallon of\n\nmilk.    The findings of claimant's treating physician, Dr. Cruz, do\n\nnot support such limitations. In particular, Dr. Cruz opined that,\n\ndespite the heart condition and the associated chest pain, claimant\n\noccasionally could lift up to ten pounds and could walk for four\n\nhours per day.       Further, the non-examining cardiologist did not\n\neven think that claimant's heart condition was severe.\n\n        In relation to his back condition, claimant argues that the\n\nfinding of a herniated disc at L5-S1 supports his allegations of\n\ndisabling back pain.        While such a condition obviously can be\n\nexpected to produce pain, evidence of treatment for this pain is\n\nsparse.     Claimant apparently was seen for his back only once in\n\n1995 (when an electromyographic study of his lower extremities was\n\nnormal) and once in 1996.        And, aside from the February 1997 C-T\n\nscan showing the herniated disc, claimant was seen only twice in\n\n1997. This is evidence that claimant's back pain was not as severe\n\nas alleged.       See Irlanda Ortiz, 955 F.2d at 769.\n\n     Further, claimant gave conflicting accounts of how his pain\n\naffected    his    exertional   abilities.   In   March   1998,   claimant\n\ncompleted a report of daily activities, in which he indicated that\n\nhe required help with his personal needs and that he could not\n\nperform any household chores.       Yet, when he was being interviewed\n\nby Dr. Rivera, in April 1998, claimant reported that he could take\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcare of his personal needs and could do some household chores such\n\nas dishwashing and mopping.        Finally, we note that the ALJ did\n\ncredit claimant's complaints of pain to a large degree by accepting\n\nthe   limitations   imposed   by   Dr.   Cruz   and   by   including    these\n\nrestrictions   in   the   hypotheticals   presented    to   the   VE.     For\n\nexample, the ALJ cited, as a limitation, claimant's inability to\n\nbend, and this was one of claimant's primary complaints. The ALJ's\n\nconclusion that claimant's complaints of disabling pain were not\n\nentirely credible thus has substantial support in the record.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f",
