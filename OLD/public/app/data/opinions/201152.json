This is an interlocutory appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of pro se plaintiff's motion to enjoin\n\ndefendant lender's foreclosure sale of plaintiff's home.     Because\n\nthe sale has now occurred, plaintiff's request to enjoin the sale\n\nhas become moot, and she has failed to demonstrate the requisite\n\nthreat of immediate harm or the likelihood of success on the merits\n\nto warrant any other preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n          As we recently reiterated, where \"[t]he posture of the\n\ncase has changed in significant ways since the plaintiff initially\n\nmade her motion for a preliminary injunction,\" the justiciability\n\nof an interlocutory appeal from the denial of that motion \"is\n\ncalled into question.\"   Matos v.

And, where, as\n\nhere, the event that plaintiff sought to enjoin--the January 2004\n\nforeclosure sale--has already occurred, \"this court lacks the power\n\nto turn back the clock and, accordingly, . . . the appeal is moot.\"\n\nMatos, 367 F.3d at 72.\n\n          Although plaintiff's motion also sought to enjoin any\n\nfuture foreclosure sale, there is no evidence that any future sale\n\nhas been or will be scheduled before the trial, which is scheduled\n\nto occur this fall.   In the absence of a real threat of immediate\n\nand irreparable harm, the district court appropriately declined to\n\nissue a preliminary injunction.

Also, to the extent that plaintiff's\n\npresent motion for preliminary injunctive relief was based on the\n\nsame grounds as her earlier one, there is little likelihood that\n\nplaintiff will succeed on those grounds for the reasons stated by\n\nthe magistrate judge in his Report and Recommendation that the\n\nearlier motion be denied.\n\n           The   district     court   also    properly   denied   plaintiff's\n\nrequest   for    injunctive     relief      against   defendant's    counsel,\n\nprohibiting them \"from conducting any foreclosure auctions within\n\nthe   court's    borders\"   until     various   actions   are     taken.
