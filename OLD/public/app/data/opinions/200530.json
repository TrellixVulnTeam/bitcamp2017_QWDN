The district court\n\nadopted   the   magistrate   judge's   report   and   recommendation   and\n\ndismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing.              After\n\ncareful review, we affirm.\n\n                               I.    Facts\n\nA.   Cerro Maravilla\n\n           We recount only the basic facts of the infamous events at\n\nCerro Maravilla.       A more detailed account can be found in the\n\nmajority and minority opinions of United States v. Moreno Morales,\n\n815 F.2d 725 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 966 (1987).\n\n                  On July 25, 1978, Arnaldo Darío Rosado\n           and Carlos Soto Arriví were shot and killed by\n           police on a mountain site in Puerto Rico known\n           as Cerro Maravilla. The two men, both of whom\n           were members of the Puerto Rico independence\n           movement (independentistas), had gone to Cerro\n           Maravilla apparently intending to blow up or\n           otherwise sabotage a television tower located\n           on the mountain. The police reported after the\n           event that Rosado and Soto Arriví met their\n           death in a shootout while resisting arrest.\n\nId. at 729.\n\n           The Cerro Maravilla incident became a principal issue in\n\nPuerto Rico politics as conflicting versions of the events emerged,\n\nculminating in a six-month live-televised hearing in front of the\n\nPuerto Rico Senate (\"Senate\") in late 1983.            See id. at 754-55\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f(Torruella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).            The\n\nhearings ended dramatically when four key witnesses, including\n\npolice officers Miguel Cartagena Flores (\"Cartagena\") and José\n\nMontañez Ortiz (\"Montañez\"), were granted immunity and testified\n\nthat Soto Arriví and Rosado had surrendered and were disarmed when\n\nthey were killed by police officers in a second volley of gunfire.\n\nId. at 755.\n\n           As a \"direct result of the evidence adduced\" in the\n\nSenate   hearings,   the   federal   authorities   reopened   a   criminal\n\ninvestigation1 into the events at Cerro Maravilla.        Id.\n\nB.   The Trial: Testimony of Cartagena and Montañez\n\n           Moreno Morales was a police officer present when Soto\n\nArriví and Rosado were killed.         Most officers asserted that the\n\nindependentistas were killed in self-defense during a shoot-out,\n\nbut the Senate hearings yielded a story of execution and cover-up.\n\nWhen questioned by local prosecutors, a federal grand jury, and\n\nattorneys conducting depositions in a civil case, Moreno Morales\n\nclaimed that there was only one volley of shots and that he was not\n\npresent when the independentistas were killed.        He and nine other\n\nofficers were charged with perjury and obstruction of justice and\n\ntried in federal court in February and March, 1985. Key government\n\nevidence at trial included the testimony of Cartagena and Montañez.\n\n\n1\n    There were previous inquiries by local and national law\nenforcement authorities.   All absolved the police officers of\nculpability in the deaths.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fCartagena testified that when he was about to leave the area where\n\nboth independentistas were under arrest (and alive); he heard\n\nshots, looked     back,   and   saw    Moreno   Morales    and   Luis   Reverón\n\nMartínez each holding a weapon and observed each officer's hand\n\nrecoiling.\n\n          Officer Montañez testified that although he was not\n\npresent, Moreno Morales told him that Soto Arriví asked Moreno\n\nMorales to     \"finish    him   up,\"   and   Moreno   Morales    took   another\n\nofficer's weapon and shot the victim.           Montañez also stated that\n\nAntonio Méndez Rivera was with him at the time of the killings.\n\nThis contradicted Méndez Rivera's testimony in which he stated that\n\nhe saw Moreno Morales kill Soto Arriví.\n\n             The jury found Moreno Morales guilty of one count of\n\nconspiring to obstruct justice, give false testimony and suborn\n\nperjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and five substantive\n\ncounts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1621 & 1623.2\n\nMoreno Morales was sentenced to thirty years in prison.             A divided\n\npanel of this Court affirmed his conviction.              Moreno Morales, 815\n\nF.2d at 752.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   Moreno Morales was later found guilty in state court of the\nsecond degree murder of Soto Arriví, and was sentenced to twenty-\ntwo to thirty years in prison, to be served after his federal\nsentence. Puerto Rico v. Pérez Casillas, 92 J.T.S. 171 (1992).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fC.   Post-Trial\n\n            In 1992, Moreno Morales sought post-judgment relief under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255.       The district court denied relief and we\n\naffirmed.    Moreno Morales v. United States, No. 92-1157, 1992 WL\n\n245718, at *1 (1st Cir. Oct. 1, 1992).\n\n            Moreno Morales was denied parole in July, 1995. He filed\n\na petition for writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the Parole\n\nCommission's denial was arbitrary and capricious.       The district\n\ncourt denied relief and, in an unpublished decision, we upheld the\n\nruling.     Moreno Morales v. United States Parole Comm'n, No. 96-\n\n2358, 1998 WL 124718, at *4 (1st Cir. Jan. 20, 1998) (per curiam).\n\nWe noted that at his parole hearing, Moreno Morales \"admitted\n\nshooting Soto Arriví, saying he did so when he 'lost control' after\n\nSoto Arriví shot at him.\"    Id. at *2.\n\n            In December, 1996, the Puerto Rico Senate held another\n\ninvestigation, this time to probe allegedly wrongful conduct during\n\nthe Senate's original investigation of the incident.      During the\n\n1996 hearing, Cartagena testified that he did not in fact know who\n\nkilled the victims at Cerro Maravilla.     He testified that he was\n\npressured into changing his testimony by prosecutors.         Moreno\n\nMorales also testified, admitting that he shot at Soto Arriví,\n\naccepting responsibility for the victim's death, and asking for\n\nforgiveness from the relatives of the victims.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fD.    Evidence Presented for Review\n\n             Moreno Morales presents three categories of evidence to\n\nsupport the instant petition. First, he cites the recent testimony\n\nof Cartagena before the Senate, in which Cartagena admitted that he\n\nlied during trial and claims that he in fact does not know who\n\nkilled the victims at Cerro Maravilla. Cartagena has also recently\n\nstated that before the criminal trial he took fifteen or sixteen\n\npolygraph tests administered by the government, in which he stated\n\nthat he did not know who killed Soto Arriví or Rosado.                     He claims\n\nthat government officials told him he was failing the tests and\n\nsuggested that he would be prosecuted if he did not change his\n\nstory.      In response to this pressure, Cartagena stated that he\n\nchanged his story to say that he saw Moreno Morales shoot one of\n\nthe victims, and the government then told him that he had \"passed\"\n\nthe    polygraph     examination.        Moreno       Morales    claims    that    the\n\ngovernment only disclosed three polygraph examinations of Cartagena\n\nto    the   defense,    and    alleges    that       the   prosecutors     committed\n\nmisconduct by pressuring Cartagena.\n\n             Second,    Moreno    Morales      has    recently    discovered      that\n\nCartagena     gave     three     sworn    statements         during    the       Senate\n\nInvestigation in late 1983 stating that he did not know who killed\n\nthe victims     at     Cerro   Maravilla.        These     documents      were    never\n\ndisclosed to the defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          Finally, recent Senate notes that have been released\n\nreveal that witnesses Cartagena and Montañez told the Senate during\n\nthe 1983 investigation that they did not know who killed the\n\nindependentistas.         The notes show that United States Attorney\n\nDaniel López Romo and Assistant United States Attorney Celestino\n\nMatta were present during the questioning of Montañez and that\n\nCartagena visited López Romo after he was questioned.                None of\n\nthese statements were disclosed to the defense during Moreno\n\nMorales's trial.\n\nE.   Current Petition\n\n           In August, 1998, Moreno Morales sought leave to file a\n\nsecond or successive petition under § 2255, alleging that newly-\n\ndiscovered     evidence    of    witness    recantation   and   prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct     warranted        relief.       Finding     the   circumstances\n\n\"sufficiently unusual so as to 'warrant a fuller exploration by the\n\ndistrict court,'\" we granted the application.             Order of Court, No.\n\n98-8025, Nov. 9, 1998 (citing Rodríguez v. Superintendent, Bay\n\nState Corr. Ctr., 139 F.3d 270, 272-73 (1st Cir. 1998)).                    The\n\ndistrict court then dismissed Moreno Morales's § 2255 petition\n\nwithout   an    evidentiary       hearing    and   subsequently    issued     a\n\ncertificate of appealability.         This appeal followed.\n\n                          II.    Standard of Review\n\n          We review the district court's dismissal of petitioner's\n\n§ 2255 motion de novo.          Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 641\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f(1st Cir. 2002). Because the district court dismissed petitioner's\n\nclaim   without    an   evidentiary        hearing,     we   accept   as    true\n\npetitioner's sworn factual allegations \"unless those allegations\n\nare merely conclusory, contradicted by the record, or inherently\n\nincredible.\"   Id.\n\n                           III.   Discussion\n\n           Evidentiary    hearings    on     §   2255    petitions    are   the\n\nexception, not the norm, and there is a heavy burden on the\n\npetitioner to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is warranted.\n\nUnited States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).                   An\n\nevidentiary hearing \"is not necessary when a [§] 2255 petition (1)\n\nis inadequate on its face, or (2) although facially adequate, is\n\nconclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and\n\nrecords of the case.\"    United States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954\n\n(1st Cir. 1978) (quotation omitted).\n\nA.   Brady Claim\n\n           A defendant's right to due process is violated when the\n\nprosecution suppresses evidence that is both favorable to the\n\naccused and material either to guilt or innocence.                    Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).           Impeachment evidence may make\n\nthe difference between conviction and acquittal and, thus, must be\n\ndisclosed.   Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972).             The\n\naccused does not have a duty to request favorable evidence from the\n\nprosecution.   United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 107 (1976).\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            A petitioner must demonstrate that suppressed evidence is\n\n\"material,\" that is, that \"its suppression undermines confidence in\n\nthe outcome of the trial.\"          United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667,\n\n678 (1985); Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1189 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     \"The question is not whether the defendant would more\n\nlikely    than   not   have   received      a    different    verdict   with   the\n\nevidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,\n\nunderstood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\"\n\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995).                    \"Materiality\" is\n\nassessed collectively, not item by item.                 Id. at 436.\n\n            We assess Moreno Morales's Brady claim to discern whether\n\nhe has shown the three components of a Brady violation: \"the\n\nevidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because\n\nit is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must\n\nhave     been    suppressed    by     the       State,    either   willfully    or\n\ninadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\"                    Strickler v.\n\nGreene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999).\n\n            1.    Statements to the Senate\n\n            Moreno Morales asserts that notes and sworn statements\n\nfrom the 1983 Senate investigation indicating that Montañez and\n\nCartagena did not know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla\n\nshould have been disclosed.\n\n            There is no evidence that federal prosecutors had access\n\nto any of Cartagena's sworn statements or were aware of Cartagena's\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\ftestimony when he denied having knowledge of who fired the fatal\n\nshots at Cerro Maravilla.         Moreno Morales claims that because the\n\nSenate notes indicate that Cartagena was going to meet with a\n\nfederal prosecutor after he was questioned and because other\n\nportions of the notes reveal a close collaboration between the\n\nSenate investigators and federal prosecutors, we should assume that\n\neither Cartagena discussed his Senate testimony and statements with\n\nthe   federal      prosecutor,     or    the   federal    prosecutor    obtained\n\ninformation regarding the witness's statements directly from the\n\nSenate.    From the evidence presented, we cannot make the leaps\n\nnecessary to support either conclusory assumption.              Moreno Morales\n\nhas no evidence suggesting that the prosecutors did in fact meet\n\nwith Cartagena or that Cartagena revealed his testimony to them.\n\n               The government's duty to disclose extends beyond material\n\nin the prosecution's possession. A prosecutor \"has a duty to learn\n\nof any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the\n\ngovernment's behalf in the case, including the police.\" Kyles, 514\n\nU.S. at 437.          However, the Puerto Rico Senate was not acting on\n\nbehalf    of    the    federal   government;    rather,    it   was   conducting\n\nindependent investigations.             While federal prosecutors may have\n\nobserved some of the questioning and may have reopened their\n\ninvestigation as a result of what they learned in the hearings, the\n\nnotes of the Senate hearings were under seal and there is no\n\nevidence that they were turned over to federal prosecutors. \"[T]he\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fgovernment has no duty to produce evidence outside of its control.\"\n\nUnited States v. Hughes, 211 F.3d 676, 688 (1st Cir. 2000).         The\n\nfederal prosecutors did not have access to the Senate's papers and\n\nnotes. Principles of federalism lead us to the same conclusion our\n\nsister circuit has reached -- \"the state's knowledge and possession\n\nof potential impeachment evidence cannot be imputed to a federal\n\nprosecutor for purposes of establishing a Brady violation.\" United\n\nStates v. Beers, 189 F.3d 1297, 1304 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that\n\nfederal prosecutors had no duty to discover and disclose evidence\n\nobtained in an unrelated state investigation).         Therefore, there\n\nwas no duty to disclose Cartagena's statements.\n\n          The   testimony   of   Montañez    is   different.   Assuming\n\npetitioner's allegations are true, federal prosecutors were present\n\nwhen Montañez swore before the Senate that he did not know who\n\nkilled Soto Arriví or Rosado.     This contradicted his testimony at\n\ntrial, and therefore was impeaching evidence that should have been\n\ndisclosed under Brady.      See Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154-55 (finding\n\nduty on part of prosecutor's office to reveal impeaching oral\n\nevidence).    At oral argument, the government asserted that it\n\nturned over all its notes to the defense, notes which would have\n\nincluded the prosecutor's notes from the hearing at which Montañez\n\ntestified. However, the record is devoid of any such disclosure to\n\nthe defense, and we cannot assume that those notes included the\n\nimpeachment   evidence.     We   therefore   accept   Moreno   Morales's\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcontention that he was not aware of Montañez's contradictory\n\ntestimony before the Senate.\n\n          2.   Polygraph Examinations\n\n          Cartagena recently stated that he was given fifteen or\n\nsixteen polygraph examinations by the federal government before the\n\n1985 criminal trial. During every examination, save the final one,\n\nCartagena denied being present when Rosado and Soto Arriví were\n\nkilled or having any knowledge of who was responsible for their\n\ndeaths. Cartagena recently stated that prosecutors threatened that\n\nif he did not testify \"truthfully,\" his immunity from federal\n\nprosecution would be withdrawn and his family might be in danger.\n\nHe states that when he changed his story and admitted being present\n\nat the scene and inculpated two officers, he suddenly\n\n\"passed\" the polygraph examination.\n\n          There   were   several   motions   regarding   polygraph\n\nexaminations during the proceedings up to and including trial; the\n\nend result was that the government was ordered to provide to the\n\ndefense results of all polygraph examinations.      The government\n\ndisclosed three examinations given to Cartagena -- in two he denied\n\nseeing the killings and in the third he inculpated Moreno Morales.\n\n          We dismiss the government's invitation to simply accept\n\nits word that because only three polygraph examinations were\n\ndisclosed, no more than three could have been administered. Nor is\n\nit inherently incredible that the government could have suppressed\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fseveral polygraph examinations in this high-profile case; whether\n\nby accidental neglect or malevolent cover-up, such Brady violations\n\ndo occur in criminal cases.                Moreno Morales has presented evidence\n\ncontradicting         the     government's      statements,        and    we    assume   his\n\nallegations are true for purposes of this case, although there is\n\nno   evidence         that    the    government       intentionally        withheld      the\n\nevidence. Accepting these allegations as true, see Ellis, 313 F.3d\n\nat 641, the government withheld as many as thirteen polygraph\n\nexaminations that could have been used to impeach Cartagena at\n\ntrial.    Assuming that it existed, that evidence should have been\n\ndisclosed to the defense.\n\n               3.     Brady Analysis\n\n               Even    if     we    assume    petitioner's      assertions        that   the\n\ntestimony       of     Montañez       and     the    results    of       many    polygraph\n\nexaminations given to Cartagena were withheld from the defense, we\n\nfind    that    the     absence       of     this    evidence   does      not    undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome of the trial and is therefore not\n\nmaterial under Brady.              See Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678.           At the time of\n\ntrial, the defense had numerous other examples of contradictory\n\nstatements made by both witnesses, including statements made under\n\noath.    Montañez was questioned about the inconsistencies in his\n\ntestimonies,          while    the     defense       chose   not     to    cross-examine\n\nCartagena.      The evidence uncovered after the trial would have been\n\nmerely cumulative, and \"the unavailability of cumulative evidence\n\n\n                                              -13-\n\fdoes not deprive the defendant of due process.\"                   United States v.\n\nSánchez, 917 F.3d 607, 618 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Zeigler v.\n\nCallahan, 659 F.2d 254, 266 (1st Cir. 1981) (noting that cumulative\n\nevidence is not usually material if defense had opportunity to\n\nimpeach the witness by other means).\n\n             We    acknowledge    the   impeaching        power   of    a   witness's\n\nevolving story.        See Kyles, 514 U.S. at 444 (\"[T]he evolution over\n\ntime of a given eyewitness's description can be fatal to its\n\nreliability.\").          Here,   however,      the    evolution    of   Cartagena's\n\ntestimony was revealed to the defense in Cartagena's conflicting\n\nstatements to grand juries.           At the first grand jury proceeding in\n\n1980    he   denied     seeing   or   hearing        anything.     At   the    second\n\nproceeding in 1983 he admitted hearing the second volley of shots.\n\nHe later returned to reveal to the grand jury that he also saw\n\nMoreno Morales's hand recoil immediately after the second volley of\n\nshots were fired.        This largely mirrors the evolution of his story\n\nin the polygraph examinations that were disclosed.                      The defense\n\nthus had ample evidence of a witness's story changing over time,\n\nbut chose not to utilize it.\n\nB.     Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n             Moreno Morales claims that the prosecutors committed\n\nmisconduct        in   shaping   Cartagena's         testimony    by    threatening\n\nprosecution or harm to his family.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f           Section 2255 provides for post-conviction relief only\n\nwhen the petitioner has demonstrated that his sentence \"(1) was\n\nimposed in violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a\n\ncourt that lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory\n\nmaximum, or (4) was otherwise subject to collateral attack.\" David\n\nv. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998).                This final\n\ncategory   includes     \"only     assignments      of   error   that     reveal\n\nfundamental   defects    which,    if   uncorrected,     will   result      in   a\n\ncomplete   miscarriage    of    justice,     or    irregularities    that    are\n\ninconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"                Id.\n\n(quotation omitted). Prosecutorial misconduct is only a ground for\n\n§ 2255 relief if it violates petitioner's due process rights, see\n\nHill v. Brigano, 199 F.3d 833, 847 (6th Cir. 1999), that is, if the\n\nconduct \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the\n\nresulting conviction     a     denial   of   due   process.\"    Donnelly v.\n\nDeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643 (1974).\n\n           It is true that due process is offended when a prosecutor\n\nknowingly suborns perjury to obtain a conviction.                   Mooney v.\n\nHolohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935). However, Moreno Morales has not\n\ndemonstrated that the government knowingly used perjured testimony\n\nto convict him.   Cartagena revealed more details each time he was\n\ninterviewed; he stated that he was not originally forthcoming\n\nbecause his brother-in-law was one of the officers implicated by\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fhis testimony.     The government could have believed that his trial\n\ntestimony was truthful and complete.\n\n            At any rate, we find that, regardless of any misconduct\n\nin this case, Moreno Morales's due process rights were not offended\n\nby his conviction.      There was ample evidence besides Cartagena's\n\ntestimony to support Moreno Morales's conviction, including two\n\nother witnesses who stated that Moreno Morales shot Soto Arriví.\n\nCoupled   with    Moreno   Morales's   confession,   we   find   that   any\n\nmisconduct by the prosecutors did not deprive Moreno Morales of a\n\nfair trial.      See United States v. González-González, 258 F.3d 16,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nC.   Newly Discovered Evidence\n\n            Cartagena's statements to the Senate denying knowledge of\n\nwho killed Soto Arriví and Rosado, while not Brady evidence, do\n\nconstitute newly discovered evidence.          In addition, Cartagena\n\nrecently recanted part of his trial testimony: during the 1996\n\nSenate hearings, he stated that he did not see who shot the\n\nindependentistas.      Moreno Morales seeks a new trial based on this\n\nevidence.     We note that this was the same hearing at which Moreno\n\nMorales admitted to shooting Soto Arriví.\n\n            We need not decide whether newly discovered evidence is\n\na cognizable ground for obtaining a new trial in proceedings under\n\n§ 2255.     See Barrett, 965 F.2d at 1194; see also Cruz-Sánchez v.\n\nRivera-Cordero, 835 F.2d 947, 948 (1st Cir. 1987) (comparing\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fcases).      We have stated that \"[a]t a minimum, petitioner would be\n\nrequired to meet the conventional criteria for obtaining a new\n\ntrial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\"                             Barrett, 965\n\nF.2d    at   1194.        That   would   require       petitioner         to    prove     four\n\nelements:     \"(1)    the    newly     discovered          evidence      was    unknown    or\n\nunavailable at the time of trial; (2) the defendant was duly\n\ndiligent in trying to discover it; (3) the evidence was material;\n\nand (4) the evidence was such that it would probably result in an\n\nacquittal upon retrial.\"             Awon v. United States, 308 F.3d 133, 140\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n             Regardless         of   whether    he    can     show    the      first    three\n\nelements, Moreno Morales has failed to show that the new evidence\n\nwould    result      in   his    acquittal.          The    new    evidence       revealing\n\nCartagena's account of the events at Cerro Maravilla largely\n\nmatches an account given soon after the incident (an account that\n\nwas disclosed to the defense).               Moreover, the new evidence Moreno\n\nMorales seeks to introduce emerged at the same time as additional\n\nnew evidence -- the fact that Moreno Morales was responsible for\n\ncausing Soto Arriví's death. Moreno Morales was charged with lying\n\nwhen he disavowed knowledge of the events at Cerro Maravilla.                               He\n\nnow admits not only to knowing what took place, but to killing one\n\nof     the   independentistas.           A     new    trial       that    considers        the\n\nrecantation       would     also     consider    the       confession,         and   in    all\n\nlikelihood Moreno Morales would again be found guilty of perjury\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fand obstruction of justice.3           Given Moreno Morales's confession at\n\nthe hearings, it is difficult to challenge the outcome of his\n\ntrial.\n\n                                 IV.   Conclusion\n\n            Because Moreno Morales's § 2255 petition is \"inadequate\n\non   its   face,\"   there   is    no   need    for   an   evidentiary   hearing.\n\nDiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954. We affirm the district court's dismissal\n\nof his petition.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    At oral argument, Moreno Morales's counsel admitted                    that\npetitioner would likely have to plead guilty at retrial.\n\n                                        -18-\n\f",

The two men, both of whom were members of the Puerto Rico independence movement (<i>independentistas</i>), had gone to Cerro Maravilla apparently intending to blow up or otherwise sabotage a television tower located on the mountain. The police reported after the event that Rosado and Soto Arriv&#237; met their death in a shootout while resisting arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 729.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cerro Maravilla incident became a principal issue in Puerto Rico politics as conflicting versions of the events emerged, culminating in a six-month live-televised hearing in front of the Puerto Rico Senate (\"Senate\") in late 1983. <i>See id.</i> at 754-55 (Torruella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The hearings ended dramatically when four key witnesses, including police officers Miguel Cartagena Flores (\"Cartagena\") and Jos&#233; Monta&#241;ez Ortiz (\"Monta&#241;ez\"), were granted immunity and testified that Soto Arriv&#237; and Rosado had surrendered and were disarmed when they were killed by police officers in a second volley of gunfire. <i>Id.</i> at 755.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a \"direct result of the evidence adduced\" in the Senate hearings, the federal authorities reopened a criminal investigation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> into the events at Cerro Maravilla. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Most officers asserted that the <i>independentistas</i> were killed in self-defense during a shoot-out, but the Senate hearings yielded a story of execution and cover-up. When questioned by local prosecutors, a federal grand jury, and attorneys conducting depositions in a civil case, Moreno Morales claimed that there was only one volley of shots and that he was not present when the <i>independentistas</i> were killed. He and nine other officers were charged with perjury and obstruction of justice and tried in federal court in February and March, 1985. Key government evidence at trial included the testimony of Cartagena and Monta&#241;ez. Cartagena testified that when he was about to leave the area where both <i>independentistas</i> were under arrest (and alive); he heard shots, looked back, and saw Moreno Morales and Luis Rever&#243;n Mart&#237;nez each holding a weapon and observed each officer's hand recoiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Monta&#241;ez testified that although he was not present, Moreno Morales told him that Soto Arriv&#237; asked Moreno Morales to \"finish him up,\" and Moreno Morales took another officer's weapon and shot the victim. Monta&#241;ez also stated that Antonio M&#233;ndez Rivera was with him at the time of the killings. This contradicted M&#233;ndez Rivera's testimony in which he stated that he saw Moreno Morales kill Soto Arriv&#237;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found Moreno Morales guilty of one count of conspiring to obstruct justice, give false testimony and suborn perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and five substantive counts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1621 &amp; 1623.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Moreno Morales was sentenced to thirty years in prison.

He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the Parole Commission's denial was arbitrary and capricious.

Jan. 20, 1998) (per curiam). We noted that at his parole hearing, Moreno Morales \"admitted shooting Soto Arriv&#237;, saying he did so when he `lost control' after Soto Arriv&#237; shot at him.\" <i>Id.</i> at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December, 1996, the Puerto Rico Senate held another investigation, this time to probe allegedly wrongful conduct during the Senate's original investigation of the incident. During the 1996 hearing, Cartagena testified that he did not in fact know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla. He testified that he was pressured into changing his testimony by prosecutors. Moreno Morales also testified, admitting that he shot at Soto Arriv&#237;, accepting responsibility for the victim's death, and asking for forgiveness from the relatives of the victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Evidence Presented for Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno Morales presents three categories of evidence to support the instant petition. First, he cites the recent testimony of Cartagena before the Senate, in which Cartagena admitted that he lied during trial and claims that he in fact does not know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla. Cartagena has also recently stated that before the criminal trial he took fifteen or sixteen polygraph tests administered by the government, in which he stated that he did not know who killed Soto Arriv&#237; or Rosado. He claims that government officials told him he was failing the tests and suggested that he would be prosecuted if he did not change his story. In response to this pressure, Cartagena stated that he changed his story to say that he saw Moreno Morales shoot one of the victims, and the government then told him that he had \"passed\" the polygraph examination. Moreno Morales claims that the government only disclosed three polygraph examinations of Cartagena to the defense, and alleges that the prosecutors committed misconduct by pressuring Cartagena.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Moreno Morales has recently discovered that Cartagena gave three sworn statements during the Senate Investigation in late 1983 stating that he did not know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla. These documents were never disclosed to the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, recent Senate notes that have been released reveal that witnesses Cartagena and Monta&#241;ez told the Senate during the 1983 investigation that they did not know who killed the <i>independentistas.</i> The notes show that United States Attorney Daniel L&#243;pez Romo and Assistant United States Attorney Celestino Matta were present during the questioning of Monta&#241;ez and that Cartagena visited L&#243;pez Romo after he was questioned. None of these statements were disclosed to the defense during Moreno Morales's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Current Petition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August, 1998, Moreno Morales sought leave to file a second or successive petition under &#167; 2255, alleging that newly-discovered evidence of witness recantation and prosecutorial misconduct warranted relief. Finding the circumstances \"sufficiently unusual so as to `warrant a fuller exploration by the district court,'\" we granted the application. Order of Court, No. 98-8025, Nov. 9, 1998 (citing <i>Rodriguez v. Superintendent, Bay State Corr. Ctr.,</i> 139 F.3d 270, 272-73 (1st Cir.1998)). The district court then dismissed Moreno Morales's &#167; 2255 petition without an evidentiary hearing and subsequently issued a certificate of appealability. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's dismissal of petitioner's &#167; 2255 motion de novo. <i>Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 641 (1st Cir.2002). Because the district court dismissed petitioner's claim without an evidentiary hearing, we accept as true petitioner's sworn factual allegations \"unless those allegations are merely conclusory, contradicted by the record, or inherently incredible.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

McGill,</i> 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1993). An evidentiary hearing \"is not necessary when a [&#167;] 2255 petition (1) is inadequate on its face, or (2) although facially adequate, is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records of the case.\" <i>United States v.

Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). \"Materiality\" is assessed collectively, not item by item. <i>Id.</i> at 436, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assess Moreno Morales's <i>Brady</i> claim to discern whether he has shown the three components of a <i>Brady</i> violation: \"the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 281-82, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>1.

Moreno Morales claims that because the Senate notes indicate that Cartagena was going to meet with a federal prosecutor after he was questioned and because other portions of the notes reveal a close collaboration between the Senate investigators and federal prosecutors, we should assume that either Cartagena discussed his Senate testimony and statements with the federal prosecutor, or the federal prosecutor obtained information regarding the witness's statements directly from the Senate. From the evidence presented, we cannot make the leaps necessary to support either conclusory assumption. Moreno Morales has no evidence suggesting that the prosecutors did in fact meet with Cartagena or that Cartagena revealed his testimony to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's duty to disclose extends beyond material in the prosecution's possession. A prosecutor \"has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555. However, the Puerto Rico Senate was not acting on behalf of the federal government; rather, it was conducting independent investigations. While federal prosecutors may have observed some of the questioning and may have reopened their investigation as a result of what they learned in the hearings, the notes of the Senate hearings were under seal and there is no evidence that they were turned over to federal prosecutors. \"[T]he government has no duty to produce evidence outside of its control.\" <i>United States v. Hughes,</i> 211 F.3d 676, 688 (1st Cir.2000). The federal prosecutors did not have access to the Senate's papers and notes. Principles of federalism lead us to the same conclusion our sister circuit has reached &#8212; \"the state's knowledge and possession of potential impeachment evidence cannot be imputed to a federal prosecutor for purposes of establishing a <i>Brady</i> violation.\" <i>United States v. Beers,</i> 189 F.3d 1297, 1304 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that federal prosecutors had no duty to discover and disclose evidence obtained in an unrelated state investigation). Therefore, there was no duty to disclose Cartagena's statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony of Monta&#241;ez is different. Assuming petitioner's allegations are true, federal prosecutors were present when Monta&#241;ez swore before the Senate that he did not know who killed Soto Arriv&#237; or Rosado. This contradicted his testimony at trial, and therefore was impeaching evidence that should have been disclosed under <i>Brady. See Giglio,</i> 405 U.S. at 154-55, 92 S.Ct. 763 (finding duty on part of prosecutor's office to reveal impeaching oral evidence). At oral argument, the government asserted that it turned over all its notes to the defense, notes which would have included the prosecutor's notes from the hearing at which Monta&#241;ez testified. However, the record is devoid of any such disclosure to the defense, and we cannot assume that those notes included the impeachment evidence. We therefore accept Moreno Morales's contention that he was not aware of Monta&#241;ez's contradictory testimony before the Senate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Polygraph Examinations</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena recently stated that he was given fifteen or sixteen polygraph examinations by the federal government before the 1985 criminal trial. During every examination, save the final one, Cartagena denied being present when Rosado and Soto Arriv&#237; were killed or having any knowledge of who was responsible for their deaths. Cartagena recently stated that prosecutors threatened that if he did not testify \"truthfully,\" his immunity from federal prosecution would be withdrawn and his family might be in danger. He states that when he changed his story and admitted being present at the scene and inculpated two officers, he suddenly \"passed\" the polygraph examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were several motions regarding polygraph examinations during the proceedings up to and including trial; the end result was that the government was ordered to provide to the defense results of all polygraph examinations. The government disclosed three examinations given to Cartagena &#8212; in two he denied seeing the killings and in the third he inculpated Moreno Morales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We dismiss the government's invitation to simply accept its word that because only three polygraph examinations were disclosed, no more than three could have been administered. Nor is it inherently incredible that the government could have suppressed several polygraph examinations in this high-profile case; whether by accidental neglect or malevolent cover-up, such <i>Brady</i> violations do occur in criminal cases. Moreno Morales has presented evidence contradicting the government's statements, and we assume his allegations are true for purposes of this case, although there is no evidence that the government intentionally withheld the evidence. Accepting these allegations as true, <i>see Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 641, the government withheld as many as thirteen polygraph examinations that could have been used to impeach Cartagena at trial. Assuming that it existed, that evidence should have been disclosed to the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3. Brady Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume petitioner's assertions that the testimony of Monta&#241;ez and the results of many polygraph examinations given to Cartagena were withheld from the defense, we find that the absence of this evidence does not undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial and is therefore not material under <i>Brady. See Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375. At the time of trial, the defense had numerous other examples of contradictory statements made by both witnesses, including statements made under oath. Monta&#241;ez was questioned about the inconsistencies in his testimonies, while the defense chose not to cross-examine Cartagena. The evidence uncovered after the trial would have been merely cumulative, and \"the unavailability of cumulative evidence does not deprive the defendant of due process.\" <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 917 F.2d 607, 618 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also Zeigler v. Callahan,</i> 659 F.2d 254, 266 (1st Cir.1981) (noting that cumulative evidence is not usually material if defense had opportunity to impeach the witness by other means).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge the impeaching power of a witness's evolving story. <i>See Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 444, 115 S.Ct. 1555 (\"[T]he evolution over time of a given eyewitness's description can be fatal to its reliability.\"). Here, however, the evolution of Cartagena's testimony was revealed to the defense in Cartagena's conflicting statements to grand juries. At the first grand jury proceeding in 1980 he denied seeing or hearing anything. At the second proceeding in 1983 he admitted hearing the second volley of shots. He later returned to reveal to the grand jury that he also saw Moreno Morales's hand recoil immediately after the second volley of shots were fired. This largely mirrors the evolution of his story in the polygraph examinations that were disclosed. The defense thus had ample evidence of a witness's story changing over time, but chose not to utilize it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno Morales claims that the prosecutors committed misconduct in shaping Cartagena's testimony by threatening prosecution or harm to his family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2255 provides for post-conviction relief only when the petitioner has demonstrated that his sentence \"(1) was imposed in violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a court that lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) was otherwise subject to collateral attack.\" <i>David v. United States,</i> 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir.1998). This final category includes \"only assignments of error that reveal fundamental defects which, if uncorrected, will result in a complete miscarriage of justice, or irregularities that are inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation omitted). Prosecutorial misconduct is only a ground for &#167; 2255 relief if it violates petitioner's due process rights, <i>see Hill v. Brigano,</i> 199 F.3d 833, 847 (6th Cir.1999), that is, if the conduct \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\" <i>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,</i> 416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that due process is offended when a prosecutor knowingly suborns perjury to obtain a conviction. <i>Mooney v. Holohan,</i> 294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935). However, Moreno Morales has not demonstrated that the government knowingly used perjured testimony to convict him. Cartagena revealed more details each time he was interviewed; he stated that he was not originally forthcoming because his brother-in-law was one of the officers implicated by his testimony. The government could have believed that his trial testimony was truthful and complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, we find that, regardless of any misconduct in this case, Moreno Morales's due process rights were not offended by his conviction. There was ample evidence besides Cartagena's testimony to support Moreno Morales's conviction, including two other witnesses who stated that Moreno Morales shot Soto Arriv&#237;. Coupled with Moreno Morales's confession, we find that any misconduct by the prosecutors did not deprive Moreno Morales of a fair trial. <i>See United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez,</i> 258 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena's statements to the Senate denying knowledge of who killed Soto Arriv&#237; and Rosado, while not <i>Brady</i> evidence, do constitute newly discovered evidence. In addition, Cartagena recently recanted part of his trial testimony: during the 1996 Senate hearings, he stated that he did not see who shot the <i>independentistas.</i> Moreno Morales seeks a new trial based on this evidence. We note that this was the same hearing at which Moreno Morales admitted to shooting Soto Arriv&#237;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether newly discovered evidence is a cognizable ground for obtaining a new trial in proceedings under &#167; 2255. <i>See Barrett,</i> 965 F.2d at 1194; <i>see also Cruz-Sanchez v. Rivera-Cordero,</i> 835 F.2d 947, 948 (1st Cir.1987) (comparing cases). We have stated that \"[a]t a minimum, petitioner would be required to meet the conventional criteria for obtaining a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\" <i>Barrett,</i> 965 F.2d at 1194. That would require petitioner to prove four elements: \"(1) the newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of trial; (2) the defendant was duly diligent in trying to discover it; (3) the evidence was material; and (4) the evidence was such that it would probably result in an acquittal upon retrial.\" <i>Awon v. United States,</i> 308 F.3d 133, 140 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether he can show the first three elements, Moreno Morales has failed to show that the new evidence would result in his acquittal. The new evidence revealing Cartagena's account of the events at Cerro Maravilla largely matches an account given soon after the incident (an account that was disclosed to the defense). Moreover, the new evidence Moreno Morales seeks to introduce emerged at the same time as additional new evidence &#8212; the fact that Moreno Morales was responsible for causing Soto Arriv&#237;'s death. Moreno Morales was charged with lying when he disavowed knowledge of the events at Cerro Maravilla. He now admits not only to knowing what took place, but to killing one of the <i>independentistas.</i> A new trial that considers the recantation would also consider the confession, and in all likelihood Moreno Morales would again be found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Given Moreno Morales's confession at the hearings, it is difficult to challenge the outcome of his trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

The two men, both of whom were members of the Puerto Rico independence movement (<i>independentistas</i>), had gone to Cerro Maravilla apparently intending to blow up or otherwise sabotage a television tower located on the mountain. The police reported after the event that Rosado and Soto Arriv&#237; met their death in a shootout while resisting arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 729.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cerro Maravilla incident became a principal issue in Puerto Rico politics as conflicting versions of the events emerged, culminating in a six-month live-televised hearing in front of the Puerto Rico Senate (\"Senate\") in late 1983. <i>See id.</i> at 754-55 (Torruella, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Most officers asserted that the <i>independentistas</i> were killed in self-defense during a shoot-out, but the Senate hearings yielded a story of execution and cover-up. When questioned by local prosecutors, a federal grand jury, and attorneys conducting depositions in a civil case, Moreno Morales claimed that there was only one volley of shots and that he was not present when the <i>independentistas</i> were killed. He and nine other officers were charged with perjury and obstruction of justice and tried in federal court in February and March, 1985. Key government evidence at trial included the testimony of Cartagena and Monta&#241;ez. Cartagena testified that when he was about to leave the area where both <i>independentistas</i> were under arrest (and alive); he heard shots, looked back, and saw Moreno Morales and Luis Rever&#243;n Mart&#237;nez each holding a weapon and observed each officer's hand recoiling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Monta&#241;ez testified that although he was not present, Moreno Morales told him that Soto Arriv&#237; asked Moreno Morales to \"finish him up,\" and Moreno Morales took another officer's weapon and shot the victim. Monta&#241;ez also stated that Antonio M&#233;ndez Rivera was with him at the time of the killings.

During the 1996 hearing, Cartagena testified that he did not in fact know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla. He testified that he was pressured into changing his testimony by prosecutors. Moreno Morales also testified, admitting that he shot at Soto Arriv&#237;, accepting responsibility for the victim's death, and asking for forgiveness from the relatives of the victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Evidence Presented for Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno Morales presents three categories of evidence to support the instant petition. First, he cites the recent testimony of Cartagena before the Senate, in which Cartagena admitted that he lied during trial and claims that he in fact does not know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla. Cartagena has also recently stated that before the criminal trial he took fifteen or sixteen polygraph tests administered by the government, in which he stated that he did not know who killed Soto Arriv&#237; or Rosado. He claims that government officials told him he was failing the tests and suggested that he would be prosecuted if he did not change his story. In response to this pressure, Cartagena stated that he changed his story to say that he saw Moreno Morales shoot one of the victims, and the government then told him that he had \"passed\" the polygraph examination. Moreno Morales claims that the government only disclosed three polygraph examinations of Cartagena to the defense, and alleges that the prosecutors committed misconduct by pressuring Cartagena.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Moreno Morales has recently discovered that Cartagena gave three sworn statements during the Senate Investigation in late 1983 stating that he did not know who killed the victims at Cerro Maravilla. These documents were never disclosed to the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, recent Senate notes that have been released reveal that witnesses Cartagena and Monta&#241;ez told the Senate during the 1983 investigation that they did not know who killed the <i>independentistas.</i> The notes show that United States Attorney Daniel L&#243;pez Romo and Assistant United States Attorney Celestino Matta were present during the questioning of Monta&#241;ez and that Cartagena visited L&#243;pez Romo after he was questioned. None of these statements were disclosed to the defense during Moreno Morales's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.

Moreno Morales claims that because the Senate notes indicate that Cartagena was going to meet with a federal prosecutor after he was questioned and because other portions of the notes reveal a close collaboration between the Senate investigators and federal prosecutors, we should assume that either Cartagena discussed his Senate testimony and statements with the federal prosecutor, or the federal prosecutor obtained information regarding the witness's statements directly from the Senate. From the evidence presented, we cannot make the leaps necessary to support either conclusory assumption. Moreno Morales has no evidence suggesting that the prosecutors did in fact meet with Cartagena or that Cartagena revealed his testimony to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's duty to disclose extends beyond material in the prosecution's possession. A prosecutor \"has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police.\" <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span>. However, the Puerto Rico Senate was not acting on behalf of the federal government; rather, it was conducting independent investigations. While federal prosecutors may have observed some of the questioning and may have reopened their investigation as a result of what they learned in the hearings, the notes of the Senate hearings were under seal and there is no evidence that they were turned over to federal prosecutors. \"[T]he government has no duty to produce evidence outside of its control.\" <i>United States v.

The federal prosecutors did not have access to the Senate's papers and notes. Principles of federalism lead us to the same conclusion our sister circuit has reached &#8212; \"the state's knowledge and possession of potential impeachment evidence cannot be imputed to a federal prosecutor for purposes of establishing a <i>Brady</i> violation.\" <i>United States v.

Therefore, there was no duty to disclose Cartagena's statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony of Monta&#241;ez is different. Assuming petitioner's allegations are true, federal prosecutors were present when Monta&#241;ez swore before the Senate that he did not know who killed Soto Arriv&#237; or Rosado. This contradicted his testimony at trial, and therefore was impeaching evidence that should have been disclosed under <i>Brady. See Giglio,</i> 405 U.S. at 154-55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108471\"><a href=\"/opinion/108471/giglio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span> (finding duty on part of prosecutor's office to reveal impeaching oral evidence). At oral argument, the government asserted that it turned over all its notes to the defense, notes which would have included the prosecutor's notes from the hearing at which Monta&#241;ez testified. However, the record is devoid of any such disclosure to the defense, and we cannot assume that those notes included the impeachment evidence. We therefore accept Moreno Morales's contention that he was not aware of Monta&#241;ez's contradictory testimony before the Senate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Polygraph Examinations</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cartagena recently stated that he was given fifteen or sixteen polygraph examinations by the federal government before the 1985 criminal trial. During every examination, save the final one, Cartagena denied being present when Rosado and Soto Arriv&#237; were killed or having any knowledge of who was responsible for their deaths. Cartagena recently stated that prosecutors threatened that if he did not testify \"truthfully,\" his immunity from federal prosecution would be withdrawn and his family might be in danger. He states that when he changed his story and admitted being present at the scene and inculpated two officers, he suddenly \"passed\" the polygraph examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were several motions regarding polygraph examinations during the proceedings up to and including trial; the end result was that the government was ordered to provide to the defense results of all polygraph examinations. The government disclosed three examinations given to Cartagena &#8212; in two he denied seeing the killings and in the third he inculpated Moreno Morales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We dismiss the government's invitation to simply accept its word that because only three polygraph examinations were disclosed, no more than three could have been administered. Nor is it inherently incredible that the government could have suppressed several polygraph examinations in this high-profile case; whether by accidental neglect or malevolent cover-up, such <i>Brady</i> violations do occur in criminal cases. Moreno Morales has presented evidence contradicting the government's statements, and we assume his allegations are true for purposes of this case, although there is no evidence that the government intentionally withheld the evidence. Accepting these allegations as true, <i>see Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 641, the government withheld as many as thirteen polygraph examinations that could have been used to impeach Cartagena at trial. Assuming that it existed, that evidence should have been disclosed to the defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3.

See Bagley,</i> 473 U.S. at 678, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3375</span></a></span>. At the time of trial, the defense had numerous other examples of contradictory statements made by both witnesses, including statements made under oath. Monta&#241;ez was questioned about the inconsistencies in his testimonies, while the defense chose not to cross-examine Cartagena. The evidence uncovered after the trial would have been merely cumulative, and \"the unavailability of cumulative evidence does not deprive the defendant of due process.\" <i>United States v.

Here, however, the evolution of Cartagena's testimony was revealed to the defense in Cartagena's conflicting statements to grand juries. At the first grand jury proceeding in 1980 he denied seeing or hearing anything. At the second proceeding in 1983 he admitted hearing the second volley of shots. He later returned to reveal to the grand jury that he also saw Moreno Morales's hand recoil immediately after the second volley of shots were fired. This largely mirrors the evolution of his story in the polygraph examinations that were disclosed. The defense thus had ample evidence of a witness's story changing over time, but chose not to utilize it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Cartagena revealed more details each time he was interviewed; he stated that he was not originally forthcoming because his brother-in-law was one of the officers implicated by his testimony.

There was ample evidence besides Cartagena's testimony to support Moreno Morales's conviction, including two other witnesses who stated that Moreno Morales shot Soto Arriv&#237;. Coupled with Moreno Morales's confession, we find that any misconduct by the prosecutors did not deprive Moreno Morales of a fair trial. <i>See United States v.

In addition, Cartagena recently recanted part of his trial testimony: during the 1996 Senate hearings, he stated that he did not see who shot the <i>independentistas.</i> Moreno Morales seeks a new trial based on this evidence. We note that this was the same hearing at which Moreno Morales admitted to shooting Soto Arriv&#237;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether newly discovered evidence is a cognizable ground for obtaining a new trial in proceedings under &#167; 2255. <i>See Barrett,</i> 965 F.2d at 1194; <i>see also Cruz-Sanchez v.

We have stated that \"[a]t a minimum, petitioner would be required to meet the conventional criteria for obtaining a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.\" <i>Barrett,</i> 965 F.2d at 1194. That would require petitioner to prove four elements: \"(1) the newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of trial; (2) the defendant was duly diligent in trying to discover it; (3) the evidence was material; and (4) the evidence was such that it would probably result in an acquittal upon retrial.\" <i>Awon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200178\"><a href=\"/opinion/200178/awon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 140 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of whether he can show the first three elements, Moreno Morales has failed to show that the new evidence would result in his acquittal. The new evidence revealing Cartagena's account of the events at Cerro Maravilla largely matches an account given soon after the incident (an account that was disclosed to the defense). Moreover, the new evidence Moreno Morales seeks to introduce emerged at the same time as additional new evidence &#8212; the fact that Moreno Morales was responsible for causing Soto Arriv&#237;'s death. Moreno Morales was charged with lying when he disavowed knowledge of the events at Cerro Maravilla. He now admits not only to knowing what took place, but to killing one of the <i>independentistas.</i> A new trial that considers the recantation would also consider the confession, and in all likelihood Moreno Morales would again be found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Given Moreno Morales's confession at the hearings, it is difficult to challenge the outcome of his trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Moreno Morales's &#167; 2255 petition is \"inadequate on its face,\" there is no need for an evidentiary hearing. <i>DiCarlo,</i> 575 F.2d at 954.
