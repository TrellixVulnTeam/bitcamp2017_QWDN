This mandamus proceeding1 requires\n\nus to resolve an issue of importance to judges and practitioners\n\nalike:    Does a district court possess the authority to compel an\n\nunwilling party to participate in, and share the costs of, non-\n\nbinding mediation conducted by a private mediator?            We hold that a\n\ncourt    may    order   mandatory     mediation   pursuant   to   an   explicit\n\nstatutory provision or local rule.            We further hold that where, as\n\nhere, no such authorizing medium exists, a court nonetheless may\n\norder mandatory mediation through the use of its inherent powers as\n\nlong as the case is an appropriate one and the order contains\n\nadequate safeguards.          Because the mediation order here at issue\n\nlacks such safeguards (although it does not fall far short), we\n\nvacate it and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n               In   January   1996,   Thames-Dick   Superaqueduct      Partners\n\n(Thames-Dick) entered into a master agreement with the Puerto Rico\n\nAqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) to construct, operate, and\n\nmaintain the North Coast Superaqueduct Project (the Project).\n\nThames-Dick granted subcontracts for various portions of the work,\n\nincluding a subcontract for construction management to Dick Corp.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although the petition seeks the issuance of a writ of\nmandamus, the relief sought is more in the nature of a writ of\nprohibition. Because the two writs have much in common — one is\nmerely the obverse of the other — we follow past practice and make\nno distinction between them. See, e.g., United States v. Horn, 29\nF.3d 754, 769 n.18 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                        -2-\n\fof Puerto Rico (Dick-PR), a subcontract for the operation and\n\nmaintenance of the Project to Thames Water International, Ltd.\n\n(Thames Water), and a subcontract for the fabrication of pipe to\n\nAtlantic Pipe Corp. (APC).        After the Project had been built, a\n\nsegment of the pipeline burst.        Thames-Dick incurred significant\n\ncosts in repairing the damage.         Not surprisingly, it sought to\n\nrecover those costs from other parties.            In response, one of\n\nPRASA's insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in a local\n\ncourt to determine whether Thames-Dick's claims were covered under\n\nits policy.     The litigation ballooned, soon involving a number of\n\nparties and a myriad of issues above and beyond insurance coverage.\n\n           On April 25, 2001, the hostilities spilled over into\n\nfederal court. Two entities beneficially interested in the master\n\nagreement — CPA Group International and Chiang, Patel & Yerby, Inc.\n\n(collectively CPA) — sued Thames-Dick, Dick-PR, Thames Water, and\n\nvarious insurers in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict   of   Puerto    Rico,   seeking   remuneration   for   consulting\n\nservices rendered in connection with repairs to the Project.             A\n\ngoogol of claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party\n\ncomplaints followed.       Some of these were brought against APC (the\n\npetitioner here).        To complicate matters, one of the defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss on grounds that, inter alia, (1) CPA had failed to\n\njoin an indispensable party whose presence would destroy diversity\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fjurisdiction, and (2) the existence of the parallel proceeding in\n\nthe local court counseled in favor of abstention.\n\n            While this motion was pending before the district court,\n\nThames-Dick asked that the case be referred to mediation and\n\nsuggested    Professor      Eric    Green     as   a   suitable     mediator.      The\n\ndistrict court granted the motion over APC's objection and ordered\n\nnon-binding mediation to proceed before Professor Green. The court\n\npronounced    mediation      likely      to    conserve      judicial    resources;\n\ndirected all parties to undertake mediation in good faith; stayed\n\ndiscovery pending completion of the mediation; and declared that\n\nparticipation in the mediation would not prejudice the parties'\n\npositions vis-à-vis the pending motion or the litigation as a\n\nwhole.   The court also stated that if mediation failed to produce\n\na global settlement, the case would proceed to trial.\n\n             After moving unsuccessfully for reconsideration of the\n\nmediation order, APC sought relief by way of mandamus.                             Its\n\npetition alleged that the district court did not have the authority\n\nto require mediation (especially in light of unresolved questions\n\nas to the court's subject-matter jurisdiction) and, in all events,\n\ncould not     force   APC    to    pay   a    share     of   the   expenses   of   the\n\nmediation.    We invited the other parties and the district judge to\n\nrespond.     See Fed. R. App. P. 21(b)(4)-(5).                     Several entities\n\n(including Thames-Dick, Dick-P.R., and Thames Water) opposed the\n\npetition.      Two    others       (third-party        defendants    United     States\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fFidelity    &    Guaranty    Company   and    United    Surety   and   Indemnity\n\nCompany) filed a brief in support of APC.              We assigned the case to\n\nthe oral argument calendar and stayed the contemplated mediation\n\npending our review.\n\n            Prior to argument in this court, two notable developments\n\noccurred.       First, the district court considered and rejected the\n\nchallenges to its exercise of jurisdiction.              Second, APC rejected\n\nan offer by Thames-Dick to pay its share of the mediator's fees.\n\nII.   JURISDICTION\n\n            In an effort to shut off further debate, the respondents\n\nasseverate that mandamus is improper because APC will not suffer\n\nirreparable harm in the absence of such relief.                  They rest this\n\nasseveration      on   the    notion   that    \"[m]andamus       is    ordinarily\n\nappropriate [only] in those rare cases in which the issuance (or\n\nnonissuance) of an order presents a question anent the limits of\n\njudicial power, poses some special risk of irreparable harm to the\n\nappellant, and is palpably erroneous.\"            United States v. Horn, 29\n\nF.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir. 1994).         The problem, however, is that these\n\nlimitations typically apply only to supervisory mandamus.                 Id. at\n\n769 & n.19.      In the tiny class of cases in which advisory mandamus\n\nis appropriate, irreparable harm need not be shown. Id. at 769-70.\n\n            We believe that this case is fit for advisory mandamus\n\nbecause the extent of a trial court's power to order mandatory\n\nmediation presents a systemically important issue as to which this\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcourt has not yet spoken.          See In re Prov. Journal Co., 293 F.3d 1,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 2002) (discussing criteria for advisory mandamus).\n\nMoreover, that issue is capable of significant repetition prior to\n\neffective      review.      See    Jennifer    O'Hearne,    Comment,   Compelled\n\nParticipation in Innovative Pretrial Proceedings, 84 Nw. U. L. Rev.\n\n290, 317 (1989) (noting that, as a practical matter, lawyers often\n\nare unable to challenge pretrial innovations even when they may be\n\ninvalid).      That fact militates in favor of advisory mandamus.              See\n\nHorn, 29 F.3d at 770.              We conclude, therefore, that invoking\n\nadvisory        mandamus    is      prudent     under      the   circumstances.\n\nConsequently, the existence vel non of irreparable harm is a non-\n\nissue.    We turn, then, to the merits.\n\nIII.   THE MERITS\n\n               There are four potential sources of judicial authority\n\nfor ordering mandatory non-binding mediation of pending cases,\n\nnamely, (a) the court's local rules, (b) an applicable statute, (c)\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and (d) the court's inherent\n\npowers.     Because the district court did not identify the basis of\n\nits assumed authority, we consider each of these sources.\n\n                             A.    The Local Rules.\n\n               A district court's local rules may provide an appropriate\n\nsource    of    authority    for    ordering    parties     to   participate    in\n\nmediation. See Rhea v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., 767 F.2d 266, 268-69\n\n(6th Cir. 1985) (per curiam).           In Puerto Rico, however, the local\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\frules contain only a single reference to any form of alternative\n\ndispute resolution (ADR).         That reference is embodied in the\n\ndistrict court's Amended Civil Justice Expense and Delay Reduction\n\nPlan (CJR Plan).    See D.P.R. R. app. III.\n\n           The district court adopted the CJR Plan on June 14, 1993,\n\nin response to the directive contained in the Civil Justice Reform\n\nAct of 1990 (CJRA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 471-482.         Rule V of the CJR Plan\n\nstates:\n\n                  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 473(b)(4), this\n           Court shall adopt a method of Alternative\n           Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\") through mediation\n           by a judicial officer.\n                  Such a program would allow litigants to\n           obtain from an impartial third party — the\n           judicial officer as mediator — a flexible non-\n           binding,   dispute   resolution   process   to\n           facilitate negotiations among the parties to\n           help them reach settlement.\n\nD.P.R. R. app. III (R. V.).       In addition to specifying who may act\n\nas a mediator, Rule V also limns the proper procedure for mediation\n\nsessions and assures confidentiality.        See id.\n\n           The respondents concede that the mediation order in this\n\ncase   falls   outside   the    boundaries   of   the   mediation   program\n\nenvisioned by Rule V.          It does so most noticeably because it\n\ninvolves mediation before a private mediator, not a judicial\n\nofficer.   Seizing upon this discrepancy, APC argues that the local\n\nrules limit the district court in this respect, and that the court\n\nexceeded its authority thereunder by issuing a non-conforming\n\nmediation order (i.e., one that contemplates the intervention of a\n\n                                    -7-\n\fprivate mediator).     The respondents counter by arguing that the\n\nrule does not bind the district court because, notwithstanding the\n\nunambiguous promise of the CJR Plan (which declares that the\n\ndistrict   court   \"shall   adopt   a   method   of   Alternative   Dispute\n\nResolution\"), no such program has been adopted to date.\n\n           This is a powerful argument. APC does not contradict the\n\nrespondents' assurance that the relevant portion of the CJR Plan\n\nhas remained unimplemented, and we take judicial notice that there\n\nis no formal, ongoing ADR program in the Puerto Rico federal\n\ndistrict court.    Because that is so, we conclude that the District\n\nof Puerto Rico has no local rule in force that dictates the\n\npermissible characteristics of mediation orders.            Consequently,\n\nAPC's argument founders.2\n\n                            B.   The ADR Act.\n\n           There is only one potential source of statutory authority\n\nfor ordering mandatory non-binding mediation here: the Alternative\n\n\n     2\n      This holding renders it unnecessary for us to discuss the\nrespondents' alternate contention that the CJR Plan is a dead\nletter because the legislation that prompted its enactment — the\nCJRA — expired in 1997.     See, e.g., Carl Tobias, Did the Civil\nJustice Reform Act of 1990 Actually Expire?, 31 U. Mich. J.L.\nReform 887, 892 (1998) (exploring the uncertainty regarding whether\nthe CJRA expired and whether local plans adopted pursuant to it are\nstill effective). By like token, this holding renders moot the\nrespondents' claim that the district court could disregard Appendix\nIII even if an ADR program were in force. See D.P.R. R. 105 (\"When\na judge of this court issues any order in a specific case which is\nnot consistent with these rules, such order shall constitute a\nsuspension of these rules for such case and only to the extent that\nit is inconsistent therewith.\"). Accordingly, we take no view of\nthe meaning or validity of Local Rule 105.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fDispute Resolution Act of 1998 (ADR Act), 28 U.S.C. §§ 651-658.\n\nCongress   passed   the   ADR   Act    to   promote   the    utilization   of\n\nalternative dispute resolution methods in the federal courts and to\n\nset appropriate guidelines for their use.         The Act lists mediation\n\nas an appropriate ADR process.              Id. § 651(a).      Moreover, it\n\nsanctions the participation of \"professional neutrals from the\n\nprivate sector\" as mediators.          Id. § 653(b).        Finally, the Act\n\nrequires district courts to obtain litigants' consent only when\n\nthey order arbitration, id. § 652(a), not when they order the use\n\nof other ADR mechanisms (such as non-binding mediation).\n\n           Despite the broad sweep of these provisions, the Act is\n\nquite clear that some form of the ADR procedures it endorses must\n\nbe adopted in each judicial district by local rule.               See id. §\n\n651(b) (directing each district court to \"devise and implement its\n\nown alternative dispute resolution program, by local rule adopted\n\nunder [28 U.S.C.] section 2071(a), to encourage and promote the use\n\nof alternative dispute resolution in its district\").                 In the\n\nabsence of such local rules, the ADR Act itself does not authorize\n\nany specific court to use a particular ADR mechanism.            Because the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico has not yet complied with the Act's\n\nmandate, the mediation order here at issue cannot be justified\n\nunder the ADR Act.\n\n           The respondents essay an end run around this lacuna:\n\nthey contend (borrowing a phrase from the court below) that the\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f\"spirit\" of the ADR Act authorizes the mediation order because the\n\nAct was intended to promote experimentation with ADR techniques.\n\nWe reject this attempt to press the ADR Act into service by\n\nindirection.\n\n           Although the ADR Act was designed to promote the use of\n\nADR techniques, Congress chose a very well-defined path:           it\n\ngranted each judicial district, rather than each individual judge,\n\nthe authority to craft an appropriate ADR program. In other words,\n\nCongress   permitted     experimentation,   but    only   within   the\n\ndisciplining format of district-wide local rules adopted with\n\nnotice and a full opportunity for public comment.      See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2071(b).   To say that the Act authorized each district judge to\n\ndisregard a district-wide ADR plan (or the absence of one) and\n\nfashion innovative procedures for use in specific cases is simply\n\ntoo much of a stretch.\n\n           We add, however, that although the respondents cannot use\n\nthe ADR Act as a justification, neither can APC use it as a\n\nnullification.   Noting that the Act requires the adoption of local\n\nrules establishing a formal ADR program, APC equates the absence of\n\nsuch rules with the absence of power to employ an ADR procedure\n\n(say, mediation) in a specific case. But that is wishful thinking:\n\nif one assumes that district judges possessed the power to require\n\nmediation prior to the passage of the ADR Act, there is nothing in\n\nthe Act that strips them of that power.           After all, even the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fadoption of a federal procedural rule does not implicitly abrogate\n\na district court's inherent power to act merely because the rule\n\ntouches upon the same subject matter. See Chambers v. Nasco, Inc.,\n\n501 U.S. 32, 42-43 (1991) (rejecting the argument that the adoption\n\nof various provisions of the Civil Rules eliminated the district\n\ncourt's inherent power to impose other sanctions); Link v. Wabash\n\nR.R.,   370    U.S.   626,   630   (1963)       (explaining    that   neither    the\n\npermissive language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) nor the policy behind\n\nit justified a conclusion that it was meant to limit the district\n\ncourts' inherent power to dismiss a case for want of prosecution).\n\n              The case before us is analogous to Chambers and Link.\n\nEven though Congress may cabin the district courts' inherent\n\npowers, its intention to do so must be clear and unmistakable.                   See\n\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 313 (1982).                      Not so\n\nhere:   we know of nothing in either the ADR Act or the policies\n\nthat undergird it that can be said to restrict the district courts'\n\nauthority     to    engage   in    the    case-by-case        deployment   of    ADR\n\nprocedures.     Hence, we conclude that where, as here, there are no\n\nimplementing local rules, the ADR Act neither authorizes nor\n\nprohibits the entry of a mandatory mediation order.\n\n                             C.    The Civil Rules.\n\n              The   respondents    next    argue    that   the    district      court\n\npossessed the authority to require mediation by virtue of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. They concentrate their attention\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fon Fed. R. Civ. P. 16, which states in pertinent part that \"the\n\ncourt may take appropriate action[] with respect to . . . (9)\n\nsettlement and the use of special procedures to assist in resolving\n\nthe dispute when authorized by statute or local rule . . . .\"                Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 16(c)(9).          But the words \"when authorized by statute or\n\nlocal       rule\"   are   a   frank   limitation   on   the   district    courts'\n\nauthority to order mediation thereunder,3 and we must adhere to\n\nthat circumscription.           See Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104,\n\n121 (1964) (explaining that the Civil Rules \"should not be expanded\n\nby disregarding plainly expressed limitations\").               Because there is\n\nno statute or local rule authorizing mandatory private mediation in\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico, see supra Parts III(A)-(B), Rule\n\n16(c)(9) does not assist the respondents' cause.4\n\n\n     3\n      We think it is pertinent here to quote the                         advisory\ncommittee's note:\n          The rule acknowledges the presence of statutes\n          and local rules or plans that may authorize\n          use of some [ADR] procedures even when not\n          agreed to by the parties. The rule does not\n          attempt to resolve questions as to the extent\n          a court would be authorized to require such\n          proceedings as an exercise of its inherent\n          powers.\n\nFed.

All of them\npredate the 1993 amendments, which added the pertinent language to\nRule 16. See, e.g., Fed. Reserve Bank v. Carey-Canada, Inc., 123\nF.R.D. 603, 606 (D. Minn. 1988); Arabian Am.

Bank v.\n\nPeat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 771 F.2d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 1985)\n\n(explaining that \"the rules of civil procedure do not completely\n\ndescribe and limit the power of district courts\").               This inherent\n\npower takes many forms.          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(b) (providing that\n\njudges may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal\n\nlaw and applicable rules).           By way of illustration, a district\n\ncourt may use its inherent power to compel represented clients to\n\nattend pretrial settlement conferences, even though such a practice\n\nis not specifically authorized in the Civil Rules.               See Heileman\n\nBrewing Co. v. Joseph Oat Corp., 871 F.2d 648, 650 (7th Cir. 1989)\n\n(en banc).\n\n            Of course, a district court's inherent powers are not\n\ninfinite.     There are at least four limiting principles.             First,\n\ninherent powers must be used in a way reasonably suited to the\n\nenhancement of the court's processes, including the orderly and\n\nexpeditious disposition of pending cases.             Coyante v. P.R. Ports\n\nAuth., 105 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1997).           Second, inherent powers\n\ncannot be exercised in a manner that contradicts an applicable\n\nstatute or rule.       Chambers, 501 U.S. at 47.         Third, the use of\n\ninherent powers must comport with procedural fairness.              Id. at 50.\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fAnd, finally, inherent powers \"must be exercised with restraint and\n\ndiscretion.\"            Id. at 44.\n\n                 At one time, the inherent power of judges to compel\n\nunwilling parties to participate in ADR procedures was a hot-button\n\nissue for legal scholars.                 Compare, e.g., O'Hearne, supra at 320\n\n(arguing         that    inherent     power      should      not   be    used    to   compel\n\nparticipation in pretrial settlement proceedings), with Lucille M.\n\nPonte, Putting Mandatory Summary Jury Trial Back on the Docket:\n\nRecommendations on the Exercise of Judicial Authority, 63 Fordham\n\nL.   Rev.    1069,        1094    (1995)       (urging   the   opposite        conclusion).\n\nAlthough many federal district courts have forestalled further\n\ndebate      by    adopting        local    rules      that   authorize         specific   ADR\n\nprocedures and outlaw others, e.g., D.N.H. R. 53.1 (permitting\n\nmandatory mediation); D. Me. R. 83.11 (permitting only voluntary\n\nmediation); D. Mass. R. 16.4 (permitting mandatory summary jury\n\ntrials but only voluntary mediation), the District of Puerto Rico\n\nis not among them.               Thus, we have no choice but to address the\n\nquestion head-on.\n\n                 We begin our inquiry by examining the case law.                           In\n\nStrandell v. Jackson County, 838 F.2d 884 (7th Cir. 1987), the\n\nSeventh     Circuit        held    that    a    district     court      does    not   possess\n\ninherent power to compel participation in a summary jury trial.5\n\n\n      5\n      A summary jury trial is an ADR technique in which the\nopposing attorneys present their case, in abbreviated form, to a\nmock jury, which proceeds to render a non-binding verdict. See In\n\n                                               -14-\n\fIn the court's view, Fed. R. Civ. P. 16 occupied the field and\n\nprevented a district court from forcing \"an unwilling litigant [to]\n\nbe sidetracked from the normal course of litigation.\"   Id. at 887.\n\nBut the group that spearheaded the subsequent revision of Rule 16\n\nexplicitly rejected that interpretation.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16,\n\nadvisory committee's note (1993 Amendment) (\"The [amended] rule\n\ndoes not attempt to resolve questions as to the extent a court\n\nwould be authorized to require [ADR] proceedings as an exercise of\n\nits inherent powers.\").   Thus, we do not find Strandell persuasive\n\non this point.\n\n           The Strandell court also expressed concern that summary\n\njury trials would undermine traditional discovery and privilege\n\nrules by requiring certain disclosures prior to an actual trial.\n\n838 F.2d at 888.    We find this concern unwarranted.    Because a\n\nsummary jury trial (like a non-binding mediation) does not require\n\nany disclosures beyond what would be required in the ordinary\n\ncourse of discovery, its principal disadvantage to the litigants is\n\nthat it may prevent them from saving surprises for the time of\n\ntrial.   Since trial by ambush is no longer in vogue, that interest\n\ndoes not deserve protection.     See Fed. Reserve Bank v. Carey-\n\nCanada, Inc., 123 F.R.D. 603, 606 (D. Minn. 1988).\n\n\n\n\nre NLO, Inc., 5 F.3d 154, 156 (6th Cir. 1993); see generally Thomas\nD. Lambros, The Summary Jury Trial Report to the Judicial\nConference of the United States, 103 F.R.D. 461 (1984).\n\n                               -15-\n\f           Relying on policy arguments, the Sixth Circuit also has\n\nfound that district courts do not possess inherent power to compel\n\nparticipation in summary jury trials.        See In re NLO, Inc., 5 F.3d\n\n154, 157-58 (6th Cir. 1993).          The court thought the value of a\n\nsummary jury trial questionable when parties do not engage in the\n\nprocess    voluntarily,    and   it     worried   that     \"too   broad    an\n\ninterpretation of the federal courts' inherent power to regulate\n\ntheir procedure . . . encourages judicial high-handedness . . . .\"\n\nId. at 158 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The concerns articulated by these two respected courts\n\nplainly apply to mandatory mediation orders.             When mediation is\n\nforced upon unwilling litigants, it stands to reason that the\n\nlikelihood of settlement is diminished.             Requiring parties to\n\ninvest substantial amounts of time and money in mediation under\n\nsuch circumstances may well be inefficient. Cf. Richard A. Posner,\n\nThe Summary Jury Trial and Other Methods of Alternative Dispute\n\nResolution:     Some Cautionary Observations, 53 U. Chi. L. Rev. 366,\n\n369-72 (1986) (offering a model to evaluate ADR techniques in terms\n\nof their capacity to encourage settlements).\n\n           The    fact    remains,    however,    that     none   of    these\n\nconsiderations    establishes    that   mandatory   mediation     is   always\n\ninappropriate.     There may well be specific cases in which such a\n\nprotocol   is    likely   to   conserve     judicial     resources     without\n\nsignificantly burdening the objectors' rights to a full, fair, and\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fspeedy trial. Much depends on the idiosyncracies of the particular\n\ncase and the details of the mediation order.\n\n            In some cases, a court may be warranted in believing that\n\ncompulsory mediation could yield significant benefits even if one\n\nor more parties object.      After all, a party may resist mediation\n\nsimply out of unfamiliarity with the process or out of fear that a\n\nwillingness to submit would be perceived as a lack of confidence in\n\nher legal position.        See Campbell C. Hutchinson, The Case for\n\nMandatory Mediation, 42 Loy. L. Rev. 85, 89-90 (1996).           In such an\n\ninstance, the party's initial reservations are likely to evaporate\n\nas the mediation progresses, and negotiations could well produce a\n\nbeneficial outcome, at reduced cost and greater speed, than would\n\na trial.    While the possibility that parties will fail to reach\n\nagreement remains ever present, the boon of settlement can be worth\n\nthe risk.\n\n            This is particularly true in complex cases involving\n\nmultiple claims and parties.      The fair and expeditious resolution\n\nof such cases often is helped along by creative solutions —\n\nsolutions that simply are not available in the binary framework of\n\ntraditional adversarial litigation.       Mediation with the assistance\n\nof a skilled facilitator gives parties an opportunity to explore a\n\nmuch wider    range   of   options,   including   those   that   go   beyond\n\nconventional zero-sum resolutions.         Mindful of these potential\n\nadvantages, we hold that it is within a district court's inherent\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fpower to order non-consensual mediation in those cases in which\n\nthat step     seems    reasonably         likely     to    serve    the    interests    of\n\njustice.     Cf. Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 156-57 (1st\n\nCir. 1988) (finding that district courts have inherent power to\n\nappoint technical advisors in especially complex cases).\n\n                            E.     The Mediation Order.\n\n            Our determination that the district courts have inherent\n\npower to refer cases to non-binding mediation is made with a\n\nrecognition that any such order must be crafted in a manner that\n\npreserves procedural fairness and shields objecting parties from\n\nundue burdens.        We thus turn to the specifics of the mediation\n\norder entered in this case.               As with any exercise of a district\n\ncourt's inherent powers, we review the entry of that order for\n\nabuse of discretion.             See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 50; Reilly, 863\n\nF.2d at 156.\n\n            As an initial matter, we agree with the lower court that\n\nthe   complexity      of    this       case    militates    in     favor   of   ordering\n\nmediation.     At last count, the suit involves twelve parties,\n\nasserting a welter of claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and\n\nthird-party claims predicated on a wide variety of theories.                           The\n\npendency of nearly parallel litigation in the Puerto Rican courts,\n\nwhich features a slightly different cast of characters and claims\n\nthat are     related       to    but    not    completely    congruent      with   those\n\nasserted here, further complicates the matter.                         Untangling the\n\n\n                                              -18-\n\fintricate web of relationships among the parties, along with the\n\ndifficult and fact-intensive arguments made by each, will be time-\n\nconsuming and will impose significant costs on the parties and the\n\ncourt.      Against   this    backdrop,   mediation   holds   out   the    dual\n\nprospect    of   advantaging     the   litigants   and   conserving   scarce\n\njudicial resources.\n\n            In an effort to parry this thrust, APC raises a series of\n\nobjections.      Its threshold claim is that the district court erred\n\nin ordering mediation before resolving a pending motion to dismiss\n\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (or, alternatively, to\n\nabstain).    See, e.g., Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Fla. Dep't of Envtl.\n\nProt., 91 F.3d 1445, 1448-49 (11th Cir. 1996) (vacating a mediation\n\norder and directing the lower court first to consider the objecting\n\nparty's assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity).\n\n            Given what has transpired, this argument is fruitless.\n\nWhile this proceeding was pending, the district court denied the\n\nmotion in question and confirmed the existence of its subject-\n\nmatter jurisdiction.         See CPA Group Int'l, Inc. v. Am. Int'l Ins.\n\nCo., No. 01-1483, slip op. at 16-25 (D.P.R. May 23, 2002).                Thus,\n\neven if it were error to enter the mediation order before passing\n\nupon the motion to dismiss,6 the error was harmless:            it would be\n\n\n     6\n      Although we take no view of this aspect of APC's argument, we\nnote that when a jurisdictional question involves disputed facts,\nthe district court sometimes \"may defer resolution of the\njurisdictional issue until the time of trial.\" Valentin v. Hosp.\nBella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 363 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001).        How this\n\n                                       -19-\n\fan empty exercise to vacate the mediation order on this ground when\n\nthe lower court has already rejected the challenges to its exercise\n\nof jurisdiction.   See, e.g., Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 78 (1939);\n\nAoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            Next, APC posits that the appointment of a private\n\nmediator proposed by one of the parties is per se improper (and,\n\nthus, invalidates the order).   We do not agree.   The district court\n\nhas inherent power to \"appoint persons unconnected with the court\n\nto aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties.\"    Ex\n\nparte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 312 (1920).     In the context of non-\n\nbinding mediation, the mediator does not decide the merits of the\n\ncase and has no authority to coerce settlement.         Thus, in the\n\nabsence of a contrary statute or rule, it is perfectly acceptable\n\nfor the district court to appoint a qualified and neutral private\n\nparty as a mediator.    The mere fact that the mediator was proposed\n\nby one of the parties is insufficient to establish bias in favor of\n\nthat party.   Cf. TechSearch, L.L.C. v. Intel Corp., 286 F.3d 1360,\n\n1379 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (noting that technical advisors typically\n\nwould be selected from a list of candidates submitted by the\n\nparties).\n\n            We hasten to add that the litigants are free to challenge\n\nthe qualifications or neutrality of any suggested mediator (whether\n\n\nproposition affects a trial court's ability to issue interim orders\ndesigned to move litigation forward while it ponders a challenge to\nits jurisdiction is a matter that we leave for another day.\n\n                                 -20-\n\for not nominated by a party to the case).                 APC, for example, had a\n\nfull opportunity to present its views about the suggested mediator\n\nboth in its opposition to the motion for mediation and in its\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the mediation order.                    Despite these\n\nopportunities, APC offered no convincing reason to spark a belief\n\nthat       Professor     Green,   a    nationally    recognized       mediator   with\n\nsignificant experience in sprawling cases, is an unacceptable\n\nchoice.       When a court enters a mediation order, it necessarily\n\nmakes an independent determination that the mediator it appoints is\n\nboth qualified and neutral.             Because the court made that implicit\n\ndetermination here in a manner that was procedurally fair (if not\n\nideal),      we   find    no   abuse    of   discretion    in   its    selection   of\n\nProfessor Green.7\n\n               APC also grouses that it should not be forced to share\n\nthe costs of an unwanted mediation.                 We have held, however, that\n\ncourts have the power under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f) to issue pretrial\n\ncost-sharing orders in complex litigation.                   See In re San Juan\n\nDupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 994 F.2d 956, 965 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nGiven the difficulties facing trial courts in cases involving\n\nmultiple parties and multiple claims, we are hesitant to limit that\n\npower to the traditional discovery context.                     See id.     This is\n\n\n       7\n      We say \"not ideal\" because, in an ideal world, it would be\npreferable for the district court, before naming a mediator, to\nsolicit the names of potential nominees from all parties and to\nprovide an opportunity for the parties to comment upon each others'\nproposed nominees.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fespecially true in complicated cases, where the potential value of\n\nmediation      lies     not   only   in    promoting    settlement     but    also   in\n\nclarifying the issues remaining for trial.\n\n               The short of the matter is that, without default cost-\n\nsharing rules, the use of valuable ADR techniques (like mediation)\n\nbecomes hostage to the parties' ability to agree on the concomitant\n\nfinancial arrangements.              This means that the district court's\n\ninherent power to order private mediation in appropriate cases\n\nwould be rendered nugatory absent the corollary power to order the\n\nsharing of reasonable mediation costs.                 To avoid this pitfall, we\n\nhold that the district court, in an appropriate case, is empowered\n\nto order the sharing of reasonable costs and expenses associated\n\nwith mandatory non-binding mediation.\n\n               The remainder of APC's arguments are not so easily\n\ndispatched.          Even when generically appropriate, a mediation order\n\nmust       contain    procedural     and   substantive    safeguards     to    ensure\n\nfairness to all parties involved. The mediation order in this case\n\ndoes not quite meet that test.              In particular, the order does not\n\nset    limits    on     the   duration     of   the   mediation   or   the    expense\n\nassociated therewith.8\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      We do not assign significant weight to Thames-Dick's belated\noffer to pay APC's share of the mediator's fee. There are other\nexpenses involved, and there is too much of a risk that \"free\nrider\" status will itself breed problems.\n\n                                           -22-\n\f          We need not wax longiloquent.        As entered, the order\n\nsimply requires the parties to mediate; it does not set forth\n\neither a timetable for the mediation or a cap on the fees that the\n\nmediator may charge.    The figures that have been bandied about in\n\nthe briefs — $900 per hour or $9,000 per mediation day — are quite\n\nlarge and should not be left to the mediator's whim.       Relatedly,\n\nbecause the mediator is to be paid an hourly rate, the court should\n\nhave set an outside limit on the number of hours to be devoted to\n\nmediation.    Equally as important, it is trite but often true that\n\njustice delayed is justice denied.      An unsuccessful mediation will\n\npostpone the ultimate resolution of the case — indeed, the district\n\ncourt has stayed all discovery pending the completion of the\n\nmediation — and, thus, prolong the litigation.      For these reasons,\n\nthe district court should have set a definite time frame for the\n\nmediation.\n\n             The respondents suggest that the district court did not\n\nneed to articulate any limitations in its mediation order because\n\nthe mediation process will remain under the district court's\n\nultimate supervision; the court retains the ability to curtail any\n\nexcessive expenditures of time or money; and a dissatisfied party\n\ncan easily return to the court at any time.       While this might be\n\nenough of a safeguard in many instances, the instant litigation is\n\nsufficiently complicated and the mediation efforts are likely to be\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fsufficiently expensive that, here, reasonable time limits and fee\n\nconstraints, set in advance, are appropriate.9\n\n              A   court   intent   on     ordering   non-consensual     mediation\n\nshould take other precautions as well.                For example, the court\n\nshould make it clear (as did the able district court in this case)\n\nthat participation in mediation will not be taken as a waiver of\n\nany    litigation     position.          The   important   point   is   that   the\n\nprotections we have mentioned are not intended to comprise an\n\nexhaustive list, but, rather, to illustrate that when a district\n\ncourt orders a party to participate in mediation, it should take\n\ncare to assuage legitimate concerns about the possible negative\n\nconsequences of such an order.\n\n              To recapitulate, we rule that a mandatory mediation order\n\nissued under the district court's inherent power is valid in an\n\nappropriate case.         We also rule that this is an appropriate case.\n\nWe    hold,   however,     that    the    district   court's   failure    to   set\n\nreasonable limits on the duration of the mediation and on the\n\nmediator's fees dooms the decree.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n              We admire the district court's pragmatic and innovative\n\napproach to this massive litigation.                 Our core holding — that\n\n\n\n       9\n      We do not mean that a mediation order in such a case must be\netched in stone. The mediator and the parties remain free, for\ngood cause shown, to ask the district court to extend or modify the\noriginal order.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fordering mandatory mediation is a proper exercise of a district\n\ncourt's inherent power, subject, however, to a variety of terms and\n\nconditions — validates that approach.           We are mindful that this\n\nholding is in tension with the opinions of the Sixth and Seventh\n\nCircuits in NLO and Strandell, respectively, but we believe it is\n\njustified by the important goal of promoting flexibility and\n\ncreative problem-solving in the handling of complex litigation.\n\n             That said, the need of the district judge in this case to\n\nconstruct his own mediation regime ad hoc underscores the greater\n\nneed of the district court as an institution to adopt an ADR\n\nprogram and memorialize it in its local rules.            In the ADR Act,\n\nCongress directed that \"[e]ach United States district court shall\n\nauthorize,    by   local   rule   under    section   2071(a),   the   use   of\n\nalternative dispute resolution processes in all civil actions . .\n\n. .\"   28 U.S.C. § 651(b).         While Congress did not set a firm\n\ndeadline for compliance with this directive, the statute was\n\nenacted four years ago.       This omission having been noted, we are\n\nconfident that the district court will move expediently to bring\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico into compliance.\n\n          We need go no further.

We hold that a court may order mandatory mediation pursuant to an explicit statutory provision or local rule. We further hold that where, as here, no such authorizing medium exists, a court nonetheless may order mandatory mediation through the use of its inherent powers as long as the case is an appropriate one and the order contains adequate safeguards. Because the mediation order here at issue lacks such safeguards (although it does not fall far short), we vacate it and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1996, Thames-Dick Superaqueduct Partners (Thames-Dick) entered into a master agreement with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) to construct, operate, and maintain the North Coast Superaqueduct Project (the Project). Thames-Dick granted subcontracts for various portions of the work, including a subcontract for construction management to Dick Corp. of Puerto Rico (Dick-PR), a subcontract for the operation and maintenance of the Project to Thames Water International, Ltd. (Thames Water), and a subcontract for the fabrication of pipe to Atlantic Pipe Corp. (APC). After the Project had been built, a segment of the pipeline burst. Thames-Dick incurred significant costs in repairing the damage. Not surprisingly, it sought to recover those costs from other parties. In response, one of PRASA's insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in a local court to determine whether Thames-Dick's claims were covered under its policy. The litigation ballooned, soon involving a number of parties and a myriad of issues above and beyond insurance coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2001, the hostilities spilled over into federal court. Two entities beneficially interested in the master agreement &#8212; CPA Group International and Chiang, Patel &amp; Yerby, Inc. (collectively CPA) &#8212; sued Thames-Dick, Dick-PR, Thames Water, and various insurers in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking remuneration for consulting services rendered in connection with repairs to the Project. A googol of claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party complaints followed. Some of these were brought against APC (the petitioner here). To complicate matters, one of the defendants moved to dismiss on grounds that, inter alia, (1) CPA had failed to join an indispensable party whose presence would destroy diversity jurisdiction, and (2) the existence of the parallel proceeding in the local court counseled in favor of abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this motion was pending before the district court, Thames-Dick asked that the case be referred to mediation and suggested Professor Eric Green as a suitable mediator. The district court granted the motion over APC's objection and ordered non-binding mediation to proceed before Professor Green. The court pronounced mediation likely to conserve judicial resources; directed all parties to undertake mediation in good faith; stayed discovery pending completion of the mediation; and declared that participation in the mediation would not prejudice the parties' positions vis-&#224;-vis the pending motion or the litigation as a whole. The court also stated that if mediation failed to produce a global settlement, the case would proceed to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After moving unsuccessfully for reconsideration of the mediation order, APC sought relief by way of mandamus. Its petition alleged that the district court did not have the authority to require mediation (especially in light of unresolved questions as to the court's subject-matter jurisdiction) and, in all events, could not force APC to pay a share of the expenses of the mediation. We invited the other parties and the district judge to respond. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 21(b)(4)-(5). Several entities (including Thames-Dick, Dick-P.R., and Thames Water) opposed the petition. Two others (third-party defendants United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company and United Surety and Indemnity Company) filed a brief in support of APC. We assigned the case to the oral argument calendar and stayed the contemplated mediation pending our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to argument in this court, two notable developments occurred. First, the district court considered and rejected the challenges to its exercise of jurisdiction. Second, APC rejected an offer by Thames-Dick to pay its share of the mediator's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to shut off further debate, the respondents asseverate that mandamus is improper because APC will not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of such relief. They rest this asseveration on the notion that \"[m]andamus is ordinarily appropriate [only] in those rare cases in which the issuance (or nonissuance) of an order presents a question anent the limits of judicial power, poses some special risk of irreparable harm to the appellant, and is palpably erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir.1994). The problem, however, is that these limitations typically apply only to <i>supervisory</i> mandamus. <i>Id.</i> at 769 &amp; n. 19. In the tiny class of cases in which advisory mandamus is appropriate, irreparable harm need not be shown. <i>Id.</i> at 769-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that this case is fit for advisory mandamus because the extent of a trial court's power to order mandatory mediation presents a systemically important issue as to which this court has not yet spoken. <i>See In re Prov. Journal Co.,</i> 293 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002) (discussing criteria for advisory mandamus). Moreover, that issue is capable of significant repetition prior to effective review. <i>See</i> Jennifer O'Hearne, Comment, <i>Compelled Participation in Innovative Pretrial Proceedings,</i> 84 Nw. U.L.Rev. 290, 317 (1989) (noting that, as a practical matter, lawyers often are unable to challenge pretrial innovations even when they may be invalid). That fact militates in favor of advisory mandamus. <i>See Horn,</i> 29 F.3d at 770. We conclude, therefore, that invoking advisory mandamus is prudent under the circumstances. Consequently, the existence <i>vel non</i> of irreparable harm is a non-issue. We turn, then, to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are four potential sources of judicial authority for ordering mandatory non-binding mediation of pending cases, namely, (a) the court's local rules, (b) an applicable statute, (c) the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and (d) the court's inherent powers. Because the district court did not identify the basis of its assumed authority, we consider each of these sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Local Rules.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's local rules may provide an appropriate source of authority for ordering parties to participate in mediation. <i>See Rhea v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc.,</i> 767 F.2d 266, 268-69 (6th Cir.1985) (per curiam). In Puerto Rico, however, the local rules contain only a single reference to any form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). That reference is embodied in the district court's Amended Civil Justice Expense and Delay Reduction Plan (CJR Plan). <i>See</i> D.P.R. R. app. III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the CJR Plan on June 14, 1993, in response to the directive contained in the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 471-482. Rule V of the CJR Plan states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 473(b)(4), this Court shall adopt a method of Alternative Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\") through mediation by a judicial officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a program would allow litigants to obtain from an impartial third party &#8212; the judicial officer as mediator &#8212; a flexible non-binding, dispute resolution process to facilitate negotiations among the parties to help them reach settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.P.R. R. app. III (R. V.). In addition to specifying who may act as a mediator, Rule V also limns the proper procedure for mediation sessions and assures confidentiality. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents concede that the mediation order in this case falls outside the boundaries of the mediation program envisioned by Rule V. It does so most noticeably because it involves mediation before a private mediator, not a judicial officer. Seizing upon this discrepancy, APC argues that the local rules limit the district court in this respect, and that the court exceeded its authority thereunder by issuing a non-conforming mediation order (i.e., one that contemplates the intervention of a private mediator). The respondents counter by arguing that the rule does not bind the district court because, notwithstanding the unambiguous promise of the CJR Plan (which declares that the district court \"shall adopt a method of Alternative Dispute Resolution\"), no such program has been adopted to date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a powerful argument. APC does not contradict the respondents' assurance that the relevant portion of the CJR Plan has remained unimplemented, and we take judicial notice that there is no formal, ongoing ADR program in the Puerto Rico federal district court. Because that is so, we conclude that the District of Puerto Rico has no local rule in force that dictates the permissible characteristics of mediation orders. Consequently, APC's argument founders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The ADR Act.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is only one potential source of statutory authority for ordering mandatory non-binding mediation here: the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 (ADR Act), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 651-658. Congress passed the ADR Act to promote the utilization of alternative dispute resolution methods in the federal courts and to set appropriate guidelines for their use. The Act lists mediation as an appropriate ADR process. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 651(a). Moreover, it sanctions the participation of \"professional neutrals from the private sector\" as mediators. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 653(b). Finally, the Act requires district courts to obtain litigants' consent only when they order arbitration, <i>id.</i> &#167; 652(a), not when they order the use of other ADR mechanisms (such as non-binding mediation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the broad sweep of these provisions, the Act is quite clear that some form of the ADR procedures it endorses must be adopted in each judicial district by local rule. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 651(b) (directing each district court to \"devise and implement its own alternative dispute resolution program, by local rule adopted under [28 U.S.C.] section 2071(a), to encourage and promote the use of alternative dispute resolution in its district\"). In the absence of such local rules, the ADR Act itself does not authorize any specific court to use a particular ADR mechanism. Because the District of Puerto Rico has not yet complied with the Act's mandate, the mediation order here at issue cannot be justified under the ADR Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents essay an end run around this lacuna: they contend (borrowing a phrase from the court below) that the \"spirit\" of the ADR Act authorizes the mediation order because the Act was intended to promote experimentation with ADR techniques. We reject this attempt to press the ADR Act into service by indirection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the ADR Act was designed to promote the use of ADR techniques, Congress chose a very well-defined path: it granted each judicial district, rather than each individual judge, the authority to craft an appropriate ADR program. In other words, Congress permitted experimentation, but only within the disciplining format of district-wide local rules adopted with notice and a full opportunity for public comment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2071(b). To say that the Act authorized each district judge to disregard a district-wide ADR plan (or the absence of one) and fashion innovative procedures for use in specific cases is simply too much of a stretch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, however, that although the respondents cannot use the ADR Act as a justification, neither can APC use it as a nullification. Noting that the Act requires the adoption of local rules establishing a formal ADR program, APC equates the absence of such rules with the absence of power to employ an ADR procedure (say, mediation) in a specific case. But that is wishful thinking: if one assumes that district judges possessed the power to require mediation prior to the passage of the ADR Act, there is nothing in the Act that strips them of that power. After all, even the adoption of a federal procedural rule does not implicitly abrogate a district court's inherent power to act merely because the rule touches upon the same subject matter. <i>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 32, 42-43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (rejecting the argument that the adoption of various provisions of the Civil Rules eliminated the district court's inherent power to impose other sanctions); <i>Link v. Wabash R.R.,</i> 370 U.S. 626, 630, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1963) (explaining that neither the permissive language of Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) nor the policy behind it justified a conclusion that it was meant to limit the district courts' inherent power to dismiss a case for want of prosecution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case before us is analogous to <i>Chambers</i> and <i>Link.</i> Even though Congress may cabin the district courts' inherent powers, its intention to do so must be clear and unmistakable. <i>See Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,</i> 456 U.S. 305, 313, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91 (1982). Not so here: we know of nothing in either the ADR Act or the policies that undergird it that can be said to restrict the district courts' authority to engage in the case-by-case deployment of ADR procedures. Hence, we conclude that where, as here, there are no implementing local rules, the ADR Act neither authorizes nor prohibits the entry of a mandatory mediation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Civil Rules.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents next argue that the district court possessed the authority to require mediation by virtue of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They concentrate their attention on Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, which states in pertinent part that \"the court may take appropriate action[] with respect to ... (9) settlement and the use of special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule....\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(9). But the words \"when authorized by statute or local rule\" are a frank limitation on the district courts' authority to order mediation thereunder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and we must adhere to that circumscription. <i>See Schlagenhauf v. Holder,</i> 379 U.S. 104, 121, 85 S.Ct. 234, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964) (explaining that the Civil Rules \"should not be expanded by disregarding plainly expressed limitations\"). Because there is no statute or local rule authorizing mandatory private mediation in the District of Puerto Rico, <i>see supra</i> Parts III(A)-(B), Rule 16(c)(9) does not assist the respondents' cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Inherent Powers.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even apart from positive law, district courts have substantial inherent power to manage and control their calendars. <i>See Link,</i> 370 U.S. at 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386; <i>see generally Brockton Sav. Bank v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co.,</i> 771 F.2d 5, 11 (1st Cir.1985) (explaining that \"the rules of civil procedure do not completely describe and limit the power of district courts\"). This inherent power takes many forms. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(b) (providing that judges may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law and applicable rules). By way of illustration, a district court may use its inherent power to compel represented clients to attend pretrial settlement conferences, even though such a practice is not specifically authorized in the Civil Rules. <i>See Heileman Brewing Co. v. Joseph Oat Corp.,</i> 871 F.2d 648, 650 (7th Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a district court's inherent powers are not infinite. There are at least four limiting principles. First, inherent powers must be used in a way reasonably suited to the enhancement of the court's processes, including the orderly and expeditious disposition of pending cases. <i>Coyante v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> 105 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir.1997). Second, inherent powers cannot be exercised in a manner that contradicts an applicable statute or rule. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 47, 111 S.Ct. 2123. Third, the use of inherent powers must comport with procedural fairness. <i>Id.</i> at 50, 111 S.Ct. 2123. And, finally, inherent powers \"must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 44, 111 S.Ct. 2123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one time, the inherent power of judges to compel unwilling parties to participate in ADR procedures was a hot-button issue for legal scholars. <i>Compare, e.g.,</i> O'Hearne, <i>supra</i> at 320 (arguing that inherent power should not be used to compel participation in pretrial settlement proceedings), <i>with</i> Lucille M. Ponte, <i>Putting Mandatory Summary Jury Trial Back on the Docket: Recommendations on the Exercise of Judicial Authority,</i> 63 Fordham L.Rev. 1069, 1094 (1995) (urging the opposite conclusion). Although many federal district courts have forestalled further debate by adopting local rules that authorize specific ADR procedures and outlaw others, <i>e.g.,</i> D.N.H. R. 53.1 (permitting mandatory mediation); D. Me. R. 83.11 (permitting only voluntary mediation); D. Mass. R. 16.4 (permitting mandatory summary jury trials but only voluntary mediation), the District of Puerto Rico is not among them. Thus, we have no choice but to address the question head-on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our inquiry by examining the case law. In <i>Strandell v. Jackson County,</i> 838 F.2d 884 (7th Cir.1987), the Seventh Circuit held that a district court does not possess inherent power to compel participation in a summary jury trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the court's view, Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 occupied the field and prevented a district court from forcing \"an unwilling litigant [to] be sidetracked from the normal course of litigation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 887. But the group that spearheaded the subsequent revision of Rule 16 explicitly rejected that interpretation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, advisory committee's note (1993 Amendment) (\"The [amended] rule does not attempt to resolve questions as to the extent a court would be authorized to require [ADR] proceedings as an exercise of its inherent powers.\"). Thus, we do not find <i>Strandell</i> persuasive on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Strandell</i> court also expressed concern that summary jury trials would undermine traditional discovery and privilege rules by requiring certain disclosures prior to an actual trial. 838 F.2d at 888. We find this concern unwarranted. Because a summary jury trial (like a non-binding mediation) does not require any disclosures beyond what would be required in the ordinary course of discovery, its principal disadvantage to the litigants is that it may prevent them from saving surprises for the time of trial. Since trial by ambush is no longer in vogue, that interest does not deserve protection. <i>See Fed. Reserve Bank v. Carey-Canada, Inc.,</i> 123 F.R.D. 603, 606 (D.Minn.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on policy arguments, the Sixth Circuit also has found that district courts do not possess inherent power to compel participation in summary jury trials. <i>See In re NLO, Inc.,</i> 5 F.3d 154, 157-58 (6th Cir.1993). The court thought the value of a summary jury trial questionable when parties do not engage in the process voluntarily, and it worried that \"too broad an interpretation of the federal courts' inherent power to regulate their procedure ... encourages judicial high-handedness....\" <i>Id.</i> at 158 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concerns articulated by these two respected courts plainly apply to mandatory mediation orders. When mediation is forced upon unwilling litigants, it stands to reason that the likelihood of settlement is diminished. Requiring parties to invest substantial amounts of time and money in mediation under such circumstances may well be inefficient. <i>Cf.</i> Richard A. Posner, <i>The Summary Jury Trial and Other Methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution: Some Cautionary Observations,</i> 53 U. Chi. L.Rev. 366, 369-72 (1986) (offering a model to evaluate ADR techniques in terms of their capacity to encourage settlements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact remains, however, that none of these considerations establishes that mandatory mediation is always inappropriate. There may well be specific cases in which such a protocol is likely to conserve judicial resources without significantly burdening the objectors' rights to a full, fair, and speedy trial. Much depends on the idiosyncracies of the particular case and the details of the mediation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some cases, a court may be warranted in believing that compulsory mediation could yield significant benefits even if one or more parties object. After all, a party may resist mediation simply out of unfamiliarity with the process or out of fear that a willingness to submit would be perceived as a lack of confidence in her legal position. <i>See</i> Campbell C. Hutchinson, <i>The Case for Mandatory Mediation,</i> 42 Loy. L.Rev. 85, 89-90 (1996). In such an instance, the party's initial reservations are likely to evaporate as the mediation progresses, and negotiations could well produce a beneficial outcome, at reduced cost and greater speed, than would a trial. While the possibility that parties will fail to reach agreement remains ever present, the boon of settlement can be worth the risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is particularly true in complex cases involving multiple claims and parties. The fair and expeditious resolution of such cases often is helped along by creative solutions &#8212; solutions that simply are not available in the binary framework of traditional adversarial litigation. Mediation with the assistance of a skilled facilitator gives parties an opportunity to explore a much wider range of options, including those that go beyond conventional zero-sum resolutions. Mindful of these potential advantages, we hold that it is within a district court's inherent power to order non-consensual mediation in those cases in which that step seems reasonably likely to serve the interests of justice. <i>Cf. Reilly v. United States,</i> 863 F.2d 149, 156-57 (1st Cir.1988) (finding that district courts have inherent power to appoint technical advisors in especially complex cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Mediation Order.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the district courts have inherent power to refer cases to non-binding mediation is made with a recognition that any such order must be crafted in a manner that preserves procedural fairness and shields objecting parties from undue burdens. We thus turn to the specifics of the mediation order entered in this case. As with any exercise of a district court's inherent powers, we review the entry of that order for abuse of discretion. <i>See Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 50, 111 S.Ct. 2123; <i>Reilly,</i> 863 F.2d at 156.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we agree with the lower court that the complexity of this case militates in favor of ordering mediation. At last count, the suit involves twelve parties, asserting a welter of claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims predicated on a wide variety of theories. The pendency of nearly parallel litigation in the Puerto Rican courts, which features a slightly different cast of characters and claims that are related to but not completely congruent with those asserted here, further complicates the matter. Untangling the intricate web of relationships among the parties, along with the difficult and fact-intensive arguments made by each, will be time-consuming and will impose significant costs on the parties and the court. Against this backdrop, mediation holds out the dual prospect of advantaging the litigants and conserving scarce judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to parry this thrust, APC raises a series of objections. Its threshold claim is that the district court erred in ordering mediation before resolving a pending motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (or, alternatively, to abstain). <i>See, e.g., Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Fla. Dep't of Envtl. Prot.,</i> 91 F.3d 1445, 1448-49 (11th Cir.1996) (vacating a mediation order and directing the lower court first to consider the objecting party's assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given what has transpired, this argument is fruitless. While this proceeding was pending, the district court denied the motion in question and confirmed the existence of its subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See CPA Group Int'l, Inc. v. Am. Int'l Ins. Co.,</i> No. 01-1483, slip op. at 16-25 (D.P.R. May 23, 2002). Thus, even if it were error to enter the mediation order before passing upon the motion to dismiss,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the error was harmless: it would be an empty exercise to vacate the mediation order on this ground when the lower court has already rejected the challenges to its exercise of jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., Gibbs v. Buck,</i> 307 U.S. 66, 78, 59 S.Ct. 725, 83 L.Ed. 1111 (1939); <i>Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 862 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, APC posits that the appointment of a private mediator proposed by one of the parties is per se improper (and, thus, invalidates the order). We do not agree. The district court has inherent power to \"appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties.\" <i>Ex parte Peterson,</i> 253 U.S. 300, 312, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920). In the context of non-binding mediation, the mediator does not decide the merits of the case and has no authority to coerce settlement. Thus, in the absence of a contrary statute or rule, it is perfectly acceptable for the district court to appoint a qualified and neutral private party as a mediator. The mere fact that the mediator was proposed by one of the parties is insufficient to establish bias in favor of that party. <i>Cf. TechSearch, L.L.C. v. Intel Corp.,</i> 286 F.3d 1360, 1379 n. 3 (Fed.Cir.2002) (noting that technical advisors typically would be selected from a list of candidates submitted by the parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that the litigants are free to challenge the qualifications or neutrality of any suggested mediator (whether or not nominated by a party to the case). APC, for example, had a full opportunity to present its views about the suggested mediator both in its opposition to the motion for mediation and in its motion for reconsideration of the mediation order. Despite these opportunities, APC offered no convincing reason to spark a belief that Professor Green, a nationally recognized mediator with significant experience in sprawling cases, is an unacceptable choice. When a court enters a mediation order, it necessarily makes an independent determination that the mediator it appoints is both qualified and neutral. Because the court made that implicit determination here in a manner that was procedurally fair (if not ideal), we find no abuse of discretion in its selection of Professor Green.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">APC also grouses that it should not be forced to share the costs of an unwanted mediation. We have held, however, that courts have the power under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f) to issue pretrial cost-sharing orders in complex litigation. <i>See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 994 F.2d 956, 965 (1st Cir.1993). Given the difficulties facing trial courts in cases involving multiple parties and multiple claims, we are hesitant to limit that power to the traditional discovery context. <i>See id.</i> This is especially true in complicated cases, where the potential value of mediation lies not only in promoting settlement but also in clarifying the issues remaining for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that, without default cost-sharing rules, the use of valuable ADR techniques (like mediation) becomes hostage to the parties' ability to agree on the concomitant financial arrangements. This means that the district court's inherent power to order private mediation in appropriate cases would be rendered nugatory absent the corollary power to order the sharing of reasonable mediation costs. To avoid this pitfall, we hold that the district court, in an appropriate case, is empowered to order the sharing of reasonable costs and expenses associated with mandatory non-binding mediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remainder of APC's arguments are not so easily dispatched. Even when generically appropriate, a mediation order must contain procedural and substantive safeguards to ensure fairness to all parties involved. The mediation order in this case does not quite meet that test. In particular, the order does not set limits on the duration of the mediation or the expense associated therewith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent. As entered, the order simply requires the parties to mediate; it does not set forth either a timetable for the mediation or a cap on the fees that the mediator may charge. The figures that have been bandied about in the briefs &#8212; $900 per hour or $9,000 per mediation day &#8212; are quite large and should not be left to the mediator's whim. Relatedly, because the mediator is to be paid an hourly rate, the court should have set an outside limit on the number of hours to be devoted to mediation. Equally as important, it is trite but often true that justice delayed is justice denied. An unsuccessful mediation will postpone the ultimate resolution of the case &#8212; indeed, the district court has stayed all discovery pending the completion of the mediation &#8212; and, thus, prolong the litigation. For these reasons, the district court should have set a definite time frame for the mediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents suggest that the district court did not need to articulate any limitations in its mediation order because the mediation process will remain under the district court's ultimate supervision; the court retains the ability to curtail any excessive expenditures of time or money; and a dissatisfied party can easily return to the court at any time. While this might be enough of a safeguard in many instances, the instant litigation is sufficiently complicated and the mediation efforts are likely to be sufficiently expensive that, here, reasonable time limits and fee constraints, set in advance, are appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court intent on ordering non-consensual mediation should take other precautions as well. For example, the court should make it clear (as did the able district court in this case) that participation in mediation will not be taken as a waiver of any litigation position. The important point is that the protections we have mentioned are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, but, rather, to illustrate that when a district court orders a party to participate in mediation, it should take care to assuage legitimate concerns about the possible negative consequences of such an order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we rule that a mandatory mediation order issued under the district court's inherent power is valid in an appropriate case. We also rule that this is an appropriate case. We hold, however, that the district court's failure to set reasonable limits on the duration of the mediation and on the mediator's fees dooms the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We admire the district court's pragmatic and innovative approach to this massive litigation. Our core holding &#8212; that ordering mandatory mediation is a proper exercise of a district court's inherent power, subject, however, to a variety of terms and conditions &#8212; validates that approach. We are mindful that this holding is in tension with the opinions of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits in <i>NLO</i> and <i>Strandell,</i> respectively, but we believe it is justified by the important goal of promoting flexibility and creative problem-solving in the handling of complex litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the need of the district judge in this case to construct his own mediation regime ad hoc underscores the greater need of the district court as an institution to adopt an ADR program and memorialize it in its local rules. In the ADR Act, Congress directed that \"[e]ach United States district court shall authorize, by local rule under section 2071(a), the use of alternative dispute resolution processes in all civil actions....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 651(b). While Congress did not set a firm deadline for compliance with this directive, the statute was enacted four years ago. This omission having been noted, we are confident that the district court will move expediently to bring the District of Puerto Rico into compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the district court's mediation order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The district court is free to order mediation if it continues to believe that such a course is advisable or, in the alternative, to proceed with discovery and trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded.

Mich. J.L. Reform 887, 892 (1998) (exploring the uncertainty regarding whether the CJRA expired and whether local plans adopted pursuant to it are still effective). By like token, this holding renders moot the respondents' claim that the district court could disregard Appendix III even if an ADR program were in force. <i>See</i> D.P.R. R. 105 (\"When a judge of this court issues any order in a specific case which is not consistent with these rules, such order shall constitute a suspension of these rules for such case and only to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith.\").

We hold that a court may order mandatory mediation pursuant to an explicit statutory provision or local rule. We further hold that where, as here, no such authorizing medium exists, a court nonetheless may order mandatory mediation through the use of its inherent powers as long as the case is an appropriate one and the order contains adequate safeguards. Because the mediation order here at issue lacks such safeguards (although it does not fall far short), we vacate it and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1996, Thames-Dick Superaqueduct Partners (Thames-Dick) entered into a master agreement with the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) to construct, operate, and maintain the North Coast Superaqueduct Project (the Project). Thames-Dick granted subcontracts for various portions of the work, including a subcontract for construction management to Dick Corp. of Puerto Rico (Dick-PR), a subcontract for the operation and maintenance of the Project to Thames Water International, Ltd. (Thames Water), and a subcontract for the fabrication of pipe to Atlantic Pipe Corp. (APC). After the Project had been built, a segment of the pipeline burst. Thames-Dick incurred significant costs in repairing the damage. Not surprisingly, it sought to recover those costs from other parties. In response, one of PRASA's insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in a local court to determine whether Thames-Dick's claims were covered under its policy. The litigation ballooned, soon involving a number of parties and a myriad of issues above and beyond insurance coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 25, 2001, the hostilities spilled over into federal court. Two entities beneficially interested in the master agreement &#8212; CPA Group International and Chiang, Patel &amp; Yerby, Inc. (collectively CPA) &#8212; sued Thames-Dick, Dick-PR, Thames Water, and various insurers in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, seeking remuneration for consulting services rendered in connection with repairs to the Project. A googol of claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party complaints followed. Some of these were brought against APC (the petitioner here). To complicate matters, one of the defendants moved to dismiss on grounds that, inter alia, (1) CPA had failed to join an indispensable party whose presence would destroy diversity jurisdiction, and (2) the existence of the parallel proceeding in the local court counseled in favor of abstention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this motion was pending before the district court, Thames-Dick asked that the case be referred to mediation and suggested Professor Eric Green as a suitable mediator. The district court granted the motion over APC's objection and ordered non-binding mediation to proceed before Professor Green. The court pronounced mediation likely to conserve judicial resources; directed all parties to undertake mediation in good faith; stayed discovery pending completion of the mediation; and declared that participation in the mediation would not prejudice the parties' positions vis-&#224;-vis the pending motion or the litigation as a whole. The court also stated that if mediation failed to produce a global settlement, the case would proceed to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After moving unsuccessfully for reconsideration of the mediation order, APC sought relief by way of mandamus. Its petition alleged that the district court did not have the authority to require mediation (especially in light of unresolved questions as to the court's subject-matter jurisdiction) and, in all events, could not force APC to pay a share of the expenses of the mediation. We invited the other parties and the district judge to respond. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 21(b)(4)-(5). Several entities (including Thames-Dick, Dick-P.R., and Thames Water) opposed the petition. Two others (third-party defendants United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company and United Surety and Indemnity Company) filed a brief in support of APC. We assigned the case to the oral argument calendar and stayed the contemplated mediation pending our review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to argument in this court, two notable developments occurred. First, the district court considered and rejected the challenges to its exercise of jurisdiction. Second, APC rejected an offer by Thames-Dick to pay its share of the mediator's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to shut off further debate, the respondents asseverate that mandamus is improper because APC will not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of such relief. They rest this asseveration on the notion that \"[m]andamus is ordinarily appropriate [only] in those rare cases in which the issuance (or nonissuance) of an order presents a question anent the limits of judicial power, poses some special risk of irreparable harm to the appellant, and is palpably erroneous.\" <i>United States v.

The problem, however, is that these limitations typically apply only to <i>supervisory</i> mandamus. <i>Id.</i> at 769 &amp; n. 19. In the tiny class of cases in which advisory mandamus is appropriate, irreparable harm need not be shown. <i>Id.</i> at 769-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that this case is fit for advisory mandamus because the extent of a trial court's power to order mandatory mediation presents a systemically important issue as to which this court has not yet spoken. <i>See In re Prov. Journal Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2002) (discussing criteria for advisory mandamus). Moreover, that issue is capable of significant repetition prior to effective review. <i>See</i> Jennifer O'Hearne, Comment, <i>Compelled Participation in Innovative Pretrial Proceedings,</i> 84 Nw. U.L.Rev. 290, 317 (1989) (noting that, as a practical matter, lawyers often are unable to challenge pretrial innovations even when they may be invalid). That fact militates in favor of advisory mandamus. <i>See Horn,</i> 29 F.3d at 770. We conclude, therefore, that invoking advisory mandamus is prudent under the circumstances. Consequently, the existence <i>vel non</i> of irreparable harm is a non-issue. We turn, then, to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are four potential sources of judicial authority for ordering mandatory non-binding mediation of pending cases, namely, (a) the court's local rules, (b) an applicable statute, (c) the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and (d) the court's inherent powers. Because the district court did not identify the basis of its assumed authority, we consider each of these sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Local Rules.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's local rules may provide an appropriate source of authority for ordering parties to participate in mediation. <i>See Rhea v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454836\"><a href=\"/opinion/454836/wesley-rhea-v-massey-ferguson-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 268-69 (6th Cir.1985) (per curiam). In Puerto Rico, however, the local rules contain only a single reference to any form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). That reference is embodied in the district court's Amended Civil Justice Expense and Delay Reduction Plan (CJR Plan). <i>See</i> D.P.R. R. app. III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the CJR Plan on June 14, 1993, in response to the directive contained in the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 (CJRA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 471-482. Rule V of the CJR Plan states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 473(b)(4), this Court shall adopt a method of Alternative Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\") through mediation by a judicial officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a program would allow litigants to obtain from an impartial third party &#8212; the judicial officer as mediator &#8212; a flexible non-binding, dispute resolution process to facilitate negotiations among the parties to help them reach settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.P.R. R. app. III (R. V.). In addition to specifying who may act as a mediator, Rule V also limns the proper procedure for mediation sessions and assures confidentiality. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents concede that the mediation order in this case falls outside the boundaries of the mediation program envisioned by Rule V. It does so most noticeably because it involves mediation before a private mediator, not a judicial officer. Seizing upon this discrepancy, APC argues that the local rules limit the district court in this respect, and that the court exceeded its authority thereunder by issuing a non-conforming mediation order (i.e., one that contemplates the intervention of a private mediator). The respondents counter by arguing that the rule does not bind the district court because, notwithstanding the unambiguous promise of the CJR Plan (which declares that the district court \"shall adopt a method of Alternative Dispute Resolution\"), no such program has been adopted to date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a powerful argument. APC does not contradict the respondents' assurance that the relevant portion of the CJR Plan has remained unimplemented, and we take judicial notice that there is no formal, ongoing ADR program in the Puerto Rico federal district court. Because that is so, we conclude that the District of Puerto Rico has no local rule in force that dictates the permissible characteristics of mediation orders. Consequently, APC's argument founders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The ADR Act.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is only one potential source of statutory authority for ordering mandatory non-binding mediation here: the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 (ADR Act), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 651-658. Congress passed the ADR Act to promote the utilization of alternative dispute resolution methods in the federal courts and to set appropriate guidelines for their use. The Act lists mediation as an appropriate ADR process. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 651(a). Moreover, it sanctions the participation of \"professional neutrals from the private sector\" as mediators. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 653(b). Finally, the Act requires district courts to obtain litigants' consent only when they order arbitration, <i>id.</i> &#167; 652(a), not when they order the use of other ADR mechanisms (such as non-binding mediation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the broad sweep of these provisions, the Act is quite clear that some form of the ADR procedures it endorses must be adopted in each judicial district by local rule. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 651(b) (directing each district court to \"devise and implement its own alternative dispute resolution program, by local rule adopted under [28 U.S.C.] section 2071(a), to encourage and promote the use of alternative dispute resolution in its district\"). In the absence of such local rules, the ADR Act itself does not authorize any specific court to use a particular ADR mechanism. Because the District of Puerto Rico has not yet complied with the Act's mandate, the mediation order here at issue cannot be justified under the ADR Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents essay an end run around this lacuna: they contend (borrowing a phrase from the court below) that the \"spirit\" of the ADR Act authorizes the mediation order because the Act was intended to promote experimentation with ADR techniques. We reject this attempt to press the ADR Act into service by indirection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the ADR Act was designed to promote the use of ADR techniques, Congress chose a very well-defined path: it granted each judicial district, rather than each individual judge, the authority to craft an appropriate ADR program. In other words, Congress permitted experimentation, but only within the disciplining format of district-wide local rules adopted with notice and a full opportunity for public comment. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2071(b). To say that the Act authorized each district judge to disregard a district-wide ADR plan (or the absence of one) and fashion innovative procedures for use in specific cases is simply too much of a stretch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, however, that although the respondents cannot use the ADR Act as a justification, neither can APC use it as a nullification. Noting that the Act requires the adoption of local rules establishing a formal ADR program, APC equates the absence of such rules with the absence of power to employ an ADR procedure (say, mediation) in a specific case. But that is wishful thinking: if one assumes that district judges possessed the power to require mediation prior to the passage of the ADR Act, there is nothing in the Act that strips them of that power. After all, even the adoption of a federal procedural rule does not implicitly abrogate a district court's inherent power to act merely because the rule touches upon the same subject matter. <i>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 42-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Romero-Barcelo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110699\"><a href=\"/opinion/110699/weinberger-v-romero-barcelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 313, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110699\"><a href=\"/opinion/110699/weinberger-v-romero-barcelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span> (1982). Not so here: we know of nothing in either the ADR Act or the policies that undergird it that can be said to restrict the district courts' authority to engage in the case-by-case deployment of ADR procedures. Hence, we conclude that where, as here, there are no implementing local rules, the ADR Act neither authorizes nor prohibits the entry of a mandatory mediation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Civil Rules.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents next argue that the district court possessed the authority to require mediation by virtue of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They concentrate their attention on Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, which states in pertinent part that \"the court may take appropriate action[] with respect to ... (9) settlement and the use of special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule....\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(9). But the words \"when authorized by statute or local rule\" are a frank limitation on the district courts' authority to order mediation thereunder,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and we must adhere to that circumscription. <i>See Schlagenhauf v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span>, 121, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></span> (1964) (explaining that the Civil Rules \"should not be expanded by disregarding plainly expressed limitations\"). Because there is no statute or local rule authorizing mandatory private mediation in the District of Puerto Rico, <i>see supra</i> Parts III(A)-(B), Rule 16(c)(9) does not assist the respondents' cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Inherent Powers.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even apart from positive law, district courts have substantial inherent power to manage and control their calendars. <i>See Link,</i> 370 U.S. at 630-31, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1386</span></span>; <i>see generally Brockton Sav. Bank v.

This inherent power takes many forms. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(b) (providing that judges may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law and applicable rules). By way of illustration, a district court may use its inherent power to compel represented clients to attend pretrial settlement conferences, even though such a practice is not specifically authorized in the Civil Rules. <i>See Heileman Brewing Co. v. Joseph Oat Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520636\"><a href=\"/opinion/520636/g-heileman-brewing-co-inc-v-joseph-oat-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 650 (7th Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a district court's inherent powers are not infinite. There are at least four limiting principles. First, inherent powers must be used in a way reasonably suited to the enhancement of the court's processes, including the orderly and expeditious disposition of pending cases. <i>Coyante v. P.R. Ports Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197171\"><a href=\"/opinion/197171/coyante-v-pr-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1997). Second, inherent powers cannot be exercised in a manner that contradicts an applicable statute or rule. <i>Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Third, the use of inherent powers must comport with procedural fairness. <i>Id.</i> at 50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And, finally, inherent powers \"must be exercised with restraint and discretion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ponte, <i>Putting Mandatory Summary Jury Trial Back on the Docket: Recommendations on the Exercise of Judicial Authority,</i> 63 Fordham L.Rev. 1069, 1094 (1995) (urging the opposite conclusion). Although many federal district courts have forestalled further debate by adopting local rules that authorize specific ADR procedures and outlaw others, <i>e.g.,</i> D.N.H. R. 53.1 (permitting mandatory mediation); D. Me. R. 83.11 (permitting only voluntary mediation); D. Mass. R. 16.4 (permitting mandatory summary jury trials but only voluntary mediation), the District of Puerto Rico is not among them. Thus, we have no choice but to address the question head-on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our inquiry by examining the case law. In <i>Strandell v. Jackson County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501226\"><a href=\"/opinion/501226/in-the-matter-of-alex-strandell-v-jackson-county-illinois-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1987), the Seventh Circuit held that a district court does not possess inherent power to compel participation in a summary jury trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the court's view, Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 occupied the field and prevented a district court from forcing \"an unwilling litigant [to] be sidetracked from the normal course of litigation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 887. But the group that spearheaded the subsequent revision of Rule 16 explicitly rejected that interpretation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 16, advisory committee's note (1993 Amendment) (\"The [amended] rule does not attempt to resolve questions as to the extent a court would be authorized to require [ADR] proceedings as an exercise of its inherent powers.\"). Thus, we do not find <i>Strandell</i> persuasive on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Strandell</i> court also expressed concern that summary jury trials would undermine traditional discovery and privilege rules by requiring certain disclosures prior to an actual trial. 838 F.2d at 888. We find this concern unwarranted. Because a summary jury trial (like a non-binding mediation) does not require any disclosures beyond what would be required in the ordinary course of discovery, its principal disadvantage to the litigants is that it may prevent them from saving surprises for the time of trial. Since trial by ambush is no longer in vogue, that interest does not deserve protection. <i>See Fed. Reserve Bank v. Carey-Canada, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></span>, 606 (D.Minn.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on policy arguments, the Sixth Circuit also has found that district courts do not possess inherent power to compel participation in summary jury trials. <i>See In re NLO, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"652937\"><a href=\"/opinion/652937/in-re-nlo-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 157-58 (6th Cir.1993). The court thought the value of a summary jury trial questionable when parties do not engage in the process voluntarily, and it worried that \"too broad an interpretation of the federal courts' inherent power to regulate their procedure ... encourages judicial high-handedness....\" <i>Id.</i> at 158 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concerns articulated by these two respected courts plainly apply to mandatory mediation orders. When mediation is forced upon unwilling litigants, it stands to reason that the likelihood of settlement is diminished. Requiring parties to invest substantial amounts of time and money in mediation under such circumstances may well be inefficient. <i>Cf.</i> Richard A. Posner, <i>The Summary Jury Trial and Other Methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution: Some Cautionary Observations,</i> 53 U. Chi. L.Rev. 366, 369-72 (1986) (offering a model to evaluate ADR techniques in terms of their capacity to encourage settlements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact remains, however, that none of these considerations establishes that mandatory mediation is always inappropriate. There may well be specific cases in which such a protocol is likely to conserve judicial resources without significantly burdening the objectors' rights to a full, fair, and speedy trial. Much depends on the idiosyncracies of the particular case and the details of the mediation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some cases, a court may be warranted in believing that compulsory mediation could yield significant benefits even if one or more parties object. After all, a party may resist mediation simply out of unfamiliarity with the process or out of fear that a willingness to submit would be perceived as a lack of confidence in her legal position. <i>See</i> Campbell C. Hutchinson, <i>The Case for Mandatory Mediation,</i> 42 Loy. L.Rev. 85, 89-90 (1996). In such an instance, the party's initial reservations are likely to evaporate as the mediation progresses, and negotiations could well produce a beneficial outcome, at reduced cost and greater speed, than would a trial. While the possibility that parties will fail to reach agreement remains ever present, the boon of settlement can be worth the risk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is particularly true in complex cases involving multiple claims and parties. The fair and expeditious resolution of such cases often is helped along by creative solutions &#8212; solutions that simply are not available in the binary framework of traditional adversarial litigation. Mediation with the assistance of a skilled facilitator gives parties an opportunity to explore a much wider range of options, including those that go beyond conventional zero-sum resolutions. Mindful of these potential advantages, we hold that it is within a district court's inherent power to order non-consensual mediation in those cases in which that step seems reasonably likely to serve the interests of justice. <i>Cf. Reilly v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515719\"><a href=\"/opinion/515719/donna-reilly-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 156-57 (1st Cir.1988) (finding that district courts have inherent power to appoint technical advisors in especially complex cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Mediation Order.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the district courts have inherent power to refer cases to non-binding mediation is made with a recognition that any such order must be crafted in a manner that preserves procedural fairness and shields objecting parties from undue burdens. We thus turn to the specifics of the mediation order entered in this case. As with any exercise of a district court's inherent powers, we review the entry of that order for abuse of discretion. <i>See Chambers,</i> 501 U.S. at 50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2123</span></a></span>; <i>Reilly,</i> 863 F.2d at 156.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we agree with the lower court that the complexity of this case militates in favor of ordering mediation. At last count, the suit involves twelve parties, asserting a welter of claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims predicated on a wide variety of theories. The pendency of nearly parallel litigation in the Puerto Rican courts, which features a slightly different cast of characters and claims that are related to but not completely congruent with those asserted here, further complicates the matter. Untangling the intricate web of relationships among the parties, along with the difficult and fact-intensive arguments made by each, will be time-consuming and will impose significant costs on the parties and the court. Against this backdrop, mediation holds out the dual prospect of advantaging the litigants and conserving scarce judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to parry this thrust, APC raises a series of objections. Its threshold claim is that the district court erred in ordering mediation before resolving a pending motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (or, alternatively, to abstain). <i>See, e.g., Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Fla. Dep't of Envtl. Prot.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71172\"><a href=\"/opinion/71172/tug-capt-fred-v-fl-deptenviron/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1445</span></a></span>, 1448-49 (11th Cir.1996) (vacating a mediation order and directing the lower court first to consider the objecting party's assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given what has transpired, this argument is fruitless. While this proceeding was pending, the district court denied the motion in question and confirmed the existence of its subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See CPA Group Int'l, Inc. v. Am. Int'l Ins. Co.,</i> No. 01-1483, slip op. at 16-25 (D.P.R. May 23, 2002). Thus, even if it were error to enter the mediation order before passing upon the motion to dismiss,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the error was harmless: it would be an empty exercise to vacate the mediation order on this ground when the lower court has already rejected the challenges to its exercise of jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., Gibbs v. Buck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103195\"><a href=\"/opinion/103195/gibbs-v-buck/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 78, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We do not agree. The district court has inherent power to \"appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties.\" <i>Ex parte Peterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99615\"><a href=\"/opinion/99615/ex-parte-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 312, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></span> (1920). In the context of non-binding mediation, the mediator does not decide the merits of the case and has no authority to coerce settlement. Thus, in the absence of a contrary statute or rule, it is perfectly acceptable for the district court to appoint a qualified and neutral private party as a mediator. The mere fact that the mediator was proposed by one of the parties is insufficient to establish bias in favor of that party. <i>Cf. TechSearch, L.L.C. v. Intel Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777304\"><a href=\"/opinion/777304/techsearch-llc-v-intel-corporation-defendant-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1360</span></a></span>, 1379 n. 3 (Fed.Cir.2002) (noting that technical advisors typically would be selected from a list of candidates submitted by the parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that the litigants are free to challenge the qualifications or neutrality of any suggested mediator (whether or not nominated by a party to the case). APC, for example, had a full opportunity to present its views about the suggested mediator both in its opposition to the motion for mediation and in its motion for reconsideration of the mediation order. Despite these opportunities, APC offered no convincing reason to spark a belief that Professor Green, a nationally recognized mediator with significant experience in sprawling cases, is an unacceptable choice. When a court enters a mediation order, it necessarily makes an independent determination that the mediator it appoints is both qualified and neutral. Because the court made that implicit determination here in a manner that was procedurally fair (if not ideal), we find no abuse of discretion in its selection of Professor Green.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">APC also grouses that it should not be forced to share the costs of an unwanted mediation. We have held, however, that courts have the power under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(f) to issue pretrial cost-sharing orders in complex litigation. <i>See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608082\"><a href=\"/opinion/608082/in-re-two-appeals-arising-out-of-the-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 965 (1st Cir.1993). Given the difficulties facing trial courts in cases involving multiple parties and multiple claims, we are hesitant to limit that power to the traditional discovery context. <i>See id.</i> This is especially true in complicated cases, where the potential value of mediation lies not only in promoting settlement but also in clarifying the issues remaining for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that, without default cost-sharing rules, the use of valuable ADR techniques (like mediation) becomes hostage to the parties' ability to agree on the concomitant financial arrangements. This means that the district court's inherent power to order private mediation in appropriate cases would be rendered nugatory absent the corollary power to order the sharing of reasonable mediation costs. To avoid this pitfall, we hold that the district court, in an appropriate case, is empowered to order the sharing of reasonable costs and expenses associated with mandatory non-binding mediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remainder of APC's arguments are not so easily dispatched. Even when generically appropriate, a mediation order must contain procedural and substantive safeguards to ensure fairness to all parties involved. The mediation order in this case does not quite meet that test. In particular, the order does not set limits on the duration of the mediation or the expense associated therewith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent. As entered, the order simply requires the parties to mediate; it does not set forth either a timetable for the mediation or a cap on the fees that the mediator may charge. The figures that have been bandied about in the briefs &#8212; $900 per hour or $9,000 per mediation day &#8212; are quite large and should not be left to the mediator's whim. Relatedly, because the mediator is to be paid an hourly rate, the court should have set an outside limit on the number of hours to be devoted to mediation. Equally as important, it is trite but often true that justice delayed is justice denied. An unsuccessful mediation will postpone the ultimate resolution of the case &#8212; indeed, the district court has stayed all discovery pending the completion of the mediation &#8212; and, thus, prolong the litigation. For these reasons, the district court should have set a definite time frame for the mediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondents suggest that the district court did not need to articulate any limitations in its mediation order because the mediation process will remain under the district court's ultimate supervision; the court retains the ability to curtail any excessive expenditures of time or money; and a dissatisfied party can easily return to the court at any time. While this might be enough of a safeguard in many instances, the instant litigation is sufficiently complicated and the mediation efforts are likely to be sufficiently expensive that, here, reasonable time limits and fee constraints, set in advance, are appropriate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court intent on ordering non-consensual mediation should take other precautions as well. For example, the court should make it clear (as did the able district court in this case) that participation in mediation will not be taken as a waiver of any litigation position. The important point is that the protections we have mentioned are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, but, rather, to illustrate that when a district court orders a party to participate in mediation, it should take care to assuage legitimate concerns about the possible negative consequences of such an order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we rule that a mandatory mediation order issued under the district court's inherent power is valid in an appropriate case. We also rule that this is an appropriate case. We hold, however, that the district court's failure to set reasonable limits on the duration of the mediation and on the mediator's fees dooms the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We admire the district court's pragmatic and innovative approach to this massive litigation. Our core holding &#8212; that ordering mandatory mediation is a proper exercise of a district court's inherent power, subject, however, to a variety of terms and conditions &#8212; validates that approach. We are mindful that this holding is in tension with the opinions of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits in <i>NLO</i> and <i>Strandell,</i> respectively, but we believe it is justified by the important goal of promoting flexibility and creative problem-solving in the handling of complex litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, the need of the district judge in this case to construct his own mediation regime ad hoc underscores the greater need of the district court as an institution to adopt an ADR program and memorialize it in its local rules. In the ADR Act, Congress directed that \"[e]ach United States district court shall authorize, by local rule under section 2071(a), the use of alternative dispute resolution processes in all civil actions....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 651(b). While Congress did not set a firm deadline for compliance with this directive, the statute was enacted four years ago. This omission having been noted, we are confident that the district court will move expediently to bring the District of Puerto Rico into compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the district court's mediation order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The district court is free to order mediation if it continues to believe that such a course is advisable or, in the alternative, to proceed with discovery and trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded. Costs shall be taxed in favor of the petitioner.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the petition seeks the issuance of a writ of mandamus, the relief sought is more in the nature of a writ of prohibition.

Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674595\"><a href=\"/opinion/674595/united-states-v-richard-a-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 769 n. 18 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This holding renders it unnecessary for us to discuss the respondents' alternate contention that the CJR Plan is a dead letter because the legislation that prompted its enactment &#8212; the CJRA &#8212; expired in 1997<i>See, e.g.,</i> Carl Tobias, <i>Did the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 Actually Expire?,</i> 31 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 887, 892 (1998) (exploring the uncertainty regarding whether the CJRA expired and whether local plans adopted pursuant to it are still effective). By like token, this holding renders moot the respondents' claim that the district court could disregard Appendix III even if an ADR program were in force. <i>See</i> D.P.R. R. 105 (\"When a judge of this court issues any order in a specific case which is not consistent with these rules, such order shall constitute a suspension of these rules for such case and only to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith.\").
