Tehan, Jr. with whom Jonathan M. Silverstein and\nKopelman and Paige, P.C. were on brief for appellant.\n     David J. Bolton, Jr. pro se.\n\n\n\n                          May 4, 2004\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge.         On October 25, 1999, at about 10\n\na.m., David Bolton--later the plaintiff in this civil rights case--\n\npulled up to a gas station at the corner of Sawyer and Purchase\n\nStreets in New Bedford, Massachusetts.          A woman named Sandra Swain\n\ngot out of Bolton's car.         These events took place in sight of\n\npolice officer Stephen Taylor--the prime defendant in this case--\n\nwho was rolling up to the intersection in his police car and said\n\nthat he knew Swain to be a prostitute who plied her trade on the\n\ncorner and that she was also a drug addict.\n\n           According to Taylor's later testimony, Swain gave Taylor\n\na \"mischievous smile\"--\"maybe 'you caught me' or something to that\n\neffect.\"    Then, according to Taylor, Bolton gave him a quick\n\nglance, looked away, appeared \"nervous,\" and left the parking lot\n\nwith squealing tires and at a \"high rate of speed.\"                  Taylor\n\nfollowed and eventually pulled Bolton over. These supposed details\n\nwere not contested by Bolton at trial, except for Taylor's claim of\n\nsquealing tires.\n\n           After Bolton was stopped, an altercation followed between\n\nBolton, Taylor and several policemen who appeared in another police\n\ncar. Bolton and Taylor gave different versions as to how it began,\n\neach blaming the other, but there is no doubt that Bolton was\n\nthrown down, struck and suffered severe injuries.            Taylor sought\n\nprosecution   of   Bolton   on   five   state   charges,   and   Bolton   was\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fconvicted by a jury on two of them: assault and battery on a police\n\nofficer and disturbing the peace.\n\n           In due course Bolton brought the present action under\n\nsection 1983 against Taylor, two other officers, the police chief\n\nand the City of New Bedford.         42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).     Eventually\n\nthe case went to trial on just two claims.          One was a false arrest\n\nclaim against Taylor and another officer, transmuted along the way\n\ninto a claim that Taylor had engaged in an unlawful Terry stop.\n\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).           The other was a claim against\n\nthe same two officers for use of excessive force.\n\n           The    jury    returned   a   verdict   against    Taylor   on   the\n\nunlawful stop claim, awarding Bolton $175,000.          The jury found for\n\nthe defendants in all other respects, specifically rejecting the\n\ncharge of excessive force. The district court required a reduction\n\nof the award to $17,500 by remittitur, which Bolton accepted to\n\navoid a new trial.        Taylor now appeals, claiming inter alia that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to support liability.                Only this\n\nfirst ground of the appeal need be addressed.\n\n           Claims    of    insufficient     evidence   must   ordinarily     be\n\npreserved by a timely motion at trial for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50; Davignon v. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).      In one of Taylor's post-trial motions, he represents\n\nthat he made a motion at trial both at the close of the plaintiff’s\n\ncase and at the close of all evidence.              Although at trial his\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcounsel did not spell out the contents of the motions, it is\n\nreasonably    clear     that    counsel   and   the   district     court   judge\n\nunderstood the oral motions as directed to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.\n\n            This brings us to the merits. The background legal rules\n\nare straightforward.           At the time of the stop, Taylor lacked\n\n“probable cause” to believe that Bolton had committed an offense,\n\nbut under the Terry doctrine, Taylor could pull Bolton over for a\n\ncomparatively brief “investigative stop” on less than probable\n\ncause.    See Flowers v. Fiore, 359 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nWhat Terry requires to satisfy the Fourth Amendment’s reasonable\n\nseizure standard is an “articulable suspicion”–-meaning a rational\n\nreason (as opposed to a hunch) to suspect criminal activity.\n\nIllinois v. Wardlow,       528 U.S. 119, 123-24 (2000).\n\n            Whether a reasonable suspicion exists is treated as an\n\nobjective inquiry: the actual motive or thought process of the\n\nofficer is not plumbed.        Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813\n\n(1996).      So   the   only    pertinent   “facts”    are   the   information\n\navailable to the officer. If this is disputed, the jury’s findings\n\ncontrol unless clearly erroneous, see Ornelas v. United States, 517\n\nU.S. 690, 696-97 (1996); United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1020 (1996), but in this\n\ncase what Taylor saw and knew is not contested, apart from the\n\nquestion whether Bolton’s tires squealed.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f          What deference, then, is to be given to the jury’s\n\nfurther judgment as to the ultimate question: whether on known or\n\nresolved facts a reasonable suspicion of the defendant was not\n\nwarranted?   Strictly speaking, the application of an abstract\n\nstandard to known facts is a legal issue even though it is\n\nsometimes called a mixed question or question of law application,\n\ne.g., City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526\n\nU.S. 687, 721 (1999); but usually some measure of deference is\n\ngiven to the factfinder, because the jury or trial judge is closer\n\nto the situation and unique facts diminish precedential value.1\n\n          However, there are exceptions and the Supreme Court has\n\nprovided that no deference should be given to the fact-finder as to\n\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion where the raw facts are\n\nundisputed or settled and the only issue is one of law application.\n\nsee Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 696-97; United States v. Maguire, 359 F.3d\n\n71, 76 (1st Cir. 2004).   Although the Ornelas case involved a judge\n\nas fact-finder, it would make no sense to defer on law application\n\nto the jury but not to the trial judge.    See Johnson v. Campbell,\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distributors, Inc., 361 F.3d 50,\n57 & n.4 (1st Cir. 2004).     Sometimes the standard of review is\ndescribed as one of reasonableness, e.g., United States v.\nPadilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 597 n.3 (1st Cir. 2003), but in\ntruth the degree of deference tends to vary with the circumstances,\nIn re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                 -5-\n\f332 F.3d 199, 204-09 (3d Cir. 2003); Bell v. Irwin, 321 F.3d 637,\n\n640 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 84 (2003).2\n\n          In this case, we come reluctantly to the view that a\n\npoliceman in Taylor’s position was entitled to have a reasonable\n\nsuspicion that Bolton had engaged in criminal activity.      It is\n\ndoubtful whether Taylor was motivated by any such belief, and his\n\nconduct may well have been deplorable; we shall return to these\n\nissues in due course.   But under Fourth Amendment precedents, the\n\ndecisive question is whether an objective observer could have had\n\na reasonable suspicion, and to this question our answer is yes.\n\n          At trial and in his appellate brief, Taylor said or\n\nimplied that Bolton might reasonably have been suspected of four\n\ndifferent crimes: buying drugs from or selling them to Swain;\n\ndriving under the influence of drugs; speeding or reckless driving;\n\nor soliciting prostitution.    Taylor never says that any one of\n\nthese possibilities was in his mind at the time or that any or all\n\nof them motivated his decision.   Typical of his testimony is the\n\nfollowing passage:\n\n          Again, it was the totality of the whole\n          circumstance.    Sandra Swain being in the\n          vehicle, a high crime area, he's squealing the\n          tires out of the parking lot, he's not looking\n\n\n     2\n      Another circuit has said that in light of Ornelas, it is\npointless to submit the reasonable suspicion or probable cause\nquestions to the jury at all unless the facts are disputed. See\nBell, 321 F.3d at 640. Because in this case there were at least\nsome details actually or potentially disputed, we need not pursue\nthis issue.\n\n                                -6-\n\f          at me, seems kind of nervous, you know,\n          doesn't want to make eye contact with me. As\n          soon as he rips out of there, I don't know . .\n          . what he's holding, if he wants to throw\n          something out of the car.     There's a whole\n          myriad of things that could be happening.\n\n          The   supposed     drug    related   crimes     can    readily   be\n\ndisregarded.    Taylor apparently knew Swain was a drug user but\n\nthere is no evidence, and no basis for suspicion, that Swain was a\n\nsupplier to anyone or that Bolton (in fact a lobsterman with his\n\nown boat) was supplying Swain with drugs.            The notion that Bolton\n\nhad drugs (“I don’t know what he’s holding”) or was driving under\n\ntheir influence (elsewhere implied by Taylor) is equally without\n\nany basis even for suspicion.\n\n          The   suggestion    that    Bolton   was    speeding   or   driving\n\nunsafely is also unsupported. Taylor testified that Bolton’s tires\n\nsquealed as he left the lot and that he was traveling fast, but\n\nTaylor never states that Bolton was exceeding the speed limit, and\n\nTaylor never charged Bolton with speeding. Moreover, Bolton denied\n\nthat he was speeding, a fact we must assume that the jury decided\n\nin Bolton's favor.   Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. P.R. Sun Oil\n\nCo., 295 F.3d 68, 84 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          This leaves as the only remaining crime the possibility\n\nthat Bolton had solicited Swain’s services as a prostitute–-a crime\n\nto be sure, Commonwealth v. King, 372 N.E.2d 196, 203 (Mass. 1977),\n\nalthough one often ignored. Here, the evidence available to Taylor\n\nwas thin but not non-existent: Swain was known to be a prostitute;\n\n                                     -7-\n\fBolton was letting her out of his car at her known haunt; the\n\ndemeanor of both Bolton and Swain (according to Taylor’s un-\n\nrebutted testimony quoted above) was faintly suspicious; and Bolton\n\nleft   very    quickly   on   seeing   Taylor,   even   if   not   unlawfully\n\nspeeding.\n\n              Is this enough to give an officer a reasonable suspicion\n\nthat Bolton had solicited sexual favors from a prostitute?                Two\n\npoints work in Taylor’s favor.          One is that the required level of\n\nsuspicion for a Terry stop and brief inquiry is fairly low.\n\nWardlow, 528 U.S. at 123-25.           The other factor is that the law\n\nimputes to a trained policeman a measure of expertise, Ornelas, 517\n\nU.S. at 699-700, and an explainable suspicion can be based on an\n\nassemblage of clues viewed through the lens of the policeman’s\n\ntraining and experience.       United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 9-\n\n10 (1989).\n\n              Here, Bolton was seen parting from a known prostitute at\n\nher usual beat, and the natural inference was reinforced by the\n\npair's alleged suspicious demeanor and Bolton’s rapid departure.\n\nSo, on de novo review, we think that Taylor could have had a\n\nreasonable suspicion–-nothing more–-that Bolton had been consorting\n\nwith Swain and instituted a Terry stop to ask Bolton what had\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\foccurred between him and Swain.    Case law has allowed Terry stops\n\non no greater suspicion.3\n\n          Why then does this outcome leave a sour taste?           It is\n\nprimarily because Taylor apparently did not halt Bolton because\n\nTaylor was interested in investigating whether Bolton had committed\n\nthe crime of soliciting a prostitute.       Taylor himself testified\n\nthat arresting customers of prostitutes “does not interest me,”\n\nthat \"I have never arrested a prostitute in my nine years,” and\n\nthat \"[w]e are too busy in our city to get involved with that type\n\nof police work. . . .       We don't have–-we don't have the time.\n\nThat's why narcotics and vice handle that type of situation.\"\n\n          Worse still, at trial Bolton testified that he had merely\n\noffered Swain a ride because she said that she was sick.         Taylor’s\n\ncounsel in turn called Swain as a witness and she testified that\n\nshe had consorted with Bolton on the morning in question and at\n\nother times.    In   response,   over   objection   from   the   defense,\n\nBolton’s counsel then read transcripts of an earlier interview\n\ngiven by Swain to the police.       After the close of plaintiff's\n\nevidence, Bolton's counsel was allowed, over objection, to play a\n\ntape of Swain's interview.\n\n\n\n     3\n      Compare United States v. Martin, 289 F.3d 392, 399 (6th Cir.\n2002) (prostitute flagging down motorist), and State v. Lipscomb,\n779 A.2d 88, 94 (Conn. 2001) (same), with United States v. Gray,\n213 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (8th Cir. 2000) (presence in area of\nprostitution), and Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 262-64 (1st Cir.\n1992) (presence in area where drug dealer arrested).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          In the interview, Swain had told a police investigator\n\nlooking into the Bolton-Taylor incident that Taylor and other\n\nofficers made a regular habit of harassing Swain’s clients.    She\n\nintimated that the officers did so not to effect arrests but merely\n\nout of humor or malice.   Bolton’s counsel invoked this evidence in\n\nher closing.   On appeal, Taylor says it was error to admit the\n\ntape, arguing inter alia that its impeachment value was outweighed\n\nby its prejudicial impact, see Fed. R. Evid. 403, and its offer in\n\nevidence was unfairly instigated by the trial judge after Bolton\n\nhad rested.\n\n          Whether or not the tape was admissible to impeach Swain’s\n\ncourtroom testimony, it might well have persuaded the jury of\n\nTaylor’s actual motive for stopping Bolton even though--being\n\nhearsay--it was not admissible for its truth.4   After all, Taylor\n\nhad testified that he was not interested in prostitution, and his\n\nother supposed suspicions were even less plausible.     If the law\n\nheld Taylor responsible for making a Terry stop subjectively\n\nmotivated by a wrongful purpose, the verdict against Taylor might\n\nbe defended.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      There is an exception to the hearsay bar, associated with\nUnited States v. De Sisto, 329 F.2d 929, 933-34 (2d Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 377 U.S. 979 (1964), now codified in Fed. R. Evid.\n801(d)(1)(A), but there is no indication that its requirements were\nmet in this case.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f            Unfortunately for Bolton, Whren’s ”objective\" standard in\n\nFourth Amendment cases seemingly makes subjective motive irrelevant\n\nin all such cases, 517 U.S. at 813; not only can the police invoke\n\na minor traffic violation for an arrest actually prompted by other\n\nlaw-enforcement aims (e.g., the driver is a known drug dealer whom\n\nthe police wish to surveil) but it is even irrelevant--at least\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment, equal protection claims may be a\n\ndifferent   matter,   id.--whether      the   same   traffic   violation    is\n\nnormally    invoked   against   other    drivers,     so   long   as   it   is\n\ntechnically a violation.    See 1 La Fave, Search & Seizure § 1.4 (3d\n\ned. 1996, Supp. 2004) (deploring Whren).\n\n            In Holland v. City of Portland, 102 F.3d 6, 9-11 (1st\n\nCir. 1996), this court formally reserved the question whether any\n\nsubjective motive for a stop or arrest could be so bad as to\n\novercome Whren's bar. We expressed grave doubt that Whren admitted\n\nof exceptions, but noted that, in Holland itself, there was no\n\ncompelling evidence of harassment, id. at 11; here, there was\n\nevidence of a sort, but it was not admissible for its truth so the\n\nsituation is about the same.      Nothing since Holland suggests any\n\nerosion of Whren.\n\n            What this means is that Bolton cannot collect the $17,500\n\njudgment to which his larger award was reduced, and we need not\n\nreach Taylor’s other claims of alleged error such as the admission\n\nof the tape.   Taylor may well have lacked any proper intent, but a\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\freasonable police officer could have performed a lawful Terry stop\n\nbased on what Taylor knew.    That said, we join in the view–-\n\nobviously shared by the district judge and the jury–-that Bolton\n\nwas badly treated by the police.\n\n          The judgment in Bolton's favor is vacated.   The case is\n\nremanded for entry of judgment in Taylor's favor.   Each side shall\n\nbear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

The district court required a reduction of the award to $17,500 by remittitur, which Bolton accepted to avoid a new trial. Taylor now appeals, claiming <i>inter alia</i> that the evidence was insufficient to support liability. Only this first ground of the appeal need be addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims of insufficient evidence must ordinarily be preserved by a timely motion at trial for judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50; <i>Davignon v. Clemmey,</i> 322 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2003). In one of Taylor's post-trial motions, he represents that he made a motion at trial both at the close of the plaintiff's case and at the close of all evidence. Although at trial his counsel did not spell out the contents of the motions, it is reasonably clear that counsel and the district court judge understood the oral motions as directed to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the merits. The background legal rules are straightforward. At the time of the stop, Taylor lacked \"probable cause\" to believe that Bolton had committed an offense, but under the <i>Terry</i> doctrine, Taylor could pull Bolton over for a comparatively brief \"investigative stop\" on less than probable cause. <i>See Flowers v. Fiore,</i> 359 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.2004). What <i>Terry</i> requires to satisfy the Fourth Amendment's reasonable seizure standard is an \"articulable suspicion\" &#8212; meaning a rational reason (as opposed to a hunch) to suspect criminal activity. <i>Illinois v. Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. 119, 123-24, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a reasonable suspicion exists is treated as an objective inquiry: the actual motive or thought process of the officer is not plumbed. <i>Whren v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). So the only pertinent \"facts\" are the information available to the officer. If this is disputed, the jury's findings control unless clearly erroneous, <i>see Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 696-97, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <i>United States v. Tibolt,</i> 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir.1995), <i>cert. denied,</i> 518 U.S. 1020, 116 S.Ct. 2554, 135 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1996), but in this case what Taylor saw and knew is not contested, apart from the question whether Bolton's tires squealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What deference, then, is to be given to the jury's further judgment as to the ultimate question: whether on known or resolved facts a reasonable suspicion of the defendant was not warranted? Strictly speaking, the application of an abstract standard to known facts is a legal issue even though it is sometimes called a mixed question or question of law application, <i>e.g., City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.,</i> 526 U.S. 687, 721, 119 S.Ct. 1624, 143 L.Ed.2d 882 (1999); but usually some measure of deference is given to the factfinder, because the jury or trial judge is closer to the situation and unique facts diminish precedential value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, there are exceptions and the Supreme Court has provided that no deference should be given to the fact-finder as to probable cause or reasonable suspicion where the raw facts are undisputed or settled and the only issue is one of law application. <i>see Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 696-97, 116 S.Ct. 1657; <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> 359 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.2004). Although the <i>Ornelas</i> case involved a judge as fact-finder, it would make no sense to defer on law application to the jury but not to the trial judge. <i>See Johnson v. Campbell,</i> 332 F.3d 199, 204-09 (3d Cir.2003); <i>Bell v. Irwin,</i> 321 F.3d 637, 640 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 818, 124 S.Ct. 84, 157 L.Ed.2d 36 (2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we come reluctantly to the view that a policeman in Taylor's position was entitled to have a reasonable suspicion that Bolton had engaged in criminal activity. It is doubtful whether Taylor was motivated by any such belief, and his conduct may well have been deplorable; we shall return to these issues in due course. But under Fourth Amendment precedents, the decisive question is whether an objective observer could have had a reasonable suspicion, and to this question our answer is yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial and in his appellate brief, Taylor said or implied that Bolton might reasonably have been suspected of four different crimes: buying drugs from or selling them to Swain; driving under the influence of drugs; speeding or reckless driving; or soliciting prostitution. Taylor never says that any one of these possibilities was in his mind at the time or that any or all of them motivated his decision. Typical of his testimony is the following passage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, it was the totality of the whole circumstance. Sandra Swain being in the vehicle, a high crime area, he's squealing the tires out of the parking lot, he's not looking at me, seems kind of nervous, you know, doesn't want to make eye contact with me. As soon as he rips out of there, I don't know ... what he's holding, if he wants to throw something out of the car. There's a whole myriad of things that could be happening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supposed drug related crimes can readily be disregarded. Taylor apparently knew Swain was a drug user but there is no evidence, and no basis for suspicion, that Swain was a supplier to anyone or that Bolton (in fact a lobsterman with his own boat) was supplying Swain with drugs. The notion that Bolton had drugs (\"I don't know what he's holding\") or was driving under their influence (elsewhere implied by Taylor) is equally without any basis even for suspicion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion that Bolton was speeding or driving unsafely is also unsupported. Taylor testified that Bolton's tires squealed as he left the lot and that he was traveling fast, but Taylor never <i>states</i> that Bolton was exceeding the speed limit, and Taylor never charged Bolton with speeding. Moreover, Bolton denied that he was speeding, a fact we must assume that the jury decided in Bolton's favor. <i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. P.R. Sun Oil Co.,</i> 295 F.3d 68, 84 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves as the only remaining crime the possibility that Bolton had solicited Swain's services as a prostitute &#8212; a crime to be sure, <i>Commonwealth v. King,</i> 374 Mass. 5, 372 N.E.2d 196, 203 (1977), although one often ignored. Here, the evidence available to Taylor was thin but not non-existent: Swain was known to be a prostitute; Bolton was letting her out of his car at her known haunt; the demeanor of both Bolton and Swain (according to Taylor's un-rebutted testimony quoted above) was faintly suspicious; and Bolton left very quickly on seeing Taylor, even if not unlawfully speeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Is this enough to give an officer a reasonable suspicion that Bolton had solicited sexual favors from a prostitute? Two points work in Taylor's favor. One is that the required level of suspicion for a <i>Terry</i> stop and brief inquiry is fairly low. <i>Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. at 123-25, 120 S.Ct. 673. The other factor is that the law imputes to a trained policeman a measure of expertise, <i>Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 699-700, 116 S.Ct. 1657, and an explainable suspicion can be based on an assemblage of clues viewed through the lens of the policeman's training and experience. <i>United States v. Sokolow,</i> 490 U.S. 1, 9-10, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Bolton was seen parting from a known prostitute at her usual beat, and the natural inference was reinforced by the pair's alleged suspicious demeanor and Bolton's rapid departure. So, on <i>de novo</i> review, we think that Taylor could have had a reasonable suspicion &#8212; nothing more &#8212; that Bolton had been consorting with Swain and instituted a <i>Terry</i> stop to ask Bolton what had occurred between him and Swain. Case law has allowed <i>Terry</i> stops on no greater suspicion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why then does this outcome leave a sour taste? It is primarily because Taylor apparently did not halt Bolton because Taylor was interested in investigating whether Bolton had committed the crime of soliciting a prostitute. Taylor himself testified that arresting customers of prostitutes \"does not interest me,\" that \"I have never arrested a prostitute in my nine years,\" and that \"[w]e are too busy in our city to get involved with that type of police work .... We don't have &#8212; we don't have the time. That's why narcotics and vice handle that type of situation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Worse still, at trial Bolton testified that he had merely offered Swain a ride because she said that she was sick. Taylor's counsel in turn called Swain as a witness and she testified that she had consorted with Bolton on the morning in question and at other times. In response, over objection from the defense, Bolton's counsel then read transcripts of an earlier interview given by Swain to the police. After the close of plaintiff's evidence, Bolton's counsel was allowed, over objection, to play a tape of Swain's interview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interview, Swain had told a police investigator looking into the Bolton-Taylor incident that Taylor and other officers made a regular habit of harassing Swain's clients. She intimated that the officers did so not to effect arrests but merely out of humor or malice. Bolton's counsel invoked this evidence in her closing. On appeal, Taylor says it was error to admit the tape, arguing <i>inter alia</i> that its impeachment value was outweighed by its prejudicial impact, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, and its offer in evidence was unfairly instigated by the trial judge after Bolton had rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the tape was admissible to impeach Swain's courtroom testimony, it might well have persuaded the jury of Taylor's actual motive for stopping Bolton even though &#8212; being hearsay &#8212; it was not admissible for its truth.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After all, Taylor had testified that he was not interested in prostitution, and his other supposed suspicions were even less plausible. If the law held Taylor responsible for making a <i>Terry</i> stop subjectively motivated by a wrongful purpose, the verdict against Taylor might be defended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Bolton, <i>Whren's</i> \"objective\" standard in Fourth Amendment cases seemingly makes subjective motive irrelevant in all such cases, 517 U.S. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769; not only can the police invoke a minor traffic violation for an arrest actually prompted by other law-enforcement aims (<i>e.g.,</i> the driver is a known drug dealer whom the police wish to surveil) but it is even irrelevant &#8212; at least under the Fourth Amendment, equal protection claims may be a different matter, <i>id.</i> &#8212; whether the same traffic violation is normally invoked against other drivers, so long as it is technically a violation. <i>See</i> 1 La Fave, <i>Search &amp; Seizure</i> &#167; 1.4 (3d ed.1996, Supp.2004) (deploring <i>Whren</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Holland v. City of Portland,</i> 102 F.3d 6, 9-11 (1st Cir.1996), this court formally reserved the question whether any subjective motive for a stop or arrest could be so bad as to overcome <i>Whren's</i> bar. We expressed grave doubt that <i>Whren</i> admitted of exceptions, but noted that, in <i>Holland</i> itself, there was no compelling evidence of harassment, <i>id.</i> at 11; here, there was evidence of a sort, but it was not admissible for its truth so the situation is about the same. Nothing since <i>Holland</i> suggests any erosion of <i>Whren.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What this means is that Bolton cannot collect the $17,500 judgment to which his larger award was reduced, and we need not reach Taylor's other claims of alleged error such as the admission of the tape. Taylor may well have lacked any proper intent, but a reasonable police officer could have performed a lawful <i>Terry</i> stop based on what Taylor knew. That said, we join in the view &#8212; obviously shared by the district judge and the jury &#8212; that Bolton was badly treated by the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment in Bolton's favor is <i>vacated.</i> The case is <i>remanded</i> for entry of judgment in Taylor's favor. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Coady Corp. v.

A woman named Sandra Swain got out of Bolton's car. These events took place in sight of police officer Stephen Taylor &#8212; the prime defendant in this case &#8212; who was rolling up to the intersection in his police car and said that he knew Swain to be a prostitute who plied her trade on the corner and that she was also a drug addict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Taylor's later testimony, Swain gave Taylor a \"mischievous smile\" &#8212; \"maybe `you caught me' or something to that effect.\" Then, according to Taylor, Bolton gave him a quick glance, looked away, appeared \"nervous,\" and left the parking lot with squealing tires and at a \"high rate of speed.\" Taylor followed and eventually pulled Bolton over. These supposed details were not contested by Bolton at trial, except for Taylor's claim of squealing tires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Bolton was stopped, an altercation followed between Bolton, Taylor and several policemen who appeared in another police car. Bolton and Taylor gave different versions as to how it began, each blaming the other, but there is no doubt that Bolton was thrown down, struck and suffered severe injuries. Taylor sought prosecution of Bolton on five state charges, and Bolton was convicted by a jury on two of them: assault and battery on a police officer and disturbing the peace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course Bolton brought the present action under section 1983 against Taylor, two other officers, the police chief and the City of New Bedford. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). Eventually the case went to trial on just two claims. One was a false arrest claim against Taylor and another officer, transmuted along the way into a claim that Taylor had engaged in an unlawful <i>Terry</i> stop. <i>Terry v.

It is doubtful whether Taylor was motivated by any such belief, and his conduct may well have been deplorable; we shall return to these issues in due course. But under Fourth Amendment precedents, the decisive question is whether an objective observer could have had a reasonable suspicion, and to this question our answer is yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial and in his appellate brief, Taylor said or implied that Bolton might reasonably have been suspected of four different crimes: buying drugs from or selling them to Swain; driving under the influence of drugs; speeding or reckless driving; or soliciting prostitution. Taylor never says that any one of these possibilities was in his mind at the time or that any or all of them motivated his decision. Typical of his testimony is the following passage:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, it was the totality of the whole circumstance. Sandra Swain being in the vehicle, a high crime area, he's squealing the tires out of the parking lot, he's not looking at me, seems kind of nervous, you know, doesn't want to make eye contact with me. As soon as he rips out of there, I don't know ... what he's holding, if he wants to throw something out of the car. There's a whole myriad of things that could be happening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supposed drug related crimes can readily be disregarded. Taylor apparently knew Swain was a drug user but there is no evidence, and no basis for suspicion, that Swain was a supplier to anyone or that Bolton (in fact a lobsterman with his own boat) was supplying Swain with drugs. The notion that Bolton had drugs (\"I don't know what he's holding\") or was driving under their influence (elsewhere implied by Taylor) is equally without any basis even for suspicion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion that Bolton was speeding or driving unsafely is also unsupported. Taylor testified that Bolton's tires squealed as he left the lot and that he was traveling fast, but Taylor never <i>states</i> that Bolton was exceeding the speed limit, and Taylor never charged Bolton with speeding. Moreover, Bolton denied that he was speeding, a fact we must assume that the jury decided in Bolton's favor. <i>Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc. v. P.R. Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200019\"><a href=\"/opinion/200019/supplies-inc-v-pr-sun-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves as the only remaining crime the possibility that Bolton had solicited Swain's services as a prostitute &#8212; a crime to be sure, <i>Commonwealth v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052441\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052441/commonwealth-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052441\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052441/commonwealth-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 203 (1977), although one often ignored. Here, the evidence available to Taylor was thin but not non-existent: Swain was known to be a prostitute; Bolton was letting her out of his car at her known haunt; the demeanor of both Bolton and Swain (according to Taylor's un-rebutted testimony quoted above) was faintly suspicious; and Bolton left very quickly on seeing Taylor, even if not unlawfully speeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Is this enough to give an officer a reasonable suspicion that Bolton had solicited sexual favors from a prostitute? Two points work in Taylor's favor. One is that the required level of suspicion for a <i>Terry</i> stop and brief inquiry is fairly low. <i>Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. at 123-25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118326\"><a href=\"/opinion/118326/illinois-v-wardlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>. The other factor is that the law imputes to a trained policeman a measure of expertise, <i>Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 699-700, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1657</span></a></span>, and an explainable suspicion can be based on an assemblage of clues viewed through the lens of the policeman's training and experience. <i>United States v. Sokolow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112239\"><a href=\"/opinion/112239/united-states-v-sokolow/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Bolton was seen parting from a known prostitute at her usual beat, and the natural inference was reinforced by the pair's alleged suspicious demeanor and Bolton's rapid departure. So, on <i>de novo</i> review, we think that Taylor could have had a reasonable suspicion &#8212; nothing more &#8212; that Bolton had been consorting with Swain and instituted a <i>Terry</i> stop to ask Bolton what had occurred between him and Swain. Case law has allowed <i>Terry</i> stops on no greater suspicion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why then does this outcome leave a sour taste? It is primarily because Taylor apparently did not halt Bolton because Taylor was interested in investigating whether Bolton had committed the crime of soliciting a prostitute. Taylor himself testified that arresting customers of prostitutes \"does not interest me,\" that \"I have never arrested a prostitute in my nine years,\" and that \"[w]e are too busy in our city to get involved with that type of police work .... We don't have &#8212; we don't have the time. That's why narcotics and vice handle that type of situation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Worse still, at trial Bolton testified that he had merely offered Swain a ride because she said that she was sick. Taylor's counsel in turn called Swain as a witness and she testified that she had consorted with Bolton on the morning in question and at other times. In response, over objection from the defense, Bolton's counsel then read transcripts of an earlier interview given by Swain to the police. After the close of plaintiff's evidence, Bolton's counsel was allowed, over objection, to play a tape of Swain's interview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interview, Swain had told a police investigator looking into the Bolton-Taylor incident that Taylor and other officers made a regular habit of harassing Swain's clients. She intimated that the officers did so not to effect arrests but merely out of humor or malice. Bolton's counsel invoked this evidence in her closing. On appeal, Taylor says it was error to admit the tape, arguing <i>inter alia</i> that its impeachment value was outweighed by its prejudicial impact, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, and its offer in evidence was unfairly instigated by the trial judge after Bolton had rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not the tape was admissible to impeach Swain's courtroom testimony, it might well have persuaded the jury of Taylor's actual motive for stopping Bolton even though &#8212; being hearsay &#8212; it was not admissible for its truth.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> After all, Taylor had testified that he was not interested in prostitution, and his other supposed suspicions were even less plausible. If the law held Taylor responsible for making a <i>Terry</i> stop subjectively motivated by a wrongful purpose, the verdict against Taylor might be defended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately for Bolton, <i>Whren's</i> \"objective\" standard in Fourth Amendment cases seemingly makes subjective motive irrelevant in all such cases, 517 U.S. at 813, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span>; not only can the police invoke a minor traffic violation for an arrest actually prompted by other law-enforcement aims (<i>e.g.,</i> the driver is a known drug dealer whom the police wish to surveil) but it is even irrelevant &#8212; at least under the Fourth Amendment, equal protection claims may be a different matter, <i>id.</i> &#8212; whether the same traffic violation is normally invoked against other drivers, so long as it is technically a violation. <i>See</i> 1 La Fave, <i>Search &amp; Seizure</i> &#167; 1.4 (3d ed.1996, Supp.2004) (deploring <i>Whren</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Holland v. City of Portland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197117\"><a href=\"/opinion/197117/holland-v-portland/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9-11 (1st Cir.1996), this court formally reserved the question whether any subjective motive for a stop or arrest could be so bad as to overcome <i>Whren's</i> bar. We expressed grave doubt that <i>Whren</i> admitted of exceptions, but noted that, in <i>Holland</i> itself, there was no compelling evidence of harassment, <i>id.</i> at 11; here, there was evidence of a sort, but it was not admissible for its truth so the situation is about the same. Nothing since <i>Holland</i> suggests any erosion of <i>Whren.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What this means is that Bolton cannot collect the $17,500 judgment to which his larger award was reduced, and we need not reach Taylor's other claims of alleged error such as the admission of the tape. Taylor may well have lacked any proper intent, but a reasonable police officer could have performed a lawful <i>Terry</i> stop based on what Taylor knew. That said, we join in the view &#8212; obviously shared by the district judge and the jury &#8212; that Bolton was badly treated by the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment in Bolton's favor is <i>vacated.</i> The case is <i>remanded</i> for entry of judgment in Taylor's favor.
