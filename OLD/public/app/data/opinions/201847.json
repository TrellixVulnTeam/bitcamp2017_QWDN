Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                      Lynch, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jose Enrique Gonzalez-Florido on brief pro se.\n     Miguel A. Fernandez, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Jose Javier\nSantos-Mimoso, and H.S.

Jose Enrique Gonzalez-Florido seeks review\n\nof the district court's denial of his motion for relief under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4).   The government first asserts that the\n\nappeal should be dismissed as untimely.   Appellant concedes that\n\nthe notice of appeal was received and filed by the district court\n\ntwo days after the time to appeal expired, but he contends that\n\nthe filing was timely under the prison mailbox rule, Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 4(c)(1). The government argues that appellant is not entitled\n\nto the benefit of the prison mailbox rule because he failed to\n\ndemonstrate in the manner specified in Rule 4(c)(1) that he\n\ndeposited the notice in the prison mail system before the filing\n\ndeadline.    However, the postmark on the envelope in which the\n\nnotice of appeal was mailed predates that deadline. For purposes\n\nof this appeal, we will assume, without deciding, that this is\n\nsufficient to establish timely filing.       See Sulik v. Taney\n\nCounty, 316 F.3d 813, 814 (8th Cir. 2003).\n\n            On the merits, however, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of Rule 60(b)(4) relief essentially for the reasons stated\n\nin its January 20, 2004 order.   Even if, as appellant argues, the\n\njudgment was erroneous, it was not void within the meaning of\n\nRule 60(b)(4).    See Lubben v. Selective Service System, Local\n\nBoard No. 27, 453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972).     \"Only in the\n\nrare instance of a clear usurpation of power,\" id., such as where\n\nthe court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, will a judgment be\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdeemed void.   See Farm Credit Bank v. Ferrera-Goitia, 316 F.3d\n\n62, 67 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. One Rural Lot No.\n\n10,356, 238 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 2001).
