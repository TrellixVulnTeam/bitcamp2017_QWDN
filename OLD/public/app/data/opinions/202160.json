Robert   Kibuuka,   a   native   of   Uganda,\n\npetitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirming an order of removal against him.                  We\n\ndismiss the petition in part for a lack of jurisdiction and deny\n\nthe remainder.\n\n            In January 2000, Kibuuka arrived in the United States on\n\na student visa to attend Troy State University in Alabama.                In\n\nMarch    2001,    the   Immigration   and   Naturalization   Service   (INS)\n\nlearned that Kibuuka had left school and issued him a notice to\n\nappear at a removal hearing for not complying with the terms of his\n\nvisa.1     In September 2002, over 30 months after his arrival,\n\nKibuuka applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\n            In August 2003, an immigration judge (IJ) convened a\n\nhearing on Kibuuka's applications for relief. Kibuuka was the only\n\nwitness.    Kibuuka testified that he is a 33 year-old homosexual,\n\nsingle male from Uganda, where homosexuality is illegal.             In July\n\n1999, Kibuuka attended the wedding of two men.          The police raided\n\nthe wedding, beat several of the attendees, including Kibuuka,\n\ninterrogated other, and arrested the groom.         Kibuuka was permitted\n\nto leave.    Thereafter, he went into hiding at his parents' home,\n\nwhere he stayed until he left for the United States.\n\n\n     1\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\nreorganized and transferred into the new Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            Kibuuka did not immediately attend Troy State because he\n\ndid not have enough money for tuition. Eventually, he attended the\n\nuniversity for one semester before withdrawing.           While at school,\n\nhe did not divulge his sexual orientation because he did not think\n\nthat \"there were many gay people\" there.                After withdrawing,\n\nKibuuka went to Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked delivering\n\nfurniture.    At the conclusion of Kibuuka's testimony, the IJ asked\n\nif he was presently involved in a romantic relationship with a\n\nman.    Kibuuka answered that he was not.\n\n            Kibuuka also submitted a report from a psychologist,\n\nwhich    recounted   Kibuuka's   history   and   concluded     that   Kibuuka\n\nsuffered from a major depressive disorder due to the treatment he\n\nhad received because of his sexual orientation.            The report also\n\nstated that Kibuuka's mental state gradually improved once he\n\narrived in the United States, but that his depression made him\n\n\"unable to apply for asylum based on his homosexuality during [the]\n\nfirst year of his United States residence.\"\n\n            The IJ concluded that Kibuuka was not credible because\n\nthere were several material contradictions between his testimony\n\nand the information included in the report.          The IJ rejected the\n\nasylum claim on the ground that the application was time barred\n\nbecause it was not filed within one year of Kibuuka entering the\n\nUnited    States,    and   because     Kibuuka    had    not    established\n\nextraordinary circumstances to justify the late filing.               The IJ\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\falso rejected the withholding of removal and CAT claims because\n\nKibuuka failed to persuade him that he actually attended the 1999\n\nwedding or that he was a \"member of the gay community.\"\n\n          Kibuuka appealed to the BIA.             He challenged the IJ's\n\ntime-bar ruling and also sought to reopen the hearing to present\n\n\"new\" evidence that he was involved in a homosexual relationship on\n\nthe date of his initial hearing.            The BIA summarily affirmed the\n\ntime-bar ruling and denied Kibuuka's motion to reopen because the\n\nevidence of Kibuuka's romantic relationship was not new.\n\n          Kibuuka      reasserts    these    claims    in    his    petition    for\n\nreview.   He contends that the IJ erred by ruling his asylum\n\napplication untimely without explicitly considering whether his\n\ndepression should excuse the late filing.             He also argues that the\n\nBIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen because\n\nhe did not understand that he needed to present evidence of his\n\ninvolvement   in   a   romantic    relationship       to    prove   that   he   was\n\nhomosexual.\n\n          An alien has one year from the date of arrival in the\n\nUnited States to file an application for asylum unless the alien\n\ndemonstrates to the Attorney General's satisfaction that the delay\n\nwas caused by changed or extraordinary circumstances. See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1158(a)(2)(B) & (D).            This court cannot review an agency\n\ndetermination that an asylum application was untimely.                      See 8\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); Haoud v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d          201, 204-05 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n            Kibuuka contends that we may address his claim because\n\nthe   IJ   did   not   consider   his   argument   that   his   depression\n\nconstituted extraordinary circumstances justifying the late filing.\n\nSee Sagaydak v. Gonzales,         405 F.3d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir. 2005)\n\n(remanding case to BIA where the IJ and BIA \"failed to address\"\n\npetitioner's extraordinary circumstances claim).            We reject the\n\npremise of Kibuuka's argument.       There is no reason for us to infer\n\nthat the IJ failed to consider Kibuuka's depression-related claim\n\nin determining that he had failed to demonstrate extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.\n\n              Kibuuka's   extraordinary    circumstances     argument   was\n\npremised on the psychological report's conclusion that he could not\n\ntimely file his asylum application due to depression.              The IJ\n\nadmitted this report over the government's objection and clearly\n\nread it, referring to it several times in his opinion.          While the\n\nIJ did not specifically address the depression-related claim in\n\nrejecting Kibuuka's extraordinary circumstances argument, we are\n\nconfident, based on the record as a whole, that he considered it.\n\nNo more is required.       See Enwonwu v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 22, 35\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (stating that an IJ is not required to \"spell out\n\nevery last detail of its reasoning where the logical underpinnings\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fare clear from the record\").             We therefore lack jurisdiction to\n\nconsider this aspect of Kibuuka's petition.2\n\n               We turn to Kibuuka's motion to reopen.          The denial of       a\n\nmotion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion.                      Chen v.\n\nGonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 153 (1st Cir. 2005). In the interests of\n\nfinality, such motions are disfavored.                 See Mabikas v. INS, 358\n\nF.3d 145, 148 (1st Cir. 2004).              One predicate for a successful\n\nmotion    to    reopen   to   present    additional     evidence   is    that    the\n\nevidence must have been \"previously unavailable.\"                       Fesseha v.\n\nAshcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n               Kibuuka   sought    to    reopen   the   hearing    to    introduce\n\nevidence that he was involved in a homosexual relationship on the\n\ndate of his initial hearing.             He acknowledges that this evidence\n\nwas available at the time of his hearing but claims that he did not\n\nmention    it     because     he   did   not   think    that   presenting       such\n\ninformation was necessary to his case.\n\n               Kibuuka's admission that this evidence was available at\n\nthe   initial      hearing     undermines      his   claimed   entitlement        to\n\n\n\n      2\n      Kibuuka also argues that the REAL ID ACT of 2005, Pub. L. No,\n109-13, § 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119 Stat. 231-310 (codified at 8\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)) empowers us to review the timeliness\ndetermination because it grants this court authority to review\nconstitutional claims or questions of law.           But the IJ's\ndetermination that Kibuuka's depression was insufficient to\nestablish extraordinary circumstances was a discretionary judgment\nto which § 1252(a)(2)(D) does not apply. See Mehilli v. Gonzales,\n433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Chen v. U.S. Dep't of\nJustice, 434 F.3d 144, 151-55 (2d Cir. 2005).\n\n                                         -6-\n\freopening.   There is no question that the IJ specifically asked\n\nKibuuka if he was involved in a relationship with a man, and that\n\nKibuuka   provided   a   false   answer.   Kibuuka   claims   that   he\n\nnevertheless should be allowed to present this evidence because he\n\ndid not know that his answer would be used by the IJ as a ground\n\nfor decision.   There are two problems with this argument.     First,\n\na witness obviously is not entitled to prevaricate simply because\n\nhe deems a question irrelevant.     Rather, he must either object or\n\nanswer the question truthfully.3     Moreover, Kibuuka overstates the\n\nrecord by suggesting that his false answer to the IJ's question was\n\nthe linchpin of the decision.     The IJ primarily rejected Kibuuka's\n\nclaim because of inconsistencies between his testimony and the\n\ninformation contained in the psychologist's report.      And nothing\n\nabout Kibuuka's homosexual relationship would undercut the IJ's\n\nprimary basis for denying Kibuuka relief.      There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in denying Kibuuka's motion to reopen.\n\n           Dismissed in part and denied in part.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Kibuuka does not claim that he was unable to truthfully\nrespond to the IJ's question because of the depression that he\nsuffered because of his alleged experiences as a gay man in Uganda.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",

One predicate for a successful\n\nmotion    to    reopen   to   present    additional     evidence   is    that    the\n\nevidence must have been \"previously unavailable.\"                       Fesseha v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n               Kibuuka   sought    to    reopen   the   hearing    to    introduce\n\nevidence that he was involved in a homosexual relationship on the\n\ndate of his initial hearing.             He acknowledges that this evidence\n\nwas available at the time of his hearing but claims that he did not\n\nmention    it     because     he   did   not   think    that   presenting       such\n\ninformation was necessary to his case.\n\n               Kibuuka's admission that this evidence was available at\n\nthe   initial      hearing     undermines      his   claimed   entitlement        to\n\n\n\n      2\n      Kibuuka also argues that the REAL ID ACT of 2005, Pub. L. No,\n109-13, § 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119 Stat. 231-310 (codified at 8\nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)) empowers us to review the timeliness\ndetermination because it grants this court authority to review\nconstitutional claims or questions of law.           But the IJ's\ndetermination that Kibuuka's depression was insufficient to\nestablish extraordinary circumstances was a discretionary judgment\nto which § 1252(a)(2)(D) does not apply. See Mehilli v. Gonzales,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201978\"><a href=\"/opinion/201978/mehilli-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Chen v.

There is no question that the IJ specifically asked\n\nKibuuka if he was involved in a relationship with a man, and that\n\nKibuuka   provided   a   false   answer.   Kibuuka   claims   that   he\n\nnevertheless should be allowed to present this evidence because he\n\ndid not know that his answer would be used by the IJ as a ground\n\nfor decision.   There are two problems with this argument.     First,\n\na witness obviously is not entitled to prevaricate simply because\n\nhe deems a question irrelevant.     Rather, he must either object or\n\nanswer the question truthfully.3     Moreover, Kibuuka overstates the\n\nrecord by suggesting that his false answer to the IJ's question was\n\nthe linchpin of the decision.     The IJ primarily rejected Kibuuka's\n\nclaim because of inconsistencies between his testimony and the\n\ninformation contained in the psychologist's report.      And nothing\n\nabout Kibuuka's homosexual relationship would undercut the IJ's\n\nprimary basis for denying Kibuuka relief.      There was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in denying Kibuuka's motion to reopen.\n\n           Dismissed in part and denied in part.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Kibuuka does not claim that he was unable to truthfully\nrespond to the IJ's question because of the depression that he\nsuffered because of his alleged experiences as a gay man in Uganda.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f</pre>",
