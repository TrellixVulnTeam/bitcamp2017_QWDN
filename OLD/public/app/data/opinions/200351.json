The Individuals with Disabilities\n\nEducation Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (1997), obligates\n\nschool districts to furnish a free appropriate public education\n\n(FAPE)   to    children   with    disabilities.     See   id.   §§       1401(8),\n\n1411(b)(2)(C), 1412(a)(1), 1413(i)(1), 1415(b)(1).              That is the\n\ngood news.      The bad news is that the IDEA is not self-executing,\n\nand parents, school officials, bureaucrats, and judges alike have\n\nstruggled to master its intricacies.\n\n              These consolidated appeals illustrate the point.             Taken\n\ntogether, they present two loosely related questions.                The first\n\nconcerns      whether   parents    who    successfully    resist     a    school\n\ndistrict's effort, in an independent legal action, to overturn a\n\nstay-put placement on the ground of the alleged dangerousness of a\n\nchild with disabilities are considered prevailing parties within\n\nthe purview of the IDEA's fee-shifting provision.                  The second\n\nconcerns the circumstances under which a learning-disabled child\n\nwho, by reason of his age, is no longer covered by the IDEA may\n\nnonetheless be entitled to some relief to compensate him for the\n\ndeprivation of a FAPE during an earlier period. The district court\n\nanswered these questions in ways that pretermitted the appellants'\n\nclaims for attorneys' fees and compensatory education. Concluding,\n\nas we do, that the court erred, we reverse the judgments below and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We sketch the relevant facts.       The appellants, Mr. and\n\nMrs. R., are the parents of S.R.      S.R., who was born in December of\n\n1980, suffers from Down's Syndrome. He has had special educational\n\nneeds throughout his formative years.       During the times material\n\nhereto, Maine School Administrative District No. 35 (the School\n\nDistrict) has had the responsibility of ministering to these needs.\n\n           Generally speaking, the IDEA obliged the School District\n\nto furnish S.R. with a FAPE sufficient to confer some educational\n\nbenefit.   See Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 207 (1982);\n\nRoland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 992 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nFederal law directs school districts to carry out such a duty\n\nthrough    the    development   and   implementation    of   an     annual\n\nindividualized education program (IEP). See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(11),\n\n1412(a)(4), 1414(d); see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.340-50.            S.R. was\n\neligible for such special education services through the 2000-2001\n\nschool year (when he turned twenty years of age).       See 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(1)(B)(i)-(ii) (linking eligibility for special education\n\nservices to state law); Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 20-A, § 5201(1)\n\n(granting every student the right to public education through the\n\nschool year encompassing his or her twentieth birthday).\n\n           It would serve no useful purpose to discuss S.R.'s early\n\nscholastic experiences. Rather, we begin with the 1999-2000 school\n\nyear   (which     encompassed   S.R.'s   nineteenth    birthday).       In\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffurtherance of its responsibilities under the IDEA, the School\n\nDistrict prepared an IEP for that year.                 Under it, S.R. spent\n\nmornings at Marshwood High School and afternoons at a work-site\n\ntraining program (where he also received some special education\n\nservices).\n\n            During    the    1999-2000     school    year,   S.R.       displayed    a\n\nvariety of behavioral problems, including verbal outbursts and\n\nassaultive conduct.         Believing that these problems stemmed from\n\nS.R.'s    \"ineffective      and   frustrating\"       IEP,    Mr.    and    Mrs.     R.\n\nrepeatedly    requested      modifications.         Officials      of    the   School\n\nDistrict     met   with     the   family    many    times    to    address       these\n\nremonstrances, discuss S.R.'s current IEP, and ponder his future\n\ncurriculum.\n\n             In June of 2000, the School District proffered a new IEP\n\nfor the 2000-2001 school year.         Under this proposal, S.R. was to be\n\nrelegated to a work-site training program for the entire school\n\nday.     His vocational training would be augmented with monthly\n\nspeech therapy, sign language lessons, behavioral consultations,\n\nand social skills instruction.\n\n             S.R.'s   parents     rejected    this    proposal.           They    took\n\nespecial umbrage at the fact that the draft IEP completely removed\n\nS.R. from a mainstream academic setting.                Concluding that this\n\ncircumstance violated their son's right to receive educational\n\nservices in the least restrictive environment possible, see 20\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fU.S.C. § 1412(a)(5), the parents sought a hearing before the Maine\n\nDepartment    of     Education,      see   id.   §    1415(f).        The    parents\n\nsimultaneously       invoked   the    IDEA's     stay-put     provision,       id.   §\n\n1415(j), so that S.R. would remain in his 1999-2000 educational\n\nplacement pending a resolution of his 2000-2001 IEP.1                     The School\n\nDistrict defended the draft IEP, and, accordingly, resisted the\n\nparents' administrative petition.\n\n          The School District then took a more unusual step:                         it\n\ninitiated a civil action in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Maine (the First Suit) seeking to bar S.R. from\n\nreturning to Marshwood High because his presence there would pose\n\n(or so the School District alleged) a substantial risk of danger to\n\nhimself or others.       Coincident with the filing of its complaint,\n\nthe School District moved for temporary and preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief.      After    reviewing    the     motion    papers    and    the   family's\n\nobjection,    the    district     court     refused    to     issue   a     temporary\n\nrestraining order (TRO).          The effect of that ruling was to leave\n\n\n\n     1\n      The stay-put provision, with an exception not applicable\nhere, states:\n\n          [D]uring the pendency of any proceedings\n          conducted pursuant to [IDEA § 1415], unless\n          the State or local educational agency and the\n          parents otherwise agree, the child shall\n          remain   in   the   then-current  educational\n          placement of such child, . . . until all such\n          proceedings have been completed.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(j).\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe stay-put order (and, thus, S.R.'s placement at Marshwood High)\n\nintact.   The School District chose not to pursue the matter\n\nfurther, but, rather, moved to dismiss its complaint.        See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 41(a).       The parents did not object but asserted an\n\nentitlement   to   attorneys'   fees   and   costs.   See   20   U.S.C.   §\n\n1415(i)(3)(B).     The district court granted the School District's\n\nmotion for voluntary dismissal but denied the parents' request for\n\nremuneration on the ground that they were not a prevailing party.\n\nMe. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. & Mrs. R., Civ. No. 00-242 (D.\n\nMe. Apr. 9, 2001).    The parents filed a timely appeal.\n\n          Meanwhile, the administrative hearing anent the adequacy\n\nof the proposed 2000-2001 IEP went forward on a parallel track.           In\n\na decision dated October 31, 2000, the hearing officer approved the\n\nconcept of a totally non-scholastic placement but determined that\n\nthe IEP was inadequate in other respects. Consequently, he ordered\n\nthe School District to prepare an amended IEP.              The parents\n\nexercised their right to judicial review of this decision, see 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A); they commenced an action in the federal\n\ndistrict court (the Second Suit) in which they sought to overturn\n\nthe hearing officer's approval of S.R.'s work-site placement.         The\n\nSchool District filed a cross-complaint challenging other parts of\n\nthe administrative decision.\n\n          In December of 2001, S.R. reached his twentieth birthday.\n\nThe following June, he graduated from Marshwood High.            Upon the\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\foccurrence of that event, the School District took the position\n\nthat the parents' appeal from the administrative decision had\n\nbecome moot. In their reply, the parents gainsaid this contention.\n\nThey pointed out that S.R. had dropped out of his special education\n\nprogram at Marshwood High during the 2000-2001 school year and\n\nasserted that he was entitled to compensatory education to offset\n\nthe inadequate IEP that the School District had proposed.2              After\n\nsome skirmishing (the details of which need not concern us), the\n\ndistrict court ruled that the suit was not \"procedural[ly] moot[]\"\n\nbecause the parents had raised the claim for compensatory education\n\nin a timely fashion.3         Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. & Mrs.\n\nR.,   176   F.   Supp.   2d    15,   24-25   (D.   Me.   2001).   The   court\n\n\n      2\n      We need not dwell on the withdrawal, as it is irrelevant to\nthe appellants' compensatory education claim.       Cf. Zobrest v.\nCatalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 4 n.3 (1993) (holding\nthat a school district's responsibility for providing appropriate\neducational services is not discharged merely because the parents\nvoluntarily withdrew their child from a placement); Doe v.\nBrookline Sch. Comm., 722 F.2d 910, 916 (1st Cir. 1983) (suggesting\nthat after withdrawal from a public school, a handicapped student\nstill may pursue funding for an appropriate placement during that\nperiod). If it is eventually determined that S.R. would not have\nreceived a FAPE had he remained at Marshwood under the stay-put\nplacement — a matter on which we take no view — his withdrawal\nwould not foreclose his claim for compensatory education.\n      3\n      The district judge — the same judge who earlier had dismissed\nthe First Suit without an award of attorneys' fees — referred the\nSchool District's motion to dismiss to a magistrate judge. See 28\nU.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).        He thereafter\naccepted and adopted the magistrate judge's detailed report and\nrecommendation.    For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish\nbetween the two judicial officers.           Rather, we take an\ninstitutional view and refer to the determinations below as those\nof the district court.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fnevertheless dismissed the case for what it termed \"substantive\n\nmootness,\" declaring that \"S.R. [had] received, for all that\n\nappears in the record, the very relief he and his parents initially\n\nsought in this action, by virtue of the . . . 'stay-put' ruling.\"\n\nId. at 25.     The second appeal followed.           We consolidated it with\n\nthe earlier       appeal    (which   had    been   stayed)   for   briefing   and\n\nargument.     We now resolve both appeals.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n             The parents — we henceforth shall refer to them as the\n\nappellants — press ahead on two fronts.              They assign error to the\n\nlower court's determination that they were not prevailing parties\n\nin    the   First   Suit.     They   also    protest   the   district   court's\n\ndismissal of the Second Suit as moot, pointing to the pendency of\n\ntheir compensatory education claim.                 We address these points\n\nsequentially.\n\n                      A.     The Attorneys' Fee Claim.\n\n             In most civil litigation, the parties are responsible for\n\npaying their own attorneys' fees.            See Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home,\n\nInc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 602\n\n(2001); Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288,\n\n293 (1st Cir. 2001). Despite this general rule, Congress sometimes\n\nchooses to allow for fee-shifting in particular situations, and it\n\nchose to do so in connection with the IDEA.             The statute provides\n\nin relevant part:\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f          In any action or proceeding brought under\n          [section 1415 of the IDEA], the court, in its\n          discretion, may award reasonable attorneys'\n          fees as part of the costs to the parents of a\n          child with a disability who is the prevailing\n          party.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B).           Because this provision employs the\n\nphrase \"prevailing party\" — a term of art — it must be interpreted\n\nand applied in the same manner as other federal fee-shifting\n\nstatutes that use the same phraseology.             See New Hampshire v.\n\nAdams, 159 F.3d 680, 684 (1st Cir. 1998) (explaining that, in\n\nconstruing the IDEA's fee-shifting provision, \"cases decided under\n\nkindred federal fee-shifting statutes, such as the Fees Act, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988, furnish persuasive authority\"); H.R. Rep. No. 105-\n\n95, at 105-106 (1997), reprinted in 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 78, 103-104\n\n(stating that section 1415(i)(3)(B) should be construed in keeping\n\nwith Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 440 (1983), a Fees Act\n\ncase);   see    also   Buckhannon,     532   U.S.   at    603   (classifying\n\n\"prevailing party\" as a term of art).\n\n          For    purposes   of   a    federal   fee-shifting     statute,   a\n\nprevailing party is any party who \"succeed[s] on any significant\n\nissue . . . which achieves some of the benefits plaintiffs sought\n\nin bringing suit.\"     Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433.         The party's success\n\ncannot be a hollow victory; it must materially alter the litigants'\n\nlegal relationship by modifying one party's behavior in a way that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fdirectly benefits the other.4   See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103,\n\n111-12 (1992); Gay Officers, 247 F.3d at 293.     Thus, the change\n\neffected must be material; a purely technical or de minimis victory\n\ncannot confer prevailing party status.   Tex. State Teachers' Ass'n\n\nv. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989); Stanton v.\n\nS. Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          It follows from the foregoing that a court faced with the\n\nneed to decide whether a litigant is (or is not) a prevailing party\n\nmust make a qualitative inquiry into the import of the result\n\nobtained. Gay Officers, 247 F.3d at 293, 295; see also Christopher\n\nP. v. Marcus, 915 F.2d 794, 804 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"[I]t is helpful to\n\nidentify the relief sought by the plaintiff and compare it with the\n\nrelief obtained as a result of the suit.\").       Where, as here,\n\nprevailing party status turns on a question of law, we afford\n\n\n     4\n      In a case involving the fee-shifting provisions of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, and the Fair\nHousing Act Amendments, id. § 3613(c)(2), the Supreme Court\nconcluded that the change in the legal relationship must be one to\nwhich a judicial imprimatur attaches. Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605.\nWe applied that rationale to a claim brought under the Fees Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 1988.    See New Engl. Reg'l Council of Carpenters v.\nKinton, 284 F.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2002). Two of our sister circuits\nhave adopted Buckhannon's reasoning in connection with the IDEA's\nfee-shifting provision. See John T. v. Del. County Intermed. Unit,\n___ F.3d ___, ___ (3d Cir. 2003) [2003 WL 194874, at *8-*10]; J.C.\nv. Reg'l Sch. Dist. 10, 278 F.3d 119, 123-24 (2d Cir. 2002). But\nsee TD v. La Grange Sch. Dist. No. 102, 222 F. Supp. 2d 1062, 1065\n(N.D. Ill. 2002) (positing that \"there exist critical distinctions\nin the text and structure of the IDEA and the ADA and FHAA that\npersuade me that the Court's ruling in Buckhannon was not meant to\nextend to the IDEA\"). These appeals do not require us to resolve\nthis conflict, and we therefore express no opinion as to whether\nthe Buckhannon rule applies in IDEA cases.\n\n                                -11-\n\fplenary review.    Gay Officers, 247 F.3d at 292-93; Domegan v.\n\nPonte, 972 F.2d 401, 406 (1st Cir. 1992).           With this paradigm in\n\nmind, we turn to the assignment of error.\n\n          The appellants ask for attorneys' fees referable only to\n\nthe First Suit.    Their position is straightforward:          the School\n\nDistrict commenced a civil action and the appellants successfully\n\ndefended against it (i.e., the School District did not receive any\n\nof the relief that it sought and, eventually, threw in the towel).\n\nThe   School   District   rejoins     that   this    victory   was   merely\n\ninterlocutory — a single battle in the war over the 2000-2001 IEP\n\n— and therefore is insufficient to support prevailing party status.\n\nWe test these hypotheses.\n\n          In general, the materiality requirement demands that a\n\nparty succeed on the merits of a claim or defense.        Adams, 159 F.3d\n\nat 684.   But a party may be considered \"prevailing\" even without\n\nobtaining a favorable final judgment on all (or even the most\n\ncrucial) of her claims.      Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 603; Rome Sch.\n\nComm. v. Mrs. B., 247 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2001); see generally\n\nWilliam H. Danne, Jr., Annotation, Who Is Prevailing Party for\n\nPurposes of Obtaining Attorney's Fees Under § 615(i)(3)(B) of\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, 153 A.L.R. Fed. 1\n\n(1999) (collecting cases).    Thus, interlocutory orders that confer\n\nsubstantive injunctive relief often have been viewed as sufficient\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fto carry the weight of a fee award.5         E.g., Haley v. Pataki, 106\n\nF.3d 478, 483 (2d Cir. 1997); Pearson v. Fair, 980 F.2d 37, 45 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (collecting cases).\n\n            On the other hand, interlocutory orders that serve merely\n\nto maintain the status quo usually are deemed insufficient to buoy\n\na fee award.    See LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, 205 F.3d 1146, 1161 (9th Cir.\n\n2000).    Consequently, a successful invocation of the IDEA's stay-\n\nput provision, on an interlocutory basis, ordinarily will not\n\nconfer prevailing party status. See, e.g., J.O. v. Orange Township\n\nBd. of Educ., 287 F.3d 267, 274 (3d Cir. 2002); Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nSteven L., 89 F.3d 464, 469 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n           This case, however, is not cut from the usual cloth.           We\n\nare   dealing   here   not   with   a   stay-put   order   issued,   on   an\n\ninterlocutory basis, in the course of ongoing judicial review.\n\nRather, the First Suit was an independent, free-standing civil\n\naction, instituted by the School District, in which it sought to\n\nenjoin the operation of the stay-put provision.            That quest for\n\ninjunctive relief was the sole object — the raison d'être — of the\n\nFirst Suit.\n\n            To be sure, the School District probably saw the First\n\nSuit as a piece of a larger dispute between it and the appellants\n\nover the 2000-2001 IEP.      But a party's subjective view of a cause\n\n\n      5\n      We say \"often\" because the rule is not invariable.     See,\ne.g., Foreman v. Dallas County, 193 F.3d 314, 323 (5th Cir. 1999)\n(stating that TROs can never constitute merits-based relief).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof action counts for very little in determining prevailing party\n\nstatus.   See Tex. State Teachers' Ass'n, 489 U.S. at 791; Nadeau v.\n\nHelgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 280 (1st Cir. 1978).         By the same token, it\n\nis immaterial whether the School District ultimately withdrew its\n\ncomplaint because it thought that the administrative decision had\n\nrendered the request moot.       See Watson v. County of Riverside, 300\n\nF.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir. 2002); Bisciglia v. Kenosha Unified\n\nSch. Dist. No. 1, 45 F.3d 223, 230 (7th Cir. 1995).               We search,\n\ntherefore, for more objective indicia.\n\n            We   deem   it   important   to   emphasize   that   the     School\n\nDistrict,   not   the   appellants,      brought   the   First   Suit.     The\n\nappellants were haled into court as defendants and won a clear-cut\n\nvictory on the sole issue in the case (an issue that had been\n\nframed by the School District). A triumphant defendant may qualify\n\nas a prevailing party for the purpose of obtaining a fee award.\n\nSee, e.g., Weyant v. Okst, 198 F.3d 311, 316 (2d Cir. 1999)\n\n(collecting cases); see also Burke v. Guiney, 700 F.2d 767, 771\n\n(1st Cir. 1983).        It follows inexorably that a defendant who\n\nprevails on the only claim that justifies the presence of the case\n\nin a federal court has a legitimate basis for asserting that she is\n\nthe prevailing party.        See Perlman v. Zell, 185 F.3d 850, 859 (7th\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n            This conclusion is reinforced by our awareness that the\n\nSchool District could have appealed the stay-put order as part and\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fparcel     of   judicial    review   of     the     IEP,    see   20     U.S.C.     §\n\n1415(i)(2)(A), but eschewed that course.                It elected instead to\n\npursue an independent cause of action by invoking a statute that\n\npermits temporary changes in a child's placement if a school\n\ndistrict can demonstrate \"by substantial evidence that maintaining\n\nthe current placement of such child is substantially likely to\n\nresult in injury to the child or to others.\"               Id. § 1415(k)(2)(A).\n\nThis statute does not carve out an exception to section 1415(j)'s\n\nstay-put provision. See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 324-25 (1988);\n\nTimothy W. v. Rochester, N.H., Sch. Dist., 875 F.2d 954, 972 (1st\n\nCir. 1989); cf. Orange Township, 287 F.3d at 272-73 (implying that\n\nsections    1415(j)   and   1415(k)(2)      are    independent      in      terms   of\n\nprevailing party determinations).            Indeed, a restraining order\n\nunder    section   1415(k)(2)    requires         the   proponent      to    proffer\n\nsubstantial evidence that the affected child's current placement\n\nposes a significant and unreasonable likelihood of injury either to\n\nhimself or to others.       20 U.S.C. § 1415(k)(2)(A), (C).              The merits\n\nof the IEP dispute are almost wholly irrelevant.                  Cf. Honig, 484\n\nU.S. at 324-25 (emphasizing the dichotomy between injunctions for\n\nsafety and stay-put placements).\n\n            In fine, the School District chose to make S.R.'s alleged\n\ndangerousness a contested issue in and of itself and to try to\n\nchange his placement accordingly.           That is to say, the injunctive\n\naction that it brought under section 1415(k)(2) (the First Suit)\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fattempted to work an autarkic material alteration in the legal\n\nrelations between the parties.          Defeating that attempt, once and\n\nfor   all,   gave   the   appellants    solid     ground   on   which    to   base\n\nprevailing party status.6\n\n             This result squares with commonly accepted notions of\n\nmateriality in the fee-shifting context.              The materiality of a\n\njudicial outcome depends in part on whether the result is purely\n\nprocedural     or   whether    it      actually     accomplishes        something\n\nsubstantive for the winning party.         See Adams, 159 F.3d at 685-86;\n\nKrichinsky v. Knox County Sch., 963 F.2d 847, 849-50 (6th Cir.\n\n1992); see also Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 759 (1980).\n\nBecause the district court denied injunctive relief on the basis\n\nthat the School District had not adduced sufficient proof to\n\nsatisfy the section 1415(k)(2) standard, it is readily evident that\n\nthe appellants successfully defended the First Suit on the merits.\n\n             This thesis is confirmed by considering what would have\n\nhappened had the appellants not appeared in court to oppose the\n\nSchool District's action.        In that event, the court most likely\n\n\n\n      6\n      This result is not altered because the critical decision took\nplace on a motion for a TRO.       The court below must have been\ncognizant of the delays characteristic of administrative and\njudicial proceedings under the IDEA. See Burlington Sch. Comm. v.\nMass. Dep't of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 370 (1985) (describing such\nproceedings as \"ponderous\").      Thus, the denial of the School\nDistrict's motion was effectively a final judgment on the merits of\nthe \"dangerousness\" claim that the School District had brought.\nSee Coalition for Basic Human Needs v. King, 691 F.2d 597, 600-01\n(1st Cir. 1982).\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwould have entered a default judgment and changed S.R.'s placement.\n\nBy defending, the appellants not only deprived the School District\n\nof the benefit that it sought in bringing suit but also blocked it\n\nfrom implementing a course of action inimical to S.R.'s interests.\n\nThe appellants' victory was, therefore, material.            See Farrar, 506\n\nU.S. at 111-12; Stanton, 197 F.3d at 576.\n\n            For these reasons, we conclude that the appellants were\n\nthe prevailing parties in the First Suit, and that the district\n\ncourt erred as a matter of law in holding to the contrary.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the district court's order and remand the\n\nFirst   Suit   so    that   the   court   may   determine   whether   special\n\ncircumstances exist that might bar an award, and, if not, the\n\namount of attorneys' fees and costs to which the appellants are\n\nentitled.\n\n                B.    The Compensatory Education Claim.\n\n            We turn now to the justiciability of the appellants'\n\ncompensatory education claim.         It is black-letter law that, in a\n\nfederal court, justiciability requires the existence of an actual\n\ncase or controversy.        U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.     Even if an\n\nactual case or controversy exists at the inception of litigation,\n\na case may be rendered moot (and, therefore, subject to dismissal)\n\nif changed circumstances eliminate any possibility of effectual\n\nrelief.   CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., 48 F.3d\n\n618, 620-21 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f              In a suit seeking only injunctive relief, this ordinarily\n\nmeans that once the act sought to be enjoined occurs, the suit must\n\nbe dismissed as moot.        E.g., Oakville Dev. Corp. v. FDIC, 986 F.2d\n\n611,   613    (1st   Cir.    1993).        If,   however,     a   plaintiff   seeks\n\nalternative     redress     (such     as   money      damages)    in   addition    to\n\ninjunctive relief, the occurrence of the watershed event may not\n\nrender the controversy moot.               CMM Cable Rep., 48 F.3d at 621;\n\nCurtis Indus., Inc. v. Livingstone, 30 F.3d 96, 97-98 (8th Cir.\n\n1994).   We review de novo a lower court's dismissal of an action on\n\nthe ground of mootness. See Verhoeven v. Brunswick Sch. Comm., 207\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999); N.H. Right to Life Political Action\n\nComm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              In this instance, the question of mootness depends on the\n\nviability of the appellants' compensatory education claim. We know\n\nthat a child eligible for special education services under the IDEA\n\nmay be entitled to further services, in compensation for past\n\ndeprivations, even after his or her eligibility has expired.                     See,\n\ne.g., Adams, 159 F.3d at 682 n.1; Pihl v. Mass. Dep't of Educ., 9\n\nF.3d 184, 188-89 & n.8 (1st Cir. 1993).                Such a child's claim for\n\ncompensatory education begins to accrue when his or her IEP is so\n\ninappropriate that the child is receiving no real educational\n\nbenefit.     M.C. v. Cent. Reg'l Sch. Dist., 81 F.3d 389, 396 (3d Cir.\n\n1996); Murphy v. Timberlane Reg'l Sch. Dist., 22 F.3d 1186, 1195\n\n(1st   Cir.    1994).       The   presence       of   an   actionable    claim    for\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fcompensatory   education   will    insulate    an   IDEA    case   against   a\n\nmootness challenge even after the child's eligibility for special\n\neducation services ends.        Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 284 v. A.C., 258\n\nF.3d 769, 774-75 (8th Cir. 2001); cf. Thomas R.W. v. Mass. Dep't of\n\nEduc., 130 F.3d 477, 480 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating the negative of\n\nthe same proposition).\n\n          Orderly     procedure    suggests    that    we     bifurcate    our\n\ndiscussion of this issue.         We first must determine whether the\n\nappellants timely asserted their claim for compensatory education.\n\nIf so, we then must address the question of whether S.R. arguably\n\nsuffered a deprivation of services that would give rise to such a\n\nclaim.\n\n          1.     Timeliness.     The district court concluded that the\n\nappellants had advanced the compensatory education claim in a\n\ntimely manner.    See Me. Sch. Admin. Dist., 178 F. Supp. 2d at 24-\n\n25.   We affirm that holding on the basis of the district court's\n\nlucid analysis of the record and its perspicacious reasoning.               See\n\nid.   We add only that, once the end of S.R.'s eligibility for\n\nspecial   education     services     loomed,    the    appellants         acted\n\nexpeditiously to make known their desire that the School District\n\noffset the inadequacies of the 2000-2001 school year by providing\n\ncompensatory education.        No more was exigible.        See Thomas R.W.,\n\n130 F.3d at 480.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f            In a related vein, we reject the School District's\n\nimportuning that the compensatory education claim was barred by a\n\nfailure   to     exhaust   administrative    remedies.       The   appellants'\n\nobjections to the IEP related only to S.R.'s final year in school.\n\nS.R. was within the eligible age limits when that year began; by\n\nthe time that year ended, the administrative record had been closed\n\nfor quite some time and the case was pending before the district\n\ncourt.          Although   parents   ordinarily      must     exhaust    their\n\nadministrative remedies before appealing to a federal court, see\n\nFrazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm., 276 F.3d 52, 59, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2002),    the    appellants'   failure      to   raise   a   then-nonexistent\n\ncompensatory education claim before the hearing officer is not\n\nfatal to judicial review.       See id. at 59; Pihl, 9 F.3d at 190-91.\n\nParents are not expected to have the gift of prophecy.\n\n            2.     Mootness.    We turn next to the district court's\n\nholding that the compensatory education claim was substantively\n\nmoot.    Me. Sch. Admin. Dist., 178 F. Supp. 2d at 25.             In coming to\n\nthis conclusion, the court focused on the appellants' challenge to\n\nthe work-site placement.       We think that this focus was too narrow.\n\n            S.R.'s placement at a work site rather than in a school\n\nwas only a part of the overall IEP.          The record shows beyond hope\n\nof contradiction that the appellants sought from the beginning an\n\nappropriate IEP for the 2000-2001 school year — a new IEP that did\n\nnot merely replicate S.R.'s unsuccessful 1999-2000 IEP.                    The\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fhearing officer responded to these expressed concerns, dissecting\n\nthe   School   District's    suggested    IEP,     approving   parts    of   it\n\n(including the work-site placement) and disapproving other parts.\n\nAlthough    the   appellants    only   sought    judicial   review     of    the\n\nplacement decision, not of the order to add other features to the\n\nIEP, the fact remains that S.R. never enjoyed the benefits that\n\nwould have flowed from the implementation of those other features.\n\nIn short, while S.R. was not relegated to a work site for the 2000-\n\n2001 school year, he may not have received an appropriate IEP for\n\nthat year (and, thus, may not have received the FAPE to which he\n\nwas entitled).\n\n            The School District attempts to cast doubt upon the\n\nfactual antecedents of the appellants' position.                The attempt\n\nfails.     The record fully supports the appellants' asseveration\n\nthat, all along, they sought the development of an appropriate IEP,\n\ndifferent from both the previous IEP (1999-2000) and the proposed\n\nIEP (2000-2001).       Indeed, their criticisms of the 1999-2000 IEP\n\nwere vociferous.       So viewed, the appellants have a colorable claim\n\nthat the continuation of this benighted placement into the 2000-\n\n2001 school year deprived S.R. of the compendium of services\n\nreasonably necessary to constitute a FAPE. See Roland M., 910 F.2d\n\nat 992.\n\n            Let   us    be   perfectly    clear.       We   recognize       that\n\ncompensatory education is not an appropriate remedy for a purely\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fprocedural violation of the IDEA.            Erickson v. Albuquerque Pub.\n\nSch., 199 F.3d 1116, 1122-23 (10th Cir. 1999).                  In contrast, a\n\nsubstantive violation may give rise to a claim for compensatory\n\nrelief.    See Rome Sch. Comm., 247 F.3d at 31; Pihl, 9 F.3d at 188,\n\n189-90 (collecting cases).        Here, the prospective relief that the\n\nappellants sought at the commencement of these proceedings was both\n\nprocedural    and    substantive.        Thus,    a   claim   for   compensatory\n\neducation arguably lies — and their case is not moot.\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nSchool District complains that the appellants forced it, through\n\nthe invocation of the stay-put provision, to maintain S.R.'s\n\ncontested 1999-2000 IEP throughout the 2000-2001 school year (or\n\nnearly so).     That is true as far as it goes — but it does not\n\nadvance the School District's cause.              The appellants never sought\n\na stay-put placement as relief on the merits before either the\n\nhearing officer or the district court.                For them, the stay-put\n\nplacement was merely the lesser of two evils.7            See Burr v. Ambach,\n\n863 F.2d     1071,   1076   (2d   Cir.    1988)    (describing      the   stay-put\n\nprovision as protection against an even worse placement during the\n\npendency of review proceedings).          Conferring blanket immunity from\n\n\n     7\n      The School District did not seek to secure the parents'\nagreement to an alternative interim placement. See 20 U.S.C. §\n1415(j) (quoted supra note 1) (permitting such consensual\narrangements). Such an agreement would have averted any liability\nfor compensatory education. See W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 500\n(3d Cir. 1995); see also Doe v. Defendant I, 898 F.2d 1186, 1189\n(6th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcompensatory education claims during the course of a stay-put\n\nplacement       would   reward   school    districts   for    misfeasance       or\n\nnonfeasance in providing appropriate educational services.                      Cf.\n\nJefferson County Bd. of Educ. v. Breen, 853 F.2d 853, 857-58 (11th\n\nCir.    1988)    (awarding    compensatory     education     to   deter   school\n\ndistricts       from    unnecessarily     prolonging   litigation);       Doe    v.\n\nBrookline Sch. Comm., 722 F.2d 910, 916 (1st Cir. 1983) (condemning\n\na rule that would allow a party who shirks its duties during a\n\nstay-put placement to escape liability for its laxity).               The case\n\nlaw, though sparse, suggests that courts should refuse to confer\n\nany such blanket immunity.        See, e.g., W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484,\n\n500 (3d Cir. 1995); M.C. v. Voluntown Bd. of Educ., 56 F. Supp. 2d\n\n243, 250 n.7 (D. Conn. 1999).           We so hold:    claiming to be caught\n\nbetween a rock and a hard place is no excuse for dereliction of\n\nduty.    The IDEA charges school districts with making reasonable\n\nefforts both to work with parents and to satisfy the needs of\n\nspecial education students.             That entails the responsibility to\n\nfind a path that runs between the rock and the hard place.                  Knee-\n\njerk compliance with a stay-put provision does not negate that\n\nresponsibility.\n\n            The School District also submits that the appellants\n\nfailed to allege specific facts in support of their claim for\n\ncompensatory education. They suggest that the appellants needed to\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fshow precisely what services S.R. should have received (but did\n\nnot) during the 2000-2001 school year.    This sets the bar too high.\n\n             The IDEA constructs a framework that ensures procedural\n\ndue process in the IEP context.    See 20 U.S.C. § 1415.   It does not\n\nattempt to delineate the specific substance of any particular\n\nchild's IEP.     That is as it should be:    IEPs are by their very\n\nnature idiosyncratic, and the appropriate content of a particular\n\nchild's IEP for a given year can only be determined by those\n\nassigned to evaluate the child and develop the IEP (with the help\n\nof the parents).      See id. §§ 1401(11), 1412(a)(4), 1414(d); 34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.340-50.      In mounting a challenge to a current or\n\nproposed IEP, the most that parents can be expected to do is to\n\npoint out areas in which the IEP is deficient.       See Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 208-09; Erickson, 199 F.3d at 1123; Roland M., 910 F.2d at\n\n992.\n\n          These tenets hold true vis-à-vis claims for compensatory\n\neducation.    See Cent. Reg'l Sch. Dist., 81 F.3d at 397 (noting that\n\n\"a child's entitlement to special education should not depend upon\n\nthe vigilance of the parents\").      The appellants, who pointed to\n\nmany problems in both the 1999-2000 IEP and the proposed 2000-2001\n\nIEP, did their part. Consequently, we reject the School District's\n\nsuggestion that the appellants' compensatory education claim was\n\ninsufficiently precise.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f              None    of     this   is    equivalent     to   saying    that     S.R.   is\n\nentitled      to    compensatory         education.      We    hold    only    that     the\n\nappellants'        claim     for    compensatory      education       deserves    to    be\n\nconsidered on the merits and that the district court should not\n\nhave jettisoned it as moot.                Accordingly, the order of dismissal\n\nmust be reversed and the compensatory education issue remanded to\n\nthe district court.            If the district court does not believe that\n\nthe record is sufficient to permit it to make the highly nuanced\n\njudgments       necessary      to    resolve       the   claim    for    compensatory\n\neducation, it may remand the matter for further administrative\n\nadjudication.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.8         We hold that the appellants were\n\nprevailing         parties    in    the    First    Suit;     that     the    claim     for\n\ncompensatory education was properly raised, and remained viable, in\n\nthe Second Suit; and that, therefore, the district court erred in\n\nits adjudication of appellants' claims.                       Hence, we reverse the\n\njudgments below and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      The appellants' complaint in the Second Suit also contained\nclaims under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and Maine's\nspecial education laws, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 20-A, §§ 7001-8207.\nThe district court never addressed these claims, and the parties do\nnot discuss them on appeal. We therefore take no view as to their\njusticiability.\n\n                                            -25-\n\f          Reversed and remanded.   Costs are taxed in favor of the\n\nappellants.\n\n\n\n\n                              -26-\n\f",

The Individuals with Disabilities\n\nEducation Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487 (1997), obligates\n\nschool districts to furnish a free appropriate public education\n\n(FAPE)   to    children   with    disabilities.     See   id.   §§       1401(8),\n\n1411(b)(2)(C), 1412(a)(1), 1413(i)(1), 1415(b)(1).              That is the\n\ngood news.      The bad news is that the IDEA is not self-executing,\n\nand parents, school officials, bureaucrats, and judges alike have\n\nstruggled to master its intricacies.\n\n              These consolidated appeals illustrate the point.             Taken\n\ntogether, they present two loosely related questions.                The first\n\nconcerns      whether   parents    who    successfully    resist     a    school\n\ndistrict's effort, in an independent legal action, to overturn a\n\nstay-put placement on the ground of the alleged dangerousness of a\n\nchild with disabilities are considered prevailing parties within\n\nthe purview of the IDEA's fee-shifting provision.                  The second\n\nconcerns the circumstances under which a learning-disabled child\n\nwho, by reason of his age, is no longer covered by the IDEA may\n\nnonetheless be entitled to some relief to compensate him for the\n\ndeprivation of a FAPE during an earlier period. The district court\n\nanswered these questions in ways that pretermitted the appellants'\n\nclaims for attorneys' fees and compensatory education. Concluding,\n\nas we do, that the court erred, we reverse the judgments below and\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We sketch the relevant facts.       The appellants, Mr. and\n\nMrs. R., are the parents of S.R.      S.R., who was born in December of\n\n1980, suffers from Down's Syndrome. He has had special educational\n\nneeds throughout his formative years.       During the times material\n\nhereto, Maine School Administrative District No. 35 (the School\n\nDistrict) has had the responsibility of ministering to these needs.\n\n           Generally speaking, the IDEA obliged the School District\n\nto furnish S.R. with a FAPE sufficient to confer some educational\n\nbenefit.

Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (1982);\n\nRoland M. v.

See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(11),\n\n1412(a)(4), 1414(d); see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.340-50.            S.R. was\n\neligible for such special education services through the 2000-2001\n\nschool year (when he turned twenty years of age).       See 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(1)(B)(i)-(ii) (linking eligibility for special education\n\nservices to state law); Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 20-A, § 5201(1)\n\n(granting every student the right to public education through the\n\nschool year encompassing his or her twentieth birthday).\n\n           It would serve no useful purpose to discuss S.R.'s early\n\nscholastic experiences. Rather, we begin with the 1999-2000 school\n\nyear   (which     encompassed   S.R.'s   nineteenth    birthday).       In\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffurtherance of its responsibilities under the IDEA, the School\n\nDistrict prepared an IEP for that year.                 Under it, S.R. spent\n\nmornings at Marshwood High School and afternoons at a work-site\n\ntraining program (where he also received some special education\n\nservices).\n\n            During    the    1999-2000     school    year,   S.R.       displayed    a\n\nvariety of behavioral problems, including verbal outbursts and\n\nassaultive conduct.         Believing that these problems stemmed from\n\nS.R.'s    \"ineffective      and   frustrating\"       IEP,    Mr.    and    Mrs.     R.\n\nrepeatedly    requested      modifications.         Officials      of    the   School\n\nDistrict     met   with     the   family    many    times    to    address       these\n\nremonstrances, discuss S.R.'s current IEP, and ponder his future\n\ncurriculum.\n\n             In June of 2000, the School District proffered a new IEP\n\nfor the 2000-2001 school year.         Under this proposal, S.R. was to be\n\nrelegated to a work-site training program for the entire school\n\nday.     His vocational training would be augmented with monthly\n\nspeech therapy, sign language lessons, behavioral consultations,\n\nand social skills instruction.\n\n             S.R.'s   parents     rejected    this    proposal.           They    took\n\nespecial umbrage at the fact that the draft IEP completely removed\n\nS.R. from a mainstream academic setting.                Concluding that this\n\ncircumstance violated their son's right to receive educational\n\nservices in the least restrictive environment possible, see 20\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fU.S.C. § 1412(a)(5), the parents sought a hearing before the Maine\n\nDepartment    of     Education,      see   id.   §    1415(f).        The    parents\n\nsimultaneously       invoked   the    IDEA's     stay-put     provision,       id.   §\n\n1415(j), so that S.R. would remain in his 1999-2000 educational\n\nplacement pending a resolution of his 2000-2001 IEP.1                     The School\n\nDistrict defended the draft IEP, and, accordingly, resisted the\n\nparents' administrative petition.\n\n          The School District then took a more unusual step:                         it\n\ninitiated a civil action in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Maine (the First Suit) seeking to bar S.R. from\n\nreturning to Marshwood High because his presence there would pose\n\n(or so the School District alleged) a substantial risk of danger to\n\nhimself or others.       Coincident with the filing of its complaint,\n\nthe School District moved for temporary and preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief.      After    reviewing    the     motion    papers    and    the   family's\n\nobjection,    the    district     court     refused    to     issue   a     temporary\n\nrestraining order (TRO).          The effect of that ruling was to leave\n\n\n\n     1\n      The stay-put provision, with an exception not applicable\nhere, states:\n\n          [D]uring the pendency of any proceedings\n          conducted pursuant to [IDEA § 1415], unless\n          the State or local educational agency and the\n          parents otherwise agree, the child shall\n          remain   in   the   then-current  educational\n          placement of such child, . . . until all such\n          proceedings have been completed.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(j).\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe stay-put order (and, thus, S.R.'s placement at Marshwood High)\n\nintact.   The School District chose not to pursue the matter\n\nfurther, but, rather, moved to dismiss its complaint.        See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 41(a).       The parents did not object but asserted an\n\nentitlement   to   attorneys'   fees   and   costs.   See   20   U.S.C.   §\n\n1415(i)(3)(B).     The district court granted the School District's\n\nmotion for voluntary dismissal but denied the parents' request for\n\nremuneration on the ground that they were not a prevailing party.\n\nMe. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. & Mrs. R., Civ. No. 00-242 (D.\n\nMe. Apr. 9, 2001).    The parents filed a timely appeal.\n\n          Meanwhile, the administrative hearing anent the adequacy\n\nof the proposed 2000-2001 IEP went forward on a parallel track.           In\n\na decision dated October 31, 2000, the hearing officer approved the\n\nconcept of a totally non-scholastic placement but determined that\n\nthe IEP was inadequate in other respects. Consequently, he ordered\n\nthe School District to prepare an amended IEP.              The parents\n\nexercised their right to judicial review of this decision, see 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A); they commenced an action in the federal\n\ndistrict court (the Second Suit) in which they sought to overturn\n\nthe hearing officer's approval of S.R.'s work-site placement.         The\n\nSchool District filed a cross-complaint challenging other parts of\n\nthe administrative decision.\n\n          In December of 2001, S.R. reached his twentieth birthday.\n\nThe following June, he graduated from Marshwood High.            Upon the\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\foccurrence of that event, the School District took the position\n\nthat the parents' appeal from the administrative decision had\n\nbecome moot. In their reply, the parents gainsaid this contention.\n\nThey pointed out that S.R. had dropped out of his special education\n\nprogram at Marshwood High during the 2000-2001 school year and\n\nasserted that he was entitled to compensatory education to offset\n\nthe inadequate IEP that the School District had proposed.2              After\n\nsome skirmishing (the details of which need not concern us), the\n\ndistrict court ruled that the suit was not \"procedural[ly] moot[]\"\n\nbecause the parents had raised the claim for compensatory education\n\nin a timely fashion.3         Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. & Mrs.\n\nR.,   176   F.   Supp.   2d    15,   24-25   (D.   Me.   2001).   The   court\n\n\n      2\n      We need not dwell on the withdrawal, as it is irrelevant to\nthe appellants' compensatory education claim.       Cf. Zobrest v.\nCatalina Foothills Sch.

If it is eventually determined that S.R. would not have\nreceived a FAPE had he remained at Marshwood under the stay-put\nplacement — a matter on which we take no view — his withdrawal\nwould not foreclose his claim for compensatory education.\n      3\n      The district judge — the same judge who earlier had dismissed\nthe First Suit without an award of attorneys' fees — referred the\nSchool District's motion to dismiss to a magistrate judge. See 28\nU.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).        He thereafter\naccepted and adopted the magistrate judge's detailed report and\nrecommendation.    For simplicity's sake, we do not distinguish\nbetween the two judicial officers.           Rather, we take an\ninstitutional view and refer to the determinations below as those\nof the district court.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fnevertheless dismissed the case for what it termed \"substantive\n\nmootness,\" declaring that \"S.R. [had] received, for all that\n\nappears in the record, the very relief he and his parents initially\n\nsought in this action, by virtue of the . . . 'stay-put' ruling.\"\n\nId. at 25.     The second appeal followed.           We consolidated it with\n\nthe earlier       appeal    (which   had    been   stayed)   for   briefing   and\n\nargument.     We now resolve both appeals.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n             The parents — we henceforth shall refer to them as the\n\nappellants — press ahead on two fronts.              They assign error to the\n\nlower court's determination that they were not prevailing parties\n\nin    the   First   Suit.     They   also    protest   the   district   court's\n\ndismissal of the Second Suit as moot, pointing to the pendency of\n\ntheir compensatory education claim.                 We address these points\n\nsequentially.\n\n                      A.     The Attorneys' Fee Claim.\n\n             In most civil litigation, the parties are responsible for\n\npaying their own attorneys' fees.            See Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home,\n\nInc. v. W. Va.

Despite this general rule, Congress sometimes\n\nchooses to allow for fee-shifting in particular situations, and it\n\nchose to do so in connection with the IDEA.             The statute provides\n\nin relevant part:\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f          In any action or proceeding brought under\n          [section 1415 of the IDEA], the court, in its\n          discretion, may award reasonable attorneys'\n          fees as part of the costs to the parents of a\n          child with a disability who is the prevailing\n          party.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B).           Because this provision employs the\n\nphrase \"prevailing party\" — a term of art — it must be interpreted\n\nand applied in the same manner as other federal fee-shifting\n\nstatutes that use the same phraseology.

With this paradigm in\n\nmind, we turn to the assignment of error.\n\n          The appellants ask for attorneys' fees referable only to\n\nthe First Suit.    Their position is straightforward:          the School\n\nDistrict commenced a civil action and the appellants successfully\n\ndefended against it (i.e., the School District did not receive any\n\nof the relief that it sought and, eventually, threw in the towel).\n\nThe   School   District   rejoins     that   this    victory   was   merely\n\ninterlocutory — a single battle in the war over the 2000-2001 IEP\n\n— and therefore is insufficient to support prevailing party status.\n\nWe test these hypotheses.\n\n          In general, the materiality requirement demands that a\n\nparty succeed on the merits of a claim or defense.

We\n\nare   dealing   here   not   with   a   stay-put   order   issued,   on   an\n\ninterlocutory basis, in the course of ongoing judicial review.\n\nRather, the First Suit was an independent, free-standing civil\n\naction, instituted by the School District, in which it sought to\n\nenjoin the operation of the stay-put provision.            That quest for\n\ninjunctive relief was the sole object — the raison d'être — of the\n\nFirst Suit.\n\n            To be sure, the School District probably saw the First\n\nSuit as a piece of a larger dispute between it and the appellants\n\nover the 2000-2001 IEP.

The\n\nappellants were haled into court as defendants and won a clear-cut\n\nvictory on the sole issue in the case (an issue that had been\n\nframed by the School District).

That is to say, the injunctive\n\naction that it brought under section 1415(k)(2) (the First Suit)\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fattempted to work an autarkic material alteration in the legal\n\nrelations between the parties.

We first must determine whether the\n\nappellants timely asserted their claim for compensatory education.\n\nIf so, we then must address the question of whether S.R. arguably\n\nsuffered a deprivation of services that would give rise to such a\n\nclaim.\n\n          1.     Timeliness.     The district court concluded that the\n\nappellants had advanced the compensatory education claim in a\n\ntimely manner.    See Me. Sch. Admin. Dist., 178 F. Supp. 2d at 24-\n\n25.   We affirm that holding on the basis of the district court's\n\nlucid analysis of the record and its perspicacious reasoning.               See\n\nid.   We add only that, once the end of S.R.'s eligibility for\n\nspecial   education     services     loomed,    the    appellants         acted\n\nexpeditiously to make known their desire that the School District\n\noffset the inadequacies of the 2000-2001 school year by providing\n\ncompensatory education.        No more was exigible.        See Thomas R.W.,\n\n130 F.3d at 480.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f            In a related vein, we reject the School District's\n\nimportuning that the compensatory education claim was barred by a\n\nfailure   to     exhaust   administrative    remedies.       The   appellants'\n\nobjections to the IEP related only to S.R.'s final year in school.\n\nS.R. was within the eligible age limits when that year began; by\n\nthe time that year ended, the administrative record had been closed\n\nfor quite some time and the case was pending before the district\n\ncourt.          Although   parents   ordinarily      must     exhaust    their\n\nadministrative remedies before appealing to a federal court, see\n\nFrazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776058\"><a href=\"/opinion/776058/kate-frazier-v-fairhaven-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n2002),    the    appellants'   failure      to   raise   a   then-nonexistent\n\ncompensatory education claim before the hearing officer is not\n\nfatal to judicial review.       See id. at 59; Pihl, 9 F.3d at 190-91.\n\nParents are not expected to have the gift of prophecy.\n\n            2.     Mootness.    We turn next to the district court's\n\nholding that the compensatory education claim was substantively\n\nmoot.    Me. Sch. Admin. Dist., 178 F. Supp. 2d at 25.             In coming to\n\nthis conclusion, the court focused on the appellants' challenge to\n\nthe work-site placement.       We think that this focus was too narrow.\n\n            S.R.'s placement at a work site rather than in a school\n\nwas only a part of the overall IEP.          The record shows beyond hope\n\nof contradiction that the appellants sought from the beginning an\n\nappropriate IEP for the 2000-2001 school year — a new IEP that did\n\nnot merely replicate S.R.'s unsuccessful 1999-2000 IEP.                    The\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fhearing officer responded to these expressed concerns, dissecting\n\nthe   School   District's    suggested    IEP,     approving   parts    of   it\n\n(including the work-site placement) and disapproving other parts.\n\nAlthough    the   appellants    only   sought    judicial   review     of    the\n\nplacement decision, not of the order to add other features to the\n\nIEP, the fact remains that S.R. never enjoyed the benefits that\n\nwould have flowed from the implementation of those other features.\n\nIn short, while S.R. was not relegated to a work site for the 2000-\n\n2001 school year, he may not have received an appropriate IEP for\n\nthat year (and, thus, may not have received the FAPE to which he\n\nwas entitled).\n\n            The School District attempts to cast doubt upon the\n\nfactual antecedents of the appellants' position.                The attempt\n\nfails.     The record fully supports the appellants' asseveration\n\nthat, all along, they sought the development of an appropriate IEP,\n\ndifferent from both the previous IEP (1999-2000) and the proposed\n\nIEP (2000-2001).       Indeed, their criticisms of the 1999-2000 IEP\n\nwere vociferous.       So viewed, the appellants have a colorable claim\n\nthat the continuation of this benighted placement into the 2000-\n\n2001 school year deprived S.R. of the compendium of services\n\nreasonably necessary to constitute a FAPE. See Roland M., 910 F.2d\n\nat 992.\n\n            Let   us    be   perfectly    clear.       We   recognize       that\n\ncompensatory education is not an appropriate remedy for a purely\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fprocedural violation of the IDEA.            Erickson v. Albuquerque Pub.\n\nSch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158978\"><a href=\"/opinion/158978/erickson-v-albuquerque-public/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1122-23 (10th Cir. 1999).                  In contrast, a\n\nsubstantive violation may give rise to a claim for compensatory\n\nrelief.    See Rome Sch. Comm., 247 F.3d at 31; Pihl, 9 F.3d at 188,\n\n189-90 (collecting cases).        Here, the prospective relief that the\n\nappellants sought at the commencement of these proceedings was both\n\nprocedural    and    substantive.        Thus,    a   claim   for   compensatory\n\neducation arguably lies — and their case is not moot.\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nSchool District complains that the appellants forced it, through\n\nthe invocation of the stay-put provision, to maintain S.R.'s\n\ncontested 1999-2000 IEP throughout the 2000-2001 school year (or\n\nnearly so).     That is true as far as it goes — but it does not\n\nadvance the School District's cause.              The appellants never sought\n\na stay-put placement as relief on the merits before either the\n\nhearing officer or the district court.                For them, the stay-put\n\nplacement was merely the lesser of two evils.7            See Burr v. Ambach,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516006\"><a href=\"/opinion/516006/clifford-burr-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-kenneth-burr-betty-burr-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>     <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   1076   (2d   Cir.    1988)    (describing      the   stay-put\n\nprovision as protection against an even worse placement during the\n\npendency of review proceedings).

We so hold:    claiming to be caught\n\nbetween a rock and a hard place is no excuse for dereliction of\n\nduty.    The IDEA charges school districts with making reasonable\n\nefforts both to work with parents and to satisfy the needs of\n\nspecial education students.             That entails the responsibility to\n\nfind a path that runs between the rock and the hard place.                  Knee-\n\njerk compliance with a stay-put provision does not negate that\n\nresponsibility.\n\n            The School District also submits that the appellants\n\nfailed to allege specific facts in support of their claim for\n\ncompensatory education. They suggest that the appellants needed to\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fshow precisely what services S.R. should have received (but did\n\nnot) during the 2000-2001 school year.    This sets the bar too high.\n\n             The IDEA constructs a framework that ensures procedural\n\ndue process in the IEP context.    See 20 U.S.C. § 1415.   It does not\n\nattempt to delineate the specific substance of any particular\n\nchild's IEP.     That is as it should be:    IEPs are by their very\n\nnature idiosyncratic, and the appropriate content of a particular\n\nchild's IEP for a given year can only be determined by those\n\nassigned to evaluate the child and develop the IEP (with the help\n\nof the parents).      See id. §§ 1401(11), 1412(a)(4), 1414(d); 34\n\nC.F.R. §§ 300.340-50.      In mounting a challenge to a current or\n\nproposed IEP, the most that parents can be expected to do is to\n\npoint out areas in which the IEP is deficient.       See Rowley, 458\n\nU.S. at 208-09; Erickson, 199 F.3d at 1123; Roland M., 910 F.2d at\n\n992.\n\n          These tenets hold true vis-à-vis claims for compensatory\n\neducation.    See Cent. Reg'l Sch. Dist., 81 F.3d at 397 (noting that\n\n\"a child's entitlement to special education should not depend upon\n\nthe vigilance of the parents\").      The appellants, who pointed to\n\nmany problems in both the 1999-2000 IEP and the proposed 2000-2001\n\nIEP, did their part. Consequently, we reject the School District's\n\nsuggestion that the appellants' compensatory education claim was\n\ninsufficiently precise.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f              None    of     this   is    equivalent     to   saying    that     S.R.   is\n\nentitled      to    compensatory         education.      We    hold    only    that     the\n\nappellants'        claim     for    compensatory      education       deserves    to    be\n\nconsidered on the merits and that the district court should not\n\nhave jettisoned it as moot.                Accordingly, the order of dismissal\n\nmust be reversed and the compensatory education issue remanded to\n\nthe district court.            If the district court does not believe that\n\nthe record is sufficient to permit it to make the highly nuanced\n\njudgments       necessary      to    resolve       the   claim    for    compensatory\n\neducation, it may remand the matter for further administrative\n\nadjudication.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.8         We hold that the appellants were\n\nprevailing         parties    in    the    First    Suit;     that     the    claim     for\n\ncompensatory education was properly raised, and remained viable, in\n\nthe Second Suit; and that, therefore, the district court erred in\n\nits adjudication of appellants' claims.                       Hence, we reverse the\n\njudgments below and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      The appellants' complaint in the Second Suit also contained\nclaims under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and Maine's\nspecial education laws, Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 20-A, §§ 7001-8207.\nThe district court never addressed these claims, and the parties do\nnot discuss them on appeal. We therefore take no view as to their\njusticiability.\n\n                                            -25-\n\f          Reversed and remanded.
