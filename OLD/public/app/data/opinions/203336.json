Poppy Sombah, her husband Freddy,\n\nand her minor son, all natives and citizens of Indonesia, petition\n\nfor review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\") denying their applications for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").\n\nWe deny the petition.\n\n          Sombah and her son entered the United States on November\n\n3, 2003 with non-immigrant visitor visas which authorized them to\n\nremain until May 2, 2004.     They overstayed.    Sombah's husband had\n\nentered on a non-immigrant visa on September 3, 2003.        That visa\n\nexpired on October 3, 2003, and he overstayed.      On April 26, 2004,\n\nSombah filed an application for asylum with the Department of\n\nHomeland Security (\"DHS\") on behalf of herself as well as her son\n\nand husband as derivative applicants.\n\n          Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") initiated\n\nremoval proceedings against the Sombah family by filing Notices to\n\nAppear (\"NTA\") on July 13, 2004.        The agency charged the Sombahs\n\nwith removability for having overstayed their visas; the Sombahs\n\nconceded removability.\n\n          In her testimony before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") and\n\nin affidavits accompanying her application for asylum, Sombah\n\ndescribed several incidents in support of her claim of persecution\n\non account of her religion.    Although born into a Muslim family in\n\nJakarta, Sombah converted to Christianity in 1981 and married a\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fChristian man.       Sombah's Muslim family disowned her, \"terrorized\"\n\nFreddy at work, and threatened to kidnap their three children.\n\nSombah has not received any such threats from her family since\n\n1986.\n\n             Sombah testified to having experienced other forms of\n\nharassment due to her Christian faith.                Between 1994 and 2000, the\n\nSombahs held monthly prayer meetings at their home with other\n\nmembers of their church.         Attendees at these meetings found, upon\n\nleaving, that their cars had been vandalized.                           In 1999, the\n\nSombahs' church was burned, presumably by Muslims.                  The church had\n\nbeen erected without government approval, and the government did\n\nnot allow the church to be rebuilt.               In 2001, Freddy Sombah was\n\nriding   a   bus    when   a   group   of     thugs    boarded    and     robbed    the\n\npassengers.        The robbers made threatening comments to Freddy,\n\nreferencing    his    Christian      faith.       Also   in     2001,    the   Sombahs\n\ntraveled to Sulawesi, a separate island from their home island of\n\nJava, and attended a prayer meeting that was disrupted by a violent\n\ngroup.   The Sombahs were not injured in this incident.\n\n             Sombah   additionally      testified        that    Muslim    neighbors\n\nkilled her dog, that a neighbor blocked a pipe in order to cause\n\nsewage to flow onto her property rather than the neighbor's own,\n\nthat her son was asked to vacate his apartment in a predominantly\n\nMuslim   neighborhood,         and   that   her    granddaughter         received    a\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdisparaging letter from classmates at her predominantly Muslim\n\nschool.\n\n            On    July    26,    2005,    the   IJ     denied   Sombah's   asylum\n\napplication.      The IJ described the threats directed at Sombah by\n\nher family as \"a private matter\" and stressed that they ceased in\n\n1986.     The IJ acknowledged the other incidents of harassment in\n\ndetail and concluded that they did not qualify Sombah for asylum.\n\nIn finding that Sombah had not established a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution were she to return to Indonesia, the IJ noted that\n\nSombah's grown son and daughter, both Christians, continue to live\n\nthere.    The IJ also found it significant that before traveling to\n\nthe United States, Sombah previously visited Europe for two months,\n\nincluding a visit to her sister residing in Germany.                       Sombah\n\nreturned to Indonesia without seeking asylum in Europe.                         When\n\nSombah later obtained a visa to visit the United States, she waited\n\nnine months before departing Indonesia, during which time she and\n\nher family suffered no harm.\n\n            The BIA affirmed the denial of relief on February 28,\n\n2007.     The BIA reiterated the incidents described in Sombah's\n\ntestimony,       then    concluded       that   they     did    not   \"singly    or\n\naccumulatively[] rise to the level of persecution.\" The BIA agreed\n\nwith the IJ that because Sombah had failed to meet the requirements\n\nfor   asylum,     she    could   not   establish       the   high   standards   for\n\nwithholding of removal or relief under the CAT.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f          Sombah timely petitioned to this court for review.      We\n\nuphold the agency's determinations if they are \"supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"    INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The agency's findings of fact \"are conclusive unless any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).   \"We review legal issues de\n\nnovo, granting appropriate deference to the agency's interpretation\n\nof the statutes they are charged with enforcing.\"    Kho v. Keisler,\n\n505 F.3d 50, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          In order to qualify for asylum, Sombah bears the burden\n\nof proving that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution based on her religion.       Chikkeur v.\n\nMukasey, 514 F.3d 1381, 1382 (1st Cir. 2008); see also 8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A).\n\n          There is substantial evidence in the record to sustain\n\nthe BIA's conclusion that Sombah's experiences in Indonesia did not\n\nrise to the level of persecution.      \"Persecution,\" as the term is\n\nused in the immigration law, surpasses \"unpleasantness, harassment,\n\nand even basic suffering.\"    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).    We cannot say that the BIA erred in concluding that\n\nthe intermittent harassment described by Sombah did not constitute\n\npersecution warranting asylum.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Sombah argues that in denying the existence of past\n\npersecution, the IJ erred by failing to take into account the\n\n\"totality of the circumstances,\" including the country conditions\n\nin Indonesia.   That argument fails.   The IJ's decision discussed\n\nDepartment of State Country Condition Reports in the record, and\n\nthe IJ even supplemented the record by introducing, sua sponte, the\n\nDepartment's 2005 Issue Paper regarding Christians in Indonesia.\n\nThe IJ acknowledged that these sources confirm the existence of\n\ndiscrimination against Christians in Muslim-majority Indonesia,\n\neven at the level of national and local government. However, these\n\nbackground facts do not relate in any specific way to Sombah's\n\nindividual claim for asylum. Discrimination in Indonesia does not,\n\nwithout more, qualify a Christian Indonesian national for asylum.\n\nSee, e.g., Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 308-09 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Kho, 505 F.3d at 58; Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57, 59-61\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Sombah also argues that the agency committed legal error\n\nin finding that Sombah failed to establish a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.   Sombah argues that the IJ found that the\n\nIndonesian government was involved in Sombah's harassment and, from\n\nthis, that agency regulations put the burden on the DHS to show\n\nthat it would be reasonable for Sombah to avoid persecution by\n\nrelocating to a different location within Indonesia.   See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§§ 208.13(b)(2)(ii), (3).    Sombah argues that the IJ failed to\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fplace this evidentiary burden on the DHS, and that the DHS did not\n\nmeet it.\n\n           Sombah's argument fails on its premise.                The IJ did not\n\nmake a finding that the Indonesian government was complicit or\n\nacquiescent in private actors' mistreatment of Sombah.                  As noted\n\nabove, the IJ made comments in her decision concerning evidence --\n\ntaken from State Department reports -- that \"there continue to be\n\ncertain levels of discrimination, apparently in Indonesia, both\n\nlocally    and   nationally    with    respect       to     the   treatment   of\n\nChristians.\"     Nowhere does the IJ state that the government was\n\ninvolved in any of the incidents that Sombah relied on for her\n\nasylum claim.    Neither does the record support the suggestion that\n\nSombah's is a case \"in which the persecutor is a government or is\n\ngovernment-sponsored.\"       Id. § 208.13(b)(3)(ii).\n\n           In    a   final    argument       relating       to    the   agency's\n\ndetermination of the asylum issue, Sombah argues that the IJ's\n\nfinding of discrimination by the Indonesian government triggers\n\n\"heightened scrutiny\" of her claims.            We need not consider the\n\nargument because Sombah failed to present it to the BIA.                See Butt\n\nv. Keisler, 506 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir. 2007); see also 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(d)(1).\n\n           Because   Sombah    does    not    meet    the    requirements     for\n\nestablishing eligibility for asylum, neither can she satisfy the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmore stringent standard for withholding of removal. See Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Lastly, because Sombah does not make any arguments in her\n\npetition regarding relief under the CAT, those claims are waived.\n\nSee Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 66 n.4 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Sombah's Muslim family disowned her, \"terrorized\" Freddy at work, and threatened to kidnap their three children. Sombah has not received any such threats from her family since 1986.</p>\n<p>Sombah testified to having experienced other forms of harassment due to her Christian faith. Between 1994 and 2000, the Sombahs held monthly prayer meetings at their home with other members of their church. Attendees at these meetings found, upon leaving, that their cars had been vandalized. In 1999, the Sombahs' church was burned, presumably by Muslims. The church had been erected without government approval, and the government did not allow the church to be rebuilt. In 2001, Freddy Sombah was riding a bus when a group of thugs boarded and robbed the passengers. The robbers made threatening comments to Freddy, referencing his Christian faith. Also in 2001, the Sombahs traveled to Sulawesi, a separate island from their home island of Java, and attended a prayer meeting that was disrupted by a violent group. The Sombahs were not injured in this incident.</p>\n<p>Sombah additionally testified that Muslim neighbors killed her dog, that a neighbor blocked a pipe in order to cause sewage to flow onto her property rather than the neighbor's own, that her son was asked to vacate his apartment in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood, and that her granddaughter received a disparaging letter from classmates at her predominantly Muslim school.</p>\n<p>On July 26, 2005, the IJ denied Sombah's asylum application. The IJ described the threats directed at Sombah by her family as \"a private matter\" and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> stressed that they ceased in 1986. The IJ acknowledged the other incidents of harassment in detail and concluded that they did not qualify Sombah for asylum. In finding that Sombah had not established a well-founded fear of persecution were she to return to Indonesia, the IJ noted that Sombah's grown son and daughter, both Christians, continue to live there. The IJ also found it significant that before traveling to the United States, Sombah previously visited Europe for two months, including a visit to her sister residing in Germany. Sombah returned to Indonesia without seeking asylum in Europe. When Sombah later obtained a visa to visit the United States, she waited nine months before departing Indonesia, during which time she and her family suffered no harm.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the denial of relief on February 28, 2007. The BIA reiterated the incidents described in Sombah's testimony, then concluded that they did not \"singly or accumulatively[] rise to the level of persecution.\" The BIA agreed with the IJ that because Sombah had failed to meet the requirements for asylum, she could not establish the high standards for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p>Sombah timely petitioned to this court for review. We uphold the agency's determinations if they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v.

Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203124\"><a href=\"/opinion/203124/chikkeur-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1382 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>There is substantial evidence in the record to sustain the BIA's conclusion that Sombah's experiences in Indonesia did not rise to the level of persecution. \"Persecution,\" as the term is used in the immigration law, surpasses \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.2000). We cannot say that the BIA erred in concluding that the intermittent harassment described by Sombah did not constitute persecution warranting asylum.</p>\n<p>Sombah argues that in denying the existence of past persecution, the IJ erred by failing to take into account the \"totality of the circumstances,\" including the country conditions in Indonesia. That argument fails. The IJ's decision discussed Department of State Country Condition Reports in the record, and the IJ even supplemented the record by introducing, sua sponte, the Department's 2005 Issue Paper regarding Christians in Indonesia. The IJ acknowledged that these sources confirm the existence of discrimination against Christians in Muslim-majority Indonesia, even at the level of national and local government. However, these background facts do not relate in any specific way to Sombah's individual claim for asylum. Discrimination in Indonesia does not, without more, qualify a Christian Indonesian national for asylum. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203272\"><a href=\"/opinion/203272/pulisir-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 308-09 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Kho,</i> 505 F.3d at 58; <i>Susanto</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> <i>v.

Sombah argues that the IJ found that the Indonesian government was involved in Sombah's harassment and, from this, that agency regulations put the burden on the DHS to show that it would be reasonable for Sombah to avoid persecution by relocating to a different location within Indonesia. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13(b)(2)(ii), (3). Sombah argues that the IJ failed to place this evidentiary burden on the DHS, and that the DHS did not meet it.</p>\n<p>Sombah's argument fails on its premise. The IJ did not make a finding that the Indonesian government was complicit or acquiescent in private actors' mistreatment of Sombah. As noted above, the IJ made comments in her decision concerning evidencetaken from State Department reportsthat \"there continue to be certain levels of discrimination, apparently in Indonesia, both locally and nationally with respect to the treatment of Christians.\" Nowhere does the IJ state that the government was involved in any of the incidents that Sombah relied on for her asylum claim. Neither does the record support the suggestion that Sombah's is a case \"in which the persecutor is a government or is government-sponsored.\" <i>Id.</i> § 208.13(b)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p>In a final argument relating to the agency's determination of the asylum issue, Sombah argues that the IJ's finding of discrimination by the Indonesian government triggers \"heightened scrutiny\" of her claims. We need not consider the argument because Sombah failed to present it to the BIA. <i>See </i><i>Butt v. Keisler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203005\"><a href=\"/opinion/203005/butt-v-keisler/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2007); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p>Because Sombah does not meet the requirements for establishing eligibility for asylum, neither can she satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Lastly, because Sombah does not make any arguments in her petition regarding relief under the CAT, those claims are waived. <i>See </i><i>Zeru v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></span>, 66 n. 4 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The petition is denied.</p>\n</div>",
