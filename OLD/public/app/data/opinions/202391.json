Petitioner Serge Ngitabah\n\nNyambi (\"Nyambi\") asks us to review the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals' (\"BIA\") denial of his application for asylum, withholding\n\nof   removal,   and   relief   under    the   Convention   Against   Torture\n\n(\"CAT\").   After careful review, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n           Nyambi is a native and citizen of Cameroon who entered\n\nthe United States at New York City on October 6, 1999.               He   was\n\nadmitted to the United States on the basis of a fraudulent passport\n\nand tourist visa.     On June 6, 2000, Nyambi filed an application for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.1\n\n           On February 13, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")2 served Nyambi with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\"),\n\ncharging him with removability for failure to possess a valid entry\n\ndocument pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A). Nyambi conceded\n\n\n\n\n1\n    The Asylum Officer in his Assessment to Refer mentions an\nearlier application for asylum, filed on March 17, 2000. For the\npurposes of this appeal, we will analyze the most recent\napplication. The March 17 application does not appear to be on\nrecord.\n2\n   In March 2003, all     of the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new    Department of Homeland Security, where they\nwere reorganized as        the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (\"BICE\").     See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.\nNo. 107-296, § 471(a),    116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at\n6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fremovability, renewed his application for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval, and sought CAT relief.\n\n            On the same date, Nyambi appeared before an Asylum\n\nOfficer (\"AO\") for an interview.        Nyambi testified that he was\n\nraped during the 1992 and 1998 detentions.      The AO concluded that\n\nNyambi was not credible and referred the matter to an Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\").\n\n            On September 27, 2002, Nyambi appeared at the removal\n\nhearing before the IJ.     The relevant details of his testimony are\n\nset out below.\n\n            Nyambi testified that he was a Cameroonian citizen, and\n\nthat he fled Cameroon because of political oppression.       He further\n\ntestified that he was a member of two Cameroonian opposition\n\ngroups, the Social Democratic Front (\"SDF\") and the Southern\n\nCameroon National Council (\"SCNC\").\n\n            According to Nyambi, the SDF, formed on May 26, 1990, is\n\na political group fighting against the \"ones [sic] party system in\n\nCameroon.\"    Nyambi alleged that he joined the SDF at its inception\n\nand   participated   in   meetings,   symposiums,   and   rallies.   He\n\ntestified that he became a member of the SCNC in 1997 during his\n\nlast year in high school.      The SCNC was a political group that\n\naimed at securing the independence for the Anglophone part of\n\nCameroon.    Nyambi also stated that he was a prominent member of the\n\ngroup and that he tried to \"sensitize the people to make them\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\funderstand how important it was to be a part of that group.\"\n\nNyambi also distributed flyers and took part in \"a lot of rallies.\"\n\n           Nyambi     alleged    that    he    was        detained,   beaten,    and\n\nmaltreated by the police on three occasions.                 The first detention,\n\nlasting nearly two months, occurred in 1990 at the Brigade Mobile\n\nMixte headquarters in the city of Bamenda.                      There, Nyambi was\n\nbeaten and tortured.        Nyambi's father negotiated his son's release\n\nfor a sum of 50,000 francs.               The second detention allegedly\n\noccurred   in     October   1992,    after    the    Cameroonian      presidential\n\nelection. Nyambi declared that he was arrested by the government's\n\nsecurity forces and detained in a prison in Yaounde.                           Nyambi\n\ntestified that he was forced to crawl together with the other\n\ninmates on a wet floor, while the guards beat them with clubs.                   One\n\nmonth after the 1992 arrest, Nyambi allegedly escaped from the\n\ncorrectional facility when the detainees were taken to town to\n\nperform    some    work.       The   third     detention        occurred   between\n\nNovember 24, 1998 and October 4, 1999.                   Nyambi testified that he\n\nwas arrested at a peaceful SCNC demonstration and detained in the\n\nKondengui prison in Yaounde.              Nyambi's father negotiated his\n\nrelease and provided him with a passport and visa to the United\n\nStates.\n\n           After     further    questioning         by    the   IJ,   Nyambi    first\n\ntestified that he was raped during the 1990 and 1992 detentions,\n\nthen he testified that he was raped during the 1992 and 1998\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fdetentions.       Finally, Nyambi declared that he knew he was raped\n\ntwice but that he was \"kind of mixed up\" about the dates.\n\n            Nyambi       also    introduced        his    father's     affidavit      into\n\nevidence.         This     affidavit         generally         corroborated        Nyambi's\n\nallegations, averring that Nyambi was \"gruesomely sodomized\" during\n\nthe 1990 detention.             The affidavit also stated that Nyambi was\n\nreleased from the 1992 detention due to his critical health.\n\nNyambi stated that his father's affidavit is incorrect because it\n\ncontradicted Nyambi's own previous testimony that he escaped from\n\nthe 1992 detention. Nyambi also introduced into evidence his SDF\n\nmembership card and driver's license.                      Nyambi alleged that his\n\nfather paid the SDF renewal dues on his behalf and thus obtained\n\nthe   SDF   card.         Nyambi       presented     an    undated     medical       legal\n\ncertificate to document his 1990 rape.\n\n            The     IJ     denied       Nyambi's         application        for     asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief, but granted him voluntary\n\ndeparture.        In     her    oral    decision,        the    IJ   made    an     adverse\n\ncredibility   finding          based    on    Nyambi's      inconsistent          testimony\n\nregarding the dates of the sexual abuses.                       Before the AO, Nyambi\n\ndeclared that he was raped in 1992 and 1998.                    Before the IJ, Nyambi\n\ntestified initially that he was raped in 1990 and 1992 but then\n\ntestified that he was \"mixed up\" about the dates.\n\n            The IJ also concluded that Nyambi's submitted documentary\n\nevidence did not \"rehabilitate the respondent from his unpersuasive\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fand not incredible [sic] testimony.\"             The IJ pointed to several\n\npieces of evidence to support its reasoning. First, Nyambi himself\n\nattacked the accuracy of his father's affidavit with respect to the\n\nsecond detention.         Second, the medical legal certificate was\n\nundated.   Third, the SDF card was issued on January 15, 1999, while\n\nNyambi was in prison.       Fourth, Nyambi's driver's license was dated\n\nJanuary 12, 2000, when Nyambi was allegedly in the United States.\n\n              Nyambi    appealed   the   IJ's    decision   to    BIA.     On\n\nSeptember 12, 2005, the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ noting\n\nthat   \"the    [IJ's]    adverse   credibility    finding   was   based   upon\n\nconspicuous,        inadequately-explained        discrepancies     in    the\n\nrespondent's testimony and between his testimony and the affidavits\n\nhe submitted in support of his claim.\"            Nyambi now petitions for\n\nreview of this decision.3\n\n                               II.    Analysis\n\n              A.   Standard of Review\n\n              Ordinarily, we are limited to reviewing the decision of\n\nthe BIA without more.        Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).        However, where the BIA defers to the IJ's reasons for\n\ndenying a petitioner's claims, we view those portions of the IJ's\n\n\n\n3\n   Nyambi does not make any argument about the CAT relief in his\nappellate brief. Therefore, we deem that issue waived. Nikijuluw\nv. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[I]ssues\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.\") (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fdecision as incorporated into the final agency determination.                See\n\nHernández-Barrera v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2004).                We\n\nreview the BIA's decisions under the deferential \"substantial\n\nevidence standard.\"       Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 17 (1st\n\nCir.   2004).      See    also    8     U.S.C.     §    1252(b)(4)(B)    (\"[T]he\n\nadministrative     findings      of    fact   are      conclusive   unless   any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\").     We must accept the agency's findings of fact so long\n\nas they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                  INS v. Elías-\n\nZacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).\n\n           B.    Asylum\n\n           An alien has the burden of establishing that he is\n\neligible for asylum.      8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).              To establish\n\neligibility for asylum, an alien must show either past persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of persecution motivated by \"race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Albathani, 318 F.3d\n\nat 373.   Any asylum seeker who has established past persecution is\n\nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.     8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).\n\n           The    applicant's         testimony,       if   uncorroborated    by\n\nconvincing evidence, must be credible, persuasive, and refer to\n\nspecific facts.     8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).              The credibility\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdetermination may be based on the internal consistency of each of\n\nthe applicant's statements and \"the consistency of such statements\n\nwith other evidence of record.\"        Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).      \"[I]n\n\nthe case of an adverse credibility determination, the IJ must offer\n\na specific, cogent reason for [her] disbelief.\" Mihaylov, 379 F.3d\n\nat 21.   \"[The] adverse credibility determination cannot rest on\n\ntrivia but must be based on discrepancies that 'involved the heart\n\nof the asylum claim.'\"    Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 1999) (citation omitted).\n\n          In   the   instant   case,    the   IJ   supported   her   adverse\n\ncredibility determination by pointing out several inconsistencies\n\nin Nyambi's statements relating to the rape incidents, which are\n\ncentral to his asylum claim.      As the IJ correctly noted, Nyambi\n\nstated in his asylum application that the first detention in 1990\n\n\"will remain the most traumatic.\"        Nyambi also stated that he was\n\nsexually abused during the first detention. However, Nyambi failed\n\nto mention this before the AO, despite the fact that the 1990\n\ndetention was allegedly the \"most traumatic\" incident.          Before the\n\nIJ, Nyambi first testified that he was raped during the 1990 and\n\n1992 detentions, then testified that he was raped during the 1992\n\nand 1998 detentions.     Eventually he testified that he could not\n\nremember during which of the detentions he was raped.          The medical\n\nlegal certificate introduced by Nyambi to corroborate his testimony\n\nregarding the 1990 rape does not resolve the discrepancy because it\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fis undated.     These inconsistencies reach to the heart of Nyambi's\n\nclaims.   Compare Ye v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 289, 295 (2d Cir. 2006)\n\n(finding that the omission from the asylum application of a three\n\nday detention accompanied by beatings is a material inconsistency)\n\nwith Hoxha v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 210, 217 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting\n\nthat \"[m]inor inconsistencies in the record such as discrepancies\n\nin dates which reveal nothing about an asylum applicant's fear for\n\nhis safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility\n\nfinding.\")     (citation    and    internal      quotations    marks      omitted).\n\nBecause the rape incidents were central to Nyambi's claim, we find\n\nthat   the    BIA's     affirmance    of   the    IJ's   adverse     credibility\n\ndetermination was supported by specific, cogent reasons.\n\n             The   IJ    gave     additional     reasons      for   her     adverse\n\ncredibility finding.        First, the IJ did not assign any weight to\n\nNyambi's father's affidavit, basing her ruling on Nyambi's own\n\ntestimony that the affidavit was incorrect with respect to the 1992\n\nescape.      Second, the IJ noted that Nyambi could not explain the\n\nissuance date of his SDF card.4            Third, Nyambi's driving license\n\nraised concerns about its accuracy, since it was dated January 12,\n\n2000, when Nyambi was allegedly in the United States.                     We do not\n\nfind anything on the record that would compel a reasonable trier of\n\n\n4\n   The SDF card was issued on January 15, 1999 when Nyambi was\nallegedly in prison.    Nyambi declared that his father paid the\nrenewal dues and obtained the card. Nonetheless, Nyambi did not\nshow any previous SDF membership cards, although he claimed that he\nhad joined the SDF in 1990.\n\n                                       -9-\n\ffact   to   reverse   the   BIA's    finding   of   adverse   credibility.\n\nTherefore, we affirm the BIA's determination.           Because \"a fully\n\nsupported adverse credibility determination, without more, can\n\nsustain a denial of asylum,\"        Olujoke v. Gonzáles, 411 F.3d 16, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), we find Nyambi not eligible for asylum.\n\n            C.   Withholding of Removal\n\n            Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, Nyambi\n\ncannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\n\nSee Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.         Therefore, we find that Nyambi\n\nfailed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\n                            III.     Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n            Denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

L.\nNo. 107-296, § 471(a),    116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at\n6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fremovability, renewed his application for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval, and sought CAT relief.\n\n            On the same date, Nyambi appeared before an Asylum\n\nOfficer (\"AO\") for an interview.        Nyambi testified that he was\n\nraped during the 1992 and 1998 detentions.      The AO concluded that\n\nNyambi was not credible and referred the matter to an Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\").\n\n            On September 27, 2002, Nyambi appeared at the removal\n\nhearing before the IJ.     The relevant details of his testimony are\n\nset out below.\n\n            Nyambi testified that he was a Cameroonian citizen, and\n\nthat he fled Cameroon because of political oppression.       He further\n\ntestified that he was a member of two Cameroonian opposition\n\ngroups, the Social Democratic Front (\"SDF\") and the Southern\n\nCameroon National Council (\"SCNC\").\n\n            According to Nyambi, the SDF, formed on May 26, 1990, is\n\na political group fighting against the \"ones [sic] party system in\n\nCameroon.\"    Nyambi alleged that he joined the SDF at its inception\n\nand   participated   in   meetings,   symposiums,   and   rallies.   He\n\ntestified that he became a member of the SCNC in 1997 during his\n\nlast year in high school.      The SCNC was a political group that\n\naimed at securing the independence for the Anglophone part of\n\nCameroon.    Nyambi also stated that he was a prominent member of the\n\ngroup and that he tried to \"sensitize the people to make them\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\funderstand how important it was to be a part of that group.\"\n\nNyambi also distributed flyers and took part in \"a lot of rallies.\"\n\n           Nyambi     alleged    that    he    was        detained,   beaten,    and\n\nmaltreated by the police on three occasions.                 The first detention,\n\nlasting nearly two months, occurred in 1990 at the Brigade Mobile\n\nMixte headquarters in the city of Bamenda.                      There, Nyambi was\n\nbeaten and tortured.        Nyambi's father negotiated his son's release\n\nfor a sum of 50,000 francs.               The second detention allegedly\n\noccurred   in     October   1992,    after    the    Cameroonian      presidential\n\nelection. Nyambi declared that he was arrested by the government's\n\nsecurity forces and detained in a prison in Yaounde.                           Nyambi\n\ntestified that he was forced to crawl together with the other\n\ninmates on a wet floor, while the guards beat them with clubs.                   One\n\nmonth after the 1992 arrest, Nyambi allegedly escaped from the\n\ncorrectional facility when the detainees were taken to town to\n\nperform    some    work.       The   third     detention        occurred   between\n\nNovember 24, 1998 and October 4, 1999.                   Nyambi testified that he\n\nwas arrested at a peaceful SCNC demonstration and detained in the\n\nKondengui prison in Yaounde.              Nyambi's father negotiated his\n\nrelease and provided him with a passport and visa to the United\n\nStates.\n\n           After     further    questioning         by    the   IJ,   Nyambi    first\n\ntestified that he was raped during the 1990 and 1992 detentions,\n\nthen he testified that he was raped during the 1992 and 1998\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fdetentions.       Finally, Nyambi declared that he knew he was raped\n\ntwice but that he was \"kind of mixed up\" about the dates.\n\n            Nyambi       also    introduced        his    father's     affidavit      into\n\nevidence.         This     affidavit         generally         corroborated        Nyambi's\n\nallegations, averring that Nyambi was \"gruesomely sodomized\" during\n\nthe 1990 detention.             The affidavit also stated that Nyambi was\n\nreleased from the 1992 detention due to his critical health.\n\nNyambi stated that his father's affidavit is incorrect because it\n\ncontradicted Nyambi's own previous testimony that he escaped from\n\nthe 1992 detention. Nyambi also introduced into evidence his SDF\n\nmembership card and driver's license.                      Nyambi alleged that his\n\nfather paid the SDF renewal dues on his behalf and thus obtained\n\nthe   SDF   card.         Nyambi       presented     an    undated     medical       legal\n\ncertificate to document his 1990 rape.\n\n            The     IJ     denied       Nyambi's         application        for     asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief, but granted him voluntary\n\ndeparture.        In     her    oral    decision,        the    IJ   made    an     adverse\n\ncredibility   finding          based    on    Nyambi's      inconsistent          testimony\n\nregarding the dates of the sexual abuses.                       Before the AO, Nyambi\n\ndeclared that he was raped in 1992 and 1998.                    Before the IJ, Nyambi\n\ntestified initially that he was raped in 1990 and 1992 but then\n\ntestified that he was \"mixed up\" about the dates.\n\n            The IJ also concluded that Nyambi's submitted documentary\n\nevidence did not \"rehabilitate the respondent from his unpersuasive\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fand not incredible [sic] testimony.\"             The IJ pointed to several\n\npieces of evidence to support its reasoning. First, Nyambi himself\n\nattacked the accuracy of his father's affidavit with respect to the\n\nsecond detention.         Second, the medical legal certificate was\n\nundated.   Third, the SDF card was issued on January 15, 1999, while\n\nNyambi was in prison.       Fourth, Nyambi's driver's license was dated\n\nJanuary 12, 2000, when Nyambi was allegedly in the United States.\n\n              Nyambi    appealed   the   IJ's    decision   to    BIA.     On\n\nSeptember 12, 2005, the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ noting\n\nthat   \"the    [IJ's]    adverse   credibility    finding   was   based   upon\n\nconspicuous,        inadequately-explained        discrepancies     in    the\n\nrespondent's testimony and between his testimony and the affidavits\n\nhe submitted in support of his claim.\"            Nyambi now petitions for\n\nreview of this decision.3\n\n                               II.

Asylum\n\n           An alien has the burden of establishing that he is\n\neligible for asylum.      8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).              To establish\n\neligibility for asylum, an alien must show either past persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of persecution motivated by \"race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also Albathani, 318 F.3d\n\nat 373.   Any asylum seeker who has established past persecution is\n\nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution.     8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).\n\n           The    applicant's         testimony,       if   uncorroborated    by\n\nconvincing evidence, must be credible, persuasive, and refer to\n\nspecific facts.     8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii).              The credibility\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdetermination may be based on the internal consistency of each of\n\nthe applicant's statements and \"the consistency of such statements\n\nwith other evidence of record.\"        Id. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).      \"[I]n\n\nthe case of an adverse credibility determination, the IJ must offer\n\na specific, cogent reason for [her] disbelief.\" Mihaylov, 379 F.3d\n\nat 21.   \"[The] adverse credibility determination cannot rest on\n\ntrivia but must be based on discrepancies that 'involved the heart\n\nof the asylum claim.'\"    Bojorques-Villanueva v.

As the IJ correctly noted, Nyambi\n\nstated in his asylum application that the first detention in 1990\n\n\"will remain the most traumatic.\"        Nyambi also stated that he was\n\nsexually abused during the first detention. However, Nyambi failed\n\nto mention this before the AO, despite the fact that the 1990\n\ndetention was allegedly the \"most traumatic\" incident.          Before the\n\nIJ, Nyambi first testified that he was raped during the 1990 and\n\n1992 detentions, then testified that he was raped during the 1992\n\nand 1998 detentions.     Eventually he testified that he could not\n\nremember during which of the detentions he was raped.          The medical\n\nlegal certificate introduced by Nyambi to corroborate his testimony\n\nregarding the 1990 rape does not resolve the discrepancy because it\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fis undated.

First, the IJ did not assign any weight to\n\nNyambi's father's affidavit, basing her ruling on Nyambi's own\n\ntestimony that the affidavit was incorrect with respect to the 1992\n\nescape.      Second, the IJ noted that Nyambi could not explain the\n\nissuance date of his SDF card.4            Third, Nyambi's driving license\n\nraised concerns about its accuracy, since it was dated January 12,\n\n2000, when Nyambi was allegedly in the United States.
