Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                        Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                     Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Lorraine Femino on brief pro se.\n     William E. O'Gara and Pannone Lopes & Devereaux LLC on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                               April 14, 2008\n\f          Per Curiam.    In these consolidated appeals, pro se\n\nplaintiff-appellant Lorraine Femino seeks review of the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to her former employer, NFA\n\nCorporation (\"NFA\"), in two actions alleging violations of the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA).1   Appellant's claims arise from the\n\ntermination of her long-term disability benefits under an employer-\n\nsponsored plan (\"LTD Plan\") based on a provision limiting benefits\n\nfor disabilities based on \"self-reported symptoms\" to twenty-four\n\nmonths.   Essentially for the reasons set forth in the magistrate\n\njudge's two Reports and Recommendations dated June 6, 2007, we\n\nconclude that the ERISA claims brought in each of the underlying\n\ncases were subject to claim preclusion based on the final judgment\n\nentered on September 5, 2006, in Femino v. NFA Corporation, Civil\n\nAction No. 05-519ML (\"Femino I\"), an earlier ERISA action filed in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.\n\nSee Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).    To the extent appellant challenges related discovery\n\nrulings made in Civil Action No. 06-143ML (\"Femino II\"), we see no\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n          As to the ADA claims, the district court concluded that\n\nappellant was ineligible for protection under the ADA because she\n\n\n     1\n      Appellant also has requested leave to file a supplemental\nappendix containing documents filed in a related district court\naction. The unopposed motion is granted.\n\n                                -2-\n\fwas totally disabled at all relevant times and therefore, by\n\ndefinition, was not a \"qualified individual with a disability.\"\n\nSee 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(a), 12111(8).                Appellant challenges this\n\ninterpretation    of    the    statute,    and    argues    that   the   relevant\n\nlanguage is ambiguous and should be construed to include even\n\ntotally disabled former employees.                We have not yet squarely\n\naddressed this issue, but we find it unnecessary to do so in this\n\ncase   because   we    conclude,    as    the    district    court    did,    that\n\nappellant's claims lack merit in any event.\n\n           On the merits, appellant's primary contention is that the\n\ndistrict court misconstrued her claims and failed to consider her\n\nclaim of \"disparate-impact\" discrimination.             Appellant states that\n\nshe does not allege, as the district court suggested, that the\n\nself-reported symptoms limitation was discriminatory as written\n\nbecause it treated disabilities based on self-reported symptoms\n\ndifferently   from     other   types     of   disabilities.        Instead,   she\n\nmaintains that her claim was based              on the theory that the self-\n\nreported symptoms limitation, although not discriminatory on its\n\nface, was administered in a manner that disproportionately affected\n\nindividuals who, like appellant, were disabled due to fibromyalgia.\n\n           To make out a prima facie case of disparate impact\n\ndiscrimination,   a    plaintiff    must      (1)    identify   the   challenged\n\nemployment practice or policy, and pinpoint the defendant's use of\n\nit\" (2) \"demonstrate a disparate impact on a group characteristic\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f. . . that falls within the protective ambit of [the ADA]\"; and (3)\n\n\"demonstrate a causal relationship between the identified practice\n\nand the disparate impact.\"      E.E.O.C. v. Steamship Clerks Union,\n\nLocal 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 601 (1st Cir. 1995) (citations omitted);\n\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(3).        Even assuming that appellant's\n\nallegations are adequate to state a claim of disparate-impact\n\ndiscrimination, the only evidence she offered to demonstrate that\n\nthe self-reported symptoms limitation had a disproportionately\n\nnegative effect on individuals suffering from fibromyalgia was that\n\nthe medical evidence in her own case was deemed insufficient to\n\nestablish that her disability was not based on self-reported\n\nsymptoms.     This is not enough to demonstrate a disparate impact on\n\nthe particular group appellant identifies. In essence, appellant's\n\ndisparate-impact theory seems to be nothing more than a dressed-up\n\nclaim that her benefits were arbitrarily terminated; absent any\n\nevidence of discrimination, ERISA provides the appropriate avenue\n\nfor review.    However, as noted above, that avenue is no longer open\n\nto appellant in light of the judgment entered in Femino I.\n\n            The judgments of the district court are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
