D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Peter J. Cyr and Law Offices of Anthony J. Sineni, III, LLC\non brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              January 12, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam.       Appellant, Jose Duran, was convicted of\n\nconspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute\n\n100 grams or more of heroin in violation of                      21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1)   &   846.     He    now   appeals    both     his    conviction   and\n\nsentence.\n\n            In addition, on November 21, 2005, appellant filed a\n\nmotion to relieve his attorney requesting that we provide him a\n\ncopy of a 28(j) letter filed by the government and grant him\n\nleave to refile his pro se supplemental brief.                     Refiling is\n\nunnecessary, however, because we are in receipt of his September\n\n23, 2005 pro se supplemental brief and have considered the claims\n\nraised therein, as well as the claims raised in the supplemental\n\nbrief, reply brief and merits brief filed through his counsel on\n\nhis behalf.     Moreover, we have provided appellant a copy of the\n\n28(j) letter.     Accordingly, the motion is denied.\n\n            Further, he filed on December 5, 2005 and December 16,\n\n2005 motions claiming that the District Court in Maine lacked\n\njurisdiction because      appellant was indicted for a crime that\n\nallegedly took place solely in Massachusetts.                  The facts of the\n\npresentence     report   detailing     the     instant    offense--to     which\n\nappellant did not object below--belie appellant's argument. They\n\nindicate that appellant engaged in a conspiracy to provide drugs\n\nthat were to be sold in Maine.         Accordingly, we deny the motion\n\nand turn to his appeal.       See 18 U.S.C. § 3237 (\"Offenses begun in\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fone district and completed in another, or committed in more than\n\none district, may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district\n\nin which such offense was begun, continued, or completed.\").\n\n          I.   Appeal of the Conviction\n\n          We first address his appeal of his conviction, which\n\nlargely consists of waived claims.     Appellant argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in relying upon police reports to conclude\n\nthat he was previously convicted of his prior convictions.\n\nAppellant, however, waived the claim when appellant's counsel\n\nwithdrew his objection concerning the evidence presented by the\n\ngovernment in support of the prior convictions and when appellant\n\nadmitted that the facts in the presentence report are undisputed.\n\n          Likewise,   appellant   waived    his   argument   that the\n\ndistrict court erred in allowing him to plead guilty to an\n\nindictment that was not supported by sufficient evidence and\n\nwhich was based on perjured statements.        See United States v.\n\nLujan, 324 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2003) (a guilty plea waives all\n\nnonjurisdictional challenges to a criminal conviction); United\n\nStates v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 629-631 (U.S. 2002)(concluding\n\nclaim that indictment was defective because it failed to include\n\ndrug quantity was not jurisdictional).\n\n          Though related, appellant's claim that his plea was\n\ninvoluntary is not waived, however.        In particular, appellant\n\nasserts his plea was involuntary because the court failed to\n\n\n                              -3-\n\festablish the factual basis for his plea.       See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(3) (stating, \"[b]efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,\n\nthe court must determine that there is a factual basis for the\n\nplea.\").    We review Rule 11 challenges raised for the first time\n\non appeal only for plain error.       See United States v. Cheal, 389\n\nF.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2004).          After reviewing the record, we\n\nconclude there was no plain error here because appellant's plea\n\nhad a rational basis in facts that he conceded.              See United\n\nStates v. Serrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Appellant also waived his claims that his guilty plea\n\ncannot be accepted because venue was not proper.             See United\n\nStates v. Lujan, 324 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2003) (a guilty plea\n\nwaives     all    nonjurisdictional    challenges   to   a     criminal\n\nconviction); United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (stating, \"[w]e have further recognized that venue is a\n\nwaivable personal privilege designed for the benefit of the\n\ndefendant.       As such, the constitutional and statutory venue\n\nprovisions are not restrictions on the court's jurisdiction.\")\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n            In addition, he claims that his counsel ineffectively\n\nassisted him.     \"The rule in this circuit is that a fact-specific\n\nclaim of ineffective legal assistance cannot be raised initially\n\non direct review of a criminal conviction, but must originally be\n\npresented to the district court.\"        United States v. Grace, 367\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fF.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWe will deviate from this rule \"where the critical facts are not\n\ngenuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to\n\nallow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim.\"\n\nUnited States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\nAppellant's fact-intensive claim does not fit into the exception\n\nto the rule.\n\n           II.      Appeal of the Sentence\n\n           We now turn to appellant's challenges to his sentence.\n\nHe first argues that the district court erred in failing to\n\nexercise its discretion to grant a downward departure.                  He\n\nconcedes, however, that he did not request a departure below. We\n\nlack jurisdiction to review a sentencing court's refusal to\n\ndepart   downward    based   on   its    belief   that   the   defendant's\n\ncircumstances fail to warrant such a departure.                See United\n\nStates v. Melendez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50-51 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nsee also United States v. Monteiro, 417 F.3d 208 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(declining to review a sentencing judge's refusal to grant a\n\ndownward   departure     where    the     judge   did    not   evince   an\n\nunderstanding that he was constrained from doing so).            Here, the\n\njudge gave no indication that the guidelines constrained him from\n\ngranting a departure, so we cannot consider the claim.            See id.\n\n           Appellant further argues that the district court erred\n\nin sentencing him as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f4B1.1.   Guidelines section 4B1.1 sets forth three criteria for\n\n\"career offender\" status: (1) the defendant was at least 18 years\n\nold at the time he committed the instant offense; (2) the instant\n\noffense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a\n\ncontrolled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least\n\ntwo prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a\n\ncontrolled substance offense. Here, the PSR shows that he was 29\n\nyears old when he committed the instant offense and that he had\n\na prior conviction for trafficking possession of marijuana, a\n\nprior conviction for trafficking and possession of cocaine and\n\nheroin, and a conviction for assault and battery and possession\n\nof cocaine.      In addition, there is no doubt that the instant\n\noffense is a felony that is a controlled substance offense.\n\nAccordingly, the three criteria are met, and the district court\n\ndid not err in sentencing appellant as a career offender.\n\n            Lastly, appellant raises a claim pursuant to United\n\nStates v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005), and with greater success.\n\nThough   the    government   disputes     whether   the    district     court\n\nconcluded that the guidelines were mandatory, it is clear to us\n\nfrom the record that the court acted as if it was bound by\n\nmandatory   guidelines     when   it   sentenced    appellant.     Because\n\nappellant      preserved   the    claim   by   timely     challenging    the\n\nconstitutionality of the guidelines, the government has the\n\nburden of proving the harmlessness of the district court's error.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fSee United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d 476, 488-490 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n          The government argues that the error was harmless\n\nbecause appellant's counsel conceded that the statutory minimum\n\nof ten years likely \"would not be enough\" in light of appellant's\n\nrecord. We disagree. Over ten years separates appellant's actual\n\nsentence and the statutory minimum, so there is plenty of room\n\nfor a lesser sentence that accommodates appellant's counsel's\n\nconcession.   The government also argues that, in stating the\n\nsentence was \"something that you have brought upon yourself by\n\nyour past criminal conduct,\" the sentencing judge indicated that\n\nhe did not feel constrained by the guidelines.\n\n          This argument would have more weight were it not for\n\nthe fact that the sentencing judge made several statements that\n\nindicated he felt constrained, \"[i]t doesn't give me any pleasure\n\nto impose a sentence of 262 months on a 30-year-old-man\" and, \"I\n\ndon't say that to berate you, simply [it] is the fact that this\n\nis the law that Congress has imposed because of the scourge of\n\ndrugs like heroin and other drugs . . . it is a huge sentence .\n\n. . it's a great tragedy for you and your family.\"   The fact that\n\nthe judge sentenced appellant to the bottom of the guidelines\n\nrange would not alone warrant a remand but, in conjunction with\n\nthe judge's statements, adds to our concerns.    See United States\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\fv. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 102 (1st Cir. 2005) (doubt enhanced by\n\nsentence at bottom of range).\n\n          Lastly, the government claims that the sentence is\n\nreasonable in light of appellant's extensive criminal record.\n\nEven if we were to consider at this stage the reasonableness of\n\nthe sentence, the government's argument goes little distance\n\ntowards establishing that the district court's error was harmless\n\nbecause it is possible that a lesser sentence would meet the\n\nstatutory requirements.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553.   Accordingly, we\n\nbelieve the Booker error here was not harmless.\n\n          To conclude, we deny appellant's motion to relieve his\n\nattorney and motion for review of jurisdiction, affirm the\n\nconviction, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.   The remand is not a suggestion or\n\na prediction that the sentence will necessarily be altered.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Melendez-Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201783\"><a href=\"/opinion/201783/united-states-v-melendez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50-51 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nsee also United States v.

Here, the\n\njudge gave no indication that the guidelines constrained him from\n\ngranting a departure, so we cannot consider the claim.            See id.\n\n           Appellant further argues that the district court erred\n\nin sentencing him as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f4B1.1.   Guidelines section 4B1.1 sets forth three criteria for\n\n\"career offender\" status: (1) the defendant was at least 18 years\n\nold at the time he committed the instant offense; (2) the instant\n\noffense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a\n\ncontrolled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least\n\ntwo prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a\n\ncontrolled substance offense. Here, the PSR shows that he was 29\n\nyears old when he committed the instant offense and that he had\n\na prior conviction for trafficking possession of marijuana, a\n\nprior conviction for trafficking and possession of cocaine and\n\nheroin, and a conviction for assault and battery and possession\n\nof cocaine.      In addition, there is no doubt that the instant\n\noffense is a felony that is a controlled substance offense.\n\nAccordingly, the three criteria are met, and the district court\n\ndid not err in sentencing appellant as a career offender.\n\n            Lastly, appellant raises a claim pursuant to United\n\nStates v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), and with greater success.\n\nThough   the    government   disputes     whether   the    district     court\n\nconcluded that the guidelines were mandatory, it is clear to us\n\nfrom the record that the court acted as if it was bound by\n\nmandatory   guidelines     when   it   sentenced    appellant.     Because\n\nappellant      preserved   the    claim   by   timely     challenging    the\n\nconstitutionality of the guidelines, the government has the\n\nburden of proving the harmlessness of the district court's error.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fSee United States v. Vazquez-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201585\"><a href=\"/opinion/201585/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488-490 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n          The government argues that the error was harmless\n\nbecause appellant's counsel conceded that the statutory minimum\n\nof ten years likely \"would not be enough\" in light of appellant's\n\nrecord. We disagree. Over ten years separates appellant's actual\n\nsentence and the statutory minimum, so there is plenty of room\n\nfor a lesser sentence that accommodates appellant's counsel's\n\nconcession.   The government also argues that, in stating the\n\nsentence was \"something that you have brought upon yourself by\n\nyour past criminal conduct,\" the sentencing judge indicated that\n\nhe did not feel constrained by the guidelines.\n\n          This argument would have more weight were it not for\n\nthe fact that the sentencing judge made several statements that\n\nindicated he felt constrained, \"[i]t doesn't give me any pleasure\n\nto impose a sentence of 262 months on a 30-year-old-man\" and, \"I\n\ndon't say that to berate you, simply [it] is the fact that this\n\nis the law that Congress has imposed because of the scourge of\n\ndrugs like heroin and other drugs . . . it is a huge sentence .\n\n. . it's a great tragedy for you and your family.\"   The fact that\n\nthe judge sentenced appellant to the bottom of the guidelines\n\nrange would not alone warrant a remand but, in conjunction with\n\nthe judge's statements, adds to our concerns.    See United States\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\fv. Casas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (1st Cir. 2005) (doubt enhanced by\n\nsentence at bottom of range).\n\n          Lastly, the government claims that the sentence is\n\nreasonable in light of appellant's extensive criminal record.\n\nEven if we were to consider at this stage the reasonableness of\n\nthe sentence, the government's argument goes little distance\n\ntowards establishing that the district court's error was harmless\n\nbecause it is possible that a lesser sentence would meet the\n\nstatutory requirements.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553.   Accordingly, we\n\nbelieve the Booker error here was not harmless.\n\n          To conclude, we deny appellant's motion to relieve his\n\nattorney and motion for review of jurisdiction, affirm the\n\nconviction, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.   The remand is not a suggestion or\n\na prediction that the sentence will necessarily be altered.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f</pre>",
