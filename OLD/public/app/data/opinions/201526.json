Nineteen individuals, including\n\nappellants Felix Mercado Irizarry, Hernan Vazquez-Mendez, Eliezer\n\nMorera-Vigo, Manuel Vazquez-Mendez, and German Rodríguez Rodríguez,\n\nwere indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of\n\none kilogram of heroin, five kilograms of cocaine, and fifty grams\n\nof cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.      Defendants were\n\ncharged with distributing drugs through several drug points in the\n\nTibes Public Housing Project in Ponce, Puerto Rico, from 1992 until\n\nthe return of the indictment in 2000.\n\n           All defendants save these five appellants pled guilty to\n\nthe charge. After a seventeen-day jury trial, the five appellants\n\nwere found guilty.   The court sentenced each to life imprisonment.\n\nEach appeals from both the verdict of guilt and the life sentence,\n\nsave Hernan Vazquez-Mendez, who appeals only his sentence.\n\n                                  I.\n\nChallenges to Conviction\n\nMercado Irizarry\n\n          Mercado first argues that he was deprived of a fair trial\n\nbased on the cumulative effect of various alleged evidentiary\n\nerrors: admission of three statements about Mercado's involvement\n\nin murders and of other evidence of two murders committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.    He also argues for the first time\n\nhere that the government committed a Brady violation.        Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          The first two challenged statements were made by Edwin\n\nMelendez-Negron, a co-conspirator who pled guilty to the conspiracy\n\nand became a cooperating witness for the government.           Melendez-\n\nNegron testified that Mercado told him that Mercado was the driver\n\nof the car during the murder of a man named Hueso.              On cross\n\nexamination,   when   Melendez-Negron    was    confronted     with     his\n\npreviously made contradictory statements, Melendez-Negron admitted\n\nthat Mercado never told him anything about Heuso's murder.        But he\n\ntestified that Mercado was present when a man named Melito and\n\nMelendez-Negron discussed Hueso's murder.        Mercado argues that,\n\nbecause Melendez-Negron retracted his earlier statement, the judge\n\nshould have stricken Melendez-Negron's first statement from the\n\nrecord and instructed the jury not to consider it.\n\n          Melendez-Negron   then    testified   that   the   murderer    of\n\nHueso, a man named Melito, told Melendez-Negron that Mercado helped\n\nhim kill Hueso.   This statement was admitted under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E) as a statement made by a co-conspirator in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy.    Mercado argues that the statement was wrongly\n\nadmitted under the co-conspirator exception because the evidence\n\nwas that the murder was a result of a personal vendetta, and not in\n\nfurtherance of the drug conspiracy.\n\n          The final statement was by a police agent, Edwin Rosado\n\nVega, who testified about prior consistent statements made by\n\nMelendez-Negron regarding Hueso's murder.       This was permitted by\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe   district    court    on   the    basis   that   it    was    duplicative   of\n\nMelendez-Negron's sworn statement already in evidence.                 That sworn\n\nstatement was introduced into evidence by the defense when cross\n\nexamining Melendez-Negron, in an attempt to impeach his earlier\n\ntestimony.     Although the defense introduced the sworn statement of\n\nMelendez-Negron, Mercado now argues that Melendez-Negron's sworn\n\nstatement was made after his motive to fabricate a story regarding\n\nHueso's murder arose, because the statement was made after he\n\nagreed   to    cooperate    with      the   government     and    testify   against\n\nMercado.      As a result, he argues, it was error to admit Rosado's\n\nstatement.\n\n              Mercado further argues that the district court erred in\n\nallowing any evidence of the murder of Hueso, and evidence of\n\nanother murder allegedly committed by Mercado of a man named Wally,\n\nbecause of a lack of evidence that these murders were committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.              He argues that the only evidence\n\nthat the murder of Wally was related to the conspiracy is the\n\ntestimony of Julio Valentin Medina, who testified that he heard\n\nthat Mercado killed Wally because of a \"debt\" and because he was a\n\n\"stool pigeon.\"     Mercado argues that this evidence is insufficient\n\nto show that Wally's murder was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n              Finally, Mercado argues that the government committed a\n\nBrady violation by presenting testimony of the murders of Edwin and\n\nMichel Vázquez as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy,\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdespite the fact that the government had in its possession a sworn\n\nstatement from a different cooperating witness that these murders\n\nwere unrelated to the conspiracy, which it did not disclose to the\n\ndefense.       Mercado does not argue that the Brady violation itself\n\nwarrants a new trial, but rather he argues that the disclosure of\n\nthe statement would have allowed the court to perform a more\n\ninformed balancing test under Fed. R. Evid. 403, and that balancing\n\nmay   have     led    to    this   evidence      being   disallowed   as   unfairly\n\nprejudicial.         Further, he argues that the failure to disclose the\n\nstatement      impeded      his    cross   examination     of   the   government's\n\ntestifying witness.           The government denies there was any Brady\n\nviolation.\n\n               We review the district court's evidentiary rulings as to\n\npreserved claims for abuse of discretion. United States v. Balsam,\n\n203 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting the statements of Melendez-Negron or Officer Rosado.\n\nFirst,    as    to    the    testimony     of    Melendez-Negron,     Mercado   has\n\nimpermissibly switched the basis for his argument twixt trial and\n\nappeal.      His trial counsel did not move to have Melendez-Negron's\n\nearlier statement stricken on the ground, argued now, that the\n\nwitness had disavowed his earlier testimony.                Rather, he asked the\n\njudge to strike any testimony relating to the murder of Hueso on\n\nthe ground that there was inadequate evidence that the murder was\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fin furtherance of the conspiracy.         The \"in furtherance\" evidence\n\nwas sufficient, for reasons described later. Considering his newly\n\nadvanced argument on appeal, there was no plain error, and no error\n\nat all.      It was up to the jury to evaluate the statements,\n\nincluding the contradictions.\n\n          As to the second statement, that Melito told Melendez-\n\nNegron that Mercado helped him kill Hueso, there was adequate\n\nevidence that the murder of Hueso was in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy. This statement was admissible under the co-conspirator\n\nexception.   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).      Mercado attempts to argue\n\nthat Melito wanted to kill Hueso because Hueso stole drugs from him\n\nat a time before Melito joined the Tibes conspiracy, and therefore\n\nthe murder could not have been found to be in furtherance of the\n\nTibes conspiracy.      This is not so.        When Melito and Mercado\n\nmurdered Hueso, they both worked for Melendez-Negron at Tibes,\n\nMelendez-Negron supplied them with the weapons to kill Hueso, and\n\nhe instructed them to do so away from the Tibes Public Housing\n\nProject so as not to draw attention to the drug points.             The\n\ngovernment introduced evidence that the Tibes conspiracy had a\n\npattern of killing those who had wronged members of the conspiracy\n\nin order to protect the conspiracy; there is adequate evidence that\n\nthe murder of Hueso was a part of this pattern.\n\n          As    to   Officer   Rosado's    testimony   concerning   what\n\nMelendez-Negron had told him about Hueso's murder, the district\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fcourt correctly ruled that this was admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)\n\nbecause Melendez-Negron's consistent sworn statement about the\n\nmurder had already been introduced into evidence by the defense in\n\nan attempt to impeach his direct testimony.\n\n          It is also clear that evidence of the murders of Hueso\n\nand Wally were not erroneously admitted.        There was adequate\n\nevidence that each of these murders was committed in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy.    As to the evidence about Wally's murder, the\n\ngovernment introduced testimony that Mercado murdered Wally because\n\nhe owed a debt and because he was a \"stool pigeon.\"\n\n          As to the unpreserved argument of an alleged Brady\n\nviolation, we note that the statement in question was referred to\n\nin multiple reported cases before the start of Mercado's trial, and\n\ncould easily have been discovered by Mercado's counsel, thus it is\n\ndoubtful there is any Brady claim.       In any event, given the\n\ncorroborating testimony that the murders in question were committed\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy, and the amount of evidence\n\nimplicating Mercado in the conspiracy, he cannot carry his burden\n\nof showing that the alleged violation affected the result of the\n\nproceeding.   See United States v. Conley, 249 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fMorera-Vigo\n\n          Morera-Vigo makes the same arguments that Mercado does\n\nabout admission of evidence of the murders of Hueso and Wally.                We\n\nreject them for the same reasons.\n\n          In addition, Morera-Vigo argues that the court erred in\n\nallowing evidence of murders and drug dealing committed at other\n\ndrug points in Ponce.          He argues that there was a different\n\nconspiracy run by Angela Ayala, whose only connections to the Tibes\n\nconspiracy were that one of her drug points was in the Tibes Public\n\nHousing Project and that she acted as a supplier to other drug\n\npoints there.       He argues that evidence of Angela Ayala's drug\n\nactivities at drug points other than her drug point at Tibes, and\n\nevidence of murders committed to protect those drug points, was\n\nimproperly    and    prejudicially      admitted     into     evidence.       The\n\ngovernment introduced this evidence on the theory that dealers at\n\nseveral drug points in and around the Tibes Public Housing Project\n\nassisted each other in their drug distribution efforts and in the\n\nprotection    of    their   drug    points,   and   that    its   admission   was\n\nnecessary to understand the full scope of the conspiracy.\n\n          We bypass the question of admissibility; any error was\n\nharmless. Independently, there was more than adequate evidence for\n\nthe jury to convict Morera-Vigo, including testimony and in-court\n\nidentifications       by    three     different      cooperating      witnesses\n\nimplicating Morera-Vigo as a co-conspirator selling drugs and\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fcommitting violent acts to protect the conspiracy.      There was also\n\nforensic evidence linking Morera-Vigo to murders committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n          In pro-se supplemental and reply briefing, defendant\n\nMorera-Vigo for the first time attempts to challenge his conviction\n\nbased on the fact that \"drug type and quantity was not submitted to\n\nthe jury,\" and \"the jury was not instructed to determine guilt on\n\nthe elements of drug type and quantity.\"       This argument is both\n\nfactually and legally incorrect.      The judge did instruct the jury\n\nthat, through the special verdict form, they would be asked to\n\ndetermine both drug type and a minimum drug quantity for each\n\ndefendant found guilty of the conspiracy.     Citing United States v.\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d, 20 (1st Cir. 2003), Morera-Vigo argues that\n\nthis was insufficient because the jury did not find an amount of\n\ndrugs attributable to him specifically, rather than the conspiracy\n\nas a whole. This argument misunderstands our case law. Perez-Ruiz\n\ngoes to the maximum sentence available based on the jury verdict of\n\nguilt in a conspiracy.   Id. at 15.     Perez-Ruiz says nothing about\n\nthe vacation of a conviction for conspiracy based on lack of an\n\nindividualized   quantity   determination.      The    district   court\n\ninstructed the jury on all the elements of the crime, namely,\n\nconspiracy to distribute drugs in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and\n\nthe jury found all the elements of the crime.         This argument is\n\nmeritless.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fRodríguez Rodríguez\n\n              Rodríguez     argues     that    the    district    court      erred   in\n\nallowing the government to present testimony by five witnesses\n\n(Melendez-Negron, Enrique Malave Diaz, Gamalier Douglas, Julio\n\nValentin Medina, and Joel Irizarry-Rosario), who had entered into\n\ncooperation agreements with the government which ensured them\n\nleniency in exchange for their testimony.                    He argues that such\n\nagreements gave each a motivation to present false testimony, and\n\nthat   such    testimony     was     unfairly    prejudicial.           Testimony    of\n\ncooperating witnesses is common and appropriate.                      There are also\n\nadequate procedural safeguards.               See United States v. Dailey, 759\n\nF.2d 192, 200 (1st Cir. 1985) (cooperating witness testimony\n\npermissible,        but   agreements    should       be   read   to    jury,   defense\n\npermitted      to    cross-examine      about    agreements,          and   cautionary\n\ninstruction should be given to jury about nature of agreement and\n\nrisk created thereby).          There is no claim that such procedural\n\nsafeguards were ignored in this case; rather, Rodríguez claims that\n\nsuch testimony is inherently unreliable and should have been\n\nexcluded.      This claim is meritless.\n\nManuel Vazquez-Mendez\n\n              Manuel Vazquez-Mendez argues that the district court\n\nerred in denying his Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 29 motion for acquittal.\n\nHe argues that there was testimony about at least six individuals\n\nnamed \"Manuel,\" and the jury was left to speculate as to whether he\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwas     any   of     them.     Further,   he   argues   that   the   evidence\n\naffirmatively implicating him showed only his involvement with a\n\ndifferent drug point involved in a different conspiracy, and\n\ntherefore the government did not carry its burden of showing his\n\ninvolvement in the Tibes drug conspiracy that was charged in the\n\nindictment.\n\n              We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for acquittal de\n\nnovo.    United States v. Moran, 312 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nIn doing so we must decide, viewing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict of guilt, whether a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould find the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Id. There was ample evidence to find Manuel Vazquez-Mendez\n\nguilty of the charged conspiracy.              A cooperating witness, Joel\n\nIrizarry-Rosario, made a valid in-court identification of Manuel\n\nVazquez-Mendez, testified that he was involved with selling drugs\n\nat the Tibes Housing Project, and gave detailed testimony that\n\nManuel Vazquez-Mendez was part of a group that hunted down and\n\nkilled a rival drug dealer named Papito who was at war with the\n\nTibes conspiracy.            Further, the government submitted forensic\n\nevidence      that    corroborated   Irizarry-Rosario's    testimony    about\n\nManuel Vazquez-Mendez's involvement in this murder.             Viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict of guilt, there\n\nwas adequate evidence to find Manuel Vazquez-Mendez guilty of the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fSentencing\n\n          In the aftermath of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct.\n\n738 (2005), and United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), and acknowledging that each defendant preserved\n\nhis claims of sentencing error, the government agreed to a remand\n\nfor resentencing of all.1       Although pre-Booker, the sentencing\n\ncourt was required by the Guidelines, because it found the murder\n\ncross-reference in USSG §2D1.1(d)(1) to be applicable, to impose a\n\nlife sentence, the statute permitted but did not require imposition\n\nof a life sentence.    The Guidelines are now advisory and the judge\n\nis no longer mandated to impose a life sentence, so given the\n\ngovernment's concession, remand is appropriate.          Of course, we\n\nintimate no view on what sentences should be imposed on remand.\n\n             We make one comment as to a sentencing claim made by\n\ndefendants    Hernan   Vazquez-Mendez,   Eliezer   Morera-Vigo,   Manuel\n\nVazquez-Mendez, and German Rodríguez Rodríguez.        In supplemental\n\nbriefing, each of these defendants claims that the maximum penalty\n\nhe may receive based on the jury verdict alone is twenty years, the\n\ndefault statutory maximum derived from the catch-all provision in\n\n\n\n     1\n      The government also concedes that the supervised release term\nfor Mercado of ten years was in error; the Guidelines provided for\na five-year term and the ten-year term is available only as an\nupward departure. Further, it concedes that the district court\nerred in delegating to the probation office the number of drug\ntests Morera-Vigo must undergo during his supervised release term,\npursuant to this court's holding in United States v. Melendez-\nSantana, 353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                 -13-\n\f21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).       This is so, they argue, because the jury\n\ndid not make individualized quantity determinations as to the type\n\nand quantity of drugs that were attributable to each defendant\n\nspecifically, but rather only determined drug type and quantity\n\nattributable to the conspiracy as a whole.\n\n          This argument is mistaken. The indictment specified drug\n\ntype and quantity for each defendant.              In addition, the district\n\ncourt instructed the jury that it would be asked to find beyond a\n\nreasonable    doubt    the   drug   type    and    quantity    stated   in   the\n\nindictment    for     each   defendant     found    guilty    of   joining   the\n\nconspiracy. Further, the jury was given a special verdict form for\n\neach defendant, which stated:\n\n             Do you unanimously agree by proof beyond a\n             reasonable doubt that the quantity of cocaine\n             which was distributed and/or intended to be\n             distributed as part of the conspiracy was five\n             kilograms or more?\n             Do you unanimously agree by proof beyond a\n             reasonable doubt that the quantity of heroin\n             which was distributed and/or intended to be\n             distributed as part of the conspiracy was one\n             kilogram or more?\n\nThe jury answered yes to both questions of the special verdict form\n\nfor all five defendants.       As the case law of this circuit has made\n\nabundantly clear, the maximum statutory penalty available to the\n\ndistrict court at sentencing for a defendant convicted of a drug\n\nconspiracy is based on the drug quantity and amount reflected in\n\nthe jury verdict attributable to the conspiracy as a whole. United\n\nStates v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).               Here, since\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe jury found all defendants guilty of a conspiracy to distribute\n\ngreater than one kilogram of heroin and five kilograms of cocaine,\n\nthe relevant statutory maximum penalty would be the penalty set\n\nforth in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), which is life imprisonment.\n\nConclusion\n\n          The conviction of each defendant is affirmed.       The\n\nsentence for each defendant is vacated and the cases remanded for\n\nreconsideration of the sentence of each defendant in light of\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -15-\n\f",

He also argues for the first time\n\nhere that the government committed a Brady violation.        Brady v.\n\nMaryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          The first two challenged statements were made by Edwin\n\nMelendez-Negron, a co-conspirator who pled guilty to the conspiracy\n\nand became a cooperating witness for the government.           Melendez-\n\nNegron testified that Mercado told him that Mercado was the driver\n\nof the car during the murder of a man named Hueso.              On cross\n\nexamination,   when   Melendez-Negron    was    confronted     with     his\n\npreviously made contradictory statements, Melendez-Negron admitted\n\nthat Mercado never told him anything about Heuso's murder.        But he\n\ntestified that Mercado was present when a man named Melito and\n\nMelendez-Negron discussed Hueso's murder.        Mercado argues that,\n\nbecause Melendez-Negron retracted his earlier statement, the judge\n\nshould have stricken Melendez-Negron's first statement from the\n\nrecord and instructed the jury not to consider it.\n\n          Melendez-Negron   then    testified   that   the   murderer    of\n\nHueso, a man named Melito, told Melendez-Negron that Mercado helped\n\nhim kill Hueso.   This statement was admitted under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E) as a statement made by a co-conspirator in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy.    Mercado argues that the statement was wrongly\n\nadmitted under the co-conspirator exception because the evidence\n\nwas that the murder was a result of a personal vendetta, and not in\n\nfurtherance of the drug conspiracy.\n\n          The final statement was by a police agent, Edwin Rosado\n\nVega, who testified about prior consistent statements made by\n\nMelendez-Negron regarding Hueso's murder.       This was permitted by\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthe   district    court    on   the    basis   that   it    was    duplicative   of\n\nMelendez-Negron's sworn statement already in evidence.                 That sworn\n\nstatement was introduced into evidence by the defense when cross\n\nexamining Melendez-Negron, in an attempt to impeach his earlier\n\ntestimony.     Although the defense introduced the sworn statement of\n\nMelendez-Negron, Mercado now argues that Melendez-Negron's sworn\n\nstatement was made after his motive to fabricate a story regarding\n\nHueso's murder arose, because the statement was made after he\n\nagreed   to    cooperate    with      the   government     and    testify   against\n\nMercado.      As a result, he argues, it was error to admit Rosado's\n\nstatement.\n\n              Mercado further argues that the district court erred in\n\nallowing any evidence of the murder of Hueso, and evidence of\n\nanother murder allegedly committed by Mercado of a man named Wally,\n\nbecause of a lack of evidence that these murders were committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.              He argues that the only evidence\n\nthat the murder of Wally was related to the conspiracy is the\n\ntestimony of Julio Valentin Medina, who testified that he heard\n\nthat Mercado killed Wally because of a \"debt\" and because he was a\n\n\"stool pigeon.\"     Mercado argues that this evidence is insufficient\n\nto show that Wally's murder was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n              Finally, Mercado argues that the government committed a\n\nBrady violation by presenting testimony of the murders of Edwin and\n\nMichel Vázquez as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy,\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdespite the fact that the government had in its possession a sworn\n\nstatement from a different cooperating witness that these murders\n\nwere unrelated to the conspiracy, which it did not disclose to the\n\ndefense.       Mercado does not argue that the Brady violation itself\n\nwarrants a new trial, but rather he argues that the disclosure of\n\nthe statement would have allowed the court to perform a more\n\ninformed balancing test under Fed. R. Evid. 403, and that balancing\n\nmay   have     led    to    this   evidence      being   disallowed   as   unfairly\n\nprejudicial.         Further, he argues that the failure to disclose the\n\nstatement      impeded      his    cross   examination     of   the   government's\n\ntestifying witness.           The government denies there was any Brady\n\nviolation.\n\n               We review the district court's evidentiary rulings as to\n\npreserved claims for abuse of discretion. United States v. Balsam,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198819\"><a href=\"/opinion/198819/united-states-v-balsam/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting the statements of Melendez-Negron or Officer Rosado.\n\nFirst,    as    to    the    testimony     of    Melendez-Negron,     Mercado   has\n\nimpermissibly switched the basis for his argument twixt trial and\n\nappeal.      His trial counsel did not move to have Melendez-Negron's\n\nearlier statement stricken on the ground, argued now, that the\n\nwitness had disavowed his earlier testimony.                Rather, he asked the\n\njudge to strike any testimony relating to the murder of Hueso on\n\nthe ground that there was inadequate evidence that the murder was\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fin furtherance of the conspiracy.         The \"in furtherance\" evidence\n\nwas sufficient, for reasons described later. Considering his newly\n\nadvanced argument on appeal, there was no plain error, and no error\n\nat all.      It was up to the jury to evaluate the statements,\n\nincluding the contradictions.\n\n          As to the second statement, that Melito told Melendez-\n\nNegron that Mercado helped him kill Hueso, there was adequate\n\nevidence that the murder of Hueso was in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy. This statement was admissible under the co-conspirator\n\nexception.   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).      Mercado attempts to argue\n\nthat Melito wanted to kill Hueso because Hueso stole drugs from him\n\nat a time before Melito joined the Tibes conspiracy, and therefore\n\nthe murder could not have been found to be in furtherance of the\n\nTibes conspiracy.      This is not so.        When Melito and Mercado\n\nmurdered Hueso, they both worked for Melendez-Negron at Tibes,\n\nMelendez-Negron supplied them with the weapons to kill Hueso, and\n\nhe instructed them to do so away from the Tibes Public Housing\n\nProject so as not to draw attention to the drug points.             The\n\ngovernment introduced evidence that the Tibes conspiracy had a\n\npattern of killing those who had wronged members of the conspiracy\n\nin order to protect the conspiracy; there is adequate evidence that\n\nthe murder of Hueso was a part of this pattern.\n\n          As    to   Officer   Rosado's    testimony   concerning   what\n\nMelendez-Negron had told him about Hueso's murder, the district\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fcourt correctly ruled that this was admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)\n\nbecause Melendez-Negron's consistent sworn statement about the\n\nmurder had already been introduced into evidence by the defense in\n\nan attempt to impeach his direct testimony.\n\n          It is also clear that evidence of the murders of Hueso\n\nand Wally were not erroneously admitted.        There was adequate\n\nevidence that each of these murders was committed in furtherance of\n\nthe conspiracy.    As to the evidence about Wally's murder, the\n\ngovernment introduced testimony that Mercado murdered Wally because\n\nhe owed a debt and because he was a \"stool pigeon.\"\n\n          As to the unpreserved argument of an alleged Brady\n\nviolation, we note that the statement in question was referred to\n\nin multiple reported cases before the start of Mercado's trial, and\n\ncould easily have been discovered by Mercado's counsel, thus it is\n\ndoubtful there is any Brady claim.       In any event, given the\n\ncorroborating testimony that the murders in question were committed\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy, and the amount of evidence\n\nimplicating Mercado in the conspiracy, he cannot carry his burden\n\nof showing that the alleged violation affected the result of the\n\nproceeding.   See United States v. Conley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199406\"><a href=\"/opinion/199406/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fMorera-Vigo\n\n          Morera-Vigo makes the same arguments that Mercado does\n\nabout admission of evidence of the murders of Hueso and Wally.                We\n\nreject them for the same reasons.\n\n          In addition, Morera-Vigo argues that the court erred in\n\nallowing evidence of murders and drug dealing committed at other\n\ndrug points in Ponce.          He argues that there was a different\n\nconspiracy run by Angela Ayala, whose only connections to the Tibes\n\nconspiracy were that one of her drug points was in the Tibes Public\n\nHousing Project and that she acted as a supplier to other drug\n\npoints there.       He argues that evidence of Angela Ayala's drug\n\nactivities at drug points other than her drug point at Tibes, and\n\nevidence of murders committed to protect those drug points, was\n\nimproperly    and    prejudicially      admitted     into     evidence.       The\n\ngovernment introduced this evidence on the theory that dealers at\n\nseveral drug points in and around the Tibes Public Housing Project\n\nassisted each other in their drug distribution efforts and in the\n\nprotection    of    their   drug    points,   and   that    its   admission   was\n\nnecessary to understand the full scope of the conspiracy.\n\n          We bypass the question of admissibility; any error was\n\nharmless. Independently, there was more than adequate evidence for\n\nthe jury to convict Morera-Vigo, including testimony and in-court\n\nidentifications       by    three     different      cooperating      witnesses\n\nimplicating Morera-Vigo as a co-conspirator selling drugs and\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fcommitting violent acts to protect the conspiracy.      There was also\n\nforensic evidence linking Morera-Vigo to murders committed in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n          In pro-se supplemental and reply briefing, defendant\n\nMorera-Vigo for the first time attempts to challenge his conviction\n\nbased on the fact that \"drug type and quantity was not submitted to\n\nthe jury,\" and \"the jury was not instructed to determine guilt on\n\nthe elements of drug type and quantity.\"       This argument is both\n\nfactually and legally incorrect.      The judge did instruct the jury\n\nthat, through the special verdict form, they would be asked to\n\ndetermine both drug type and a minimum drug quantity for each\n\ndefendant found guilty of the conspiracy.     Citing United States v.\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d, 20 (1st Cir. 2003), Morera-Vigo argues that\n\nthis was insufficient because the jury did not find an amount of\n\ndrugs attributable to him specifically, rather than the conspiracy\n\nas a whole. This argument misunderstands our case law. Perez-Ruiz\n\ngoes to the maximum sentence available based on the jury verdict of\n\nguilt in a conspiracy.   Id. at 15.     Perez-Ruiz says nothing about\n\nthe vacation of a conviction for conspiracy based on lack of an\n\nindividualized   quantity   determination.      The    district   court\n\ninstructed the jury on all the elements of the crime, namely,\n\nconspiracy to distribute drugs in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, and\n\nthe jury found all the elements of the crime.         This argument is\n\nmeritless.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fRodríguez Rodríguez\n\n              Rodríguez     argues     that    the    district    court      erred   in\n\nallowing the government to present testimony by five witnesses\n\n(Melendez-Negron, Enrique Malave Diaz, Gamalier Douglas, Julio\n\nValentin Medina, and Joel Irizarry-Rosario), who had entered into\n\ncooperation agreements with the government which ensured them\n\nleniency in exchange for their testimony.                    He argues that such\n\nagreements gave each a motivation to present false testimony, and\n\nthat   such    testimony     was     unfairly    prejudicial.           Testimony    of\n\ncooperating witnesses is common and appropriate.                      There are also\n\nadequate procedural safeguards.               See United States v. Dailey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450560\"><a href=\"/opinion/450560/united-states-v-kevin-r-dailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (1st Cir. 1985) (cooperating witness testimony\n\npermissible,        but   agreements    should       be   read   to    jury,   defense\n\npermitted      to    cross-examine      about    agreements,          and   cautionary\n\ninstruction should be given to jury about nature of agreement and\n\nrisk created thereby).          There is no claim that such procedural\n\nsafeguards were ignored in this case; rather, Rodríguez claims that\n\nsuch testimony is inherently unreliable and should have been\n\nexcluded.      This claim is meritless.\n\nManuel Vazquez-Mendez\n\n              Manuel Vazquez-Mendez argues that the district court\n\nerred in denying his Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 29 motion for acquittal.\n\nHe argues that there was testimony about at least six individuals\n\nnamed \"Manuel,\" and the jury was left to speculate as to whether he\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fwas     any   of     them.     Further,   he   argues   that   the   evidence\n\naffirmatively implicating him showed only his involvement with a\n\ndifferent drug point involved in a different conspiracy, and\n\ntherefore the government did not carry its burden of showing his\n\ninvolvement in the Tibes drug conspiracy that was charged in the\n\nindictment.\n\n              We review the denial of a Rule 29 motion for acquittal de\n\nnovo.

Id. There was ample evidence to find Manuel Vazquez-Mendez\n\nguilty of the charged conspiracy.              A cooperating witness, Joel\n\nIrizarry-Rosario, made a valid in-court identification of Manuel\n\nVazquez-Mendez, testified that he was involved with selling drugs\n\nat the Tibes Housing Project, and gave detailed testimony that\n\nManuel Vazquez-Mendez was part of a group that hunted down and\n\nkilled a rival drug dealer named Papito who was at war with the\n\nTibes conspiracy.            Further, the government submitted forensic\n\nevidence      that    corroborated   Irizarry-Rosario's    testimony    about\n\nManuel Vazquez-Mendez's involvement in this murder.             Viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict of guilt, there\n\nwas adequate evidence to find Manuel Vazquez-Mendez guilty of the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fSentencing\n\n          In the aftermath of United States v.

The Guidelines are now advisory and the judge\n\nis no longer mandated to impose a life sentence, so given the\n\ngovernment's concession, remand is appropriate.          Of course, we\n\nintimate no view on what sentences should be imposed on remand.\n\n             We make one comment as to a sentencing claim made by\n\ndefendants    Hernan   Vazquez-Mendez,   Eliezer   Morera-Vigo,   Manuel\n\nVazquez-Mendez, and German Rodríguez Rodríguez.

This is so, they argue, because the jury\n\ndid not make individualized quantity determinations as to the type\n\nand quantity of drugs that were attributable to each defendant\n\nspecifically, but rather only determined drug type and quantity\n\nattributable to the conspiracy as a whole.\n\n          This argument is mistaken. The indictment specified drug\n\ntype and quantity for each defendant.              In addition, the district\n\ncourt instructed the jury that it would be asked to find beyond a\n\nreasonable    doubt    the   drug   type    and    quantity    stated   in   the\n\nindictment    for     each   defendant     found    guilty    of   joining   the\n\nconspiracy. Further, the jury was given a special verdict form for\n\neach defendant, which stated:\n\n             Do you unanimously agree by proof beyond a\n             reasonable doubt that the quantity of cocaine\n             which was distributed and/or intended to be\n             distributed as part of the conspiracy was five\n             kilograms or more?\n             Do you unanimously agree by proof beyond a\n             reasonable doubt that the quantity of heroin\n             which was distributed and/or intended to be\n             distributed as part of the conspiracy was one\n             kilogram or more?\n\nThe jury answered yes to both questions of the special verdict form\n\nfor all five defendants.       As the case law of this circuit has made\n\nabundantly clear, the maximum statutory penalty available to the\n\ndistrict court at sentencing for a defendant convicted of a drug\n\nconspiracy is based on the drug quantity and amount reflected in\n\nthe jury verdict attributable to the conspiracy as a whole. United\n\nStates v. Perez-Ruiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200773\"><a href=\"/opinion/200773/united-states-v-perez-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).               Here, since\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe jury found all defendants guilty of a conspiracy to distribute\n\ngreater than one kilogram of heroin and five kilograms of cocaine,\n\nthe relevant statutory maximum penalty would be the penalty set\n\nforth in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), which is life imprisonment.\n\nConclusion\n\n          The conviction of each defendant is affirmed.
