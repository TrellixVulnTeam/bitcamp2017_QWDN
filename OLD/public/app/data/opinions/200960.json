Before us are orders certifying\n\nclass actions in two jailhouse strip search cases.          The two cases,\n\narising before two different judges in the same court (Judges\n\nCarter and Hornby), are targeted at two different Maine counties\n\n(Knox and York).      In each case, a named plaintiff seeks to\n\nrepresent   others   who   (it   is    alleged)   were   improperly   strip\n\nsearched.     Following certification of the classes, we allowed\n\ninterlocutory appeals and now affirm.\n\n            Over the last few decades, a changed popular sensibility\n\nhas produced a series of decisions curtailing what was once an\n\napparently routine practice in many jails of strip searching\n\narrestees not yet convicted of any crime.1               Such cases have\n\nincluded, or brought in their wake, lawsuits by those who were\n\nsearched seeking damages from officials or governmental entities\n\nresponsible for the searches. E.g., Miller v. Kennebec County, 219\n\nF.3d 8, 12-13 (1st Cir. 2000).        These suits are ordinarily framed\n\nas Fourth Amendment claims for unconstitutional search and seizure\n\nand brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).         Id.\n\n            Qualified immunity has defeated some of these claims\n\nagainst officials, e.g., Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (en banc), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 1074 (2004),\n\n\n     1\n      The trend began with the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). In this circuit, the leading cases\nare Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff's Dep't, 354 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.\n2003);   Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2000);\nSwain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fbut the doctrine does not protect counties, see Owen v. City of\n\nIndependence, 445 U.S. 622, 650 (1980).    Though not liable under a\n\nrespondeat superior theory, Bd. of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, 520\n\nU.S. 397, 403 (1997), counties and like entities may be liable\n\nunder section 1983 not only for their formal official acts and\n\npolicies, but also, under some circumstances, for practices \"so\n\npermanent and well settled” as to constitute established custom.\n\nMonell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978) (quoting\n\nAdickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167-68 (1970)).\n\n           In the first case before us--brought against Knox\n\nCounty, its sheriff, and unidentified officers--Laurie Tardiff\n\nfiled such a section 1983 claim, asserting that she had been\n\narrested for witness tampering after having been previously charged\n\nwith violating an anti-harassment order.    Tardiff v. Knox County,\n\n218 F.R.D. 332, 334 (D. Me. 2003).      At the jail house, Tardiff\n\nalleged that she was taken to a shower area, ordered by a female\n\ncorrections officer to disrobe, and required to \"squat and cough\"\n\nwhile the officer could see her vagina and anal area.    Id.\n\n          Judge Carter, presiding in the case, called this a “strip\n\nand visual body cavity search,”    Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 334; Judge\n\nHornby, faced with a similar description by the lead plaintiff in\n\na parallel suit against York County, called the same thing a “strip\n\nsearch,” Nilsen v. York County, 219 F.R.D. 19, 22, 25 (D. Me.\n\n2003).   For simplicity’s sake, we use \"strip search\" in this\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdecision to cover the described conduct, recognizing that the\n\nphrase is used variously in different decisions and that there is\n\na   spectrum   of     possible   search   practices   inflicting   differing\n\nindignities.     Just what happened to Tardiff and others may itself\n\nbe disputed.\n\n           Tardiff sought to represent a class of persons similarly\n\nsituated and in due course Judge Carter certified a class under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).        Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 336.       The class,\n\nas defined by the court, covered:\n\n      All people who after November 19, 1996, were\n      subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity\n      search   without   evaluation    for   individualized\n      reasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox\n      County Jail:\n\n        (1) after having been arrested on charges that did\n        not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony;\n        or\n\n        (2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges\n        that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent\n        felony; or\n\n        (3) while waiting for an initial court appearance\n        on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or\n        a violent felony; or\n\n        (4) after having been arrested on a warrant that\n        did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent\n        felony.\n\nId.\n\n           In the second case, brought before Judge Hornby, a\n\nsubstitute     lead    plaintiff–-Michael    Goodrich--was   arrested    for\n\nfailing to report for probation and (he alleges) was strip searched\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fwith the same strip, squat and cough procedure as Tardiff.           Nilsen\n\n219 F.R.D. at 22.      Like Tardiff, he alleged that this was done in\n\naccordance with a policy or custom of the county that was applied\n\nwidely to arrestees including those charged with unthreatening\n\noffenses. Judge Hornby, acting shortly after Judge Carter, entered\n\na comparable order certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(3).           Id. at\n\n19-20.2\n\n             In each case, the defendants sought interlocutory review\n\nof the class certification.         We have discretion as to whether to\n\nentertain such an appeal.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) and 1998\n\nadvisory committee's note to subdivision (f).             One reason for\n\nreview is a threat of liability so large as to place on the\n\ndefendant an “irresistible pressure to settle.”                 Waste Mgmt.\n\nHoldings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nAlthough we thought it quite possible that the certification orders\n\nwould     survive   review,   the   financial   and   similar   information\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Judge Hornby's order, Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at 25,           defines the\nclass as:\n\n        All people strip-searched at the York County Jail after\n        October 14, 1996 under a policy or custom of conducting\n        strip-searches without evaluating for individualized\n        reasonable suspicion: (1) while waiting for bail to be\n        set or for a first court appearance after being arrested\n        on charges that did not involve a weapon or drugs or a\n        violent felony; or (2) while waiting for a first court\n        appearance after being arrested on a default or other\n        warrant.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprovided by the two counties in this case persuaded us to grant\n\ninterlocutory review, which we expedited.\n\n            Nominally, review of decisions granting or denying class\n\ncertification is for “abuse of discretion,” Smilow v. S.W. Bell\n\nMobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir. 2003), but this\n\nchameleon    phrase   is    misleading.          Express    standards   for\n\ncertification are contained in Rule 23, so an appeal can pose pure\n\nissues of law reviewed de novo or occasionally raw fact findings\n\nthat are rarely disturbed.       See id.    Here, we are concerned with\n\napplying general standards to particular facts where the touchstone\n\nis “reasonableness” and review is deferential.3\n\n            All class actions certified under Rule 23 must meet\n\ncertain prerequisites listed in subsection (a): there must be\n\nnumerosity of class members, common questions of law or fact, the\n\nrepresentative must be typical of the class, and his or her\n\nrepresentation of the class must be adequate.              Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n23(a).   Here, these preconditions are admittedly satisfied.            The\n\ndefendants’ attack is instead on the further requirement, for a\n\n(b)(3)   class,   that     the   court    find   that   common   questions\n\n“predominate” over individual ones and that the class action be\n\n\n     3\n      Cf. Stanton v. Berkshire Reg'l Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d         574, 577\n(1st Cir. 1999) (attorneys' fees under IDEA); Mass. Food          Ass'n v.\nMass. Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n, 197 F.3d 560,           567 (1st\nCir. 1999) (adequacy of representation under Fed. R.               Civ. P.\n24(a)).\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f“superior” to other methods of resolving the controversy. Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 23(b)(3).\n\n            Subsection (b)(3), the cute tiger cub that has grown into\n\nsomething unexpectedly fearsome in civil rights and mass tort\n\nlitigation, is a joinder device for consolidating separate but\n\nsimilar claims–-as opposed, for example, to disputes about a common\n\nfund, which is covered by subsection (b)(1)(B).                 The subsection\n\nlists non-exclusive factors for making the determination–-the most\n\npertinent      here   is   manageability–-but     the    \"predominance\"       and\n\n\"superiority\" labels turn largely on the particular facts and\n\nissues presented.          Some courts have allowed strip search class\n\nactions and others not.4\n\n            What here are the issues?         The principal ones–-and this\n\nis our own very rough cut–-appear to be these: what rule, policy or\n\ncustom as to strip searches was in force in each county during the\n\nperiods   in    question;    was   it   lawful   as   applied   to   groups    or\n\nindividual class members; if unlawful as to some categories of\n\narrestees, were there still facts as to particular arrestees that\n\njustified a strip search; and if liability exists, what are the\n\n\n     4\n      Compare Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 622\n(W.D. Wis. 2003), Bynum v. District of Columbia, 217 F.R.D. 43, 50\n(D.D.C. 2003), Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 76-79\n(S.D.N.Y. 2002), Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 25 (D.\nMass. 2000), and Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F. Supp. 604, 613\n(D. Md. 1983)(all certifying strip search class actions), with\nKlein v. DuPage County, 119 F.R.D. 29, 31-32 (N.D. Ill.\n1988)(denying certification for strip search class action). There\nare also several unpublished opinions coming out both ways.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdamages to each person injured?     There are obviously other issues\n\n(e.g., as to individual defendants); but these four are likely the\n\nmost important.\n\n            On the first issue–-what rules, policies or customs\n\nprevailed–-there is already deep disagreement between plaintiffs\n\nand defendants.   So the question arises whose version is a court to\n\nassume for purposes of deciding whether a class action is even\n\nsuitable?    It is sometimes taken for granted that the complaint’s\n\nallegations are necessarily controlling; but class action machinery\n\nis expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed\n\npremises early on if and when the class action would be proper on\n\none premise but not another.5\n\n            In this case, whether there was a rule, policy or custom\n\nof   automatically   strip   searching   all   or   most   categories   of\n\narrestees is on its face a common disputed issue–-as both sides\n\nconcede.    Nothing here obliged the district courts to do more than\n\nview the issue as such and, so viewed, it weighs in favor of class\n\naction status.    The issue is like any other common predicate to\n\nliability for multiple parallel claims–-say whether the train\n\n\n      5\n      Compare Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177\n(1974)(discouraging any preliminary inquiry), with Gen. Tel. Co. of\nS.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160-161 (1982)(endorsing such an\ninquiry).   The circuits are also divided.      Compare Caridad v.\nMetro-North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 291-93 (2d Cir. 1999), and\nJ.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 n.7 (10th Cir.\n1999), with Johnston v. HBO Film Mgmt., Inc., 265 F.3d 178, 186-89\n(3d Cir. 2001), and Szabo v. Bridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672,\n675-76 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 951 (2001).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fengineer   was    negligent    (or     acting    within      the   scope   of   his\n\nemployment) when the train went off the rails.                     See, e.g., Am.\n\nTrading & Prod. Corp. v. Fischbach & Moore, Inc., 47 F.R.D. 155,\n\n157 (N.D. Ill. 1969).\n\n           The second issue, whether the strip search policy is\n\nunlawful, presents different complications.               The first is that it\n\nmight be lawful as to some groups of arrestees (say, those arrested\n\non firearm felony charges) and not others (say, those seized for\n\nnon-payment of parking tickets).          Both district courts sought to\n\nnarrow the potential multiplicity of categories–-which could in\n\nseveral respects work against class status–-by narrowing the class.\n\nIn both orders, the class definition excluded those arrested for\n\ndrugs, weapons or violent felonies–-categories for which automatic\n\nstrip searches might seem easier to defend.             Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at\n\n25; Tardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 336.\n\n            Of course, the defendants might still persuade the court\n\nthat some within the remaining group of arrestees (e.g., those\n\narrested for misdemeanors of certain types) could also be strip\n\nsearched as a matter of course.               But the core notion that some\n\nclasses    of    arrestees    should    not     be   strip    searched     without\n\nparticularized suspicion is now embedded in the case law.6                      Just\n\n\n     6\n      See Miller, 219 F.3d at 12; Swain, 117 F.3d at 12.        If\nanything, some of the rhetoric might lead the reader to believe,\nquite wrongly, that every arrestee must be independently evaluated\nbased on his or her own circumstances. In reality, generalizations\nlie behind most so-called individual decisions and to endorse the\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwhat groups within the class can or cannot be searched without such\n\nsuspicion appears, like the rule-policy-custom question, to present\n\na common set of issues proper for a class action.\n\n          Turning to the third of the issues we listed, defendants\n\nsay that individualized suspicion may have existed as to anyone\n\nwithin the certified class, so that every class member necessarily\n\npresents a different problem even as to liability.   True, a class\n\nmember arrested for the most minor and non-violent of offenses\n\nmight arguably warrant a strip search by his individual behavior\n\n(violently resisting arrest) or prior record (armed assaults).   If\n\nsuch an individual evaluation were necessary in every case, this\n\nmight doom an efficient class action.\n\n             Both district courts sought to finesse the issue by\n\ndefining the class to include only those who were searched without\n\nevaluation for individualized suspicion.   Nilsen, 219 F.R.D. at 25\n\n(\"without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion\");\n\nTardiff, 218 F.R.D. at 336 (\"without evaluation for individualized\n\nreasonable suspicion\").    This is not a complete answer; for one\n\nthing, at some point in the case it could still be necessary to\n\ndetermine individually who among those who were searched were so\n\nevaluated.\n\n\n\n\ngeneralization is, in substance, to endorse some categorical rules.\nSee Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                               -11-\n\f           Further, even if all persons searched based on individual\n\nevaluations were readily excluded from the class regardless of the\n\nsoundness of the evaluation, it might still be necessary–-at least\n\nin some cases--to consider whether individualized suspicion could\n\nhave justified a search.    Even if overbroad categories were used,\n\nthe defendants will likely argue that the result would have been\n\nthe same for some class members even if proper individualized\n\njudgments had been made–-raising a legal issue as to liability on\n\nwhich we offer no opinion.     Compare 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)\n\n(2000) (Title VII's same decision defense as to damages).    If the\n\nnumber of such instances was large, the feasibility of a class\n\naction might be compromised.\n\n           Without prejudging disputable issues, we think that such\n\nthreats of undue complications as to liability are limited in this\n\ncase.    If there was in fact a rule, custom or policy of strip\n\nsearching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category,\n\nthen it is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip\n\nsearched on this basis.    There might yet be some number as to whom\n\ndefensible individual judgments to strip search were actually made\n\nor could have been made–-two different situations with different\n\nlegal implications; but whoever has the burden of identifying such\n\npersons, they may well not be numerous.7\n\n\n     7\n      A number of district courts say that the burden of\nidentification is on the defendant, e.g., Blihovde, 219 F.R.D. at\n622; Mack, 191 F.R.D. at 24; see also Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v.\n\n                                -12-\n\f          Determinations to certify a class depend on initial\n\nprediction and are always subject to revision.     Gen. Tel. Co. of\n\nthe S.W. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982); Smilow, 323 F.3d at\n\n39-40; Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 297 n.6.    If a large number of class\n\nmembers turn out to present non-common issues as to liability, the\n\ncourt may have to consider narrowing or de-certifying the class.\n\nMowbray, 208 F.3d at 297 n.2.   But a court can proceed based on its\n\nreasonable best guess as to what will happen and we share the\n\ndistrict judges’ apparent view that the individualized-suspicion\n\nissue will arise only in a limited number of cases, assuming always\n\nthat plaintiffs can establish as a background fact the existence of\n\nan improperly broad strip search rule, policy or custom.\n\n          By contrast, the presence of damage claims does weigh\n\nagainst class status.    In certain cases (e.g., some security\n\nfrauds), formula damages are generally used.        See 3 Conte &\n\nNewberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 10:8 (4th ed. 2002). Here each\n\nclass member wrongly strip searched could in principle testify\n\nseparately as to the circumstances, emotional damage, lost wages,\n\nmedical treatment, doctor bills, and so on.       Indeed, the less\n\npotent the available defense on liability, the more the class\n\n\n\n\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324, 360 (1977)(Title VII), but the various\nburden issues have not been briefed in this case, and we do not\nresolve them.\n\n\n                                -13-\n\faction might look like a bundle of individualized damage claims\n\nwholly unsuited for class resolution.\n\n              Yet the need for individualized damage decisions does\n\nnot ordinarily defeat predominance where there are still disputed\n\ncommon issues as to liability.          Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40.        If the\n\nclass action resolved liability even as to some further narrowed\n\nclass, this would be a legitimate function.             At that point, the\n\ncourt would have further options, such as an agreement on modest\n\nuniform damages for those not claiming special injury, with masters\n\nto determine the (potentially few) serious claims to special\n\ninjury.     E.g., In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig., 80\n\nF.R.D. 244 (S.D. Tex. 1978).\n\n            Failing some practical solution allowing full resolution\n\nof all class damage claims in a single case, the court could enter\n\na judgment of liability, leaving class members to pursue damage\n\nclaims in separate law suits.          Smilow, 323 F.3d at 40-41; accord.\n\nBlihovde v. St. Croix County, 219 F.R.D. 607, 621 (W.D. Wis. 2003);\n\nManeely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 79 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)\n\n(strip search cases).        In addition, if and when liability is\n\nestablished    and   the   remaining    dispute   is   only   the   amount   of\n\ndamages, it is common experience that a great many claims settle.\n\n            It remains to discuss the superiority vel non of the\n\nclass action.     The counties insist that individual law suits are\n\nfeasible.     We think that only the limited number of cases where\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fserious damage ensued would ever be brought without class status\n\nand that the vast majority of claims would never be brought unless\n\naggregated because provable actual damages are too small.    This is\n\na conventional argument for a class action, Amchem Prods., Inc., v.\n\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997), and it applies here.\n\n          Whether the law should encourage the bringing of very\n\nsmall claims that would otherwise not be brought is a different\n\nmatter; law suits serve purposes beyond compensation, and the\n\nbalance of cost and benefit doubtless varies from case to case.   It\n\nis enough for the superiority determination here that for most\n\nstrip search claimants, class status here is not only the superior\n\nmeans, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral\n\nestoppel aside), to establish liability and perhaps damages. E.g.,\n\nBlihovde, 219 F.R.D. at 622; Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16,\n\n25 (D. Mass. 2000).\n\n          It follows that the orders certifying the class actions\n\nmust be sustained at this initial stage without prejudice to their\n\nfurther alteration.   In further proceedings in the district court,\n\nlittle weight should be given to our own glancing discussion of the\n\nmerits;   although    necessary     background   in   reviewing   the\n\ncertification orders, our assessment can only be preliminary,\n\nlacking the benefit of a fuller record and analyses yet to come.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f",

The two cases, arising before two different judges in the same court (Judges Carter and Hornby), are targeted at two different Maine counties (Knox and York). In each case, a named plaintiff seeks to represent others who (it is alleged) were improperly strip searched.

Kennebec County,</i> 219 F.3d 8, 12-13 (1st Cir.2000). These suits are ordinarily framed as Fourth Amendment claims for unconstitutional search and seizure and brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity has defeated some of these claims against officials, <i>e.g., Savard v.

Knox County,</i> 218 F.R.D. 332, 334 (D.Me.2003). At the jail house, Tardiff alleged that she was taken to a shower area, ordered by a female corrections officer to disrobe, and required to \"squat and cough\" while the officer could see her vagina and anal area. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Carter, presiding in the case, called this a \"strip and visual body cavity search,\" <i>Tardiff,</i> 218 F.R.D. at 334; Judge Hornby, faced with a similar description by the lead plaintiff in a parallel suit against York County, called the same thing a \"strip search,\" <i>Nilsen v. York County,</i> 219 F.R.D. 19, 22, 25 (D.Me.2003). For simplicity's sake, we use \"strip search\" in this decision to cover the described conduct, recognizing that the phrase is used variously in different decisions and that there is a spectrum of possible search practices inflicting differing indignities.

The class, as defined by the court, covered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All people who after November 19, 1996, were subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion while being held at the Knox County Jail:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) after having been arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) while waiting for bail to be set on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) while waiting for an initial court appearance on charges that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) after having been arrested on a warrant that did not involve a weapon, drugs, or a violent felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second case, brought before Judge Hornby, a substitute lead plaintiff &#8212; Michael Goodrich &#8212; was arrested for failing to report for probation and (he alleges) was strip searched with the same strip, squat and cough procedure as Tardiff. <i>Nilsen</i> 219 F.R.D. at 22. Like Tardiff, he alleged that this was done in accordance with a policy or custom of the county that was applied widely to arrestees including those charged with unthreatening offenses. Judge Hornby, acting shortly after Judge Carter, entered a comparable order certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(3). <i>Id.</i> at 19-20.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In each case, the defendants sought interlocutory review of the class certification. We have discretion as to whether to entertain such an appeal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(f) and 1998 advisory committee's note to subdivision (f). One reason for review is a threat of liability so large as to place on the defendant an \"irresistible pressure to settle.\" <i>Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir.2000). Although we thought it quite possible that the certification orders would survive review, the financial and similar information provided by the two counties in this case persuaded us to grant interlocutory review, which we expedited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nominally, review of decisions granting or denying class certification is for \"abuse of discretion,\" <i>Smilow v. S.W. Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 323 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir.2003), but this chameleon phrase is misleading. Express standards for certification are contained in Rule 23, so an appeal can pose pure issues of law reviewed <i>de novo</i> or occasionally raw fact findings that are rarely disturbed. <i>See id.</i> Here, we are concerned with applying general standards to particular facts where the touchstone is \"reasonableness\" and review is deferential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All class actions certified under Rule 23 must meet certain prerequisites listed in subsection (a): there must be numerosity of class members, common questions of law or fact, the representative must be typical of the class, and his or her representation of the class must be adequate. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Here, these preconditions are admittedly satisfied. The defendants' attack is instead on the further requirement, for a(b)(3) class, that the court find that common questions \"predominate\" over individual ones and that the class action be \"superior\" to other methods of resolving the controversy. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (b)(3), the cute tiger cub that has grown into something unexpectedly fearsome in civil rights and mass tort litigation, is a joinder device for consolidating separate but similar claims &#8212; as opposed, for example, to disputes about a common fund, which is covered by subsection (b)(1)(B). The subsection lists non-exclusive factors for making the determination &#8212; the most pertinent here is manageability &#8212; but the \"predominance\" and \"superiority\" labels turn largely on the particular facts and issues presented. Some courts have allowed strip search class actions and others not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What here are the issues? The principal ones &#8212; and this is our own very rough cut &#8212; appear to be these: what rule, policy or custom as to strip searches was in force in each county during the periods in question; was it lawful as applied to groups or individual class members; if unlawful as to some categories of arrestees, were there still facts as to particular arrestees that justified a strip search; and if liability exists, what are the damages to each person injured? There are obviously other issues (<i>e.g.,</i> as to individual defendants); but these four are likely the most important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first issue &#8212; what rules, policies or customs prevailed &#8212; there is already deep disagreement between plaintiffs and defendants. So the question arises whose version is a court to assume for purposes of deciding whether a class action is even suitable? It is sometimes taken for granted that the complaint's allegations are necessarily controlling; but class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, whether there was a rule, policy or custom of automatically strip searching all or most categories of arrestees is on its face a common disputed issue &#8212; as both sides concede. Nothing here obliged the district courts to do more than view the issue as such and, so viewed, it weighs in favor of class action status. The issue is like any other common predicate to liability for multiple parallel claims &#8212; say whether the train engineer was negligent (or acting within the scope of his employment) when the train went off the rails. <i>See, e.g., Am. Trading &amp; Prod. Corp. v. Fischbach &amp; Moore, Inc.,</i> 47 F.R.D. 155, 157 (N.D.Ill.1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue, whether the strip search policy is unlawful, presents different complications. The first is that it might be lawful as to some groups of arrestees (say, those arrested on firearm felony charges) and not others (say, those seized for non-payment of parking tickets). Both district courts sought to narrow the potential multiplicity of categories &#8212; which could in several respects work against class status &#8212; by narrowing the class. In both orders, the class definition excluded those arrested for drugs, weapons or violent felonies &#8212; categories for which automatic strip searches might seem easier to defend. <i>Nilsen,</i> 219 F.R.D. at 25; <i>Tardiff,</i> 218 F.R.D. at 336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the defendants might still persuade the court that some within the remaining group of arrestees (<i>e.g.,</i> those arrested for misdemeanors of certain types) could also be strip searched as a matter of course. But the core notion that some classes of arrestees should not be strip searched without particularized suspicion is now embedded in the case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Just what groups within the class can or cannot be searched without such suspicion appears, like the rule-policy-custom question, to present a common set of issues proper for a class action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third of the issues we listed, defendants say that individualized suspicion may have existed as to <i>anyone</i> within the certified class, so that every class member necessarily presents a different problem even as to liability. True, a class member arrested for the most minor and non-violent of offenses might arguably warrant a strip search by his individual behavior (violently resisting arrest) or prior record (armed assaults). If such an individual evaluation were necessary in every case, this might doom an efficient class action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both district courts sought to finesse the issue by defining the class to include only those who were searched without <i>evaluation</i> for individualized suspicion. <i>Nilsen,</i> 219 F.R.D. at 25 (\"without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion\"); <i>Tardiff,</i> 218 F.R.D. at 336 (\"without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion\"). This is not a complete answer; for one thing, at some point in the case it could still be necessary to determine individually who among those who were searched were so evaluated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, even if all persons searched based on individual evaluations were readily excluded from the class regardless of the soundness of the evaluation, it might still be necessary &#8212; at least in some cases &#8212; to consider whether individualized suspicion <i>could have</i> justified a search. Even if overbroad categories were used, the defendants will likely argue that the result would have been the same for some class members even if proper individualized judgments had been made &#8212; raising a legal issue as to liability on which we offer no opinion. <i>Compare</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (2000) (Title VII's same decision defense as to damages). If the number of such instances was large, the feasibility of a class action might be compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without prejudging disputable issues, we think that such threats of undue complications as to liability are limited in this case. If there was in fact a rule, custom or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category, then it is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip searched on this basis. There might yet be some number as to whom defensible individual judgments to strip search were actually made or could have been made &#8212; two different situations with different legal implications; but whoever has the burden of identifying such persons, they may well not be numerous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determinations to certify a class depend on initial prediction and are always subject to revision. <i>Gen. Tel. Co. of the S.W. v. Falcon,</i> 457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982); <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 39-40; <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 297 n. 6. If a large number of class members turn out to present non-common issues as to liability, the court may have to consider narrowing or de-certifying the class. <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 297 n. 2. But a court can proceed based on its reasonable best guess as to what will happen and we share the district judges' apparent view that the individualized-suspicion issue will arise only in a limited number of cases, assuming always that plaintiffs can establish as a background fact the existence of an improperly broad strip search rule, policy or custom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the presence of damage claims does weigh against class status. In certain cases (<i>e.g.,</i> some security frauds), formula damages are generally used. <i>See</i> 3 Conte &amp; Newberg, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> &#167; 10:8 (4th ed.2002). Here each class member wrongly strip searched could in principle testify separately as to the circumstances, emotional damage, lost wages, medical treatment, doctor bills, and so on. Indeed, the less potent the available defense on liability, the more the class action might look like a bundle of individualized damage claims wholly unsuited for class resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the need for individualized damage decisions does not ordinarily defeat predominance where there are still disputed common issues as to liability. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40. If the class action resolved liability even as to some further narrowed class, this would be a legitimate function. At that point, the court would have further options, such as an agreement on modest uniform damages for those not claiming special injury, with masters to determine the (potentially few) serious claims to special injury. <i>E.g., In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig.,</i> 80 F.R.D. 244 (S.D.Tex.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failing some practical solution allowing full resolution of all class damage claims in a single case, the court could enter a judgment of liability, leaving class members to pursue damage claims in separate law suits. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40-41; <i>accord. Blihovde v. St. Croix County,</i> 219 F.R.D. 607, 621 (W.D.Wis.2003); <i>Maneely v. City of Newburgh,</i> 208 F.R.D. 69, 79 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (strip search cases). In addition, if and when liability is established and the remaining dispute is only the amount of damages, it is common experience that a great many claims settle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains to discuss the superiority <i>vel non</i> of the class action. The counties insist that individual law suits are feasible. We think that only the limited number of cases where serious damage ensued would ever be brought without class status and that the vast majority of claims would never be brought unless aggregated because provable actual damages are too small. This is a conventional argument for a class action, <i>Amchem Prods., Inc., v. Windsor,</i> 521 U.S. 591, 617, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997), and it applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the law should encourage the bringing of very small claims that would otherwise not be brought is a different matter; law suits serve purposes beyond compensation, and the balance of cost and benefit doubtless varies from case to case. It is enough for the superiority determination here that for most strip search claimants, class status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel aside), to establish liability and perhaps damages. <i>E.g., Blihovde,</i> 219 F.R.D. at 622; <i>Mack v. Suffolk County,</i> 191 F.R.D. 16, 25 (D.Mass.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that the orders certifying the class actions must be sustained at this initial stage without prejudice to their further alteration. In further proceedings in the district court, little weight should be given to our own glancing discussion of the merits; although necessary background in reviewing the certification orders, our assessment can only be preliminary, lacking the benefit of a fuller record and analyses yet to come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The trend began with the Supreme Court's decision in<i>Bell v.

The subsection lists non-exclusive factors for making the determination &#8212; the most pertinent here is manageability &#8212; but the \"predominance\" and \"superiority\" labels turn largely on the particular facts and issues presented.

There are obviously other issues (<i>e.g.,</i> as to individual defendants); but these four are likely the most important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first issue &#8212; what rules, policies or customs prevailed &#8212; there is already deep disagreement between plaintiffs and defendants. So the question arises whose version is a court to assume for purposes of deciding whether a class action is even suitable? It is sometimes taken for granted that the complaint's allegations are necessarily controlling; but class action machinery is expensive and in our view a court has the power to test disputed premises early on if and when the class action would be proper on one premise but not another.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, whether there was a rule, policy or custom of automatically strip searching all or most categories of arrestees is on its face a common disputed issue &#8212; as both sides concede. Nothing here obliged the district courts to do more than view the issue as such and, so viewed, it weighs in favor of class action status. The issue is like any other common predicate to liability for multiple parallel claims &#8212; say whether the train engineer was negligent (or acting within the scope of his employment) when the train went off the rails. <i>See, e.g., Am. Trading &amp; Prod. Corp. v. Fischbach &amp; Moore, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span>, 157 (N.D.Ill.1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue, whether the strip search policy is unlawful, presents different complications. The first is that it might be lawful as to some groups of arrestees (say, those arrested on firearm felony charges) and not others (say, those seized for non-payment of parking tickets). Both district courts sought to narrow the potential multiplicity of categories &#8212; which could in several respects work against class status &#8212; by narrowing the class. In both orders, the class definition excluded those arrested for drugs, weapons or violent felonies &#8212; categories for which automatic strip searches might seem easier to defend. <i>Nilsen,</i> 219 F.R.D. at 25; <i>Tardiff,</i> 218 F.R.D. at 336.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the defendants might still persuade the court that some within the remaining group of arrestees (<i>e.g.,</i> those arrested for misdemeanors of certain types) could also be strip searched as a matter of course. But the core notion that some classes of arrestees should not be strip searched without particularized suspicion is now embedded in the case law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Just what groups within the class can or cannot be searched without such suspicion appears, like the rule-policy-custom question, to present a common set of issues proper for a class action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the third of the issues we listed, defendants say that individualized suspicion may have existed as to <i>anyone</i> within the certified class, so that every class member necessarily presents a different problem even as to liability. True, a class member arrested for the most minor and non-violent of offenses might arguably warrant a strip search by his individual behavior (violently resisting arrest) or prior record (armed assaults). If such an individual evaluation were necessary in every case, this might doom an efficient class action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both district courts sought to finesse the issue by defining the class to include only those who were searched without <i>evaluation</i> for individualized suspicion. <i>Nilsen,</i> 219 F.R.D. at 25 (\"without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion\"); <i>Tardiff,</i> 218 F.R.D. at 336 (\"without evaluation for individualized reasonable suspicion\"). This is not a complete answer; for one thing, at some point in the case it could still be necessary to determine individually who among those who were searched were so evaluated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, even if all persons searched based on individual evaluations were readily excluded from the class regardless of the soundness of the evaluation, it might still be necessary &#8212; at least in some cases &#8212; to consider whether individualized suspicion <i>could have</i> justified a search. Even if overbroad categories were used, the defendants will likely argue that the result would have been the same for some class members even if proper individualized judgments had been made &#8212; raising a legal issue as to liability on which we offer no opinion. <i>Compare</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (2000) (Title VII's same decision defense as to damages). If the number of such instances was large, the feasibility of a class action might be compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without prejudging disputable issues, we think that such threats of undue complications as to liability are limited in this case. If there was in fact a rule, custom or policy of strip searching every arrestee or a substantially overlarge category, then it is a fair guess that most arrestees so classed were strip searched on this basis. There might yet be some number as to whom defensible individual judgments to strip search were actually made or could have been made &#8212; two different situations with different legal implications; but whoever has the burden of identifying such persons, they may well not be numerous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determinations to certify a class depend on initial prediction and are always subject to revision. <i>Gen.

If a large number of class members turn out to present non-common issues as to liability, the court may have to consider narrowing or de-certifying the class. <i>Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d at 297 n. 2. But a court can proceed based on its reasonable best guess as to what will happen and we share the district judges' apparent view that the individualized-suspicion issue will arise only in a limited number of cases, assuming always that plaintiffs can establish as a background fact the existence of an improperly broad strip search rule, policy or custom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the presence of damage claims does weigh against class status. In certain cases (<i>e.g.,</i> some security frauds), formula damages are generally used. <i>See</i> 3 Conte &amp; Newberg, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> &#167; 10:8 (4th ed.2002). Here each class member wrongly strip searched could in principle testify separately as to the circumstances, emotional damage, lost wages, medical treatment, doctor bills, and so on. Indeed, the less potent the available defense on liability, the more the class action might look like a bundle of individualized damage claims wholly unsuited for class resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the need for individualized damage decisions does not ordinarily defeat predominance where there are still disputed common issues as to liability. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40. If the class action resolved liability even as to some further narrowed class, this would be a legitimate function. At that point, the court would have further options, such as an agreement on modest uniform damages for those not claiming special injury, with masters to determine the (potentially few) serious claims to special injury. <i>E.g., In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></span> (S.D.Tex.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failing some practical solution allowing full resolution of all class damage claims in a single case, the court could enter a judgment of liability, leaving class members to pursue damage claims in separate law suits. <i>Smilow,</i> 323 F.3d at 40-41; <i>accord. Blihovde v. St. Croix County,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span>, 621 (W.D.Wis.2003); <i>Maneely v.

In addition, if and when liability is established and the remaining dispute is only the amount of damages, it is common experience that a great many claims settle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It remains to discuss the superiority <i>vel non</i> of the class action. The counties insist that individual law suits are feasible. We think that only the limited number of cases where serious damage ensued would ever be brought without class status and that the vast majority of claims would never be brought unless aggregated because provable actual damages are too small. This is a conventional argument for a class action, <i>Amchem Prods., Inc., v. Windsor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 617, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is enough for the superiority determination here that for most strip search claimants, class status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel aside), to establish liability and perhaps damages. <i>E.g., Blihovde,</i> 219 F.R.D. at 622; <i>Mack v.
