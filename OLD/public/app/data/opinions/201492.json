Plaintiff-Appellant Chelsea\n\nSmith (\"Chelsea\"), by and through her parents, Linda and Deane\n\nSmith (\"Chelsea's Parents\"),1 initiated a proceeding before the\n\nBureau of Special Education Appeals (\"BSEA\"), pursuant to the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1400 et seq., against the Fitchburg Public Schools (\"Fitchburg\")\n\nseeking home and hospital special education services.      After a\n\nseries of pre-hearing orders and ultimately a private settlement,\n\nChelsea received all of the relief sought.       Chelsea's Parents\n\nsubsequently commenced this action in the district court to recover\n\nattorneys' fees and expenses as a prevailing party pursuant to 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(3), which provides for an award of attorneys' fees\n\nto parents of a student with a disability who is the \"prevailing\n\nparty\" in an action or proceeding brought under the IDEA.        The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of Fitchburg on\n\nthe ground that Chelsea was not a \"prevailing party\" within the\n\nmeaning of Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598 (2001).   We\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Under the IDEA, it is the aggrieved child's parents who may\ninitiate a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f), and who\nmay seek attorneys' fees as prevailing parties in such a hearing\nunder 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3). For convenience, however, we use\n\"Chelsea\" and \"Chelsea's Parents\" interchangeably throughout the\nopinion.\n\n                               -2-\n\f                              I.   BACKGROUND\n\n             The material facts in this case are undisputed.             At the\n\ntime these proceedings were initiated, Chelsea was a thirteen-year-\n\nold girl living with her parents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and\n\nenrolled as a student at St. Joseph's School.                 When Chelsea was\n\ntwo, she was diagnosed with liver cancer and underwent extensive\n\ntreatment including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.                   As a\n\nresult of that treatment, she suffers from partial hearing loss and\n\nongoing      gastrointestinal,     respiratory,         and    other    serious\n\nimpairments.    She depends on hearing aids and classroom assistance\n\nbecause of her disability.\n\n             Chelsea attended the Fitchburg public schools from 1993\n\nto 1997, during which time Fitchburg provided special education\n\nservices consisting of speech and language therapy.                    In 1997,\n\nChelsea's Parents withdrew her from the public school and enrolled\n\nher in St. Joseph's School, a non-public, parochial school located\n\nin Fitchburg.    Fitchburg continued to provide Chelsea with special\n\neducation services at St. Joseph's.\n\n             In early 2001, Chelsea became ill due to complications\n\nfrom   her     earlier   treatment,       requiring      multiple      prolonged\n\nhospitalizations and surgeries.           As a result, Chelsea missed a\n\nsignificant     amount   of   school.       In   June    2001,    Chelsea    was\n\nhospitalized again, and, in August 2001, when it became clear that\n\nChelsea would be absent from school for an extended period of time,\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fher parents asked that the principal of St. Joseph's contact\n\nFitchburg's      special   education       department       to    request    special\n\neducation     services     for    Chelsea    while    she        was   hospitalized.\n\nFitchburg informed the principal that it was not required to\n\nprovide   such    services       because    Chelsea   was    a     regular   student\n\nenrolled in a non-public school.\n\n            In September 2001, Chelsea's Parents hired a private\n\ntutor to provide Chelsea with educational services while she was in\n\nthe hospital, and directed that the bills be sent directly to\n\nFitchburg.     Fitchburg refused to pay these bills.\n\n            As a result, on November 6, 2001, Chelsea's Parents filed\n\na request for an administrative hearing before the BSEA seeking an\n\norder requiring Fitchburg to: (1) pay for Chelsea's tutoring at\n\nhome and in the hospital; (2) convene an IEP meeting to address\n\nChelsea's special education needs;2 and (3) implement the resulting\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The terms \"TEAM meeting\" and \"IEP meeting\" are used\ninterchangeably.   Both terms refer to a meeting of a disabled\nchild's \"IEP Team\" which consists of \"(i) the parents of a child\nwith a disability; (ii) at least one regular education teacher of\nsuch child (if the child is, or may be, participating in the\nregular education environment); (iii) at least one special\neducation teacher . . . ; (iv) a representative of the local\neducational agency . . . ; (v) an individual who can interpret the\ninstructional implications of evaluation results, who may be a\nmember of the team described in clauses (ii) through (vi); (vi) .\n. . other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise\nregarding the child . . . ; and (vii) whenever appropriate, the\nchild with a disability.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fIEP.3       Chelsea was subsequently discharged from the hospital on\n\nNovember 11, 2001, although her medical condition prevented her\n\nfrom returning to school at that time. Because Fitchburg continued\n\nto refuse to provide special educational services for Chelsea,\n\nChelsea's Parents arranged for Chelsea to be tutored at home.\n\n              On December 4, 2001, the BSEA Hearing Officer initiated\n\na conference call with the parties, and at that time, Fitchburg\n\norally agreed to convene a TEAM meeting on December 12, 2001 to\n\nevaluate Chelsea's special education needs.     On December 12, 2001,\n\nbecause Fitchburg had not convened the TEAM meeting, Chelsea filed\n\na motion requesting that the BSEA Hearing Officer order Fitchburg\n\nto convene the meeting.      Fitchburg did not oppose the motion, and\n\non December 20, 2001, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued a ruling\n\ngranting Chelsea's motion, stating that \"Fitchburg will use its\n\nbest efforts to convene the TEAM on January 4, 2002 but in no event\n\nwill the TEAM be convened any later than January 11, 2002.\"       On\n\nJanuary 10, 2002, Fitchburg's counsel informed Chelsea's Parents\n\nthat the TEAM meeting would take place the next day.      Due to the\n\n\n        3\n      IEP is the abbreviation for an \"Individualized Education\nProgram,\" which is defined in the IDEA as \"a written statement for\neach child with a disability that is developed, reviewed, and\nrevised in accordance with this section and that includes-(i) a\nstatement of the child's present levels of educational performance\n. . .; (ii) a statement of measurable annual goals . . .; (iii) a\nstatement of the special education and related services and\nsupplementary aids and services to be provided to the child . . .;\n[and] (vi) the projected date for the beginning of the services .\n. . and the anticipated frequency, location, and duration of those\nservices . . . .\" 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fshort notice and conflicts with Chelsea's medical appointments, the\n\nTEAM meeting was rescheduled and eventually convened on January 18,\n\n2002.\n\n            As a result of the TEAM meeting, Fitchburg determined\n\nthat Chelsea was entitled to receive \"home/hospital education\n\nservices\"   despite    her    enrollment     in   a   private   school.    Soon\n\nthereafter, the parties, under the guidance of the BSEA Hearing\n\nOfficer, commenced negotiations for a settlement agreement to\n\ninclude home/hospital tutoring, reimbursement for prior tutoring\n\nexpenses, execution of the IEP, and payment of attorneys' fees.\n\nFollowing a BSEA Hearing Officer-initiated conference call, the\n\nHearing   Officer    issued    an   Order,    noting    that    the   \"[p]arties\n\nreported that they were discussing settlement,\" and confirming that\n\n\"School Counsel will send a written proposal for settlement by\n\nMarch 25, 2002 at 12:00 p.m.\"        The Hearing Officer also scheduled\n\na follow-up conference call for March 25, 2002 at 3:00 p.m.\n\n            Fitchburg sent a draft settlement agreement to Chelsea on\n\nMarch 21, 2002.     After the March 25, 2002 conference call, the BSEA\n\nHearing Officer issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should\n\nnot be dismissed in light of the parties' impending settlement. At\n\nthat time, however, Fitchburg had not yet provided Chelsea's\n\nParents with the proposed IEP4 and a signed copy of the settlement\n\n\n     4\n      The record shows that Chelsea's Parents were provided with a\nhandwritten draft of the IEP at the conclusion of the TEAM meeting\non January 18, 2002, however, at that time, Fitchburg indicated\n\n                                     -6-\n\fagreement.      Accordingly, Chelsea's counsel responded to the show\n\ncause order, requesting that the case remain active until Chelsea\n\nreceived the IEP and both parties had executed the settlement\n\nagreement.      On April 29, 2002, after another conference call, the\n\nBSEA Hearing Officer ordered Fitchburg to send Chelsea's Parents\n\nthe IEP by Thursday, May 9, 2002 at 3:00 p.m.5 and scheduled a\n\nconference call for Friday, May 10, 2002 to further discuss the\n\npending settlement.     That order stated that Fitchburg's failure to\n\nsend the IEP by May 10, 2002 would result in sanctions.            Fitchburg\n\nfaxed the IEP on May 9, 2002, but did not forward a signed copy of\n\nthe settlement agreement. During the May 10, 2002 conference call,\n\nFitchburg said that it would send Chelsea's Parents a copy of the\n\nsettlement agreement, and would review Chelsea's Parents' proposed\n\nchanges to the IEP.      Fitchburg's promises were again memorialized\n\nin an Order issued by the BSEA Hearing Officer that same day, and\n\na   follow-up    conference   call   was   scheduled   for   May   21,   2002.\n\nChelsea's Parents forwarded the proposed changes to the IEP on May\n\n14, 2002, and on May 20, 2002, sent a letter to Fitchburg's counsel\n\nnoting that they had not yet heard back from Fitchburg about the\n\n\n\n\nthat it would have to \"clean up\" the IEP, and Fitcbhurg's counsel\ndescribed this \"cleaning up\" as \"correct[ing] grammar, punctuation,\netc. and put[ting] the IEP into typewritten form.\"\n      5\n      The actual order says \"Thursday, May 2,\" although the parties\ndo not seem to dispute that the IEP was due on May 9, the day\nbefore the conference call scheduled for May 10.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fproposed changes, despite the fact that a conference call was\n\nscheduled for the next day.\n\n           On May 23, 2002, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued a second\n\nruling,   this   time   ordering,     under   threat   of    sanctions,   that\n\nFitchburg respond to Chelsea's Parents' proposed changes to the IEP\n\nno later than May 31, 2002.          The ruling also set up a conference\n\ncall for June 3, 2002.\n\n           During the June 3, 2002 conference call, the parties\n\ndiscussed and agreed upon several proposed changes to the IEP.              In\n\naddition, the parties acknowledged that it was time to convene\n\nanother TEAM meeting to discuss services for Chelsea during the\n\nsummer months.    In an order memorializing the conference call, the\n\nBSEA Hearing Officer stated that Fitchburg would send Chelsea's\n\nParents a copy of the settlement agreement and would execute the\n\nchanges to the IEP agreed upon in the conference call.              The order\n\nalso stated that by the next conference call, scheduled for June\n\n11, 2002, a date for the TEAM to reconvene would be set.\n\n           On    June   7,   2002,   Fitchburg   executed     the   settlement\n\nagreement and forwarded it to Chelsea's counsel.               Fitchburg did\n\nnot, however, send an executed IEP reflecting the changes agreed\n\nupon during the June 3, 2002 conference call.               On June 10, 2002,\n\nChelsea's counsel sent Fitchburg a letter stating that Chelsea had\n\nnot received the signed IEP.         On June 19, 2002, Chelsea's counsel\n\nsent the BSEA Hearing Officer a letter stating that Chelsea still\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhad not received the signed IEP.      On June 26, 2002, Chelsea's\n\ncounsel sent yet another letter to the BSEA Hearing Officer stating\n\nChelsea still had not received the signed IEP, and requesting a\n\nHearing Officer-initiated conference call to address Fitchburg's\n\nfailure to provide a signed copy of the IEP.\n\n          On July 2, 2002, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued an order\n\nrequiring Fitchburg to \"execute a signed IEP no later than July 5,\n\n2002.\"   The order stated that Fitchburg's failure to do so might\n\nresult in sanctions.   On July 16, 2002, Fitchburg sent Chelsea's\n\nParents a signed IEP, and Chelsea's Parents executed the settlement\n\nagreement that same day.   The settlement agreement provided, inter\n\nalia, that (1) Chelsea is a child in need of special education\n\nservices; (2) Fitchburg would reimburse Chelsea's Parents for\n\nChelsea's home/hospital tutoring expenses; (3) Chelsea's Parents\n\nwould withdraw with prejudice their request for a hearing before\n\nthe BSEA; (4) the settlement agreement did not constitute an\n\nadmission that the services previously proposed or implemented for\n\nChelsea were in any way inappropriate or inadequate; and (5) the\n\nAgreement did not release the claims of Chelsea's Parents against\n\nFitchburg for payment of their legal fees in connection with this\n\nmatter and that the Agreement did not, in any way, affect the\n\nParents' right to seek payment of their legal fees from Fitchburg\n\nin an appropriate forum.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f          After signing the settlement agreement, Chelsea's Parents\n\nwithdrew their request for a hearing.         The case was dismissed on\n\nJuly 17, 2002.    On August 15, 2002, Chelsea's Parents brought this\n\naction in the District Court of Massachusetts, alleging that\n\nChelsea was a \"prevailing party\" in a proceeding under the IDEA,\n\nand thus was entitled to attorneys' fees, expenses and costs\n\npursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B).            Chelsea's Parents also\n\nclaimed   they    were   entitled    to    fees   because   20    U.S.C.   §\n\n1415(i)(3)(D)(ii) provides that attorneys' fees may be awarded if\n\nan IEP meeting is \"convened as a result of an administrative\n\nproceeding.\" The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe district court allowed Fitchburg's motion for summary judgment,\n\nholding that \"[t]he ultimate settlement (rather than adjudication)\n\nof this case compels the denial of prevailing party status to\n\n[Chelsea].\"      Chelsea's motion for summary judgment was denied.\n\nChelsea's Parents filed this timely appeal.\n\n                            II.     DISCUSSION\n\n          The issue we must decide is whether the pre-hearing\n\norders that precipitated the final resolution of Chelsea's claim by\n\nprivate settlement, a few accompanied by the threat of sanctions,\n\nprovide   sufficient     judicial    imprimatur    to   make     Chelsea   a\n\n\"prevailing party\" for purposes of the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n\nBuckhannon.      We review this question of law de novo.            Doe v.\n\nBoston Pub. Sch., 358 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fA.          The IDEA and the Massachusetts Special Education Law\n\n            The IDEA was enacted \"to ensure that all children with\n\ndisabilities have available to them a free appropriate public\n\neducation . . . designed to meet their unique needs.\"            20 U.S.C §\n\n1400(d)(1)(A).6     In order to determine whether a child has a\n\ndisability for purposes of the IDEA, and to evaluate the particular\n\nneeds of that child if deemed eligible for special education\n\nservices, an IEP Team is to convene and prepare an IEP.               Id. §§\n\n1414(d)(1)(A) & (B).      In the event the state or local educational\n\nagencies do not follow this procedure, for example by not convening\n\nan IEP Team meeting when required, not preparing and implementing\n\nan IEP in a timely fashion, or not preparing an IEP that adequately\n\naddresses   the   needs   of   the   child,   the   IDEA   provides   certain\n\nprocedural safeguards, including the right to an impartial due\n\nprocess administrative hearing, see id. § 1415(f),7 and a right to\n\nappeal an adverse decision in that hearing to the federal district\n\ncourt, see id. § 1415(i)(2).          The IDEA also provides that the\n\nparents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party in\n\n\n     6\n      The Massachusetts Special Education Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n71B, implements the requirements of the IDEA.\n     7\n      20 U.S.C. § 1415(f) provides: \"Whenever a complaint has been\nreceived   [with   respect   to  any   matter   relating   to   the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child,\nor the provision of a free appropriate public education to such\nchild], the parents . . . involved in such complaint shall have an\nopportunity for an impartial due process hearing.\"               In\nMassachusetts, such hearings are conducted by the Bureau of Special\nEducation Appeals (\"BSEA\") by a BSEA hearing officer.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fsuch an administrative proceeding or law suit may recover, in the\n\ncourt's       discretion,      reasonable    attorneys'     fees.       Id.   §\n\n1415(i)(3)(B).\n\n              The award of attorneys' fees for a prevailing party under\n\nthe IDEA is subject to certain limitations, including one that\n\nprovides: \"Attorneys' fees may not be awarded relating to any\n\nmeeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as a result\n\nof an administrative proceeding or judicial action . . . \"                Id. §\n\n1415(i)(3)(D)(ii).          Chelsea's Parents contend that an award under\n\nthis       paragraph   is    not   subject   to   the     \"prevailing   party\"\n\nrequirements of the general IDEA provision dealing with the award\n\nof attorneys' fees, id. § 1415(i)(3)(B)(i).             We disagree.    Section\n\n1415(i)(3)(B) of Title 20 clearly provides that the prevailing\n\nparty requirement applies to \"any action or proceeding brought\n\nunder this section.\" (Emphasis added.).           This \"section\" refers to\n\n\"section 1415,\" and includes all administrative and civil actions\n\nbrought under the IDEA.\n\nB.            Buckhannon and the \"Prevailing Party\" Requirement\n\n              To evaluate whether a party is a \"prevailing party\" for\n\npurposes of the IDEA, we are guided by the Supreme Court's decision\n\nin Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department\n\nof Health & Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598 (2001).8               See Doe, 358\n\n\n       8\n      Although the issue in Buckhannon was the fee-shifting\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §\n3601 et seq., and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42\n\n                                      -12-\n\fF.3d at 29-30 (holding that Buckhannon applies to the fee-shifting\n\nprovision of the IDEA). In Buckhannon, the Supreme Court held that\n\nfor   a   party   to   be    considered    \"prevailing,\"     there    must   be   a\n\n\"material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,\"\n\n532 U.S. at 604 (quotation omitted), and there must be \"judicial\n\nimprimatur on the change.\"         Id. at 605 (emphasis in original).9\n\n      The Buckhannon Court went on to state that a \"defendant's\n\nvoluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what\n\nthe plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary\n\njudicial imprimatur.\"         Id. (emphasis in original).       The Court then\n\nnoted that it had \"only awarded attorneys' fees where the plaintiff\n\nha[d] received a judgment on the merits or obtained a court-ordered\n\nconsent decree.\"       Id.    By contrast, the Court stated that it had\n\nnot awarded attorneys' fees \"where the plaintiff ha[d] secured the\n\nreversal    of    a    directed     verdict,     or   acquired       a    judicial\n\npronouncement that the defendant ha[d] violated the Constitution\n\nunaccompanied by 'judicial relief.'\"            Id. at 605-06 (emphasis in\n\noriginal)    (internal       citation     omitted).

Cases Interpreting Buckhannon\n\n            There is disagreement among our sister circuits whether\n\nthe Supreme Court intended \"judgments on the merits\" and \"consent\n\ndecrees\" to be the only forms of success conferring prevailing\n\nparty status, or whether these two forms are mere examples of the\n\ntypes of relief that can confer such status.         Compare Christina A.\n\nv. Bloomberg, 315 F.3d 990, 993 (8th Cir. 2003) (stating that\n\n\"Buckhannon . . . makes it clear that a party prevails only if it\n\nreceives either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent\n\ndecree.\"), with Pres. Coalition v. Fed. Transit Admin., 356 F.3d\n\n444, 452 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that \"Buckhannon does not limit\n\nfee awards to enforceable judgments on the merits or to consent\n\ndecrees\"); see also T.D. v. La Grange Sch. Dist. No. 102, 349 F.3d\n\n469, 479-80 (7th Cir. 2003) (implicitly holding that \"prevailing\n\nparty\" status under Buckhannon is not limited to judgments on the\n\nmerits and consent decrees in finding a party was \"prevailing\"\n\nafter it obtained a court-ordered case-study evaluation under the\n\nIDEA despite ultimately resolving the case by private settlement);\n\nSmyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268, 281 (4th Cir. 2002) (implicitly\n\nholding that fee awards are not limited to enforceable judgments on\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthe merits and to consent decrees in finding that \"an order\n\ncontaining an agreement reached by the parties may be functionally\n\na consent decree for purposes of [Buckhannon], even if not entitled\n\nas such\").\n\n          In this circuit, we have not squarely addressed whether\n\njudgments on the merits or consent decrees are the only forms of\n\nrelief sufficient to confer prevailing party status, whether a\n\nfunctional equivalent of such relief may be adequate, or whether\n\nany other types of relief could satisfy Buckhannon's requirements.\n\nIn a case decided after Buckhannon, but expressly not deciding\n\nwhether Buckhannon applied to the fee-shifting provisions of the\n\nIDEA, we awarded fees to a party who had successfully fended-off a\n\nmotion for a temporary restraining order, noting that \"the denial\n\nof the School District's motion [for a TRO] was effectively a final\n\njudgment on the merits on [one of the School District's claims].\"\n\nMe. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. & Mrs. R., 321 F.3d 9, 16-17\n\nn.6 (1st Cir. 2003).       Subsequently, in Doe, in holding that\n\nBuckhannon indeed did apply to the fee-shifting provisions of the\n\nIDEA, and thus barred recovery for fees following a purely private\n\nsettlement, we took \"no position on whether forms of judicial\n\nimprimatur other than a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered\n\nconsent decree may suffice to ground an award of attorneys' fees.\"\n\nDoe, 358 F.3d at 24 n.4.\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f            Here, Chelsea's Parents did not obtain a final judgment\n\non the merits, and their private settlement was not incorporated\n\ninto a consent decree.    Thus, Chelsea's Parents do not satisfy the\n\nrequirements of a narrow reading of Buckhannon.         See Christina A.,\n\n315 F.3d at 993 (holding that a party need obtain either a consent\n\ndecree or a final judgment on the merits to be deemed a \"prevailing\n\nparty\" under Buckhannon).      Furthermore, we need not decide today\n\nwhether a party could prevail under Buckhannon in the absence of a\n\nconsent decree or a final judgment on the merits, because, as we\n\nwill discuss below, neither the interlocutory orders and rulings,\n\nnor the final order dismissing the case provide the necessary\n\njudicial imprimatur on the change in the legal relationship between\n\nthe parties.   See Buckhannon, 532 U.S. 604-05.        Lastly, we need not\n\nrule out the possibility that an egregious case of foot-dragging\n\nterminated by a judicial or quasi-judicial procedural order may be\n\nsufficient to confer prevailing party status under Buckhannon,\n\nbecause the    record   does   not   reveal   that   Fitchburg   was   being\n\nwillfully obstructionist.\n\n            In one line of cases applying an expansive reading of\n\nBuckhannon, courts have held that \"[w]here a settlement agreement\n\nis embodied in a court order such that the obligation to comply\n\nwith its terms is court-ordered, the court's approval and the\n\nattendant    judicial   over-sight      (in   the    form   of   continuing\n\njurisdiction to enforce the agreement) may be equally apparent,\"\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fsuch that an order containing the agreement \"may be functionally a\n\nconsent decree for purposes of [Buckhannon], even if not entitled\n\nas such.\"   Smyth, 282 F.3d at 281; see T.D., 349 F.3d at 478 (\"We\n\nagree with the Fourth Circuit's recent conclusion [in Smyth] that\n\nsome settlement agreements, even though not explicitly labeled as\n\na 'consent decree' may confer 'prevailing party' status, if they\n\nare sufficiently analogous to a consent decree.\"); John T. v. Del.\n\nCounty Intermediate Unit, 318 F.3d 545, 558 (3d Cir. 2003) (stating\n\nthat \"a stipulated settlement could confer prevailing party status\n\n. . . . where it (1) contained mandatory language, (2) was entitled\n\n'Order,' (3) bore the signature of the District Court judge, not\n\nthe parties' counsel, and (4) provided for judicial enforcement\")\n\n(emphasis and citation omitted); see also Smyth, 282 F.3d at 281\n\n(\"We doubt that the Supreme Court's guidance in Buckhannon was\n\nintended to be interpreted so restrictively as to require that the\n\nwords 'consent decree' be used explicitly.\").   For an order to be\n\nconsidered the functional equivalent of a consent decree, however,\n\n\"[t]he obligation to comply with a settlement's terms must be\n\nexpressly made part of a court's order for jurisdiction to enforce\n\nthe settlement after dismissal of the action to exist.\" Smyth, 282\n\nF.3d at 283; see Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511\n\nU.S. 375, 381 (1994) (\"The judge's mere awareness and approval of\n\nthe terms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make them\n\na part of his order.\"). Thus, \"[e]ither incorporation of the terms\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fof the agreement or a separate provision retaining jurisdiction\n\nover the agreement will suffice for this purpose.\" Smyth, 282 F.3d\n\nat 283.   In contrast, \"[w]here a court merely recognizes the fact\n\nof the parties' agreement and dismisses the case because there is\n\nno longer a dispute before it, the terms of the agreement are not\n\nmade part of the order and consequently will not serve as a basis\n\nof jurisdiction.\"   Id.\n\n          Here, Chelsea does not argue that the order dismissing\n\nher case is the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and thus\n\nwe deem that argument waived.    See, e.g., Smilow v. Southwestern\n\nBell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Issues\n\nraised on appeal in a perfunctory manner (or not at all) are\n\nwaived.\").10\n\n          A second line of cases espousing an expansive reading of\n\nBuckhannon has developed, holding that the relief obtained by one\n\nparty satisfied the requirements of Buckhannon, even though the\n\nparty \"prevailing\" on that one issue ultimately lost in the final\n\njudgment or entered into a private settlement agreement for the\n\nremaining claims.   Essential to each of these cases is the judge's\n\nsubstantive involvement providing the necessary judicial imprimatur\n\non the change in the legal relationship between the parties.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      We note that neither party included a copy of the order of\ndismissal by the BSEA in the record before the district court.\n\n                                -18-\n\f               In T.D. v. La Grange School District Number 102, 349 F.3d\n\nat 480, the Seventh Circuit held that even though the parties\n\nultimately entered into a private settlement (that was not embodied\n\nin   a   court        order),    the   parents    were    \"prevailing\"     in     an\n\nadministrative         hearing   for   purposes    of    Buckhannon    when     they\n\nsuccessfully convinced the hearing officer to order the school\n\ndistrict to conduct a case-study evaluation to determine their\n\nchild's eligibility for benefits under the IDEA.                      The Seventh\n\nCircuit, reversing in part the decision of the district court, held\n\nthat the parents were eligible for an award of attorneys' fees for\n\n\"prevailing\" in the administrative hearing, but not for the time\n\nspent in negotiations for the final settlement.                Id.    The Seventh\n\nCircuit stated that the determination that the child was eligible\n\nfor IDEA benefits as a result of the court-ordered case-study\n\nevaluation \"represented some success for T.D. because prior to his\n\nrequest for the due process hearing the school had not acknowledged\n\nthat T.D. was even eligible for IDEA benefits.\"                  Id.     Thus, a\n\nmaterial alteration in the legal relationship between the parties\n\n(that    is,    the    school    district's    determination    that    T.D.    was\n\neligible for special education services), was effected by the\n\nhearing officer's order (after a review of the merits that the\n\nschool district was legally required to conduct a case-study\n\nevaluation), which provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on\n\nT.D.'s relief.         See id.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f             Similarly, the Second Circuit in Preservation Coalition\n\nof Erie County v. Federal Transit Administration, 356 F.3d at 452,\n\nheld that     a    party     was   \"prevailing\"     under   Buckhannon when          it\n\nsuccessfully convinced the district court to order the defendants\n\nto prepare a new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS)\n\nunder threat        of    injunctive    relief,     even   though    the   case   was\n\nultimately    resolved        by   a   settlement    agreement      embodied    in   a\n\nStipulation and Order.11 After determining that the Stipulation and\n\nOrder was \"functionally a private settlement agreement,\" the court\n\nconcluded that \"appellee obtained prevailing party status under\n\nBuckhannon when it obtained a court order requiring appellants to\n\nprepare a SEIS under threat of further injunctive relief.\"                     Id. at\n\n451, 452.         This was because \"[t]he SEIS was both judicially\n\nsanctioned and effectuated a substantive, material alteration in\n\nthe legal relationship of the parties.\"                Id. at 452 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).        And, as the Second Circuit noted, \"[a]lthough the\n\ndistrict court declined to issue an injunction, it found the [Final\n\nEnvironmental       Impact     Statement]       inadequate\"    and    ordered     the\n\ndefendants     to        prepare   a   [Supplemental       Environmental       Impact\n\n\n\n     11\n       Preservation Coalition involved the fee-shifting provision\nof the National Environmental Policy Act, which allows fee awards\nto a party who \"substantially prevails\" in an action to enforce its\nprovisions.     The Second Circuit has held that \"the terms\n'prevailing party' and 'substantially prevails' are fundamentally\nthe same for purposes of determining whether a plaintiff can\nrecover under a fee-shifting statute,\" and thus Buckhannon applies.\nPres. Coalition, 356 F.3d at 450 n.3.\n\n                                         -20-\n\fStatement].\"        Id. at 448.          Thus, the judge's substantive order\n\neffected a material alteration in the legal relationship between\n\nthe parties.\n\n              In    Maine    School      Administrative          District     Number    35,\n\nalthough not directly applying Buckhannon, we followed similar\n\nreasoning in holding that parents who successfully defended against\n\na school district's attempt to change their child's placement were\n\nprevailing parties and thus entitled to attorneys' fees under the\n\nIDEA.    See 321 F.3d at 17.             We noted that \"[b]ecause the district\n\ncourt denied        injunctive         relief    on    the   basis     that    the   School\n\nDistrict had not adduced sufficient proof to satisfy the [standard\n\nfor changing the student's placement], it [was] readily evident\n\nthat    the   appellants         successfully         defended      [the   original     suit\n\nbrought against the parents to keep their child out of the school\n\nbecause the school district thought the child was dangerous] on the\n\nmerits.\"      Id.    Thus, the district judge's substantive ruling was\n\nthe cause of a material alteration in the legal relationship\n\nbetween the parties.\n\nD.            Applying Buckhannon to Chelsea's Case\n\n              We begin our application of the law to the facts of\n\nChelsea's case with the obvious--the relief obtained by Chelsea at\n\nthe administrative level was not in the form of a consent decree or\n\na    final    judgment      on   the     merits,      and    thus    does     not    warrant\n\nattorneys'      fees     under     a    narrow    reading      of    Buckhannon.        See\n\n\n                                           -21-\n\fChristina A., 315 F.3d at 993 (holding that a party need obtain\n\neither a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits to be\n\ndeemed a \"prevailing party\" under Buckhannon). Chelsea wisely does\n\nnot argue as such.    But, our inquiry does not end there.            As we\n\nhave not decided in this circuit whether to adopt a narrow or broad\n\nreading of Buckhannon, we do not foreclose the possibility of a\n\nbroad reading, and look to determine whether Chelsea's relief, even\n\nthough not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on\n\nthe   merits,   comports    with    the    overarching     requirements   of\n\nBuckhannon; that is, whether the involvement of the BSEA Hearing\n\nOfficer provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on a material\n\nalteration of the legal relationship between the parties.                 See\n\nBuckhannon, 532 U.S. at 604-05.       We thus first identify the change\n\nin the legal relationship between Chelsea and Fitchburg, and then\n\nask whether that change was effected by the judicial actions of the\n\nBSEA Hearing Officer.\n\n1.          The Change in the Legal Relationship\n\n            As a result of her initiation of proceedings against\n\nFitchburg, Chelsea did receive all of the relief she requested. In\n\nChelsea's   complaint,     she   initially   sought   an   order   requiring\n\nFitchburg to: (1) pay for Chelsea's tutoring at home and in the\n\nhospital; (2) convene an IEP meeting to address Chelsea's special\n\neducation needs; and (3) implement the IEP.           By the time the case\n\nwas dismissed by the BSEA Hearing Officer, Fitchburg agreed to do\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\feverything requested. Thus, there was a material alteration in the\n\nlegal     relationship   between    Chelsea      and   Fitchburg.     Under\n\nBuckhannon, however, that is not enough to justify an award of\n\nattorneys' fees; there must be judicial imprimatur on that change.\n\nSee 532 U.S. 604-05.\n\n2.          The Involvement of the BSEA Hearing Officer\n\n            The judicial involvement in this case came in the form of\n\na series of orders and rulings by the BSEA Hearing Officer that\n\nmemorialized    the   voluntary    concessions    made   by   Fitchburg   and\n\nattempted to keep the settlement process moving forward in a timely\n\nmanner.12    At the time the orders were imposed, the BSEA Hearing\n\nOfficer had not yet joined issue on the question of Chelsea's\n\nsubstantive entitlement to an IEP because the BSEA Hearing Officer\n\nhad not yet convened a due process hearing.            The issue before the\n\nBSEA Hearing Officer at the time of her orders and rulings was\n\nsimply whether she should continue to promote settlement efforts\n\nor, instead, take immediate action on the parents' request for a\n\ndue process hearing under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f).            Thus, it appears\n\nfrom the record that the BSEA Hearing Officer's orders and rulings\n\nwere issued to justify the BSEA Hearing Officer's implicit decision\n\n\n\n     12\n      Chelsea does not seriously contend that there was judicial\nimprimatur on Fitchburg's decision to reimburse her parents for\nprior tutoring at home and in the hospital, part of the relief she\nreceived as a result of the settlement agreement.        Thus, we\nappropriately limit our discussion to whether there was judicial\nimprimatur on Fitchburg's convening of the IEP meeting.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fto delay the due process hearing in favor of private settlement,\n\nnot to place the weight of judicial authority behind Fitchburg's\n\nsubstantive concession that Chelsea was entitled to an IEP.\n\n            To be sure, standing alone, the BSEA Hearing Officer's\n\nDecember 20, 2001 ruling requiring Fitchburg to convene a IEP\n\nmeeting \"in no event . . . later than January 11, 2002\" might be\n\nviewed as an order, similar to the order in T.D., 349 F.3d at 480,\n\ncompelling Fitchburg to convene an IEP meeting because the Hearing\n\nOfficer determined Fitchburg was legally required to do so under\n\nthe IDEA.     A closer look at the record, however, reveals that this\n\nwas merely a ruling memorializing a substantive concession by\n\nFitchburg and an effort to keep pre-hearing settlement negotiations\n\nmoving forward.      Without being compelled to do so by the BSEA\n\nHearing Officer, Fitchburg had orally (and voluntarily) agreed to\n\nconvene an IEP meeting on December 12, 2001 during the December 4,\n\n2001   BSEA    Hearing    Officer-initiated    conference   call.   When\n\nFitchburg failed to convene the meeting on December 12, Chelsea\n\nfiled a motion requesting that the BSEA Hearing Officer order\n\nFitchburg to convene the meeting. Significantly, Fitchburg did not\n\noppose the motion.       Thus, when the BSEA Hearing Officer issued its\n\nruling stating that \"Fitchburg will use its best efforts to convene\n\nthe TEAM on January 4, 2002 but in no event . . . any later than\n\nJanuary 11, 2002,\" the officer was mandating that Fitchburg convene\n\na TEAM meeting by a specified date.        The BSEA Hearing Officer never\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\freviewed the merits of whether Fitchburg was required under the\n\nIDEA to convene the IEP meeting; the Hearing Officer only was\n\nrequiring Fitchburg to follow through with what Fitchburg had\n\nalready voluntarily promised to do.\n\n             Lastly, we note that in this case, the BSEA Hearing\n\nOfficer can be described as being simply efficient and business-\n\nlike, forcing Fitchburg to move more rapidly.           It is not clear from\n\nthe record that Fitchburg was being willfully obstructionist. And,\n\nat no point did Fitchburg refuse to comply with an order of the\n\nBSEA Hearing Officer, nor was the Hearing Officer ever compelled to\n\nmake good on her threats of sanctions against Fitchburg.               Thus, we\n\nneed   not   today   foreclose      the   possibility   that    such   judicial\n\nintervention in a clearer, or more extreme, case might justify an\n\naward of attorneys' fees under Buckhannon.\n\n                             III.     CONCLUSION\n\n             The pre-hearing orders that hastened the final resolution\n\nof Chelsea's claim by private settlement did not provide sufficient\n\njudicial imprimatur on Chelsea's relief to make her a \"prevailing\n\nparty\" under Buckhannon.         The district court was correct to deny\n\nChelsea attorneys' fees under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B), and, as\n\nthe prevailing party standard announced in Buckhannon also applies\n\nto an award of fees pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii),\n\nChelsea's    claim   under   that    subparagraph   fails      as   well.   The\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fdistrict court's orders, granting summary judgment to Fitchburg and\n\ndenying Chelsea's motion for summary judgment, are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f",

Chelsea's Parents subsequently commenced this action in the district court to recover attorneys' fees and expenses as a prevailing party pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3), which provides for an award of attorneys' fees to parents of a student with a disability who is the \"prevailing party\" in an action or proceeding brought under the IDEA. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Fitchburg on the ground that Chelsea was not a \"prevailing party\" within the meaning of <i>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources,</i> 532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts in this case are undisputed. At the time these proceedings were initiated, Chelsea was a thirteen-year-old girl living with her parents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and enrolled as a student at St. Joseph's School. When Chelsea was two, she was diagnosed with liver cancer and underwent extensive treatment including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. As a result of that treatment, she suffers from partial hearing loss and ongoing gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other serious impairments. She depends on hearing aids and classroom assistance because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chelsea attended the Fitchburg public schools from 1993 to 1997, during which time Fitchburg provided special education services consisting of speech and language therapy. In 1997, Chelsea's Parents withdrew her from the public school and enrolled her in St. Joseph's School, a non-public, parochial school located in Fitchburg. Fitchburg continued to provide Chelsea with special education services at St. Joseph's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, Chelsea became ill due to complications from her earlier treatment, requiring multiple prolonged hospitalizations and surgeries. As a result, Chelsea missed a significant amount of school. In June 2001, Chelsea was hospitalized again, and, in August 2001, when it became clear that Chelsea would be absent from school for an extended period of time, her parents asked that the principal of St. Joseph's contact Fitchburg's special education department to request special education services for Chelsea while she was hospitalized. Fitchburg informed the principal that it was not required to provide such services because Chelsea was a regular student enrolled in a non-public school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2001, Chelsea's Parents hired a private tutor to provide Chelsea with educational services while she was in the hospital, and directed that the bills be sent directly to Fitchburg. Fitchburg refused to pay these bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, on November 6, 2001, Chelsea's Parents filed a request for an administrative hearing before the BSEA seeking an order requiring Fitchburg to: (1) pay for Chelsea's tutoring at home and in the hospital; (2) convene an IEP meeting to address Chelsea's special education needs;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (3) implement the resulting IEP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Chelsea was subsequently discharged from the hospital on November 11, 2001, although her medical condition prevented her from returning to school at that time. Because Fitchburg continued to refuse to provide special educational services for Chelsea, Chelsea's Parents arranged for Chelsea to be tutored at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2001, the BSEA Hearing Officer initiated a conference call with the parties, and at that time, Fitchburg orally agreed to convene a TEAM meeting on December 12, 2001 to evaluate Chelsea's special education needs. On December 12, 2001, because Fitchburg had not convened the TEAM meeting, Chelsea filed a motion requesting that the BSEA Hearing Officer order Fitchburg to convene the meeting. Fitchburg did not oppose the motion, and on December 20, 2001, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued a ruling granting Chelsea's motion, stating that \"Fitchburg will use its best efforts to convene the TEAM on January 4, 2002 but in no event will the TEAM be convened any later than <i>January 11, 2002.</i>\" On January 10, 2002, Fitchburg's counsel informed Chelsea's Parents that the TEAM meeting would take place the next day. Due to the short notice and conflicts with Chelsea's medical appointments, the TEAM meeting was rescheduled and eventually convened on January 18, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the TEAM meeting, Fitchburg determined that Chelsea was entitled to receive \"home/hospital education services\" despite her enrollment in a private school. Soon thereafter, the parties, under the guidance of the BSEA Hearing Officer, commenced negotiations for a settlement agreement to include home/hospital tutoring, reimbursement for prior tutoring expenses, execution of the IEP, and payment of attorneys' fees. Following a BSEA Hearing Officer-initiated conference call, the Hearing Officer issued an Order, noting that the \"[p]arties reported that they were discussing settlement,\" and confirming that \"School Counsel will send a written proposal for settlement by March 25, 2002 at 12:00 p.m.\" The Hearing Officer also scheduled a follow-up conference call for March 25, 2002 at 3:00 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitchburg sent a draft settlement agreement to Chelsea on March 21, 2002. After the March 25, 2002 conference call, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed in light of the parties' impending settlement. At that time, however, Fitchburg had not yet provided Chelsea's Parents with the proposed IEP<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and a signed copy of the settlement agreement. Accordingly, Chelsea's counsel responded to the show cause order, requesting that the case remain active until Chelsea received the IEP and both parties had executed the settlement agreement. On April 29, 2002, after another conference call, the BSEA Hearing Officer ordered Fitchburg to send Chelsea's Parents the IEP by Thursday, May 9, 2002 at 3:00 p.m.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and scheduled a conference call for Friday, May 10, 2002 to further discuss the pending settlement. That order stated that Fitchburg's failure to send the IEP by May 10, 2002 would result in sanctions. Fitchburg faxed the IEP on May 9, 2002, but did not forward a signed copy of the settlement agreement. During the May 10, 2002 conference call, Fitchburg said that it would send Chelsea's Parents a copy of the settlement agreement, and would review Chelsea's Parents' proposed changes to the IEP. Fitchburg's promises were again memorialized in an Order issued by the BSEA Hearing Officer that same day, and a follow-up conference call was scheduled for May 21, 2002. Chelsea's Parents forwarded the proposed changes to the IEP on May 14, 2002, and on May 20, 2002, sent a letter to Fitchburg's counsel noting that they had not yet heard back from Fitchburg about the proposed changes, despite the fact that a conference call was scheduled for the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2002, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued a second ruling, this time ordering, under threat of sanctions, that Fitchburg respond to Chelsea's Parents' proposed changes to the IEP no later than May 31, 2002. The ruling also set up a conference call for June 3, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the June 3, 2002 conference call, the parties discussed and agreed upon several proposed changes to the IEP. In addition, the parties acknowledged that it was time to convene another TEAM meeting to discuss services for Chelsea during the summer months. In an order memorializing the conference call, the BSEA Hearing Officer stated that Fitchburg would send Chelsea's Parents a copy of the settlement agreement and would execute the changes to the IEP agreed upon in the conference call. The order also stated that by the next conference call, scheduled for June 11, 2002, a date for the TEAM to reconvene would be set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 7, 2002, Fitchburg executed the settlement agreement and forwarded it to Chelsea's counsel. Fitchburg did not, however, send an executed IEP reflecting the changes agreed upon during the June 3, 2002 conference call. On June 10, 2002, Chelsea's counsel sent Fitchburg a letter stating that Chelsea had not received the signed IEP. On June 19, 2002, Chelsea's counsel sent the BSEA Hearing Officer a letter stating that Chelsea still had not received the signed IEP. On June 26, 2002, Chelsea's counsel sent yet another letter to the BSEA Hearing Officer stating Chelsea still had not received the signed IEP, and requesting a Hearing Officer-initiated conference call to address Fitchburg's failure to provide a signed copy of the IEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 2002, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued an order requiring Fitchburg to \"execute a signed IEP no later than July 5, 2002.\" The order stated that Fitchburg's failure to do so might result in sanctions. On July 16, 2002, Fitchburg sent Chelsea's Parents a signed IEP, and Chelsea's Parents executed the settlement agreement that same day. The settlement agreement provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that (1) Chelsea is a child in need of special education services; (2) Fitchburg would reimburse Chelsea's Parents for Chelsea's home/hospital tutoring expenses; (3) Chelsea's Parents would withdraw with prejudice their request for a hearing before the BSEA; (4) the settlement agreement did not constitute an admission that the services previously proposed or implemented for Chelsea were in any way inappropriate or inadequate; and (5) the Agreement did not release the claims of Chelsea's Parents against Fitchburg for payment of their legal fees in connection with this matter and that the Agreement did not, in any way, affect the Parents' right to seek payment of their legal fees from Fitchburg in an appropriate forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After signing the settlement agreement, Chelsea's Parents withdrew their request for a hearing. The case was dismissed on July 17, 2002. On August 15, 2002, Chelsea's Parents brought this action in the District Court of Massachusetts, alleging that Chelsea was a \"prevailing party\" in a proceeding under the IDEA, and thus was entitled to attorneys' fees, expenses and costs pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(B). Chelsea's Parents also claimed they were entitled to fees because 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii) provides that attorneys' fees may be awarded if an IEP meeting is \"convened as a result of an administrative proceeding.\" The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court allowed Fitchburg's motion for summary judgment, holding that \"[t]he ultimate settlement (rather than adjudication) of this case compels the denial of prevailing party status to [Chelsea].\" Chelsea's motion for summary judgment was denied. Chelsea's Parents filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue we must decide is whether the pre-hearing orders that precipitated the final resolution of Chelsea's claim by private settlement, a few accompanied by the threat of sanctions, provide sufficient judicial imprimatur to make Chelsea a \"prevailing party\" for purposes of the Supreme Court's reasoning in <i>Buckhannon.</i> We review this question of law <i>de novo.

In the event the state or local educational agencies do not follow this procedure, for example by not convening an IEP Team meeting when required, not preparing and implementing an IEP in a timely fashion, or not preparing an IEP that adequately addresses the needs of the child, the IDEA provides certain procedural safeguards, including the right to an impartial due process administrative hearing, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1415(f),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and a right to appeal an adverse decision in that hearing to the federal district court, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also provides that the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party in such an administrative proceeding or law suit may recover, in the court's discretion, reasonable attorneys' fees. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1415(i)(3)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The award of attorneys' fees for a prevailing party under the IDEA is subject to certain limitations, including one that provides: \"Attorneys' fees may not be awarded relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as a result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action...\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii). Chelsea's Parents contend that an award under this paragraph is not subject to the \"prevailing party\" requirements of the general IDEA provision dealing with the award of attorneys' fees, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1415(i)(3)(B)(i). We disagree. Section 1415(i)(3)(B) of Title 20 clearly provides that the prevailing party requirement applies to \"<i>any</i> action or proceeding brought under this <i>section.</i>\" (Emphasis added.). This \"section\" refers to \"section 1415,\" and includes all administrative and civil actions brought under the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Buckhannon and the \"Prevailing Party\" Requirement</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To evaluate whether a party is a \"prevailing party\" for purposes of the IDEA, we are guided by the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc. v.

Bloomberg,</i> 315 F.3d 990, 993 (8th Cir.2003) (stating that \"<i>Buckhannon</i> ... makes it clear that a party prevails only if it receives either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent decree.\"), <i>with Pres. Coalition v. Fed. Transit Admin.,</i> 356 F.3d 444, 452 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that \"<i>Buckhannon</i> does not limit fee awards to enforceable judgments on the merits or to consent decrees\"); <i>see also T.D. v. La Grange Sch. Dist. No. 102,</i> 349 F.3d 469, 479-80 (7th Cir.2003) (implicitly holding that \"prevailing party\" status under <i>Buckhannon</i> is not limited to judgments on the merits and consent decrees in finding a party was \"prevailing\" after it obtained a court-ordered case-study evaluation under the IDEA despite ultimately resolving the case by private settlement); <i>Smyth v. Rivero,</i> 282 F.3d 268, 281 (4th Cir.2002) (implicitly holding that fee awards are not limited to enforceable judgments on the merits and to consent decrees in finding that \"an order containing an agreement reached by the parties may be functionally a consent decree for purposes of [<i>Buckhannon</i>], even if not entitled as such\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, we have not squarely addressed whether judgments on the merits or consent decrees are the only forms of relief sufficient to confer prevailing party status, whether a functional equivalent of such relief may be adequate, or whether any other types of relief could satisfy <i>Buckhannon's</i> requirements. In a case decided after <i>Buckhannon,</i> but expressly not deciding whether <i>Buckhannon</i> applied to the fee-shifting provisions of the IDEA, we awarded fees to a party who had successfully fended-off a motion for a temporary restraining order, noting that \"the denial of the School District's motion [for a TRO] was effectively a final judgment on the merits on [one of the School District's claims].\" <i>Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 35 v. Mr. &amp; Mrs. R.,</i> 321 F.3d 9, 16-17 n. 6 (1st Cir.2003). Subsequently, in <i>Doe,</i> in holding that <i>Buckhannon</i> indeed did apply to the fee-shifting provisions of the IDEA, and thus barred recovery for fees following a purely private settlement, we took \"no position on whether forms of judicial imprimatur other than a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree may suffice to ground an award of attorneys' fees.\" <i>Doe,</i> 358 F.3d at 24 n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Chelsea's Parents did not obtain a final judgment on the merits, and their private settlement was not incorporated into a consent decree. Thus, Chelsea's Parents do not satisfy the requirements of a narrow reading of <i>Buckhannon. See Christina A.,</i> 315 F.3d at 993 (holding that a party need obtain either a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits to be deemed a \"prevailing party\" under <i>Buckhannon</i>). Furthermore, we need not decide today whether a party could prevail under <i>Buckhannon</i> in the absence of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, because, as we will discuss below, neither the interlocutory orders and rulings, nor the final order dismissing the case provide the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change in the legal relationship between the parties. <i>See Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604-05, 121 S.Ct. 1835. Lastly, we need not rule out the possibility that an egregious case of foot-dragging terminated by a judicial or quasi-judicial procedural order may be sufficient to confer prevailing party status under <i>Buckhannon,</i> because the record does not reveal that Fitchburg was being willfully obstructionist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In one line of cases applying an expansive reading of <i>Buckhannon,</i> courts have held that \"[w]here a settlement agreement is embodied in a court order such that the obligation to comply with its terms is court-ordered, the court's approval and the attendant judicial over-sight (in the form of continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement) may be equally apparent,\" such that an order containing the agreement \"may be functionally a consent decree for purposes of [<i>Buckhannon</i>], even if not entitled as such.\" <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 281; <i>see T.D.,</i> 349 F.3d at 478 (\"We agree with the Fourth Circuit's recent conclusion [in <i>Smyth</i>] that some settlement agreements, even though not explicitly labeled as a `consent decree' may confer `prevailing party' status, if they are sufficiently analogous to a consent decree.\"); <i>John T. v.

For an order to be considered the functional equivalent of a consent decree, however, \"[t]he obligation to comply with a settlement's terms must be expressly made part of a court's order for jurisdiction to enforce the settlement after dismissal of the action to exist.\" <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 283; <i>see Kokkonen v.

Thus, \"[e]ither incorporation of the terms of the agreement or a separate provision retaining jurisdiction over the agreement will suffice for this purpose.\" <i>Smyth,</i> 282 F.3d at 283. In contrast, \"[w]here a court merely recognizes the fact of the parties' agreement and dismisses the case because there is no longer a dispute before it, the terms of the agreement are not made part of the order and consequently will not serve as a basis of jurisdiction.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Chelsea does not argue that the order dismissing her case is the functional equivalent of a consent decree, and thus we deem that argument waived. <i>See, e.g., Smilow v.

The Seventh Circuit, reversing in part the decision of the district court, held that the parents were eligible for an award of attorneys' fees for \"prevailing\" in the administrative hearing, but not for the time spent in negotiations for the final settlement. <i>Id.</i> The Seventh Circuit stated that the determination that the child was eligible for IDEA benefits as a result of the court-ordered case-study evaluation \"represented some success for T.D. because prior to his request for the due process hearing the school had not acknowledged that T.D. was even eligible for IDEA benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties (that is, the school district's determination that T.D. was eligible for special education services), was effected by the hearing officer's order (after a review of the merits that the school district was legally required to conduct a case-study evaluation), which provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on T.D.'s relief. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Second Circuit in <i>Preservation Coalition of Erie County v. Federal Transit Administration,</i> 356 F.3d at 452, held that a party was \"prevailing\" under <i>Buckhannon</i> when it successfully convinced the district court to order the defendants to prepare a new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) under threat of injunctive relief, even though the case was ultimately resolved by a settlement agreement embodied in a Stipulation and Order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> After determining that the Stipulation and Order was \"functionally a private settlement agreement,\" the court concluded that \"appellee obtained prevailing party status under <i>Buckhannon</i> when it obtained a court order requiring appellants to prepare a SEIS under threat of further injunctive relief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 451, 452. This was because \"[t]he SEIS was both judicially sanctioned and effectuated a <i>substantive,</i> material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.\" <i>Id.</i> at 452 (emphasis in original). And, as the Second Circuit noted, \"[a]lthough the district court declined to issue an injunction, it found the [Final Environmental Impact Statement] inadequate\" and \"ordered the defendants to prepare a [Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement].\" <i>Id.</i> at 448. Thus, the judge's substantive order effected a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Maine School Administrative District Number 35</i>, although not directly applying <i>Buckhannon,</i> we followed similar reasoning in holding that parents who successfully defended against a school district's attempt to change their child's placement were prevailing parties and thus entitled to attorneys' fees under the IDEA. <i>See</i> 321 F.3d at 17. We noted that \"[b]ecause the district court denied injunctive relief on the basis that the School District had not adduced sufficient proof to satisfy the [standard for changing the student's placement], it [was] readily evident that the appellants successfully defended [the original suit brought against the parents to keep their child out of the school because the school district thought the child was dangerous] on the merits.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the district judge's substantive ruling was the cause of a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Applying Buckhannon to Chelsea's Case</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our application of the law to the facts of Chelsea's case with the obvious &#8212; the relief obtained by Chelsea at the administrative level was not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, and thus does not warrant attorneys' fees under a narrow reading of <i>Buckhannon. See Christina A.,</i> 315 F.3d at 993 (holding that a party need obtain either a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits to be deemed a \"prevailing party\" under <i>Buckhannon</i>). Chelsea wisely does not argue as such. But, our inquiry does not end there. As we have not decided in this circuit whether to adopt a narrow or broad reading of <i>Buckhannon,</i> we do not foreclose the possibility of a broad reading, and look to determine whether Chelsea's relief, even though not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, comports with the overarching requirements of <i>Buckhannon;</i> that is, whether the involvement of the BSEA Hearing Officer provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties. <i>See Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604-05, 121 S.Ct. 1835. We thus first identify the change in the legal relationship between Chelsea and Fitchburg, and then ask whether that change was effected by the judicial actions of the BSEA Hearing Officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Change in the Legal Relationship</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of her initiation of proceedings against Fitchburg, Chelsea did receive all of the relief she requested. In Chelsea's complaint, she initially sought an order requiring Fitchburg to: (1) pay for Chelsea's tutoring at home and in the hospital; (2) convene an IEP meeting to address Chelsea's special education needs; and (3) implement the IEP. By the time the case was dismissed by the BSEA Hearing Officer, Fitchburg agreed to do everything requested. Thus, there was a material alteration in the legal relationship between Chelsea and Fitchburg. Under <i>Buckhannon,</i> however, that is not enough to justify an award of attorneys' fees; there must be judicial imprimatur on that change. <i>See</i> 532 U.S. at 604-05, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Involvement of the BSEA Hearing Officer</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judicial involvement in this case came in the form of a series of orders and rulings by the BSEA Hearing Officer that memorialized the voluntary concessions made by Fitchburg and attempted to keep the settlement process moving forward in a timely manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> At the time the orders were imposed, the BSEA Hearing Officer had not yet joined issue on the question of Chelsea's substantive entitlement to an IEP because the BSEA Hearing Officer had not yet convened a due process hearing. The issue before the BSEA Hearing Officer at the time of her orders and rulings was simply whether she should continue to promote settlement efforts or, instead, take immediate action on the parents' request for a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f). Thus, it appears from the record that the BSEA Hearing Officer's orders and rulings were issued to justify the BSEA Hearing Officer's implicit decision to delay the due process hearing in favor of private settlement, not to place the weight of judicial authority behind Fitchburg's substantive concession that Chelsea was entitled to an IEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, standing alone, the BSEA Hearing Officer's December 20, 2001 ruling requiring Fitchburg to convene a IEP meeting \"in no event ... later than January 11, 2002\" might be viewed as an order, similar to the order in <i>T.D.,</i> 349 F.3d at 480, compelling Fitchburg to convene an IEP meeting because the Hearing Officer determined Fitchburg was <i>legally</i> required to do so under the IDEA. A closer look at the record, however, reveals that this was merely a ruling memorializing a substantive concession by Fitchburg and an effort to keep pre-hearing settlement negotiations moving forward. Without being compelled to do so by the BSEA Hearing Officer, Fitchburg had orally (and voluntarily) agreed to convene an IEP meeting on December 12, 2001 during the December 4, 2001 BSEA Hearing Officer-initiated conference call. When Fitchburg failed to convene the meeting on December 12, Chelsea filed a motion requesting that the BSEA Hearing Officer order Fitchburg to convene the meeting. Significantly, Fitchburg did not oppose the motion. Thus, when the BSEA Hearing Officer issued its ruling stating that \"Fitchburg will use its best efforts to convene the TEAM on January 4, 2002 but in no event ... any later than January 11, 2002,\" the officer was mandating that Fitchburg convene a TEAM meeting by a specified date. The BSEA Hearing Officer never reviewed the merits of whether Fitchburg was required under the IDEA to convene the IEP meeting; the Hearing Officer only was requiring Fitchburg to follow through with what Fitchburg had already voluntarily promised to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we note that in this case, the BSEA Hearing Officer can be described as being simply efficient and business-like, forcing Fitchburg to move more rapidly. It is not clear from the record that Fitchburg was being willfully obstructionist. And, at no point did Fitchburg refuse to comply with an order of the BSEA Hearing Officer, nor was the Hearing Officer ever compelled to make good on her threats of sanctions against Fitchburg. Thus, we need not today foreclose the possibility that such judicial intervention in a clearer, or more extreme, case might justify an award of attorneys' fees under <i>Buckhannon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-hearing orders that hastened the final resolution of Chelsea's claim by private settlement did not provide sufficient judicial imprimatur on Chelsea's relief to make her a \"prevailing party\" under <i>Buckhannon.</i> The district court was correct to deny Chelsea attorneys' fees under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(B), and, as the prevailing party standard announced in <i>Buckhannon</i> also applies to an award of fees pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii), Chelsea's claim under that subparagraph fails as well. The district court's orders, granting summary judgment to Fitchburg and denying Chelsea's motion for summary judgment, are <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the IDEA, it is the aggrieved child's parents who may initiate a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f), and who may seek attorneys' fees as prevailing parties in such a hearing under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3).

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts in this case are undisputed. At the time these proceedings were initiated, Chelsea was a thirteen-year-old girl living with her parents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and enrolled as a student at St. Joseph's School. When Chelsea was two, she was diagnosed with liver cancer and underwent extensive treatment including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. As a result of that treatment, she suffers from partial hearing loss and ongoing gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other serious impairments. She depends on hearing aids and classroom assistance because of her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chelsea attended the Fitchburg public schools from 1993 to 1997, during which time Fitchburg provided special education services consisting of speech and language therapy. In 1997, Chelsea's Parents withdrew her from the public school and enrolled her in St. Joseph's School, a non-public, parochial school located in Fitchburg. Fitchburg continued to provide Chelsea with special education services at St. Joseph's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 2001, Chelsea became ill due to complications from her earlier treatment, requiring multiple prolonged hospitalizations and surgeries. As a result, Chelsea missed a significant amount of school. In June 2001, Chelsea was hospitalized again, and, in August 2001, when it became clear that Chelsea would be absent from school for an extended period of time, her parents asked that the principal of St. Joseph's contact Fitchburg's special education department to request special education services for Chelsea while she was hospitalized. Fitchburg informed the principal that it was not required to provide such services because Chelsea was a regular student enrolled in a non-public school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2001, Chelsea's Parents hired a private tutor to provide Chelsea with educational services while she was in the hospital, and directed that the bills be sent directly to Fitchburg. Fitchburg refused to pay these bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, on November 6, 2001, Chelsea's Parents filed a request for an administrative hearing before the BSEA seeking an order requiring Fitchburg to: (1) pay for Chelsea's tutoring at home and in the hospital; (2) convene an IEP meeting to address Chelsea's special education needs;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (3) implement the resulting IEP.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Chelsea was subsequently discharged from the hospital on November 11, 2001, although her medical condition prevented her from returning to school at that time. Because Fitchburg continued to refuse to provide special educational services for Chelsea, Chelsea's Parents arranged for Chelsea to be tutored at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 4, 2001, the BSEA Hearing Officer initiated a conference call with the parties, and at that time, Fitchburg orally agreed to convene a TEAM meeting on December 12, 2001 to evaluate Chelsea's special education needs. On December 12, 2001, because Fitchburg had not convened the TEAM meeting, Chelsea filed a motion requesting that the BSEA Hearing Officer order Fitchburg to convene the meeting. Fitchburg did not oppose the motion, and on December 20, 2001, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued a ruling granting Chelsea's motion, stating that \"Fitchburg will use its best efforts to convene the TEAM on January 4, 2002 but in no event will the TEAM be convened any later than <i>January 11, 2002.</i>\" On January 10, 2002, Fitchburg's counsel informed Chelsea's Parents that the TEAM meeting would take place the next day. Due to the short notice and conflicts with Chelsea's medical appointments, the TEAM meeting was rescheduled and eventually convened on January 18, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the TEAM meeting, Fitchburg determined that Chelsea was entitled to receive \"home/hospital education services\" despite her enrollment in a private school. Soon thereafter, the parties, under the guidance of the BSEA Hearing Officer, commenced negotiations for a settlement agreement to include home/hospital tutoring, reimbursement for prior tutoring expenses, execution of the IEP, and payment of attorneys' fees. Following a BSEA Hearing Officer-initiated conference call, the Hearing Officer issued an Order, noting that the \"[p]arties reported that they were discussing settlement,\" and confirming that \"School Counsel will send a written proposal for settlement by March 25, 2002 at 12:00 p.m.\" The Hearing Officer also scheduled a follow-up conference call for March 25, 2002 at 3:00 p.m.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitchburg sent a draft settlement agreement to Chelsea on March 21, 2002. After the March 25, 2002 conference call, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed in light of the parties' impending settlement. At that time, however, Fitchburg had not yet provided Chelsea's Parents with the proposed IEP<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and a signed copy of the settlement agreement. Accordingly, Chelsea's counsel responded to the show cause order, requesting that the case remain active until Chelsea received the IEP and both parties had executed the settlement agreement. On April 29, 2002, after another conference call, the BSEA Hearing Officer ordered Fitchburg to send Chelsea's Parents the IEP by Thursday, May 9, 2002 at 3:00 p.m.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and scheduled a conference call for Friday, May 10, 2002 to further discuss the pending settlement. That order stated that Fitchburg's failure to send the IEP by May 10, 2002 would result in sanctions. Fitchburg faxed the IEP on May 9, 2002, but did not forward a signed copy of the settlement agreement. During the May 10, 2002 conference call, Fitchburg said that it would send Chelsea's Parents a copy of the settlement agreement, and would review Chelsea's Parents' proposed changes to the IEP. Fitchburg's promises were again memorialized in an Order issued by the BSEA Hearing Officer that same day, and a follow-up conference call was scheduled for May 21, 2002. Chelsea's Parents forwarded the proposed changes to the IEP on May 14, 2002, and on May 20, 2002, sent a letter to Fitchburg's counsel noting that they had not yet heard back from Fitchburg about the proposed changes, despite the fact that a conference call was scheduled for the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2002, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued a second ruling, this time ordering, under threat of sanctions, that Fitchburg respond to Chelsea's Parents' proposed changes to the IEP no later than May 31, 2002.

In addition, the parties acknowledged that it was time to convene another TEAM meeting to discuss services for Chelsea during the summer months. In an order memorializing the conference call, the BSEA Hearing Officer stated that Fitchburg would send Chelsea's Parents a copy of the settlement agreement and would execute the changes to the IEP agreed upon in the conference call. The order also stated that by the next conference call, scheduled for June 11, 2002, a date for the TEAM to reconvene would be set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 7, 2002, Fitchburg executed the settlement agreement and forwarded it to Chelsea's counsel.

On June 10, 2002, Chelsea's counsel sent Fitchburg a letter stating that Chelsea had not received the signed IEP. On June 19, 2002, Chelsea's counsel sent the BSEA Hearing Officer a letter stating that Chelsea still had not received the signed IEP. On June 26, 2002, Chelsea's counsel sent yet another letter to the BSEA Hearing Officer stating Chelsea still had not received the signed IEP, and requesting a Hearing Officer-initiated conference call to address Fitchburg's failure to provide a signed copy of the IEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 2002, the BSEA Hearing Officer issued an order requiring Fitchburg to \"execute a signed IEP no later than July 5, 2002.\" The order stated that Fitchburg's failure to do so might result in sanctions. On July 16, 2002, Fitchburg sent Chelsea's Parents a signed IEP, and Chelsea's Parents executed the settlement agreement that same day. The settlement agreement provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that (1) Chelsea is a child in need of special education services; (2) Fitchburg would reimburse Chelsea's Parents for Chelsea's home/hospital tutoring expenses; (3) Chelsea's Parents would withdraw with prejudice their request for a hearing before the BSEA; (4) the settlement agreement did not constitute an admission that the services previously proposed or implemented for Chelsea were in any way inappropriate or inadequate; and (5) the Agreement did not release the claims of Chelsea's Parents against Fitchburg for payment of their legal fees in connection with this matter and that the Agreement did not, in any way, affect the Parents' right to seek payment of their legal fees from Fitchburg in an appropriate forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After signing the settlement agreement, Chelsea's Parents withdrew their request for a hearing. The case was dismissed on July 17, 2002. On August 15, 2002, Chelsea's Parents brought this action in the District Court of Massachusetts, alleging that Chelsea was a \"prevailing party\" in a proceeding under the IDEA, and thus was entitled to attorneys' fees, expenses and costs pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(B). Chelsea's Parents also claimed they were entitled to fees because 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii) provides that attorneys' fees may be awarded if an IEP meeting is \"convened as a result of an administrative proceeding.\" The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court allowed Fitchburg's motion for summary judgment, holding that \"[t]he ultimate settlement (rather than adjudication) of this case compels the denial of prevailing party status to [Chelsea].\" Chelsea's motion for summary judgment was denied. Chelsea's Parents filed this timely appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

In a case decided after <i>Buckhannon,</i> but expressly not deciding whether <i>Buckhannon</i> applied to the fee-shifting provisions of the IDEA, we awarded fees to a party who had successfully fended-off a motion for a temporary restraining order, noting that \"the denial of the School District's motion [for a TRO] was effectively a final judgment on the merits on [one of the School District's claims].\" <i>Me.

The Seventh Circuit, reversing in part the decision of the district court, held that the parents were eligible for an award of attorneys' fees for \"prevailing\" in the administrative hearing, but not for the time spent in negotiations for the final settlement. <i>Id.</i> The Seventh Circuit stated that the determination that the child was eligible for IDEA benefits as a result of the court-ordered case-study evaluation \"represented some success for T.D. because prior to his request for the due process hearing the school had not acknowledged that T.D. was even eligible for IDEA benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties (that is, the school district's determination that T.D. was eligible for special education services), was effected by the hearing officer's order (after a review of the merits that the school district was legally required to conduct a case-study evaluation), which provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on T.D.'s relief. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Second Circuit in <i>Preservation Coalition of Erie County v.

We noted that \"[b]ecause the district court denied injunctive relief on the basis that the School District had not adduced sufficient proof to satisfy the [standard for changing the student's placement], it [was] readily evident that the appellants successfully defended [the original suit brought against the parents to keep their child out of the school because the school district thought the child was dangerous] on the merits.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, the district judge's substantive ruling was the cause of a material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Applying Buckhannon to Chelsea's Case</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our application of the law to the facts of Chelsea's case with the obvious &#8212; the relief obtained by Chelsea at the administrative level was not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, and thus does not warrant attorneys' fees under a narrow reading of <i>Buckhannon.

As we have not decided in this circuit whether to adopt a narrow or broad reading of <i>Buckhannon,</i> we do not foreclose the possibility of a broad reading, and look to determine whether Chelsea's relief, even though not in the form of a consent decree or a final judgment on the merits, comports with the overarching requirements of <i>Buckhannon;</i> that is, whether the involvement of the BSEA Hearing Officer provided the necessary judicial imprimatur on a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties. <i>See Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 604-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span>. We thus first identify the change in the legal relationship between Chelsea and Fitchburg, and then ask whether that change was effected by the judicial actions of the BSEA Hearing Officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Change in the Legal Relationship</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of her initiation of proceedings against Fitchburg, Chelsea did receive all of the relief she requested. In Chelsea's complaint, she initially sought an order requiring Fitchburg to: (1) pay for Chelsea's tutoring at home and in the hospital; (2) convene an IEP meeting to address Chelsea's special education needs; and (3) implement the IEP. By the time the case was dismissed by the BSEA Hearing Officer, Fitchburg agreed to do everything requested. Thus, there was a material alteration in the legal relationship between Chelsea and Fitchburg. Under <i>Buckhannon,</i> however, that is not enough to justify an award of attorneys' fees; there must be judicial imprimatur on that change. <i>See</i> 532 U.S. at 604-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1835</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Involvement of the BSEA Hearing Officer</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judicial involvement in this case came in the form of a series of orders and rulings by the BSEA Hearing Officer that memorialized the voluntary concessions made by Fitchburg and attempted to keep the settlement process moving forward in a timely manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> At the time the orders were imposed, the BSEA Hearing Officer had not yet joined issue on the question of Chelsea's substantive entitlement to an IEP because the BSEA Hearing Officer had not yet convened a due process hearing. The issue before the BSEA Hearing Officer at the time of her orders and rulings was simply whether she should continue to promote settlement efforts or, instead, take immediate action on the parents' request for a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f). Thus, it appears from the record that the BSEA Hearing Officer's orders and rulings were issued to justify the BSEA Hearing Officer's implicit decision to delay the due process hearing in favor of private settlement, not to place the weight of judicial authority behind Fitchburg's substantive concession that Chelsea was entitled to an IEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, standing alone, the BSEA Hearing Officer's December 20, 2001 ruling requiring Fitchburg to convene a IEP meeting \"in no event ... later than January 11, 2002\" might be viewed as an order, similar to the order in <i>T.D.,</i> 349 F.3d at 480, compelling Fitchburg to convene an IEP meeting because the Hearing Officer determined Fitchburg was <i>legally</i> required to do so under the IDEA. A closer look at the record, however, reveals that this was merely a ruling memorializing a substantive concession by Fitchburg and an effort to keep pre-hearing settlement negotiations moving forward. Without being compelled to do so by the BSEA Hearing Officer, Fitchburg had orally (and voluntarily) agreed to convene an IEP meeting on December 12, 2001 during the December 4, 2001 BSEA Hearing Officer-initiated conference call. When Fitchburg failed to convene the meeting on December 12, Chelsea filed a motion requesting that the BSEA Hearing Officer order Fitchburg to convene the meeting. Significantly, Fitchburg did not oppose the motion. Thus, when the BSEA Hearing Officer issued its ruling stating that \"Fitchburg will use its best efforts to convene the TEAM on January 4, 2002 but in no event ... any later than January 11, 2002,\" the officer was mandating that Fitchburg convene a TEAM meeting by a specified date. The BSEA Hearing Officer never reviewed the merits of whether Fitchburg was required under the IDEA to convene the IEP meeting; the Hearing Officer only was requiring Fitchburg to follow through with what Fitchburg had already voluntarily promised to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we note that in this case, the BSEA Hearing Officer can be described as being simply efficient and business-like, forcing Fitchburg to move more rapidly. It is not clear from the record that Fitchburg was being willfully obstructionist. And, at no point did Fitchburg refuse to comply with an order of the BSEA Hearing Officer, nor was the Hearing Officer ever compelled to make good on her threats of sanctions against Fitchburg. Thus, we need not today foreclose the possibility that such judicial intervention in a clearer, or more extreme, case might justify an award of attorneys' fees under <i>Buckhannon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-hearing orders that hastened the final resolution of Chelsea's claim by private settlement did not provide sufficient judicial imprimatur on Chelsea's relief to make her a \"prevailing party\" under <i>Buckhannon.</i> The district court was correct to deny Chelsea attorneys' fees under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(B), and, as the prevailing party standard announced in <i>Buckhannon</i> also applies to an award of fees pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii), Chelsea's claim under that subparagraph fails as well. The district court's orders, granting summary judgment to Fitchburg and denying Chelsea's motion for summary judgment, are <i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the IDEA, it is the aggrieved child's parents who may initiate a due process hearing under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(f), and who may seek attorneys' fees as prevailing parties in such a hearing under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(3).
