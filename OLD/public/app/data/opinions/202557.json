Rya W. Zobel,       U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Torruella, Selya and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Frank Quaglia on brief pro se.\n     Daniel M. Kummer, Barry I. Slotnick, Loeb & Loeb LLP,\nJonathan M. Albano and Bingham McCutchen on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          December 15, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam.      Frank Quaglia, creator of the film \"The\n\nUltimate Audition,\" brought an action against defendants Rainbow\n\nMedia   Holdings   LLC,   National     Broadcasting    Company,     and   Bravo\n\nCompany (collectively, \"Bravo\"), creators of the television series\n\n\"The It Factor,\" for copyright infringement. Quaglia also asserted\n\nclaims under state law for breach of confidentiality and breach of\n\nimplied contract.     The district court granted summary judgment to\n\nBravo, concluding that with respect to the copyright claim, Quaglia\n\nhad failed to present any genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nissues of access or substantial similarity.           The court also denied\n\nQuaglia's state law claims. Quaglia now appeals that ruling.\n\nEssentially for the reasons set forth in the district court's March\n\n21, 2006, ruling, we affirm.\n\n           To prevail on a claim of copyright infringement, a\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate \"(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and\n\n(2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\"\n\nFeist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361\n\n(1991); see Yankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater Candle Co., 259 F.3d\n\n25, 32 (1st Cir. 2001).     Bravo does not dispute that Quaglia has a\n\nvalid copyright in \"The Ultimate Audition.\"           Accordingly, we focus\n\non the second element in the infringement analysis.\n\n           Since there is usually no evidence of actual copying, a\n\nplaintiff may prove that wrongful copying occurred by showing that\n\ndefendants   had   access   to   the    copyrighted    work   and   that   the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fallegedly       infringing     work   has   \"probative   similarity\"    to   the\n\ncopyrighted work.           Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); see Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 49 F.3d 807,\n\n813 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Probative similarity\" exists where two works\n\nare \"so similar that the court may infer that there was factual\n\ncopying.\").        Once copying has been proven, \"'the plaintiff must\n\nprove that the copying of the copyrighted material was so extensive\n\nthat       it    rendered     the     infringing   and    copyrighted    works\n\n'substantially similar.'\"             Yankee Candle Co., 259 F.3d at 33\n\n(quoting Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co., 207 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n                Quaglia argues that there was evidence in the record\n\nsufficient to support an inference that Debbie DeMontreux, the\n\nBravo employee who developed \"The It Factor,\" had access to \"The\n\nUltimate Audition.\"           Even assuming arguendo that the record was\n\nsufficient to establish access, Quaglia's claim fails on the issue\n\nof probative and substantial similarity.1                After viewing both\n\n\n       1\n      Although the concepts of probative similarity and substantial\nsimilarity are distinct, the analysis merges somewhat because\n\"[t]he requirement of originality cuts across both . . . criteria,\"\nand \"[t]he resemblances relied upon as a basis for finding\nprobative similarity must refer to 'constituent elements of the\ncopyrighted work that are original.'\" Johnson, 409 F.3d at 18-19\n(quoting Feist, 499 U.S. at 361 (alterations omitted)); see T-Peg,\nInc. v. Vermont Timber Works, Inc., 459 F.3d 97, 112 (1st Cir.\n2006). \"The substantial similarity inquiry . . . . focuses not on\nevery aspect of the copyrighted work, but on those aspects of the\nplaintiff's work that are protectable under copyright laws and\nwhether whatever copying took place appropriated those protected\nelements.\"    T-Peg, Inc., 499 U.S. at 361 (quotation marks,\n\n                                         -3-\n\fworks, we conclude that, essentially for the reasons stated by the\n\ndistrict court in its March 21, 2006, opinion, no reasonable juror\n\ncould find substantial similarity of expression, even taking the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff.                    To the extent\n\nthat    there   are    similarities,        many   of    them   relate       to   stock\n\ncharacters and scènes à faire, which are not subject to copyright\n\nprotection.     See Swirsky v. Carey, 376 F.3d 841, 848 (9th Cir.\n\n2004)    (\"Under      the    [scènes   à]    faire      doctrine,     when    certain\n\ncommonplace expressions are indispensable and naturally associated\n\nwith the treatment of a given idea, those expressions are treated\n\nlike ideas and therefore not protected by copyright.\" (alteration\n\nomitted)); MyWebGrocer, LLC v. Hometown Info, Inc., 375 F.3d 190,\n\n194 (2d Cir. 2004) (\"Scènes à faire are unprotectible elements that\n\nfollow naturally from a work's theme rather than from an author's\n\ncreativity.\").         The    remaining     similarities,       for   example,     the\n\nsimilarities in music or editing style, are not substantial, and\n\nthe differences between the works are fundamental and extensive.\n\nAccordingly, entry of summary judgment with regard to the copyright\n\ninfringement claim was proper.\n\n\n\n\ncitations and alterations omitted); see Johnson, 409 F.3d at 19\n(\"in examining whether actual copying has occurred, a court must\nengage in dissection of the copyrighted work by separating its\noriginal, protected expressive elements from those aspects that are\nnot copyrightable because they represent unprotected ideas or\nunoriginal expressions.\").\n\n                                        -4-\n\f           To the extent that Quaglia also seeks to challenge the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his state law claims for breach of\n\nimplied contract and breach of confidentiality, his claims are\n\nbased on the theory that DeMontreux directed the third-party\n\nproducers of \"The It Factor\" to copy \"The Ultimate Audition.\"\n\nHowever,   Quaglia's      argument    is    based   only    upon      a    series   of\n\ninferences   that   are    directly    contradicted        by   the       affirmative\n\nevidence of record.        Accordingly, the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that Quaglia failed to carry his burden of demonstrating\n\nthe existence of a genuine issue of material fact with regard to\n\nthe state law claims.       See Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231,\n\n236-37 (1st Cir. 2002) (improbable inferences insufficient to\n\ndefeat summary judgment); Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303,\n\n310 (1st Cir. 2001) (absence of evidence on a material issue weighs\n\nagainst the party who would bear the burden of proof at trial on\n\nthat issue); Walter v. Fiorenzo, 840 F.2d 427, 434 (7th Cir. 1988)\n\n(\"A motion for summary judgment cannot be defeated merely by an\n\nopposing party's incantation of lack of credibility over a movant's\n\nsupporting affidavit.\").\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.                    See 1st\n\nCir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
