After purchasing multiple handguns in Rhode\n               \n\nIsland and  delivering them to  New York for  illegal resale,\n\ndefendant-appellant Jesus M.  Romero pled guilty to  a twenty\n\ncount  indictment charging him with nine counts of possession\n\nof a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C.  \n\n922(g)(1), nine counts  of making a false statement to affect\n\nthe  purchase  of  firearms  in  violation  of 18  U.S.C.    \n\n922(a)(6)  and  924(a)(1)(B),  and  two  counts  of  unlawful\n\ntransportation  of  firearms   in  interstate  commerce,   in\n\nviolation   of  18  U.S.C.       922(a)(1)(A),   923(a),  and\n\n924(a)(1)(D).     Romero  appeals  from   the  imposition  of\n\nsentence, claiming that the district court erred in adding  a\n\nfour level enhancement to the base offense level, pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G.    2K2.1(b)(5),1  based  on a  finding by  the court\n\nthat Romero knew  or had reason to believe  that the firearms\n\nwould be used  at some time in the future  in connection with\n\nanother felony offense.\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\n\n                    \n\n1.  The guideline provides in relevant part:\n\n     If the defendant  used or possessed any  firearm or\n     ammunition  in   connection  with   another  felony\n     offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or\n     ammunition  with knowledge,  intent,  or reason  to\n     believe  that  it  would be  used  or  possessed in\n     connection with another felony offense, increase by\n     four levels.\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1992).\n\n     We  take  the  relevant   facts  from  the  pre-sentence\n\ninvestigation  report  (PSI)   and  the  transcript  of   the\n\nsentencing hearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Connell, 960\n                                                        \n\nF.2d  191, 192-93 (1st Cir. 1992).  On April 24, 1992, Romero\n\nwent  to  Continental  Gun  and  Engraving  (Continental)  in\n\nCranston,  Rhode   Island  and  purchased  ten  .380  caliber\n\npistols.  During the transaction, Romero filled out Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms Form 4473 (ATF 4473), which is\n\nrequired  for all gun transactions with licensed gun dealers.\n\nRomero answered  \"no\" to the  question on the ATF  that asked\n\nwhether he  had been  previously convicted of  a felony.   In\n\nfact,  Romero  had  been  convicted  of  larceny  of  a motor\n\nvehicle, a Massachusetts felony, on June 17, 1991.\n\n     On  May  1,  1992, Romero  returned  to  Continental and\n\nbought fourteen  more  pistols.   These  guns  were  ten  .25\n\ncaliber  pistols, three  .380 caliber  pistols,  and one  .22\n\ncaliber pistol.  Romero again  indicated on the ATF 4473 that\n\nhe had not been previously convicted of a felony.  The Bureau\n\nof  Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms (ATF)  began investigating\n\nRomero's activities  after receiving  its Notice of  Multiple\n\nPurchases from Continental on May 5, 1992.\n\n     On May 13, 1992, the  New York City Police recovered one\n\nof the  guns that  Romero had bought  from Continental.   The\n\npolice found the gun in the possession  of a 17 year old male\n\nduring a drug raid in the Bronx.\n\n                             -3-\n\n     Between  June 4, 1992 and August 28, 1992, Romero bought\n\nsix more handguns from Continental on six separate occasions.\n\nIn mid-October, Romero and a man named Luis F. Lugo attempted\n\nto  buy  ten more  handguns  from  Continental.   This  time,\n\nhowever, Continental refused to sell so many guns at a single\n\ntime.\n\n     On  November  6,  1992,   ATF  agents  observed  Romero,\n\naccompanied by Lugo,  buy ten .380 caliber handguns at  D &amp; C\n\nShooting  Supplies in Warwick,  Rhode Island.   Again, Romero\n\nfilled out an ATF 4473 form in which he indicated that he had\n\nnot  previously  been convicted  of  a  felony.   ATF  agents\n\nfollowed Romero home  and asked him to accompany  them to ATF\n\nheadquarters in Providence.   Romero voluntarily went  to the\n\nATF  headquarters.   After  receiving  his Miranda  warnings,\n                                                  \n\nRomero  acknowledged that he had bought guns from Continental\n\nthe previous April and May.  He stated that he got  the money\n\nfor those  guns from an  individual named William  Delgado of\n\nNew York City.   Romero said  that once he  got the guns,  he\n\ndrove to New York City and gave them to Delgado.\n\n     After defendant pled  guilty on March 22,  1993, the PSI\n\nwas prepared.2  The base offense level (BOL) was  established\n\nat level 14, because the  defendant was a \"prohibited person\"\n\nwithin the  meaning of U.S.S.G.    2K2.1(a)(6).  A  six level\n\n                    \n\n2.  The  November 1992 version  of the  Sentencing Guidelines\nwas used to determine Romero's guideline sentencing range.\n\n                             -4-\n\nincrease  was made  to the  BOL,  pursuant to    2K2.1(b)(1),\n\nbecause 50  weapons were  involved.3   The offense  level was\n\nadjusted  upward   another   four  levels,   pursuant  to    \n\n2K2.1(b)(2), because the defendant had reason to believe that\n\nthe firearms  would be used  or possessed in  connection with\n\nanother felony offense.  The defendant received a three level\n\ndownward adjustment  for acceptance of responsibility.   This\n\nyielded a total  offense level of 21.   Since the defendant's\n\ncriminal history category  was II, the guidelines  sentencing\n\nrange was determined to be forty-one to fifty-one months.\n\n     At sentencing, Romero objected to two conclusions in the\n\nPSI.    First,  Romero  denied  attempting  to  purchase  ten\n\nhandguns from Continental in October.  Romero maintained that\n\nhe should  be held responsible  only for  the forty  firearms\n\nthat  he actually  purchased.    The  government called  as a\n\nwitness  a  clerk  from  the store  who  testified  anent the\n\ndefendant's attempt  to buy  the guns.   Defendant put  on no\n\nwitnesses.  The district court  found as fact that Romero was\n\nresponsible  for fifty firearms.   Defendant does  not appeal\n\nthis finding.\n\n     Romero also  objected to the conclusion in  the PSI that\n\nthe base  offense level should  be increased by  four levels,\n\npursuant  to   U.S.S.G.       2K2.1(b)(5),   because   Romero\n\n                    \n\n3.  The number of  weapons included the forty  weapons Romero\npurchased,  as  well  as the  ten  weapons  he unsuccessfully\nattempted to purchase from Continental in October.\n\n                             -5-\n\ntransferred the  firearms to a  person in New York  City with\n\nknowledge, intent or reason to believe that the guns would be\n\nused   or  possessed  in   connection  with   another  felony\n\noffense.4    Defense  counsel argued  that  the  court should\n\naccept Romero's statement  in the PSI that he  had been asked\n\nby a man named Luis Lugo to assist him in buying handguns for\n\nshop and business  owners in New York who  wanted to purchase\n\nhandguns for protection  and did not wish to  comply with New\n\nYork's  \"well-known\" and  \"difficult\" licensing  procedures.5\n\nDefense counsel  further argued  that if Romero  had been  \"a\n\nlittle  bit smarter,  a little  bit  more sophisticated,\"  he\n\nprobably would have guessed that the guns he took to New York\n\nwould be used  in a further crime,  but that his   client was\n\ntoo naive to understand this risk.6  \n\n                    \n\n4.  Neither  the  defense   nor  the  prosecution   presented\nevidence  at the sentencing  hearing specific to  this issue.\nBoth  counsel  argued  from  the  presentence  report,  which\nincluded  the government's  version  of  the  offense  and  a\nstatement by the defendant.\n\n5.  In  his statement, Romero stated that Lugo \"indicated\" to\nhim \"that he  knew various store owners and  other people who\nran  offices and otherwise  were business people  in New York\nthat  wanted to buy  guns.\"  Romero  also stated that  he was\n\"shocked  to learn  that one  of the  guns involved  had been\nrecovered during  a drug arrest  in New York city\"  and never\nwould have entered into the  arrangement if he had known Lugo\nintended to sell the guns to drug dealers.\n\n6.  At the time of the offense, Romero  was 21 years old.  He\nhad  completed eight years  of education  in Spanish-speaking\nschools in Puerto Rico.\n\n                             -6-\n\n     The district court overruled defense counsel's objection\n\nand found that Romero  knew or had reason to believe that the\n\nfirearms he purchased  and transported to  New York would  be\n\nused at  some time in  the future in connection  with another\n\nfelony offense.  In support of this ruling, the court stated:\n\n     I've already indicated  I can't think of  any other\n     reason  for having the firearms except to fire them\n     at some  person.  There  may be some people  in our\n     society  who  do  not  understand  that  when   one\n     delivers 10  handguns to  New York  City that  they\n     could be expected to be used in the perpetration of\n     a crime.  But they are few and far between  and the\n     Defendant  is not one of them.  He had to know that\n     there  was  no  legitimate purpose  here  involved.\n     That  the firearms would  ultimately end up  in the\n     possession  of people  who  couldn't otherwise  get\n     them,  and that includes felons, and that itself is\n     a felony.  So that it seems to me the Defendant had\n     every reason  to believe that what he was doing was\n     wrong,  and  to  know  it.    So  I  overrule  that\n     objection. \n\nThe court adopted the findings and recommendations  contained\n\nin the  PSI and sentenced  the defendant to  forty-one months\n\nimprisonment,  the  bottom  end of  the  applicable guideline\n\nsentencing range.\n\n                       II.  DISCUSSION\n\n     On  appeal,  Romero argues  that there  was insufficient\n\nsupport for the district court's  finding that he knew or had\n\nreason to  believe that the  guns would  be used in  a future\n\nfelony.  We disagree.\n\n     An appellate tribunal \"shall accept the findings of fact\n\nof the district  court unless they are  clearly erroneous and\n\nshall  give due deference to the district court's application\n\n                             -7-\n\nof the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C.   3742(e) (1988).\n\nWe  have interpreted  this  statute  as  requiring,  in  most\n\ninstances, that  the court of appeals review  a trial court's\n\napplication of a  sentencing guideline to the  facts only for\n\nclear error.7  See, e.g.,  United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1150, 1158 (1st  Cir. 1993); United States v.  Ruiz, 905 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n499, 507  (1st Cir. 1990).   In the instant  case, the record\n\nadequately supports the district court's factual finding that\n\nthe  defendant must  have  understood  that  the  weapons  he\n\ndelivered  to New  York City  would wind  up in the  hands of\n\ncriminals  for  use in  future  crimes.   The  defendant  was\n\ndealing with persons of unknown backgrounds who asked him  to\n\nget involved in a  clandestine operation delivering  multiple\n\nweapons to a city with a  high crime rate.  The weapons  were\n\ninexpensive  handguns,  unsuited  for  hunting or  legitimate\n\npursuits, and  unlikely  to be  used in  such quantities  for\n\nanything but illegal purposes.  The defendant admittedly knew\n\nthat the  guns would be resold  to persons who  wished to buy\n\nweapons  illegally.  The  district court was  not required to\n\n                    \n\n7.  To be sure, Romero also argues, as  a matter of law, that\nthe scienter requirement of   2K2.1(b)(5)--that the defendant\nhave  \"knowledge,  intent,  or reason  to  believe\"  that the\nfirearm will  be used in  a future felony  offense--should be\nnarrowly  interpreted  to  require  that  the  defendant have\nsubjective  knowledge.  We  review a guideline's  meaning and\nscope de novo.   See United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54\n                                              \n(1st  Cir. 1993).    Romero,  however,  cites  no  meaningful\nauthority for his position.  At any rate, we need not address\nthis  asseveration as, here,  the district  court supportably\nfound that Romero possessed such subjective knowledge.\n\n                             -8-\n\ndiscard  common sense  and accept  the defendant's  assertion\n\nthat  he  believed  that  the  guns  would  be  purchased  by\n\nlegitimate  businessmen  for  self-protection.    See  United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.  Sklar, 920  F.2d 107, 112  (1st Cir.  1990) (court\n                \n\nneed not \"divorce [itself] from common sense\").\n\n     Romero  also  argues  that it  was  impermissible double\n\ncounting  to  predicate  the    2K2.1(b)(5)  increase  on the\n\nnumber of weapons  involved since the    2K2.1(b)(1) increase\n\nwas based  on this same fact.   But the district court relied\n\non  much  more  than  the  number  of  weapons  involved--for\n\nexample, the nature  of the weapons and  their destination8--\n\nin  concluding that  Romero knew, or  had reason  to believe,\n\nthat the weapons would be used in future felony offenses.  We\n\ntherefore  find  no  impermissible  double  counting.9    Cf.\n                                                             \n\nUnited States v. Balogun, 989  F.2d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                        \n\n(finding  no  improper  double  counting where  fact  already\n\naccounted  for in  previous enhancement  was  one of  several\n\nfactors relied upon  by the  court in  support of  additional\n\nenhancement);  United States v.  Sanders, 982 F.2d  4, 8 (1st\n                                        \n\nCir.  1992) (concluding  that, as  the  guidelines have  been\n\n                    \n\n8.  The district court  noted that the weapons  involved were\n\"cheap  handgun[s]\"  which  have  only  one  use--injuring or\nkilling people.\n\n9.  We further reject, as without  merit, Romero's contention\nthat the illegal  behavior which provided the  foundation for\nhis  conviction  was  subsequently  used  to  justify  the   \n2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement.\n\n                             -9-\n\nexplicit where double counting is to be avoided, an exception\n\nshould not be created where none is stated).  \n\n     Finally, Romero contends that the   2K2.1(b)(5) increase\n\ncannot be predicated on his  knowledge that the weapons would\n\nbe illegally  resold.   Defendant correctly  points out  that\n\nApplication Note  18 of  the Commentary  to U.S.S.G.    2K2.1\n\nstates in relevant part:\n\n     As used  in subsection (b)(5) and  (c)(1), \"another\n     felony  offense\"  and  \"another offense\"  refer  to\n     offenses   other   than  explosives   or   firearms\n     possession or trafficking offenses.\n\nThe district court,  however, heeded this mandate  and viewed\n\nthe  likely range of  felonious activity as  far broader then\n\nmere illegal possession or trafficking.  \n\n     Finding no error,  we affirm  the judgment  below.   See\n                                                             \n\nLoc. R. 27.1.\n\n                             -10-\n",

These guns were ten .25 caliber pistols, three .380 caliber pistols, and one .22 caliber pistol.  Romero again indicated on the ATF 4473 that he had not been previously convicted of a felony.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) began investigating Romero's activities after receiving its Notice of Multiple Purchases from Continental on May 5, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 13, 1992, the New York City Police recovered one of the guns that Romero had bought from Continental.

Again, Romero filled out an ATF 4473 form in which he indicated that he had not previously been convicted of a felony.  ATF agents followed Romero home and asked him to accompany them to ATF headquarters in Providence.  Romero voluntarily went to the ATF headquarters.  After receiving his Miranda warnings, Romero acknowledged that he had bought guns from Continental the previous April and May.  He stated that he got the money for those guns from an individual named William Delgado of New York City.  Romero said that once he got the guns, he drove to New York City and gave them to Delgado.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After defendant pled guilty on March 22, 1993, the PSI was prepared.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The base offense level (BOL) was established at level 14, because the defendant was a \"prohibited person\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(a)(6).  A six level increase was made to the BOL, pursuant to Sec. 2K2.1(b)(1), because 50 weapons were involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The offense level was adjusted upward another four levels, pursuant to Sec. 2K2.1(b)(2), because the defendant had reason to believe that the firearms would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.  The defendant received a three level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.  This yielded a total offense level of 21.  Since the defendant's criminal history category was II, the guidelines sentencing range was determined to be forty-one to fifty-one months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Romero objected to two conclusions in the PSI.  First, Romero denied attempting to purchase ten handguns from Continental in October.  Romero maintained that he should be held responsible only for the forty firearms that he actually purchased.  The government called as a witness a clerk from the store who testified anent the defendant's attempt to buy the guns.  Defendant put on no witnesses.  The district court found as fact that Romero was responsible for fifty firearms.  Defendant does not appeal this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romero also objected to the conclusion in the PSI that the base offense level should be increased by four levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5), because Romero transferred the firearms to a person in New York City with knowledge, intent or reason to believe that the guns would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Defense counsel argued that the court should accept Romero's statement in the PSI that he had been asked by a man named Luis Lugo to assist him in buying handguns for shop and business owners in New York who wanted to purchase handguns for protection and did not wish to comply with New York's \"well-known\" and \"difficult\" licensing procedures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Defense counsel further argued that if Romero had been \"a little bit smarter, a little bit more sophisticated,\" he probably would have guessed that the guns he took to New York would be used in a further crime, but that his client was too naive to understand this risk.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court overruled defense counsel's objection and found that Romero knew or had reason to believe that the firearms he purchased and transported to New York would be used at some time in the future in connection with another felony offense.  In support of this ruling, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I've already indicated I can't think of any other reason for having the firearms except to fire them at some person.  There may be some people in our society who do not understand that when one delivers 10 handguns to New York City that they could be expected to be used in the perpetration of a crime.  But they are few and far between and the Defendant is not one of them.  He had to know that there was no legitimate purpose here involved.  That the firearms would ultimately end up in the possession of people who couldn't otherwise get them, and that includes felons, and that itself is a felony.  So that it seems to me the Defendant had every reason to believe that what he was doing was wrong, and to know it.  So I overrule that objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court adopted the findings and recommendations contained in the PSI and sentenced the defendant to forty-one months imprisonment, the bottom end of the applicable guideline sentencing range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Romero argues that there was insufficient support for the district court's finding that he knew or had reason to believe that the guns would be used in a future felony.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate tribunal \"shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and shall give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3742(e) (1988).  We have interpreted this statute as requiring, in most instances, that the court of appeals review a trial court's application of a sentencing guideline to the facts only for clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   See, e.g., United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1158 (1st Cir. 1993);   United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir. 1990).  In the instant case, the record adequately supports the district court's factual finding that the defendant must have understood that the weapons he delivered to New York City would wind up in the hands of criminals for use in future crimes.  The defendant was dealing with persons of unknown backgrounds who asked him to get involved in a clandestine operation delivering multiple weapons to a city with a high crime rate.  The weapons were inexpensive handguns, unsuited for hunting or legitimate pursuits, and unlikely to be used in such quantities for anything but illegal purposes.  The defendant admittedly knew that the guns would be resold to persons who wished to buy weapons illegally.  The district court was not required to discard common sense and accept the defendant's assertion that he believed that the guns would be purchased by legitimate businessmen for self-protection.  See United States v. Sklar,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 1990) (court need not \"divorce [itself] from common sense\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romero also argues that it was impermissible double counting to predicate the Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5) increase on the number of weapons involved since the Sec. 2K2.1(b)(1) increase was based on this same fact.  But the district court relied on much more than the number of weapons involved-for example, the nature of the weapons and their destination<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>-in concluding that Romero knew, or had reason to believe, that the weapons would be used in future felony offenses.  We therefore find no impermissible double counting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Cf. United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding no improper double counting where fact already accounted for in previous enhancement was one of several factors relied upon by the court in support of additional enhancement);   United States v. Sanders, 982 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1992) (concluding that, as the guidelines have been explicit where double counting is to be avoided, an exception should not be created where none is stated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Romero contends that the Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5) increase cannot be predicated on his knowledge that the weapons would be illegally resold.  Defendant correctly points out that Application Note 18 of the Commentary to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1 states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As used in subsection (b)(5) and (c)(1), \"another felony offense\" and \"another offense\" refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, heeded this mandate and viewed the likely range of felonious activity as far broader then mere illegal possession or trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment below.

We review a guideline's meaning and scope  de novo.  See United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993).  Romero, however, cites no meaningful authority for his position.

Romero pled guilty to a twenty count indictment charging him with nine counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1), nine counts of making a false statement to affect the purchase of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C.

Romero appeals from the imposition of sentence, claiming that the district court erred in adding a four level enhancement to the base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> based on a finding by the court that Romero knew or had reason to believe that the firearms would be used at some time in the future in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the relevant facts from the pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.

On April 24, 1992, Romero went to Continental Gun and Engraving (Continental) in Cranston, Rhode Island and purchased ten .380 caliber pistols.  During the transaction, Romero filled out Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Form 4473 (ATF 4473), which is required for all gun transactions with licensed gun dealers.  Romero answered \"no\" to the question on the ATF that asked whether he had been previously convicted of a felony.  In fact, Romero had been convicted of larceny of a motor vehicle, a Massachusetts felony, on June 17, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 1992, Romero returned to Continental and bought fourteen more pistols.

The defendant was dealing with persons of unknown backgrounds who asked him to get involved in a clandestine operation delivering multiple weapons to a city with a high crime rate.  The weapons were inexpensive handguns, unsuited for hunting or legitimate pursuits, and unlikely to be used in such quantities for anything but illegal purposes.  The defendant admittedly knew that the guns would be resold to persons who wished to buy weapons illegally.  The district court was not required to discard common sense and accept the defendant's assertion that he believed that the guns would be purchased by legitimate businessmen for self-protection.

But the district court relied on much more than the number of weapons involved-for example, the nature of the weapons and their destination<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>-in concluding that Romero knew, or had reason to believe, that the weapons would be used in future felony offenses.  We therefore find no impermissible double counting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Cf. United States v. Balogun, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602831\"><a href=\"/opinion/602831/united-states-v-henry-olawale-balogun-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding no improper double counting where fact already accounted for in previous enhancement was one of several factors relied upon by the court in support of additional enhancement);   United States v. Sanders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597131\"><a href=\"/opinion/597131/united-states-v-steven-h-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1992) (concluding that, as the guidelines have been explicit where double counting is to be avoided, an exception should not be created where none is stated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Romero contends that the Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5) increase cannot be predicated on his knowledge that the weapons would be illegally resold.  Defendant correctly points out that Application Note 18 of the Commentary to U.S.S.G. Sec. 2K2.1 states in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As used in subsection (b)(5) and (c)(1), \"another felony offense\" and \"another offense\" refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, however, heeded this mandate and viewed the likely range of felonious activity as far broader then mere illegal possession or trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment below.

We review a guideline's meaning and scope  de novo.  See United States v.

Romero, however, cites no meaningful authority for his position.  At any rate, we need not address this asseveration as, here, the district court supportably found that Romero possessed such subjective knowledge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The district court noted that the weapons involved were \"cheap handgun[s]\" which have only one use-injuring or killing people</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We further reject, as without merit, Romero's contention that the illegal behavior which provided the foundation for his conviction was subsequently used to justify the Sec. 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
