Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Hansen,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Yvonne M. Menéndez-Calero, with whom Quiñones, Sánchez &\nGuzman, P.S.C. was on brief, for appellant Justo Cruz.\n     Lizabel M. Negrón for appellant Municipality of Aguadilla.\n     Juan Rafael González Muñoz, with whom González Muñoz & Vicéns\nSánchez, Victor Miranda Corrada, and Miranda Corrada Law Office\nwere on brief, for appellee Blanca Valentín-Almeyda.\n\n\n\n                              May 9, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. The Municipality of Aguadilla,\n\nPuerto Rico, and one of its police officers, Sgt. Justo Cruz,\n\nappeal from respective jury awards against them totaling over $1\n\nmillion.     The sums were awarded to Blanca Valentín-Almeyda, a\n\nmunicipal police officer, on her Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et\n\nseq., and Puerto Rico Law 17, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 155 et\n\nseq., claims of sexual harassment, retaliation, and violation of\n\ndue process.\n\n           The defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient\n\nto support either liability or the damages awarded, and, as a\n\nresult, the district court erred in denying their motion under\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 50(b) and 59(a) for judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict, remitittur, or a new trial.\n\n           The Municipality also attacks the verdict form, arguing\n\nthat it led the jury to award duplicate damages, and the court's\n\nfailure to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense recognized\n\nin Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998), and\n\nBurlington   Industries   v.   Ellerth,     524   U.S.   742   (1998).     The\n\nMunicipality   concedes   that   it   has    forfeited    these   claims    by\n\ndecisions it made at trial.\n\n           The defendants also mount unsuccessful attacks on the\n\ndistrict court's rulings that the Law 17 claim against Cruz was not\n\ntime-barred, that certain evidence was inadmissible, and that\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\freinstatement was proper.        In short, the defendants lost this case\n\nat trial and they cannot win it here.         We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            We recount the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe verdict.      See Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-Mart P.R., Inc., 434 F.3d\n\n75, 79 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Valentín worked for the Municipal Police of Aguadilla\n\nfrom February 15, 1997 until January 27, 2003, when her employment\n\nwas terminated.1     She was trained at the Police Academy, where she\n\ngraduated at the top of her class.            She worked for a two-year\n\nprobationary period before she became a permanent employee.                  Her\n\nsupervisors, including Cruz, and her coworkers agreed she was a\n\ngood police officer.\n\n            Cruz was an administrative sergeant whose duties included\n\nchecking the officers' entry and exit logs.               He kept track of\n\nattendance and could impose sanctions for attendance problems.                At\n\ntimes, he had direct supervisory authority over Valentín.              He also\n\nhad some power to affect her work assignments.                 He worked in a\n\nsmall    shared   space   with   a   secretarial   pool   of    four   or   five\n\nsecretaries, including Norma Gonzalez and Norma Ortiz.\n\n            In    February   2000,    Valentín,    then   aged    thirty-six,\n\nseparated from her husband; they ultimately were divorced in March\n\n\n\n     1\n       Valentín also had been a police officer from 1988 or 1989 to\n1990, leaving for reasons not material to this case.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f2001.   In August 2000, Cruz began a crude campaign to win her\n\naffections.   His comments were mild initially.            He told her on\n\nseveral occasions that she had \"pretty eyes\" and \"nice hair\" and\n\nthat her husband did not appreciate what he was leaving behind.           He\n\nalso told her she looked beautiful in the morning.               Valentín\n\nobjected to Cruz' remarks. But instead of stopping, Cruz escalated\n\nmatters in September and October of 2000.      He told Valentín she had\n\n\"great legs\" and twice told her she had \"horny\" eyes.            Although\n\nValentín was upset and tried to discourage him, he persisted,\n\ntelling her many times that she was \"hot-hot-hot.\"           He then told\n\nher that her legs were \"pretty enough\" to have \"hooked over his\n\nshoulders.\"\n\n          A number of people at the station knew that Cruz was\n\nchasing Valentín.    Norma Ortiz, one of the secretaries, confirmed\n\nthat Cruz made the reported comments about Valentín's hair, smile,\n\nand legs; that Cruz made such comments only to Valentín; and that\n\nValentín \"looked upset\" because of his approaches.\n\n          Valentín   complained   to    Officer   Hector    Villanueva,    a\n\nfriend of hers and a foot patrolman in the municipal police\n\ndepartment, that since her divorce, Cruz was constantly \"after\n\nher.\"   Villanueva observed Valentín become upset after Cruz said\n\nsomething to her in the hallway.       He noticed that Cruz always went\n\nout of his way to be near Valentín and to \"sidle up next to her.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f              Cruz took to driving by Valentín's house multiple times\n\non the same day and honking his horn.              He admitted doing this to\n\nVillanueva, who also observed him do it.2\n\n              Although the defense denied that the Police Commissioner,\n\nReynaldo      Fernández,   was   aware      of    the   situation,   that    was\n\ncontradicted by Villanueva's testimony that the Commissioner told\n\nCruz, in front of Villanueva and another officer, to get \"that\n\nlittle girlfriend of yours\" (emphasis added) under control.                  The\n\nother officer was Sgt. David Ferrer, who was second in the police\n\nhierarchy and Cruz' good friend.\n\n              Valentín   testified   that    in    early   October   2000,   she\n\ncomplained about Cruz' comments to Norma Gonzalez, the secretaries'\n\nsupervisor and designated complaint-receiver. The Commissioner had\n\ntold the female police officers that if they had any problems with\n\nmale officers, they should go to Gonzalez, who reported directly to\n\nhim.       After that complaint, Cruz' approaches to Valentín stopped\n\nfor a few weeks.3\n\n              Also in October 2000, Valentín attempted to meet with the\n\nCommissioner to complain about Cruz, who had become upset with her\n\nbecause she never greeted him with a kiss on the cheek.                      She\n\n\n       2\n       Cruz conceded frequently driving by, but he said this was\nbecause his house was nearby, and he denied honking his horn.\n       3\n       Gonzalez denied that Valentín had ever complained to her\nabout Cruz. But Ortiz testified that Valentín said she was going\nto complain to Gonzalez about Cruz and that Valentín did tell\nGonzalez that she needed to talk to her about Cruz.\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftestified that this was the first, but not the only, occasion on\n\nwhich she tried to meet with the Commissioner.         The Commissioner\n\ngreeted her at the door, but instead of hearing her complaints\n\nagainst Cruz, he told her to meet with Lt. Juan Vélez, an internal\n\naffairs   investigator    charged   with   handling    equal   employment\n\nopportunity charges for the municipal police.         She met with Vélez\n\nthat same day; he put his arm over her shoulders and said Cruz was\n\nnot at fault, \"that it was [her] fault because [she] had him\n\nbedazzled.\"   Cruz and Vélez were good friends.       The Mayor, Carlos\n\nMéndez, testified that Vélez and the Commissioner did not at that\n\ntime bring the allegations to his attention, even though Vélez' job\n\nwas to bring sexual harassment allegations to the Commissioner, who\n\nwas supposed to bring them to the Mayor.\n\n           After her first attempt to complain to the Commissioner,\n\nValentín testified, she suffered two forms of retaliation. Between\n\nOctober 2000 and January 2001, she was assigned more than five\n\ndouble shifts, although such assignments were uncommon in the\n\nAguadilla police force.    She was also transferred in October 2000\n\nfrom the traffic unit, which was regarded as \"privileged,\" to the\n\nrotating shifts assignment and then to Las Cascadas water park,\n\nwhich was regarded as \"punishment\" because it was remote and the\n\nwork was solitary.   Although it was common for officers \"working\n\nshifts\" to be assigned to Las Cascadas a few times per week,\n\nValentín was permanently assigned there for a one-month period\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fspanning the holidays, ending in early January 2001.4               Two weeks\n\ninto her posting at Las Cascadas, while she was on duty, Cruz\n\nvisited and told her that \"[w]henever [she] stop[ped] being such a\n\nspoiled rotten kid, [he] could get [her] out of there.\"\n\n              Cruz' approaches recommenced in November 2000, when he\n\nleft a note under the wiper of Valentín's car saying that she was\n\n\"his\" and that she should not be giving rides to fellow officers.\n\nIn December 2000, he began to repeatedly ask Valentín if her\n\ndivorce was final yet, telling her that he wanted to marry her and\n\noffering her money to help finalize the divorce.\n\n              Valentín felt uncomfortable and continued to rebuff Cruz'\n\napproaches.        In approximately January 2001, when Valentín again\n\nsaid she was not interested in him, he became angry and told her\n\nshe would be \"screwed\" -- that she \"had to be more affectionate\n\nwith       him\"   or    else   he   and   his   friend   Ferrer   would   exact\n\nretribution.5          Ferrer was in charge of work assignments, and Cruz\n\nalso had some assignment authority.\n\n              In January 2001, Valentín attempted to complain directly\n\nto the Mayor.          She told him she wanted to discuss Cruz, and that\n\n\n\n       4\n       Cruz testified that Valentín did not complain.                 All the\nofficers had to work at Las Cascadas once in a while.                But long\nassignments there were seen as punishment.\n       5\n       Valentín testified that Cruz told her that Ferrer had it in\nfor her, that so far he (Cruz) had been \"protecting\" her from\nFerrer, and that this supposed protection would cease if she would\nnot be more affectionate.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fshe had already attempted to speak with the Commissioner, who had\n\npaid no attention.     The Mayor told her \"he wouldn't have anything\n\nto   do   with   [her],\"   because      the   Commissioner   \"was   like   his\n\nbrother.\"6\n\n             On February 10, 2001, Valentín was at the mall with her\n\nson, and she noticed that Cruz was behind her.            She accused him of\n\nfollowing her, saying this was the third or fourth time such a\n\nthing had happened, but Cruz denied any such thing.            Valentín told\n\nhim she might complain again to the Commissioner.              By this time\n\nValentín had already tried to complain to the Commissioner twice\n\n(in October 2000 and on another date unclear from the record).\n\n             On February 14, 2001, Valentín went to the station house,\n\nintending to try yet again to meet with the Commissioner and to\n\npick up her paycheck before beginning her shift in the town square.\n\nJust before noon, as she was en route, Cruz called her on her\n\ncellular phone and told her not to show up.             He told her that she\n\nhad to go to Las Cascadas and should not come to the station house.\n\nValentín     told   Cruz   that   she     was   going   to   meet   with   the\n\nCommissioner. She did go to the station house, where she collected\n\nher paycheck, but was thereafter prevented from complaining to the\n\nCommissioner by the trio of Cruz, Ferrer, and Vélez.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      The Mayor denies this; he testified that Valentín never came\nto complain about sexual harassment before February 14, 2001.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            Ferrer told her not to leave, whereupon Cruz gave her a\n\nwarning    letter   about    her   tardiness   on   an   earlier   occasion.\n\nValentín said she wanted to speak with the Commissioner, and Cruz\n\ntold her he was not in.        Ferrer told her to wait at the dispatch\n\nofficer's station, because he had to give her other documents.\n\nVélez then called Valentín into his office and told her she was the\n\nsubject of an internal complaint pertaining to Valentín's allegedly\n\ntelling Officer Wilfredo Nieves to \"go to hell\" a month and a half\n\nearlier, on December 28, 2000. Ferrer then came into Vélez' office\n\nand gave Valentín another admonishment letter, this one pertaining\n\nto an allegedly unauthorized absence.\n\n            After Ferrer left, Valentín started to tell Vélez (who\n\nwas in charge of conducting sexual harassment investigations) about\n\nthe situation with Cruz, noting that she had not received any\n\nadmonishments until that very day, just when she was planning to\n\nfile a grievance.      She told Vélez that she was being sexually\n\nharassed; he asked her if she was going to file a complaint against\n\nOfficer Nieves, and she told him \"he knew very well who it was\n\ngoing to be against\" -- she had already complained to Vélez about\n\nCruz in October 2000.       Vélez told her that the Commissioner was not\n\npresent and she would have to wait to meet with him.\n\n            After a frustrating hour during which she got nowhere and\n\nreceived   documents    pertaining     to   three   separate   disciplinary\n\nmatters, an agitated Valentín went to the dispatch area. There she\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fattempted to call an organization that provides legal services to\n\npolice officers, but Ferrer took the telephone from her hands.\n\nThere are varying accounts of her behavior and that of other\n\nparticipants, but the upshot is that she left the station by\n\nambulance, having suffered what she calls a nervous breakdown.\n\n              She did not return to her job until October 1, 2001.\n\nBetween   February      14    and      October    1,    she    received      psychiatric\n\ntreatment from the State Insurance Fund (SIF), which \"referred\n\n[her]   for    rest.\"        It    is    unclear      whether    she   received       some\n\ndisability payments during this period.                     She testified that she\n\nexhausted sick leave and vacation leave, ceased earning a salary in\n\nmid-April,     and   fell    behind       on    her    mortgage.       She    asked    for\n\npermission to return to work because she needed the money.                            She\n\ncontinued treatment once she returned to work.\n\n              On February 26, 2001, Valentín filed an administrative\n\ncomplaint before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment of Labor; the complaint was referred to the Equal\n\nEmployment     Opportunity        Commission       (EEOC)      under   a   work-sharing\n\nagreement.      On the complaint, Valentín lists the Municipality,\n\nCruz, and Vélez as having discriminated against her. The complaint\n\nalleges sexual harassment by Cruz and retaliation by Cruz \"and\n\nother   supervisors.\"             It    was    only    after    Valentín      filed    the\n\nadministrative complaint that there was any investigation of her\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fclaims   of   harassment;   the   Mayor    then   ordered   an   internal\n\ninvestigation.7\n\n          Valentín returned to work on October 1, 2001 and was\n\nassigned to the San Antonio station house. She and another officer\n\nwere assigned to do foot patrols.         The other officer was armed;\n\nValentín was not. Her psychiatrist recommended that she work at an\n\noffice or on dispatch, to avoid having to intervene with people.\n\nAfter eighteen days of foot patrol, Valentín was assigned to a\n\nstate police station classifying complaints, which she did until\n\nJanuary 28, 2002. Valentín testified that she was supervised there\n\nby a state police sergeant, but also that she was visited once or\n\ntwice a week by the Commissioner, Ferrer, and Cruz.              She left\n\nbecause of these visits, which made her too uncomfortable to\n\ncontinue working and forced her to once again seek time off and\n\ntreatment from the SIF.\n\n          On January 3, 2003, while away from work and under\n\ntreatment, Valentín filed this lawsuit in the Puerto Rico federal\n\ndistrict court, alleging violations of Title VII and Law 17.          She\n\nnamed as defendants the Municipality, Cruz, and Vélez.           She later\n\nadded Méndez, the Mayor, as a defendant.\n\n\n\n     7\n        The Mayor testified that he initiated the internal\ninvestigation after learning that Valentín had complained to the\nstate police.    Neither party has called this complaint to our\nattention. We need only note that, from the record, it appears\nthat this complaint post-dated the events of February 14, 2001 and\nwas essentially contemporaneous with the administrative complaint.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f            On January 28, 2003, she received clearance from SIF to\n\nreturn to work.     She returned that very day, signing in for duty\n\nand remaining at the station house until noon, when she was\n\nsummoned to the Human Resources Department.           There she was given a\n\nletter written by the Mayor, dated January 27, 2003.               It was a\n\nletter of intent to lay off; the reason given was that she had not\n\nreported to work for over 360 days.         The parties stipulated that\n\nValentín was terminated from employment \"as per\" this letter.              In\n\nresponse to this discharge, Valentín amended the complaint that she\n\nhad already filed in the federal district court to include an\n\nadditional retaliation claim and a due process claim.\n\n            The district court dismissed Valentín's Title VII claims\n\nagainst Méndez, Cruz, and Vélez, applying district court precedent\n\nto   the   effect   that   Title   VII   does   not   impose   liability   on\n\nindividuals.    Valentín does not appeal this determination.           This\n\nleft, as to the individual defendants, the Law 17 claims.                  The\n\ndistrict court denied the individual defendants' motion to dismiss\n\nthese claims as time-barred, holding that Valentín had tolled the\n\nstatute of limitations on her Law 17 claims when she filed her\n\nadministrative complaint on February 26, 2001. The court did grant\n\nMéndez' motion to dismiss the claims against him in his personal\n\ncapacity.     After Valentín rested her case at trial, the court\n\ndismissed the claims against Vélez.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           The jury found the Municipality liable for $250,000 in\n\ncompensatory damages on the Title VII claim.               The jury awarded\n\n$250,000   against    the   Municipality   and      $80,000    against    Cruz\n\nindividually   in    compensatory    damages   on    the    Law   17   claims.\n\nFinally, the jury found the Municipality liable for $125,000 in\n\ncompensatory damages on the due process claim.             The total initial\n\njury award was $705,000.      After the verdict, Valentín sought and\n\nobtained reinstatement and doubling of the damages on the Law 17\n\nclaims; this doubling of the Law 17 amounts resulted in a total\n\njury award that just topped $1 million.             The court denied the\n\ndefendants' joint motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, remittitur of the damages award, or a new trial.              Cruz and\n\nthe Municipality appeal.\n\n                                    II.\n\nA.         Legal Standards\n\n           Valentín's Title VII and Law 17 claims alleged both\n\nsexual harassment and retaliation for her complaints about the\n\nharassment.8   The sexual harassment case encompassed both the\n\ntheories of hostile work environment and quid pro quo.            The claims\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        Cruz and the Municipality say the standards for liability\ngoverning Title VII claims are the same as those governing Law 17\nclaims, see Hernandez-Loring v. Universidad Metropolitana, 233 F.3d\n49, 52 (1st Cir. 2000), and they argue only under Title VII\nstandards. As this approach only simplifies matters for Valentín,\nwe proceed solely under Title VII.\n\n                                    -13-\n\falso invoke the law on employer liability for the harassing acts of\n\na co-worker and a supervisor.\n\n            Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is an\n\nunlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge or\n\notherwise   to   discriminate   against    a   person   with   respect   to\n\n\"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\"\n\nbecause of the person's sex.     42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).\n\n            One way of violating Title VII is \"requiring people to\n\nwork in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.\" Harris\n\nv. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).        In O'Rourke v. City of\n\nProvidence, 235 F.3d 713 (1st Cir. 2001), we described the essence\n\nof a hostile work environment claim: \"Title VII . . . allows a\n\nplaintiff to prove unlawful discrimination by showing that 'the\n\nworkplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule,\n\nand insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the\n\nconditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.'\"    Id. at 728 (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21) (some\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).        In O'Rourke, we described the\n\n\"sufficiently severe or pervasive\" element as one of several a\n\nplaintiff must establish to show a hostile work environment:\n\n            (1) that she (or he) is a member of a\n            protected class; (2) that she was subjected to\n            unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the\n            harassment was based upon sex; (4) that the\n            harassment    was   sufficiently    severe   or\n            pervasive so as to alter the conditions of\n            plaintiff's employment and create an abusive\n            work    environment;    (5)    that    sexually\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          objectionable conduct was both objectively and\n          subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable\n          person would find it hostile or abusive and\n          the victim in fact did perceive it to be so;\n          and (6) that some basis for employer liability\n          has been established.\n\nId.\n\n          Application of the hostile work environment test requires\n\nan assessment of the totality of the circumstances, including \"the\n\nfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it\n\nis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;   and    whether       it   unreasonably      interferes    with     an\n\nemployee's work performance.\"          Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.         Although\n\noffhand remarks and isolated incidents are not enough, \"[e]vidence\n\nof sexual remarks, innuendoes, ridicule, and intimidation may be\n\nsufficient   to    support    a    jury       verdict   for   a   hostile     work\n\nenvironment.\"     O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 729.\n\n          Quid pro quo sexual harassment also violates Title VII.\n\nIn this form of harassment, \"an employee or supervisor uses his or\n\nher superior position to extract sexual favors from a subordinate\n\nemployee, and if denied those favors, retaliates by taking action\n\nadversely affecting the subordinate's employment.\" Id. at 728; see\n\nalso Hernandez-Loring v. Universidad Metropolitana, 233 F.3d 49, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (\"Under Title VII, quid pro quo sexual harassment\n\ncan be shown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish\n\na subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.\").\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f              Retaliation, yet another basis for liability under Title\n\nVII, is discrimination against an employee because the employee\n\nhas, inter alia, \"opposed\" an unlawful employment practice under\n\nTitle VII or \"made a charge . . . or participated in any manner in\n\nan investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under Title VII.                               42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).           A retaliation claim requires a showing that\n\n(1)    the    plaintiff      engaged     in    protected   conduct;        (2)    she   was\n\nsubjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a\n\ncausal connection between the first and second elements.                          Noviello\n\nv. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 88 (1st Cir. 2005).                              Protected\n\nconduct includes not only the filing of administrative complaints,\n\nid.,    but    also    complaining       to    one's   supervisors.          Benoit      v.\n\nTechnical Mfg. Corp., 331 F.3d 166, 175 (1st Cir. 2003).                                 An\n\nemployment action, to be adverse, \"must materially change the\n\nconditions\"      of    the     plaintiff's        employment;    examples         include\n\n\"disadvantageous            transfers    or     assignments\"     and       \"unwarranted\n\nnegative job evaluations.\"              Gu v. Boston Police Dep't, 312 F.3d 6,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental\n\nTrading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n              \"Once the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of\n\nretaliation,\"         the     \"defendant       must    articulate      a    legitimate,\n\nnon-retaliatory        reason     for    its    employment     decision.           If   the\n\ndefendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must now show that the\n\nproffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\faction was the result of the defendant's retaliatory animus.\"\n\nCalero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   The defendant's burden is one of production only; the\n\nburden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff.         Provencher v. CVS\n\nPharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Where the plaintiff has shown sexual harassment by a\n\nsupervisor, the employer is not necessarily strictly liable for the\n\nsupervisor's misconduct.       Under Ellerth and Faragher, where a\n\nsupervisor   (here,   Cruz)   is   involved,   there   are   a   series   of\n\nspecialized rules and defenses depending on whether there has been\n\na tangible employment action. We recently summarized the rules for\n\ncases of actionable discrimination by supervisors:\n\n          (1) An employer is subject to vicarious\n          liability to a victimized employee for an\n          actionable hostile environment created by a\n          supervisor with immediate (or successively\n          higher) authority over the employee.\n          (2) Where no tangible employment action is\n          taken, a defending employer may raise an\n          affirmative defense to liability or damages,\n          subject to proof by a preponderance of the\n          evidence.\n          (3) No affirmative defense is available when\n          the supervisor's harassment culminates in a\n          tangible employment action, such as discharge,\n          demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\n          (4) The affirmative defense, when available,\n          comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the\n          employer exercised reasonable care to prevent\n          and correct promptly any harassing behavior,\n          and   (b)   that   the    plaintiff   employee\n          unreasonably failed to take advantage of any\n          preventive    or   corrective    opportunities\n          provided by the employer or to avoid harm\n          otherwise. The employer bears the burden of\n          proof as to both elements.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          (5) As to the first element of the defense,\n          proof of an anti-harassment policy with a\n          complaint procedure available to employees,\n          while   not   necessarily    dispositive,   is\n          relevant.\n          (6) As to the second element of the defense,\n          proof that the employee failed to meet his\n          obligation of using reasonable care is not\n          limited to an unreasonable failure to use such\n          a procedure, although such proof will normally\n          suffice to meet the employer's burden.\n\nArrieta-Colon, 434 F.3d at 86 (internal quotation marks, ellipses,\n\nand citations omitted) (quoting Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807-08).\n\nB.        Sufficiency of the Evidence of Harassment and Retaliation\n\n          We review de novo the district court's denial of the\n\ndefense motions under Rule 50 for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nWhite v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nWe review the evidence and draw inferences from it in the light\n\nmost favorable to the verdict, making no determinations of our own\n\nas to the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence,\n\nreversing \"only if a reasonable person could not have reached the\n\nconclusion   of   the   jury.\"   Id.    The   jury   was   not   asked    to\n\ndistinguish among hostile work environment, other forms of sexual\n\nharassment (such as quid pro quo), and retaliation in finding\n\nliability under Title VII and Law 17.         Each and every potential\n\nbasis of liability was supported by ample evidence.\n\n          1.      Harassment\n\n          There are two themes to the defendants' arguments.             The\n\nfirst is that the incidents here were too minimal to support a\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fhostile work environment or quid pro quo claim as a matter of law.\n\nThe second is a back-door attack on Valentín's credibility.                  The\n\nsecond can be quickly dispatched.              Credibility of witnesses is\n\nsimply not a basis for attacking a jury verdict in a sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence challenge.      See id.\n\n            As for the first defense theory, the jury, which heard\n\nthe witnesses, rejected the defense of triviality and, on the facts\n\nhere, was entitled to do so.        The picture painted by the defense\n\nfocuses on Cruz' comments and argues that any woman, particularly\n\na police officer, could handle them.              The defense ignores the\n\nconduct of Cruz -- his constant efforts at physical proximity, his\n\nrepeatedly cruising by Valentín's house, the so-called \"chance\"\n\nmeeting    at   the   shopping   mall,   his    leaving   a   note   under   the\n\nwindshield wiper of her car saying she was his.               The defense also\n\nignores that the repeated visits of the Commissioner, Cruz, and\n\nFerrer while Valentín was working at the state police station made\n\nher so uncomfortable that she was unable to continue working.\n\n            The defense ignores that Cruz threatened to and did make\n\ncompliance with his demands a condition of avoiding punishment at\n\nwork.     He threatened Valentín that she would be \"screwed\" if she\n\nwould not react more affectionately to his unwanted advances.                The\n\nthreat was not an empty one.        He had already seen to it that she\n\nreceived unfavorable work assignments: he effectively admitted to\n\nher at Las Cascadas that her continued posting there was his doing\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f(through his and his friend Ferrer's mutual control over the work\n\nassignments), and that it could be avoided if she would acquiesce.\n\nValentín was removed from the privileged traffic division and\n\nsingled out for extra double shifts and for extended posting at Las\n\nCascadas, above and beyond what ordinarily would be expected.                       And\n\nthe jury could conclude that Cruz delivered an admonishment letter\n\nto Valentín, had his friend Ferrer do the same, and had his friend\n\nVélez     simultaneously     deliver        news    of    a    month-and-a-half-old\n\ninternal complaint, as a form of reprisal for her refusal to give\n\nin   to   his     demands   (and   as   a    method       of   deterring     her   from\n\ncomplaining to the Commissioner).\n\n             2.     Retaliation\n\n             The    Municipality     argues        that   there     was   insufficient\n\nevidence of retaliation.9          This argument is without merit.\n\n             In October 2000, Valentín engaged in protected conduct by\n\ncomplaining       about   Cruz'    sexual    harassment        to   Norma   Gonzalez,\n\nattempting to complain to the Commissioner, and complaining to\n\nVélez.     All three were proper people to whom to complain.                        And\n\n\n      9\n       Cruz makes no such argument, apparently on the assumption\nthat his liability under Law 17 must have been based only on sexual\nharassment. This might be correct, but is not necessarily so. The\njury charge was somewhat ambiguous, and the verdict form even more\nso; the latter arguably permitted the jury to find Cruz liable\nunder Law 17 for retaliation. Cruz has not argued that this did\nnot happen, or that if it did, it would have been impermissible.\nIn any event, Cruz' sufficiency challenge fails on the ground he\ndid understand to be implicated: assuming the jury held him liable\nonly on the sexual harassment theory, that finding was amply\nsupported.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fbeginning in that very same month, Valentín was assigned extra\n\ndouble shifts, removed from her favorable traffic duty, and given\n\nan unusually long posting at Las Cascadas, where the work was\n\nremote and solitary.      The jury could easily regard the totality of\n\nthese   assignments,      following    swiftly    on    the   heels    of   her\n\ncomplaints,   as   well    as   the   disciplinary     letters,   as   adverse\n\nemployment actions caused by Valentín's complaints.\n\n          On February 14, 2001, Valentín said she was going to\n\ncomplain to the Commissioner, and Cruz responded as soon as she\n\narrived by giving her an admonishment letter.                 When Valentín\n\nreiterated her desire to speak with the Commissioner, Vélez gave\n\nher a document about an alleged disciplinary problem, and Ferrer\n\ngave her another admonishment letter.            The letters were adverse\n\nemployment actions.       See Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 25 (memorandum\n\nof admonishment is adverse employment action). The jury could find\n\nthat they were causally related to Valentín's protected conduct,\n\nboth in the recent past and as contemplated in the immediate future\n\n-- although her stated intentions to pursue the matter that very\n\nday never came to fruition, because she was driven past the\n\nbreaking point by these very tactics.\n\n          The Municipality does not, on appeal, address any of\n\nthese pre-termination incidents.         It focuses only on termination.\n\nEven assuming this narrow focus to be warranted, it fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f            On February 26, 2001, Valentín filed an administrative\n\ncomplaint about the sexual harassment and retaliation that she had\n\nsuffered to date.    On January 3, 2003, she filed this lawsuit.    By\n\nthe end of that month, she had been terminated.10     The Municipality\n\nsays this was not an adverse employment action because it was a\n\n\"statutory termination\" that became \"self-executing\" when Valentín\n\nfailed to avail herself of certain procedures under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.    The Municipality relies on P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, § 7, part\n\nof the Workmen's Compensation Act. That provision provides that an\n\nemployer must reserve the position of an employee out on disability\n\n(as Valentín was here) and reinstate her, provided, inter alia,\n\nthat the employee demands reinstatement within a year of the date\n\nher job-related disability began.       Id. § 7(1).   The Municipality\n\nargues, on the basis of this provision, that Valentín's termination\n\nwas \"statutory\" because she took too long to seek reinstatement.11\n\nThe Municipality uses this same argument to say that even if\n\n\n       10\n        The Municipality, stressing the timing, argues that the\ntermination was not causally connected to the administrative\ncomplaint. But the Mayor conceded at trial that, in signing the\ntermination letter, he took into consideration the fact that\nValentín had filed a claim against the Municipality. It is unclear\nwhether he was referring to the administrative complaint or the\ncivil suit, filed less than a month earlier, but the Municipality\nfails to address this point at all.\n       11\n       The Municipality also argues that the termination \"became\nself-executing\" when Valentín failed to contest it \"within the time\nframe prescribed by state law.\"      It is unclear whether this\nargument is meant to be distinct from the \"statutory termination\"\nargument under § 7.     In any event, the Municipality cites no\nadditional authority for any time frame other than the one in § 7.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fValentín made a prima facie showing of retaliation, it rebutted\n\nthat showing by proving that it had a legitimate reason for the\n\ntermination and that it would have taken the same action in any\n\nevent, \"to comply with\" § 7.\n\n           Nothing in this provision of Puerto Rico law means that\n\nthe employer is obliged to terminate an employee, even after a year\n\nhas elapsed.     The Municipality suggests that this provision, meant\n\nto protect disabled workers, somehow creates a duty to fire them if\n\nthey have not requested reinstatement by a certain time, even if\n\nthe employers are willing to grant extra time. The suggestion that\n\nthe Municipality had to terminate Valentín \"to comply with\" this\n\nprovision, or that hers was a \"statutory termination,\" contravenes\n\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's clear policy that the Workmen's\n\nCompensation Act \"must be liberally construed in favor of those\n\nwhom it seeks to protect.\"         García Díaz v. Darex P.R., Inc., 148\n\nP.R. Dec. 364, 374 n.11 (P.R. 1999) (certified translation supplied\n\nby defendants); see also Rivera-Flores v. P.R. Tel. Co., 64 F.3d\n\n742,   750-51    (1st    Cir.   1995).   The    Municipality     was   free    to\n\nreinstate Valentín at any time, whether or not a year had passed.\n\n           Although the Municipality did not have to fire Valentín,\n\nwe assume arguendo that the duration of Valentín's second, extended\n\nabsence   from    work    could   have   been   a   legitimate    reason      for\n\ntermination of her employment. Even so, the jury was not compelled\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fto find that this was in fact the cause of her termination, or that\n\nthe termination was not an adverse employment action.12\n\nC.                Lack of Faragher/Ellerth Jury Instruction\n\n                  The Municipality argues that the court should have given\n\nit the benefit of a Faragher/Ellerth instruction. The Municipality\n\nhas taken the position that Cruz was Valentín's supervisor.                It\n\nargues that even if the record shows that there was severe and\n\npervasive harassment, there still was no tangible employment action\n\ntaken against her, and so it was entitled to assert the affirmative\n\ndefense under Faragher/Ellerth.13\n\n                  The Municipality has not pointed to where in the record\n\nit ever requested a Faragher/Ellerth instruction.              Such a request\n\ndoes        not    appear     in   the   defendants'   joint   proposed   jury\n\ninstructions, submitted before trial.              In any event, the matter\n\narose before the court instructed the jury, when the court noted\n\nthat the Municipality's anti-sexual-harassment policy itself was\n\nnot in evidence.            The court reasoned that this omission meant the\n\n\n       12\n       The Municipality goes so far as to suggest that Valentín\n\"was not terminated.\" This contention is plainly contrary to the\nrecord, including the parties' stipulations.\n       13\n       The Municipality goes beyond seeking a new trial. It claims\nit was actually entitled to judgment as a matter of law against any\nliability for Cruz' conduct. It argues that a properly instructed\njury not only might have found, but would have been compelled to\nfind, that the Faragher/Ellerth defense was satisfied. But in the\npost-trial motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the verdict\nand   other   relief,   the   defense   failed   to   discuss   the\nFaragher/Ellerth defense at all. The argument, even if it had been\npreserved, fails for the reasons stated in the text.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fjury had no way of knowing what opportunities, provided by the\n\nMunicipality, Valentín had failed to pursue. Counsel for Cruz said\n\n\"[w]e have no objections [to the court's not giving a Faragher\n\ninstruction] . . . . We know the manual is not in evidence.\"\n\nCounsel for the Municipality stood silently by, as the Municipality\n\nconcedes in its reply brief.   There were no objections after the\n\njury charge was given.\n\n          Valentín argues that the Municipality expressly waived\n\nthe Faragher/Ellerth defense. The Municipality counters that Cruz'\n\nattorney did not speak for it.     Although Valentín asserts that\n\nthere was a work-sharing arrangement under which Cruz' waiver was\n\nbinding on the Municipality, and it appears that defense counsel\n\ndid de facto divide up many tasks, she has not pointed to any\n\nrecord evidence of a binding arrangement.    We therefore give the\n\nMunicipality the benefit of the doubt and treat the issue as\n\nforfeited, not waived, and we review for plain error.   See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 51(d)(2).\n\n          This means the Municipality must show that an error was\n\ncommitted, that it was plain (meaning obvious), that the error was\n\nprejudicial (meaning it affected substantial rights), and that\n\nreview is needed to prevent a \"miscarriage of justice\" (meaning\n\nthat the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings\").    Rivera Castillo v.\n\nAutokirey, Inc., 379 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fmarks omitted) (quoting Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); Muñiz v. Rovira, 373 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n            The Municipality does not explain why the failure to give\n\nthe instruction is plain error, and in any event it cannot make\n\nsuch a showing.     Plain error review requires that there be an\n\nerror.    There was none.     As this court recently observed, \"[w]here\n\nthe evidence shows that the defendant cannot prove an affirmative\n\ndefense under the Faragher standard, there is no reason to remand\n\nfor the giving of a Faragher instruction.\" Arrieta-Colon, 434 F.3d\n\nat 87.    Although there was testimony that the Municipality had an\n\nanti-sexual-harassment policy, there is no evidence that it was\n\ndistributed or that employees of the police department knew about\n\nit until after several of the crucial events in this case.14         There\n\nis no basis in the evidence that would permit a finding that the\n\nMunicipality exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\n\npromptly any harassing behavior.\n\n            Further, the Municipality has made no case that Valentín\n\nunreasonably    failed   to    take   advantage   of   any   preventive   or\n\ncorrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm\n\n\n     14\n       Valentín first received a copy of the Municipality's policy\nin November 2001; she had never, as an employee, attended a seminar\nwhere that policy was explained. Ortiz also testified that until\n2001, she had never been given a copy of the Municipality's policy.\nVélez testified that he did not recall receiving any sexual\nharassment training from the Municipality before February 14, 2001.\nThe Mayor testified that the policy \"should have\" been distributed\nto employees within weeks of its adoption in September 2000, but he\ndid not recall how the policy was actually distributed.\n\n                                      -26-\n\fotherwise. Assuming such opportunities were even open to Valentín,\n\nin fact and not just on paper, she pursued them.        She complained --\n\nand attempted to complain -- repeatedly, to several different\n\nindividuals who were proper people to whom to complain.          She was\n\nignored or worse at every turn. The Municipality's point that none\n\nof her complaints were in writing is a non sequitur in light of its\n\nfailure to show that complaints had to be in writing.\n\nD.        Due Process Claim\n\n          The   jury   awarded   Valentín    $125,000   in   compensatory\n\ndamages for the Municipality's failure to comply with her federal\n\ndue process rights.    The basis of this claim was that Valentín, as\n\na tenured municipal employee, was entitled to a hearing before she\n\nwas deprived of her employment, and that the Municipality did not\n\nprovide such a pre-termination hearing.\n\n          The Municipality argues that the issue was a pure one of\n\nlaw for the court and it was an error to submit it to a jury.         It\n\nargues that Valentín has no due process claim because even if she\n\noriginally had a property interest in the position as a permanent\n\nemployee, she lost that interest.        That, it argues, is because as\n\na matter of law, she lost her job by operation of the Workmen's\n\nCompensation Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, § 7, when more than 360\n\ndays -- treated as a year under § 7, see Torres González v. Star\n\nKist Caribe, Inc., 134 P.R. Dec. 1024, 1033 n.4 (P.R. 1994),\n\nofficial translation available at 1994 WL 909600 -- had elapsed\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fsince she last reported to work; and because this \"statutory\"\n\ndischarge became \"final and self-executing\" when she failed to take\n\nan administrative appeal.             According to the Municipality, the\n\ndistrict     court   erred   as   a   matter     of   law    in    \"creat[ing]   the\n\nimpression of voluntary discharge.\"              The argument fails for two\n\nreasons: the Municipality never presented it to the district court,\n\nand the premise of the argument itself is wrong.\n\n             The Municipality did not object to the jury instruction\n\non   due    process,   either     before    or   after      it    was   given.   The\n\nMunicipality says that its failure to preserve the issue as to the\n\njury instructions does not matter, because \"this matter was brought\n\nup by the Defendants at trial as an issue of law that should have\n\nbeen resolved by the District Court and should have not been an\n\nissue for the jury to resolve.\"            The Municipality does not support\n\nthis claim of preservation at trial with any citations to the\n\nrecord.15      The Municipality cannot sandbag the court                    and its\n\nopponent by not raising the issue and then saying the court should\n\nhave seen it.\n\n\n\n\n      15\n       The Municipality may be referring to an argument made by\nCruz' attorney in support of a Rule 50 motion at the close of all\nthe evidence.     Even assuming Cruz' attorney spoke for the\nMunicipality (contrary to the Municipality's own contentions\nelsewhere), the argument made was only that if Valentín had sought\na hearing or taken an administrative appeal under Puerto Rico law,\nshe could have avoided any damages \"even after the 360 days had\nelapsed.\" Cruz' attorney did not argue that the Municipality was\nsomehow forced to fire Valentín.\n\n                                       -28-\n\f              We have already rejected the Municipality's reading of\n\n§ 7.        \"[I]t is merely the employee's absolute right not to be\n\nterminated on account of her disability, rather than her property\n\ninterest      in    her   employment    position,    which   lapses    under   the\n\none-year           workers'    compensation         'caducity'        provision.\"\n\nRivera-Flores, 64 F.3d at 750.                  Valentín did have a property\n\ninterest in her employment.            That interest could not be taken away\n\nwithout the provision of procedural due process, including a pre-\n\ntermination hearing, the right to which did not lapse automatically\n\non any particular date.         See id. at 750-51.\n\n              The evidence permitted the jury to find that Valentín had\n\nan ongoing property interest in her job and that she was terminated\n\nfrom her job without an opportunity for hearing.16\n\nE.            Statute of Limitations Defense as to Law 17\n\n              The district court denied the individual defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss the Law 17 claims as time barred.                    Cruz, who\n\n\n\n       16\n        The Municipality says the onus was on Valentín to follow\ncertain procedures. It says that under Puerto Rico law, she should\nhave sought a pre-termination hearing within fifteen days. The\nMunicipality does not specify within fifteen days of what event --\npresumably of the date Valentín received the termination letter,\nwhich is the date her employment ended, as the parties stipulated.\nA later hearing can hardly have been \"pre-termination,\" and it was\nthe Municipality's duty to provide such a hearing.             The\nMunicipality also points to Valentín's failure to appeal her\ntermination to the Puerto Rico agency known as \"JASAP\" within\nthirty days. These procedural arguments are waived due to lack of\ndevelopment on appeal. The Municipality cites no authority for the\nexistence, application, or effect of the Puerto Rico procedures\nsaid to have been ignored by Valentín.\n\n                                         -29-\n\fraises a timeliness challenge on appeal, is affected because Law 17\n\nwas the only basis for the damages award against him, and for the\n\ndoubling of the award.17\n\n               Under Puerto Rico law, Law 17 claims must be brought\n\nwithin one year.       See 29 P.R. Laws Ann. § 155m; Matos Ortiz v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 103 F. Supp. 2d 59, 63 (D.P.R. 2000) (collecting\n\ncases).     Cruz argues that the last act of sexual harassment was in\n\nNovember of 2000, that the statute ran in November of 2001, and\n\nthat the civil complaint was filed in January of 2003.                There are\n\nseveral responses, including the response that Cruz ignores the\n\nfact    that    Valentín   also   complained   of    an   ongoing    pattern    of\n\nharassment and retaliation well after November 2000.\n\n               In order to resolve what may be a recurring issue,\n\nthough, we focus on the legal ground used by the district court to\n\nreject Cruz' argument.        The court held that Valentín tolled the\n\nstatute of limitations on the Law 17 claim when she filed her\n\nadministrative      complaint     on   February     26,   2001,     because    the\n\ncomplaint contained \"the identical cause of action\" as that later\n\nraised in the civil suit.\n\n               Under Puerto Rico law, the statute of limitations is\n\ntolled by a plaintiff's extrajudicial claim.              P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n31, § 5303.         \"The tolling is effective with regard only to\n\n\n       17\n        The Municipality is affected by Law 17, which doubled a\nportion of the compensatory damages award, but it does not raise a\ntimeliness challenge on appeal.\n\n                                       -30-\n\fidentical causes of action.\" Benitez-Pons v. Puerto Rico, 136 F.3d\n\n54, 59 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n\nRodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\nThe relief sought in the extrajudicial claim must be the same as\n\nthat later sought in court.         Id. at 59-60.\n\n              Cruz argues that, as a matter of law, Valentín's \"charge\n\nbefore      the   EEOC\"   cannot   be   identical      to   the    district   court\n\ncomplaint against him, because it is doubtful there can be a Title\n\nVII complaint against an individual.18             Because a cause of action\n\nagainst him could not have been brought under Title VII, he says,\n\nthe EEOC complaint could not have been identical with, and did not\n\ntoll the statute of limitations on, Valentín's Law 17 claim against\n\nhim.\n\n              Cruz'   entire   argument        rests   on    the    premise    that\n\nValentín's administrative claim was originally brought before the\n\nEEOC under Title VII exclusively.          This premise is incorrect.           The\n\nclaim was originally filed before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of\n\n\n\n\n       18\n       This court has not decided the issue of whether Title VII\nliability can be imposed on individuals and need not do so here.\nPrecedent in the District of Puerto Rico, which Valentín does not\nchallenge, bars Title VII liability against individuals. Maldonado\nCordero v. AT&T, 73 F. Supp. 2d 177, 184 (D.P.R. 1999).\n\n                                        -31-\n\fthe Puerto Rico Department of Labor,19 and it was not brought\n\nexclusively under Title VII.\n\n             Valentín listed Cruz among those who had discriminated\n\nagainst her.        She alleged, inter alia, that she had been the victim\n\nof sexual harassment and reprisals by Cruz.                     Valentín's cause of\n\naction      under    Law   17    is    identical        to   that   raised   in   the\n\nadministrative complaint.                  The administrative charge does not\n\nexplicitly cite any law -- Title VII, Law 17, or otherwise.                       But\n\nexcept for the fact that Law 17 expressly allows for individual\n\nliability, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 155a, 155d, 155j, Puerto\n\nRico    interprets      Law     17    as    congruent    with    Title   VII.     The\n\nadministrative complaint stated all the elements necessary for a\n\nLaw 17 claim and put Cruz on notice of the discrimination claim\n\nagainst him, as an individual.                As for remedy, Valentín asked for\n\nvarious forms of relief, including compensatory damages -- the same\n\nthing she sought from Cruz in the civil suit.\n\n             This was enough to toll the statute of limitations.                  The\n\ntolling effect continued until the conclusion of the administrative\n\nproceeding.         See Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,\n\n399 F.3d 52, 61 (1st Cir. 2005).                   Here, that conclusion was no\n\n\n\n       19\n       The parties have not briefed the issue of whether Law 17\nactually requires the filing of a prior administrative claim. It\nappears there may be no such requirement. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n29, § 155l (\"It shall not be necessary to exhaust all\nadministrative remedies for the purpose of initiating judicial\nprocedures under §§ 155-155l of this title.\").\n\n                                            -32-\n\fearlier than April 1, 2002, the date on which the EEOC issued a\n\ndetermination that there was reason to believe the alleged sexual\n\nharassment and retaliation had in fact occurred.     Valentín had a\n\nyear from that date (and arguably from a later date, for reasons\n\nwhich are unnecessary to elaborate here) to file this lawsuit, and\n\nshe did so with months to spare.20   See Rodriguez Narvaez, 895 F.2d\n\nat 43 (stating that \"the statute of limitations begins to run anew\"\n\nwhen the tolling ends).\n\nF.        Remitittur\n\n          Defendants argue that the damages awarded are duplicative\n\nand in any event excessive.\n\n          The Municipality argues that the compensatory damages\n\naward is duplicative in two senses:     there is an overlap between\n\nthe Title VII and Law 17 claims and, second, there is an overlap\n\nbetween the due process claim and the Title VII/Law 17 claims.   In\n\n\n\n     20\n        The Municipality, as already stated, does not make a\ntimeliness argument. Individual liability aside, it seems clear\nthat the filing of an administrative complaint before either the\nPuerto Rico Department of Labor or the EEOC would have been\nsufficient to toll the Law 17 statute of limitations. Either is\nsufficient under Puerto Rico's Law 100. See Rodriguez-Torres, 399\nF.3d at 61. This same rule applies to Law 69, and there is no\nreason to think the rule should be different for Law 17. See id.\n(noting that both Laws 69 and 100 \"serve the purpose of combating\ngender discrimination in employment,\" that \"Law 69 is merely an\namplification of the principles contained in Law 100,\" and that the\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court would probably apply the tolling rules of\nLaw 100 to Law 69); Matos Ortiz, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 64 (making same\nobservation as to Laws 17, 69, and 100, and concluding that \"Law 17\nand Law 69 are . . . to be interpreted in pari materia with Law\n100\").\n\n                               -33-\n\fthe Municipality's view, Valentín was awarded damages for the same\n\nbasic harms -- sexual harassment and eventual termination --\n\nmultiple times, under different legal theories.\n\n            The Municipality concedes that to the extent damages are\n\nproperly awarded under Law 17, they are subject to mandatory\n\ndoubling.    See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 155j(1).       As to any\n\npossible overlap in damages between or among the Title VII, Law 17,\n\nand due process claims, in this circuit, the primary mechanisms to\n\navoid impermissible duplicate awards for damages are the jury\n\ninstructions and the structure of the verdict form. \"To the extent\n\nthat a jury award on both claims would be duplicative, the proper\n\npractice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so as to\n\nallow the jury to recompense the plaintiff['s] injuries just once.\"\n\nAcevedo-Garcia v. Monroig, 351 F.3d 547, 569 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nDefendants should request instructions clearly directing the jury\n\nto compensate the plaintiff's injuries just once.    Id. at 570.\n\n            Once again, this is a defense which was given away at\n\ntrial.   The Municipality concedes that it never objected at trial\n\nto the proposed verdict form or to the court's failure to charge\n\nthe jury as to any possible overlap.   Nor did it raise the argument\n\nafter the jury returned the verdict and before the jury was\n\ndischarged and the judgment was entered.   In the post-trial motion\n\nseeking remitittur or a new trial, there was no argument as to\n\n\n\n\n                                -34-\n\fduplication; the only argument raised was that the damages were\n\nsimply \"excessive\" in light of the evidence.\n\n            The Municipality falls back, in its reply brief, on plain\n\nerror review.   See id.; Chestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (en banc).    But it still does not explain how the\n\ndoctrine helps it.    That argument is waived for lack of appellate\n\ndevelopment.    See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n            We turn, then, to the claim that, aside from any possible\n\nduplication, the sums awarded were simply too great in light of the\n\nevidence.    Even if we viewed the award as quite generous, that is\n\nnot the test.     The award will not be overturned unless it is\n\ngrossly excessive or so high as to shock the conscience of this\n\ncourt.    O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 733.    Further, \"[w]e accord broad\n\ndiscretion to the trial court's decision to affirm the jury's award\n\nof damages because of that court's greater familiarity with local\n\ncommunity standards and with the witnesses' demeanor at the trial.\"\n\nBrown v. Freedman Baking Co., 810 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            There was, to begin with, evidence of serious economic\n\ndamages. Valentín was wrongfully deprived of her salary, both when\n\nshe was driven by defendants' conduct to take disability leaves,\n\nand later when she was terminated outright.21    Moreover, while she\n\n\n     21\n        The jury could have determined that Valentín suffered\n$705,000 in total damages -- with no duplication whatsoever -- and\nthen divided that amount among the various spaces on the verdict\n\n                                 -35-\n\fwas out of work, she lost her house and her car, and she and her\n\nchildren    were   forced      to   move   into   an    abandoned    house.      Cf.\n\nAcevedo-Garcia, 351 F.3d at 571 (jury may consider \"secondary\n\neconomic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs' loss of earnings\").\n\nBecause of these damages and because of the harassment and threat\n\nof reprisals, Valentín suffered various forms of emotional damages\n\nand mental anguish, including, inter alia, insomnia, anxiety,\n\nguilt, and depression.         The jury could believe this suffering was\n\nreal and severe, based not only on Valentín's testimony that it\n\nwas, but also on the fact of the nervous breakdown and the fact\n\nthat she received extended psychological treatment from the SIF.\n\nSee O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 733-34 (upholding award based on similar\n\nemotional    distress,      and     collecting    cases).     There    was     ample\n\nevidence    that   it    was      defendants'     own    continued    and     varied\n\nmisconduct which caused the harms suffered by Valentín.                 The award\n\nwas not excessive.\n\n            Cruz adds his own argument that even if he harassed\n\nValentín, it was only from August of 2000 to November of 2000, or\n\nat most to February of 2001, and she did not suffer any financial\n\ndamages or adequately proven emotional distress during this time.\n\nThe argument ignores both the ample evidence of emotional damages\n\nduring that very period and the fact that the evidence supported a\n\n\n\nform. The defense has not shown that such apportionment did not\noccur or, if it did occur, that it was impermissible.\n\n                                        -36-\n\fconclusion     that   Cruz   instigated   and   participated   in   later\n\nharassment and retaliation.      More fundamentally, Cruz' artificial\n\ntime limit is based on the mistaken legal premise that a defendant\n\nis not liable for damages which flow from his own actions in\n\nviolation of law and are reasonably foreseeable.         See P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 29, § 155j(1) (person responsible for harassment is\n\nliable for \"the damages that the action has caused,\" plus mandatory\n\ndoubling) (emphasis added).\n\nG.          Denial of Motion for New Trial\n\n            Decisions by the trial court to deny a motion for a new\n\ntrial are reviewed for abuse of discretion.          Arrieta-Colon, 434\n\nF.3d at 89.    Trial judges have more leeway to grant new trials than\n\nto set aside verdicts based on insufficiency of the evidence under\n\nRule 50.     They may consider their view of the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses in doing so, but must be careful not to invade the jury's\n\nprovince.     See MacQuarrie v. Howard Johnson Co., 877 F.2d 126, 132\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).      And they may grant a new trial only if they are\n\nconvinced that the verdict is against the clear weight of the\n\nevidence, such that letting it stand would result in a miscarriage\n\nof justice.     Arrieta-Colon, 434 F.3d at 89; O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at\n\n726.   Given our account of the evidence supporting liability and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fdamages, and the absence of any error at trial,22 the trial judge\n\ncertainly did not abuse her discretion in denying a new trial.\n\nH.          Reinstatement\n\n            We review a district court's decision to award equitable\n\nrelief for an abuse of discretion.          Selgas v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,\n\n104 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1997).         We review deferentially, keeping\n\nin mind the purposes of the relevant constitutional and statutory\n\nprovisions, such as Title VII's \"dual purposes of eliminating\n\ndiscrimination and making its victims whole.\"          Id.\n\n            The Municipality argues Valentín was not entitled to\n\nreinstatement, largely on the basis of its theory that Valentín's\n\nclaim to her job automatically expired as a matter of law.23               Our\n\nearlier discussion disposes of that.\n\n            A second argument is made that a federal court, remedying\n\na    violation   of   a   federal   employment   statute,    may   not   order\n\nreinstatement because a state agency -- here, the Puerto Rico\n\n\n       22\n        The defendants argue that the verdict should be reversed\nbecause the district court did not let Valentín's ex-husband\ntestify that Valentín had trumped up charges against him. They\nargue that this was relevant to her state of mind; it showed her to\nbe a habitual liar who staged a nervous breakdown. There was no\nabuse of discretion in excluding this improper evidence.\n       23\n        The Municipality quotes the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's\nstatement that if a worker is discharged by SIF before the one-year\nterm elapses and \"does not apply for reinstatement under [§7], the\nemployer is liberated from his obligation to reserve the\nemployment.\"     García Díaz, 148 D.P.R. at 378 (certified\ntranslation).   Of course, Valentín did not claim reinstatement\nbased solely on § 7 itself, but rather relied on her federal\nrights.\n\n                                     -38-\n\fagency     known   as   JASAP   --    has   exclusive    jurisdiction      over   a\n\npersonnel claim. Not surprisingly, there is no support offered for\n\nthe Municipality's confusion of basic principles. The Municipality\n\ncites a statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 1334, which does not\n\nestablish JASAP's exclusive power at all.                  It also relies on\n\nBaez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio, 140 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\na political discrimination case, which lends no support to the\n\nMunicipality's position.         The plaintiffs in Baez-Cruz lost before\n\nJASAP, which found that their dismissals were not politically\n\nmotivated, and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed.                  Id. at 26-\n\n27.   This court held that Puerto Rico's issue preclusion doctrine\n\nended the matter for purposes of the lawsuit in federal courts.\n\nId. at 29-31.       Here, of course, there can be no argument that\n\nValentín is collaterally estopped by any factual finding of JASAP\n\nor the Puerto Rico courts.           Baez-Cruz did not in any way limit the\n\nprinciple that Congress specifies the remedies for violation of\n\nfederal law such as Title VII and has not ceded that power to the\n\nstates or to Puerto Rico.24\n\n             The   district     court   took     into   account   the    requisite\n\nequitable    considerations,         including    the   fact   that     Valentín's\n\n\n\n      24\n       To the extent the Municipality is arguing that JASAP has\nexclusive initial jurisdiction over reinstatement claims, and that\na plaintiff bringing an action under federal law in federal court\nmust first exhaust Puerto Rico administrative remedies, such a\ntheory is no better supported by § 1334 and Baez-Cruz than the\ntheory rejected in the text.\n\n                                        -39-\n\foriginal     hiring   was   valid,    that    she    met    the   eligibility\n\nrequirements for her job, and that she had not found comparable\n\nwork.   The Municipality cites not a single equitable factor in\n\nsupport of its position.      There was no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndecision to order reinstatement, which is, after all, the preferred\n\nremedy under Title VII.      Selgas, 104 F.3d at 12.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           The   judgment    is   affirmed.

Justo Cruz, appeal from respective jury awards against them totaling over $1 million. The sums were awarded to Blanca Valent&#237;n-Almeyda, a municipal police officer, on her Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and Puerto Rico Law 17, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 155 <i>et seq.,</i> claims of sexual harassment, retaliation, and violation of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support either liability or the damages awarded, and, as a result, the district court erred in denying their motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50(b) and 59(a) for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remitittur, or a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality also attacks the verdict form, arguing that it led the jury to award duplicate damages, and the court's failure to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense recognized in <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998), and <i>Burlington Industries v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998).

In short, the defendants lost this case at trial and they cannot win it here. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-Mart P.R., Inc.,</i> 434 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n worked for the Municipal Police of Aguadilla from February 15, 1997 until January 27, 2003, when her employment was terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> She was trained at the Police Academy, where she graduated at the top of her class. She worked for a two-year probationary period before she became a permanent employee. Her supervisors, including Cruz, and her coworkers agreed she was a good police officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz was an administrative sergeant whose duties included checking the officers' entry and exit logs. He kept track of attendance and could impose sanctions for attendance problems. At times, he had direct supervisory authority over Valent&#237;n. He also had some power to affect her work assignments. He worked in a small shared space with a secretarial pool of four or five secretaries, including Norma Gonzalez and Norma Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, Valent&#237;n, then aged thirty-six, separated from her husband; they ultimately were divorced in March 2001. In August 2000, Cruz began a crude campaign to win her affections. His comments were mild initially. He told her on several occasions that she had \"pretty eyes\" and \"nice hair\" and that her husband did not appreciate what he was leaving behind. He also told her she looked beautiful in the morning. Valent&#237;n objected to Cruz' remarks. But instead of stopping, Cruz escalated matters in September and October of 2000. He told Valent&#237;n she had \"great legs\" and twice told her she had \"horny\" eyes. Although Valent&#237;n was upset and tried to discourage him, he persisted, telling her many times that she was \"hot-hot-hot.\" He then told her that her legs were \"pretty enough\" to have \"hooked over his shoulders.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of people at the station knew that Cruz was chasing Valent&#237;n. Norma Ortiz, one of the secretaries, confirmed that Cruz made the reported comments about Valent&#237;n's hair, smile, and legs; that Cruz made such comments only to Valent&#237;n; and that Valent&#237;n \"looked upset\" because of his approaches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n complained to Officer Hector Villanueva, a friend of hers and a foot patrolman in the municipal police department, that since her divorce, Cruz was constantly \"after her.\" Villanueva observed Valent&#237;n become upset after Cruz said something to her in the hallway. He noticed that Cruz always went out of his way to be near Valent&#237;n and to \"sidle up next to her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz took to driving by Valent&#237;n's house multiple times on the same day and honking his horn. He admitted doing this to Villanueva, who also observed him do it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defense denied that the Police Commissioner, Reynaldo Fern&#225;ndez, was aware of the situation, that was contradicted by Villanueva's testimony that the Commissioner told Cruz, in front of Villanueva and another officer, to get \"that <i>little girlfriend</i> of yours\" (emphasis added) under control. The other officer was Sgt. David Ferrer, who was second in the police hierarchy and Cruz' good friend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n testified that in early October 2000, she complained about Cruz' comments to Norma Gonzalez, the secretaries' supervisor and designated complaint-receiver. The Commissioner had told the female police officers that if they had any problems with male officers, they should go to Gonzalez, who reported directly to him. After that complaint, Cruz' approaches to Valent&#237;n stopped for a few weeks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in October 2000, Valent&#237;n attempted to meet with the Commissioner to complain about Cruz, who had become upset with her because she never greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. She testified that this was the first, but not the only, occasion on which she tried to meet with the Commissioner. The Commissioner greeted her at the door, but instead of hearing her complaints against Cruz, he told her to meet with Lt. Juan V&#233;lez, an internal affairs investigator charged with handling equal employment opportunity charges for the municipal police. She met with V&#233;lez that same day; he put his arm over her shoulders and said Cruz was not at fault, \"that it was [her] fault because [she] had him bedazzled.\" Cruz and V&#233;lez were good friends. The Mayor, Carlos M&#233;ndez, testified that V&#233;lez and the Commissioner did not at that time bring the allegations to his attention, even though V&#233;lez' job was to bring sexual harassment allegations to the Commissioner, who was supposed to bring them to the Mayor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her first attempt to complain to the Commissioner, Valent&#237;n testified, she suffered two forms of retaliation. Between October 2000 and January 2001, she was assigned more than five double shifts, although such assignments were uncommon in the Aguadilla police force. She was also transferred in October 2000 from the traffic unit, which was regarded as \"privileged,\" to the rotating shifts assignment and then to Las Cascadas water park, which was regarded as \"punishment\" because it was remote and the work was solitary. Although it was common for officer \"working shifts\" to be assigned to Las Cascadas a few times per week, Valent&#237;n was permanently assigned there for a one-month period spanning the holidays, ending in early January 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Two weeks into her posting at Las Cascadas, while she was on duty, Cruz visited and told her that \"[w]henever [she] stop[ped] being such a spoiled rotten kid, [he] could get [her] out of there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz' approaches recommenced in November 2000, when he left a note under the wiper of Valent&#237;n's car saying that she was \"his\" and that she should not be giving rides to fellow officers. In December 2000, he began to repeatedly ask Valent&#237;n if her divorce was final yet, telling her that he wanted to marry her and offering her money to help finalize the divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n felt uncomfortable and continued to rebuff Cruz' approaches. In approximately January 2001, when Valent&#237;n again said she was not interested in him, he became angry and told her she would be \"screwed\" &#8212; that she \"had to be more affectionate with him\" or else he and his friend Ferrer would exact retribution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Ferrer was in charge of work assignments, and Cruz also had some assignment authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2001, Valent&#237;n attempted to complain directly to the Mayor. She told him she wanted to discuss Cruz, and that she had already attempted to speak with the Commissioner, who had paid no attention. The Mayor told her \"he wouldn't have anything to do with [her],\" because the Commissioner \"was like his brother.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, 2001, Valent&#237;n was at the mall with her son, and she noticed that Cruz was behind her. She accused him of following her, saying this was the third or fourth time such a thing had happened, but Cruz denied any such thing. Valent&#237;n told him she might complain again to the Commissioner. By this time Valent&#237;n had already tried to complain to the Commissioner twice (in October 2000 and on another date unclear from the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 2001, Valent&#237;n went to the station house, intending to try yet again to meet with the Commissioner and to pick up her paycheck before beginning her shift in the town square. Just before noon, as she was en route, Cruz called her on her cellular phone and told her not to show up. He told her that she had to go to Las Cascadas and should not come to the station house. Valent&#237;n told Cruz that she was going to meet with the Commissioner. She did go to the station house, where she collected her paycheck, but was thereafter prevented from complaining to the Commissioner by the trio of Cruz, Ferrer, and V&#233;lez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferrer told her not to leave, whereupon Cruz gave her a warning letter about her tardiness on an earlier occasion. Valent&#237;n said she wanted to speak with the Commissioner, and Cruz told her he was not in. Ferrer told her to wait at the dispatch officer's station, because he had to give her other documents. V&#233;lez then called Valent&#237;n into his office and told her she was the subject of an internal complaint pertaining to Valent&#237;n's allegedly telling Officer Wilfredo Nieves to \"go to hell\" a month and a half earlier, on December 28, 2000. Ferrer then came into V&#233;lez' office and gave Valent&#237;n another admonishment letter, this one pertaining to an allegedly unauthorized absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ferrer left, Valent&#237;n started to tell V&#233;lez (who was in charge of conducting sexual harassment investigations) about the situation with Cruz, noting that she had not received any admonishments until that very day, just when she was planning to file a grievance. She told V&#233;lez that she was being sexually harassed; he asked her if she was going to file a complaint against Officer Nieves, and she told him \"he knew very well who it was going to be against\" &#8212; she had already complained to V&#233;lez about Cruz in October 2000. V&#233;lez told her that the Commissioner was not present and she would have to wait to meet with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a frustrating hour during which she got nowhere and received documents pertaining to three separate disciplinary matters, an agitated Valent&#237;n went to the dispatch area. There she attempted to call an organization that provides legal services to police officers, but Ferrer took the telephone from her hands. There are varying accounts of her behavior and that of other participants, but the upshot is that she left the station by ambulance, having suffered what she calls a nervous breakdown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She did not return to her job until October 1, 2001. Between February 14 and October 1, she received psychiatric treatment from the State Insurance Fund (SIF), which \"referred [her] for rest.\" It is unclear whether she received some disability payments during this period. She testified that she exhausted sick leave and vacation leave, ceased earning a salary in mid-April, and fell behind on her mortgage. She asked for permission to return to work because she needed the money. She continued treatment once she returned to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 2001, Valent&#237;n filed an administrative complaint before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor; the complaint was referred to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under a work-sharing agreement. On the complaint, Valent&#237;n lists the Municipality, Cruz, and V&#233;lez as having discriminated against her. The complaint alleges sexual harassment by Cruz and retaliation by Cruz \"and other supervisors.\" It was only after Valent&#237;n filed the administrative complaint that there was any investigation of her claims of harassment; the Mayor then ordered an internal investigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n returned to work on October 1, 2001 and was assigned to the San Antonio station house. She and another officer were assigned to do foot patrols. The other officer was armed; Valent&#237;n was not. Her psychiatrist recommended that she work at an office or on dispatch, to avoid having to intervene with people. After eighteen days of foot patrol, Valent&#237;n was assigned to a state police station classifying complaints, which she did until January 28, 2002. Valent&#237;n testified that she was supervised there by a state police sergeant, but also that she was visited once or twice a week by the Commissioner, Ferrer, and Cruz. She left because of these visits, which made her too uncomfortable to continue working and forced her to once again seek time off and treatment from the SIF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 2003, while away from work and under treatment, Valent&#237;n filed this lawsuit in the Puerto Rico federal district court, alleging violations of Title VII and Law 17. She named as defendants the Municipality, Cruz, and V&#233;lez. She later added M&#233;ndez, the Mayor, as a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 2003, she received clearance from SIF to return to work. She returned that very day, signing in for duty and remaining at the station house until noon, when she was summoned to the Human Resources Department. There she was given a letter written by the Mayor, dated January 27, 2003. It was a letter of intent to lay off; the reason given was that she had not reported to work for over 360 days. The parties stipulated that Valent&#237;n was terminated from employment \"as per\" this letter. In response to this discharge, Valent&#237;n amended the complaint that she had already filed in the federal district court to include an additional retaliation claim and a due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Valent&#237;n's Title VII claims against M&#233;ndez, Cruz, and V&#233;lez, applying district court precedent to the effect that Title VII does not impose liability on individuals. Valent&#237;n does not appeal this determination. This left, as to the individual defendants, the Law 17 claims. The district court denied the individual defendants' motion to dismiss these claims as time-barred, holding that Valent&#237;n had tolled the statute of limitations on her Law 17 claims when she filed her administrative complaint on February 26, 2001. The court did grant M&#233;ndez' motion to dismiss the claims against him in his personal capacity. After Valent&#237;n rested her case at trial, the court dismissed the claims against V&#233;lez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found the Municipality liable for $250,000 in compensatory damages on the Title VII claim. The jury awarded $250,000 against the Municipality and $80,000 against Cruz individually in compensatory damages on the Law 17 claims. Finally, the jury found the Municipality liable for $125,000 in compensatory damages on the due process claim. The total initial jury award was $705,000. After the verdict, Valent&#237;n sought and obtained reinstatement and doubling of the damages on the Law 17 claims; this doubling of the Law 17 amounts resulted in a total jury award that just topped $1 million. The court denied the defendants' joint motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remittitur of the damages award, or a new trial. Cruz and the Municipality appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Legal Standards</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n's Title VII and Law 17 claims alleged both sexual harassment and retaliation for her complaints about the harassment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The sexual harassment case encompassed both the theories of hostile work environment and quid pro quo. The claims also invoke the law on employer liability for the harassing acts of a co-worker and a supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge or otherwise to discriminate against a person with respect to \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" because of the person's sex. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way of violating Title VII is \"requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.\" <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). In <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713 (1st Cir.2001), we described the essence of a hostile work environment claim: \"Title VII. . . allows a plaintiff to prove unlawful discrimination by showing that `the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 728 (quoting <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. 367) (some internal quotation marks omitted). In <i>O'Rourke,</i> we described the \"sufficiently severe or pervasive\" element as one of several a plaintiff must establish to show a hostile work environment:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) that she (or he) is a member of a protected class; (2) that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the harassment was based upon sex; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment; (5) that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact did perceive it to be so; and (6) that some basis for employer liability has been established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application of the hostile work environment test requires an assessment of the totality of the circumstances, including \"the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367. Although offhand remarks and isolated incidents are not enough, \"[e]vidence of sexual remarks, innuendoes, ridicule, and intimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a hostile work environment.\" <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quid pro quo sexual harassment also violates Title VII. In this form of harassment, \"an employee or supervisor uses his or her superior position to extract sexual favors from a subordinate employee, and if denied those favors, retaliates by taking action adversely affecting the subordinate's employment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 728; <i>see also Hernandez-Loring v. Universidad Metropolitana,</i> 233 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Under Title VII, quid pro quo sexual harassment can be shown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Retaliation, yet another basis for liability under Title VII, is discrimination against an employee because the employee has, inter alia, \"opposed\" an unlawful employment practice under Title VII or \"made a charge . . . or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a). A retaliation claim requires a showing that (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct; (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the first and second elements. <i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> 398 F.3d 76, 88 (1st Cir. 2005). Protected conduct includes not only the filing of administrative complaints, <i>id.,</i> but also complaining to one's supervisors. <i>Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp.,</i> 331 F.3d 166, 175 (1st Cir.2003). An employment action, to be adverse, \"must materially change the conditions\" of the plaintiff's employment; examples include \"disadvantageous transfers or assignments\" and \"unwarranted negative job evaluations.\" <i>Gu v.

U.S. Dep't of Justice,</i> 355 F.3d 6, 26 (1st Cir.2004). The defendant's burden is one of production only; the burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff. <i>Provencher v.

Under <i>Ellerth</i> and <i>Faragher,</i> where a supervisor (here, Cruz) is involved, there are a series of specialized rules and defenses depending on whether there has been a tangible employment action. We recently summarized the rules for cases of actionable discrimination by supervisors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Where no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) No affirmative defense is available when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) The affirmative defense, when available, comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. The employer bears the burden of proof as to both elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) As to the first element of the defense, proof of an anti-harassment policy with a complaint procedure available to employees, while not necessarily dispositive, is relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) As to the second element of the defense, proof that the employee failed to meet his obligation of using reasonable care is not limited to an unreasonable failure to use such a procedure, although such proof will normally suffice to meet the employer's burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 86 (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and citations omitted) (quoting <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence of Harassment and Retaliation</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's denial of the defense motions under Rule 50 for judgment as a matter of law. <i>White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.2000). We review the evidence and draw inferences from it in the light most favorable to the verdict, making no determinations of our own as to the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence, reversing \"only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> The jury was not asked to distinguish among hostile work environment, other forms of sexual harassment (such as quid pro quo), and retaliation in finding liability under Title VII and Law 17. Each and every potential basis of liability was supported by ample evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Harassment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two themes to the defendants' arguments. The first is that the incidents here were too minimal to support a hostile work environment or quid pro quo claim as a matter of law. The second is a back-door attack on Valent&#237;n's credibility. The second can be quickly dispatched. Credibility of witnesses is simply not a basis for attacking a jury verdict in a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the first defense theory, the jury, which heard the witnesses, rejected the defense of triviality and, on the facts here, was entitled to do so. The picture painted by the defense focuses on Cruz' comments and argues that any woman, particularly a police officer, could handle them. The defense ignores the conduct of Cruz &#8212; his constant efforts at physical proximity, his repeatedly cruising by Valent&#237;n's house, the so-called \"chance\" meeting at the shopping mall, his leaving a note under the windshield wiper of her car saying she was his. The defense also ignores that the repeated visits of the Commissioner, Cruz, and Ferrer while Valent&#237;n was working at the state police station made her so uncomfortable that she was unable to continue working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense ignores that Cruz threatened to and did make compliance with his demands a condition of avoiding punishment at work. He threatened Valent&#237;n that she would be \"screwed\" if she would not react more affectionately to his unwanted advances. The threat was not an empty one. He had already seen to it that she received unfavorable work assignments: he effectively admitted to her at Las Cascadas that her continued posting there was his doing (through his and his friend Ferrer's mutual control over the work assignments), and that it could be avoided if she would acquiesce. Valent&#237;n was removed from the privileged traffic division and singled out for extra double shifts and for extended posting at Las Cascadas, above and beyond what ordinarily would be expected. And the jury could conclude that Cruz delivered an admonishment letter to Valent&#237;n, had his friend Ferrer do the same, and had his friend V&#233;lez simultaneously deliver news of a month-and-a-half-old internal complaint, as a form of reprisal for her refusal to give in to his demands (and as a method of deterring her from complaining to the Commissioner).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Retaliation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that there was insufficient evidence of retaliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This argument is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2000, Valent&#237;n engaged in protected conduct by complaining about Cruz' sexual harassment to Norma Gonzalez, attempting to complain to the Commissioner, and complaining to V&#233;lez. All three were proper people to whom to complain. And beginning in that very same month, Valent&#237;n was assigned extra double shifts, removed from her favorable traffic duty, and given an unusually long posting at Las Cascadas, where the work was remote and solitary. The jury could easily regard the totality of these assignments, following swiftly on the heels of her complaints, as well as the disciplinary letters, as adverse employment actions caused by Valent&#237;n's complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 2001, Valent&#237;n said she was going to complain to the Commissioner, and Cruz responded as soon as she arrived by giving her an admonishment letter. When Valent&#237;n reiterated her desire to speak with the Commissioner, V&#233;lez gave her a document about an alleged disciplinary problem, and Ferrer gave her another admonishment letter. The letters were adverse employment actions. <i>See Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 25 (memorandum of admonishment is adverse employment action). The jury could find that they were causally related to Valent&#237;n's protected conduct, both in the recent past and as contemplated in the immediate future &#8212; although her stated intentions to pursue the matter that very day never came to fruition, because she was driven past the breaking point by these very tactics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality does not, on appeal, address any of these pre-termination incidents. It focuses only on termination. Even assuming this narrow focus to be warranted, it fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 2001, Valent&#237;n filed an administrative complaint about the sexual harassment and retaliation that she had suffered to date. On January 3, 2003, she filed this lawsuit. By the end of that month, she had been terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The Municipality says this was not an adverse employment action because it was a \"statutory termination\" that became \"self-executing\" when Valent&#237;n failed to avail herself of certain procedures under Puerto Rico law. The Municipality relies on P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 7, part of the Workmen's Compensation Act. That provision provides that an employer must reserve the position of an employee out on disability (as Valent&#237;n was here) and reinstate her, provided, inter alia, that the employee demands reinstatement within a year of the date her job-related disability began. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7(1). The Municipality argues, on the basis of this provision, that Valent&#237;n's termination was \"statutory\" because she took too long to seek reinstatement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The Municipality uses this same argument to say that even if Valent&#237;n made a prima facie showing of retaliation, it rebutted that showing by proving that it had a legitimate reason for the termination and that it would have taken the same action in any event, \"to comply with\" &#167; 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this provision of Puerto Rico law means that the employer is <i>obliged</i> to terminate an employee, even after a year has elapsed. The Municipality suggests that this provision, meant to protect disabled workers, somehow creates a duty to fire them if they have not requested reinstatement by a certain time, even if the employers are willing to grant extra time. The suggestion that the Municipality had to terminate Valent&#237;n \"to comply with\" this provision, or that hers was a \"statutory termination,\" contravenes the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's clear policy that the Workmen's Compensation Act \"must be liberally construed in favor of those whom it seeks to protect.\" <i>Garc&#237;a D&#237;az v. Darex P.R., Inc.,</i> 148 P.R. Dec. 364, 374 n. 11 (P.R.1999) (certified translation supplied by defendants); <i>see also Rivera-Flores v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 64 F.3d 742, 750-51 (1st Cir.1995). The Municipality was free to reinstate Valent&#237;n at any time, whether or not a year had passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Municipality did not <i>have</i> to fire Valent&#237;n, we assume arguendo that the duration of Valent&#237;n's second, extended absence from work could have been a legitimate reason for termination of her employment. Even so, the jury was not compelled to find that this was in fact the cause of her termination, or that the termination was not an adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Lack of Faragher/Ellerth Jury Instruction</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that the court should have given it the benefit of a <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> instruction. The Municipality has taken the position that Cruz was Valent&#237;n's supervisor. It argues that even if the record shows that there was severe and pervasive harassment, there still was no tangible employment action taken against her, and so it was entitled to assert the affirmative defense under <i>Faragher/Ellerth.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality has not pointed to where in the record it ever requested a <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> instruction. Such a request does not appear in the defendants' joint proposed jury instructions, submitted before trial. In any event, the matter arose before the court instructed the jury, when the court noted that the Municipality's anti-sexual-harassment policy itself was not in evidence. The court reasoned that this omission meant the jury had no way of knowing what opportunities, provided by the Municipality, Valent&#237;n had failed to pursue. Counsel for Cruz said \"[w]e have no objections [to the court's not giving a <i>Faragher</i> instruction]. . . . We know the manual is not in evidence.\" Counsel for the Municipality stood silently by, as the Municipality concedes in its reply brief. There were no objections after the jury charge was given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n argues that the Municipality expressly waived the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> defense. The Municipality counters that Cruz' attorney did not speak for it. Although Valent&#237;n asserts that there was a work-sharing arrangement under which Cruz' waiver was binding on the Municipality, and it appears that defense counsel did de facto divide up many tasks, she has not pointed to any record evidence of a binding arrangement. We therefore give the Municipality the benefit of the doubt and treat the issue as forfeited, not waived, and we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means the Municipality must show that an error was committed, that it was plain (meaning obvious), that the error was prejudicial (meaning it affected substantial rights), and that review is needed to prevent a \"miscarriage of justice\" (meaning that the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\"). <i>Rivera Castillo v. Autokirey, Inc.,</i> 379 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Mu&#241;iz v. Rovira,</i> 373 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality does not explain why the failure to give the instruction is plain error, and in any event it cannot make such a showing. Plain error review requires that there be an error. There was none. As this court recently observed, \"[w]here the evidence shows that the defendant cannot prove an affirmative defense under the <i>Faragher</i> standard, there is no reason to remand for the giving of a <i>Faragher</i> instruction.\" <i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 87. Although there was testimony that the Municipality had an anti-sexual-harassment policy, there is no evidence that it was distributed or that employees of the police department knew about it until after several of the crucial events in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> There is no basis in the evidence that would permit a finding that the Municipality exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Municipality has made no case that Valent&#237;n unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. Assuming such opportunities were even open to Valent&#237;n, in fact and not just on paper, she pursued them. She complained &#8212; and attempted to complain &#8212; repeatedly, to several different individuals who were proper people to whom to complain. She was ignored or worse at every turn. The Municipality's point that none of her complaints were in writing is a non sequitur in light of its failure to show that complaints had to be in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Due Process Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded Valent&#237;n $125,000 in compensatory damages for the Municipality's failure to comply with her federal due process rights. The basis of this claim was that Valent&#237;n, as a tenured municipal employee, was entitled to a hearing before she was deprived of her employment, and that the Municipality did not provide such a pre-termination hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that the issue was a pure one of law for the court and it was an error to submit it to a jury. It argues that Valent&#237;n has no due process claim because even if she originally had a property interest in the position as a permanent employee, she lost that interest. That, it argues, is because as a matter of law, she lost her job by operation of the Workmen's Compensation Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 7, when more than 360 days &#8212; treated as a year under &#167; 7, <i>see Torres Gonz&#225;lez v. Star Kist Caribe, Inc.,</i> 134 P.R. Dec. 1024, 1033 n. 4 (P.R.1994), official translation <i>available at</i> 1994 WL 909600 &#8212; had elapsed since she last reported to work; and because this \"statutory\" discharge became \"final and self-executing\" when she failed to take an administrative appeal. According to the Municipality, the district court erred as a matter of law in \"creat[ing] the impression of voluntary discharge.\" The argument fails for two reasons: the Municipality never presented it to the district court, and the premise of the argument itself is wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality did not object to the jury instruction on due process, either before or after it was given. The Municipality says that its failure to preserve the issue as to the jury instructions does not matter, because \"this matter was brought up by the Defendants at trial as an issue of law that should have been resolved by the District Court and should have not been an issue for the jury to resolve.\" The Municipality does not support this claim of preservation at trial with any citations to the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The Municipality cannot sandbag the court and its opponent by not raising the issue and then saying the court should have seen it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already rejected the Municipality's reading of &#167; 7. \"[I]t is merely the employee's absolute right not to be terminated on account of her disability, rather than her property interest in her employment position, which lapses under the one-year workers' compensation `caducity' provision.\" <i>Rivera-Flores,</i> 64 F.3d at 750. Valent&#237;n did have a property interest in her employment. That interest could not be taken away without the provision of procedural due process, including a pre-termination hearing, the right to which did not lapse automatically on any particular date. <i>See id.</i> at 750-51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence permitted the jury to find that Valent&#237;n had an ongoing property interest in her job and that she was terminated from her job without an opportunity for hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. <i>Statute of Limitations Defense as to Law 17</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the individual defendants' motion to dismiss the Law 17 claims as time barred.

Laws Ann. &#167; 155m; <i>Matos Ortiz v. Puerto Rico,</i> 103 F.Supp.2d 59, 63 (D.P.R. 2000) (collecting cases). Cruz argues that the last act of sexual harassment was in November of 2000, that the statute ran in November of 2001, and that the civil complaint was filed in January of 2003. There are several responses, including the response that Cruz ignores the fact that Valent&#237;n also complained of an ongoing pattern of harassment and retaliation well after November 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to resolve what may be a recurring issue, though, we focus on the legal ground used by the district court to reject Cruz' argument. The court held that Valent&#237;n tolled the statute of limitations on the Law 17 claim when she filed her administrative complaint on February 26, 2001, because the complaint contained \"the identical cause of action\" as that later raised in the civil suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, the statute of limitations is tolled by a plaintiff's extrajudicial claim. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5303. \"The tolling is effective with regard only to identical causes of action.\" <i>Benitez-Pons v. Puerto Rico,</i> 136 F.3d 54, 59 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Rodriguez Narvaez v. Nazario,</i> 895 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.1990)). The relief sought in the extrajudicial claim must be the same as that later sought in court. <i>Id.</i> at 59-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz argues that, as a matter of law, Valent&#237;n's \"charge before the EEOC\" cannot be identical to the district court complaint against him, because it is doubtful there can be a Title VII complaint against an individual.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Because a cause of action against him could not have been brought under Title VII, he says, the EEOC complaint could not have been identical with, and did not toll the statute of limitations on, Valent&#237;n's Law 17 claim against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz' entire argument rests on the premise that Valent&#237;n's administrative claim was originally brought before the EEOC under Title VII exclusively. This premise is incorrect. The claim was originally filed before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> and it was not brought exclusively under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n listed Cruz among those who had discriminated against her. She alleged, inter alia, that she had been the victim of sexual harassment and reprisals by Cruz. Valent&#237;n's cause of action under Law 17 is identical to that raised in the administrative complaint. The administrative charge does not explicitly cite any law &#8212; Title VII, Law 17, or otherwise. But except for the fact that Law 17 expressly allows for individual liability, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167;&#167; 155a, 155d, 155j, Puerto Rico interprets Law 17 as congruent with Title VII. The administrative complaint stated all the elements necessary for a Law 17 claim and put Cruz on notice of the discrimination claim against him, as an individual. As for remedy, Valent&#237;n asked for various forms of relief, including compensatory damages &#8212; the same thing she sought from Cruz in the civil suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was enough to toll the statute of limitations. The tolling effect continued until the conclusion of the administrative proceeding. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 61 (1st Cir.2005). Here, that conclusion was no earlier than April 1, 2002, the date on which the EEOC issued a determination that there was reason to believe the alleged sexual harassment and retaliation had in fact occurred. Valent&#237;n had a year from that date (and arguably from a later date, for reasons which are unnecessary to elaborate here) to file this lawsuit, and she did so with months to spare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> <i>See Rodriguez Narvaez,</i> 895 F.2d at 43 (stating that \"the statute of limitations begins to run anew\" when the tolling ends).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Remitittur</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the damages awarded are duplicative and in any event excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that the compensatory damages award is duplicative in two senses: there is an overlap between the Title VII and Law 17 claims and, second, there is an overlap between the due process claim and the Title VII/Law 17 claims. In the Municipality's view, Valent&#237;n was awarded damages for the same basic harms &#8212; sexual harassment and eventual termination &#8212; multiple times, under different legal theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality concedes that to the extent damages are properly awarded under Law 17, they are subject to mandatory doubling. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 155j(1). As to any possible overlap in damages between or among the Title VII, Law 17, and due process claims, in this circuit, the primary mechanisms to avoid impermissible duplicate awards for damages are the jury instructions and the structure of the verdict form. \"To the extent that a jury award on both claims would be duplicative, the proper practice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so as to allow the jury to recompense the plaintiff['s] injuries just once.\" <i>Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> 351 F.3d 547, 569 (1st Cir.2003). Defendants should request instructions clearly directing the jury to compensate the plaintiff's injuries just once. <i>Id.</i> at 570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, this is a defense which was given away at trial. The Municipality concedes that it never objected at trial to the proposed verdict form or to the court's failure to charge the jury as to any possible overlap. Nor did it raise the argument after the jury returned the verdict and before the jury was discharged and the judgment was entered. In the post-trial motion seeking remitittur or a new trial, there was no argument as to duplication; the only argument raised was that the damages were simply \"excessive\" in light of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality falls back, in its reply brief, on plain error review. <i>See id.; Chestnut v. City of Lowell,</i> 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc). But it still does not explain how the doctrine helps it. That argument is waived for lack of appellate development. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the claim that, aside from any possible duplication, the sums awarded were simply too great in light of the evidence. Even if we viewed the award as quite generous, that is not the test. The award will not be overturned unless it is grossly excessive or so high as to shock the conscience of this court. <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 733. Further, \"[w]e accord broad discretion to the trial court's decision to affirm the jury's award of damages because of that court's greater familiarity with local community standards and with the witnesses' demeanor at the trial.\" <i>Brown v. Freedman Baking Co.,</i> 810 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was, to begin with, evidence of serious economic damages. Valent&#237;n was wrongfully deprived of her salary, both when she was driven by defendants' conduct to take disability leaves, and later when she was terminated outright.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Moreover, while she was out of work, she lost her house and her car, and she and her children were forced to move into an abandoned house. <i>Cf. Acevedo-Garcia,</i> 351 F.3d at 571 (jury may consider \"secondary economic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs' loss of earnings\"). Because of these damages and because of the harassment and threat of reprisals, Valent&#237;n suffered various forms of emotional damages and mental anguish, including, inter alia, insomnia, anxiety, guilt, and depression. The jury could believe this suffering was real and severe, based not only on Valent&#237;n's testimony that it was, but also on the fact of the nervous breakdown and the fact that she received extended psychological treatment from the SIF. <i>See O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 733-34 (upholding award based on similar emotional distress, and collecting cases). There was ample evidence that it was defendants' own continued and varied misconduct which caused the harms suffered by Valent&#237;n. The award was not excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz adds his own argument that even if he harassed Valent&#237;n, it was only from August of 2000 to November of 2000, or at most to February of 2001, and she did not suffer any financial damages or adequately proven emotional distress during this time. The argument ignores both the ample evidence of emotional damages during that very period and the fact that the evidence supported a conclusion that Cruz instigated and participated in later harassment and retaliation. More fundamentally, Cruz' artificial time limit is based on the mistaken legal premise that a defendant is not liable for damages which flow from his own actions in violation of law and are reasonably foreseeable. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 155j(1) (person responsible for harassment is liable for \"the damages that the action has <i>caused,</i>\" plus mandatory doubling) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. <i>Denial of Motion for New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions by the trial court to deny a motion for a new trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 89. Trial judges have more leeway to grant new trials than to set aside verdicts based on insufficiency of the evidence under Rule 50. They may consider their view of the credibility of the witnesses in doing so, but must be careful not to invade the jury's province. <i>See MacQuarrie v. Howard Johnson Co.,</i> 877 F.2d 126, 132 (1st Cir.1989). And they may grant a new trial only if they are convinced that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, such that letting it stand would result in a miscarriage of justice. <i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 89; <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 726. Given our account of the evidence supporting liability and damages, and the absence of any error at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> the trial judge certainly did not abuse her discretion in denying a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H. <i>Reinstatement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's decision to award equitable relief for an abuse of discretion. <i>Selgas v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 104 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1997). We review deferentially, keeping in mind the purposes of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, such as Title VII's \"dual purposes of eliminating discrimination and making its victims whole.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues Valent&#237;n was not entitled to reinstatement, largely on the basis of its theory that Valent&#237;n's claim to her job automatically expired as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Our earlier discussion disposes of that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second argument is made that a federal court, remedying a violation of a federal employment statute, may not order reinstatement because a state agency &#8212; here, the Puerto Rico agency known as JASAP &#8212; has exclusive jurisdiction over a personnel claim. Not surprisingly, there is no support offered for the Municipality's confusion of basic principles. The Municipality cites a statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1334, which does not establish JASAP's exclusive power at all. It also relies on <i>Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio,</i> 140 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.1998), a political discrimination case, which lends no support to the Municipality's position. The plaintiffs in <i>Baez-Cruz</i> lost before JASAP, which found that their dismissals were not politically motivated, and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. This court held that Puerto Rico's issue preclusion doctrine ended the matter for purposes of the lawsuit in federal courts. <i>Id.</i> at 29-31. Here, of course, there can be no argument that Valent&#237;n is collaterally estopped by any factual finding of JASAP or the Puerto Rico courts. <i>Baez-Cruz</i> did not in any way limit the principle that Congress specifies the remedies for violation of federal law such as Title VII and has not ceded that power to the states or to Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took into account the requisite equitable considerations, including the fact that Valent&#237;n's original hiring was valid, that she met the eligibility requirements for her job, and that she had not found comparable work. The Municipality cites not a single equitable factor in support of its position. There was no abuse of discretion in the decision to order reinstatement, which is, after all, the preferred remedy under Title VII. <i>Selgas,</i> 104 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Valent&#237;n also had been a police officer from 1988 or 1989 to 1990, leaving for reasons not material to this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cruz conceded frequently driving by, but he said this was because his house was nearby, and he denied honking his horn</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Gonzalez denied that Valent&#237;n had ever complained to her about Cruz.

This might be correct, but is not necessarily so. The jury charge was somewhat ambiguous, and the verdict form even more so; the latter arguably permitted the jury to find Cruz liable under Law 17 for retaliation. Cruz has not argued that this did not happen, or that if it did, it would have been impermissible.

It argues that a properly instructed jury not only might have found, but would have been compelled to find, that the<i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> defense was satisfied.

V&#233;lez testified that he did not recall receiving any sexual harassment training from the Municipality before February 14, 2001.

Even assuming Cruz' attorney spoke for the Municipality (contrary to the Municipality's own contentions elsewhere), the argument made was only that if Valent&#237;n had sought a hearing or taken an administrative appeal under Puerto Rico law, she could have avoided any damages \"even after the 360 days had elapsed.\" Cruz' attorney did not argue that the Municipality was somehow forced to fire Valent&#237;n</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The Municipality says the onus was on Valent&#237;n to follow certain procedures. It says that under Puerto Rico law, she should have sought a pre-termination hearing within fifteen days. The Municipality does not specify within fifteen days of what event-presumably of the date Valent&#237;n received the termination letter, which is the date her employment ended, as the parties stipulated. A later hearing can hardly have been \"pre-termination,\" and it was the Municipality's duty to provide such a hearing. The Municipality also points to Valent&#237;n's failure to appeal her termination to the Puerto Rico agency known as \"JASAP\" within thirty days. These procedural arguments are waived due to lack of development on appeal. The Municipality cites no authority for the existence, application, or effect of the Puerto Rico procedures said to have been ignored by Valent&#237;n</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The Municipality is affected by Law 17, which doubled a portion of the compensatory damages award, but it does not raise a timeliness challenge on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> This court has not decided the issue of whether Title VII liability can be imposed on individuals and need not do so here. Precedent in the District of Puerto Rico, which Valent&#237;n does not challenge, bars Title VII liability against individuals<i>Maldonado-Cordero v.

Individual liability aside, it seems clear that the filing of an administrative complaint before<i>either</i> the Puerto Rico Department of Labor or the EEOC would have been sufficient to toll the Law 17 statute of limitations. Either is sufficient under Puerto Rico's Law 100. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 61. This same rule applies to Law 69, and there is no reason to think the rule should be different for Law 17. <i>See id.</i> (noting that both Laws 69 and 100 \"serve the purpose of combating gender discrimination in employment,\" that \"Law 69 is merely an amplification of the principles contained in Law 100,\" and that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would probably apply the tolling rules of Law 100 to Law 69); <i>Matos Ortiz,</i> 103 F.Supp.2d at 64 (making same observation as to Laws 17, 69, and 100, and concluding that \"Law 17 and Law 69 are . . . to be interpreted <i>in pari materia</i> with Law 100\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The jury could have determined that Valent&#237;n suffered $705,000 in total damages &#8212; with no duplication whatsoever &#8212; and then divided that amount among the various spaces on the verdict form.

She worked for a two-year probationary period before she became a permanent employee. Her supervisors, including Cruz, and her coworkers agreed she was a good police officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz was an administrative sergeant whose duties included checking the officers' entry and exit logs. He kept track of attendance and could impose sanctions for attendance problems. At times, he had direct supervisory authority over Valent&#237;n. He also had some power to affect her work assignments. He worked in a small shared space with a secretarial pool of four or five secretaries, including Norma Gonzalez and Norma Ortiz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2000, Valent&#237;n, then aged thirty-six, separated from her husband; they ultimately were divorced in March 2001. In August 2000, Cruz began a crude campaign to win her affections. His comments were mild initially. He told her on several occasions that she had \"pretty eyes\" and \"nice hair\" and that her husband did not appreciate what he was leaving behind. He also told her she looked beautiful in the morning. Valent&#237;n objected to Cruz' remarks. But instead of stopping, Cruz escalated matters in September and October of 2000. He told Valent&#237;n she had \"great legs\" and twice told her she had \"horny\" eyes. Although Valent&#237;n was upset and tried to discourage him, he persisted, telling her many times that she was \"hot-hot-hot.\" He then told her that her legs were \"pretty enough\" to have \"hooked over his shoulders.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of people at the station knew that Cruz was chasing Valent&#237;n. Norma Ortiz, one of the secretaries, confirmed that Cruz made the reported comments about Valent&#237;n's hair, smile, and legs; that Cruz made such comments only to Valent&#237;n; and that Valent&#237;n \"looked upset\" because of his approaches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n complained to Officer Hector Villanueva, a friend of hers and a foot patrolman in the municipal police department, that since her divorce, Cruz was constantly \"after her.\" Villanueva observed Valent&#237;n become upset after Cruz said something to her in the hallway. He noticed that Cruz always went out of his way to be near Valent&#237;n and to \"sidle up next to her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz took to driving by Valent&#237;n's house multiple times on the same day and honking his horn. He admitted doing this to Villanueva, who also observed him do it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the defense denied that the Police Commissioner, Reynaldo Fern&#225;ndez, was aware of the situation, that was contradicted by Villanueva's testimony that the Commissioner told Cruz, in front of Villanueva and another officer, to get \"that <i>little girlfriend</i> of yours\" (emphasis added) under control. The other officer was Sgt. David Ferrer, who was second in the police hierarchy and Cruz' good friend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n testified that in early October 2000, she complained about Cruz' comments to Norma Gonzalez, the secretaries' supervisor and designated complaint-receiver. The Commissioner had told the female police officers that if they had any problems with male officers, they should go to Gonzalez, who reported directly to him. After that complaint, Cruz' approaches to Valent&#237;n stopped for a few weeks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in October 2000, Valent&#237;n attempted to meet with the Commissioner to complain about Cruz, who had become upset with her because she never greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. She testified that this was the first, but not the only, occasion on which she tried to meet with the Commissioner. The Commissioner greeted her at the door, but instead of hearing her complaints against Cruz, he told her to meet with Lt. Juan V&#233;lez, an internal affairs investigator charged with handling equal employment opportunity charges for the municipal police. She met with V&#233;lez that same day; he put his arm over her shoulders and said Cruz was not at fault, \"that it was [her] fault because [she] had him bedazzled.\" Cruz and V&#233;lez were good friends. The Mayor, Carlos M&#233;ndez, testified that V&#233;lez and the Commissioner did not at that time bring the allegations to his attention, even though V&#233;lez' job was to bring sexual harassment allegations to the Commissioner, who was supposed to bring them to the Mayor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her first attempt to complain to the Commissioner, Valent&#237;n testified, she suffered two forms of retaliation. Between October 2000 and January 2001, she was assigned more than five double shifts, although such assignments were uncommon in the Aguadilla police force. She was also transferred in October 2000 from the traffic unit, which was regarded as \"privileged,\" to the rotating shifts assignment and then to Las Cascadas water park, which was regarded as \"punishment\" because it was remote and the work was solitary. Although it was common for officer \"working shifts\" to be assigned to Las Cascadas a few times per week, Valent&#237;n was permanently assigned there for a one-month period spanning the holidays, ending in early January 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Two weeks into her posting at Las Cascadas, while she was on duty, Cruz visited and told her that \"[w]henever [she] stop[ped] being such a spoiled rotten kid, [he] could get [her] out of there.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz' approaches recommenced in November 2000, when he left a note under the wiper of Valent&#237;n's car saying that she was \"his\" and that she should not be giving rides to fellow officers. In December 2000, he began to repeatedly ask Valent&#237;n if her divorce was final yet, telling her that he wanted to marry her and offering her money to help finalize the divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n felt uncomfortable and continued to rebuff Cruz' approaches. In approximately January 2001, when Valent&#237;n again said she was not interested in him, he became angry and told her she would be \"screwed\" &#8212; that she \"had to be more affectionate with him\" or else he and his friend Ferrer would exact retribution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Ferrer was in charge of work assignments, and Cruz also had some assignment authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2001, Valent&#237;n attempted to complain directly to the Mayor. She told him she wanted to discuss Cruz, and that she had already attempted to speak with the Commissioner, who had paid no attention. The Mayor told her \"he wouldn't have anything to do with [her],\" because the Commissioner \"was like his brother.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 10, 2001, Valent&#237;n was at the mall with her son, and she noticed that Cruz was behind her. She accused him of following her, saying this was the third or fourth time such a thing had happened, but Cruz denied any such thing. Valent&#237;n told him she might complain again to the Commissioner. By this time Valent&#237;n had already tried to complain to the Commissioner twice (in October 2000 and on another date unclear from the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 2001, Valent&#237;n went to the station house, intending to try yet again to meet with the Commissioner and to pick up her paycheck before beginning her shift in the town square. Just before noon, as she was en route, Cruz called her on her cellular phone and told her not to show up. He told her that she had to go to Las Cascadas and should not come to the station house. Valent&#237;n told Cruz that she was going to meet with the Commissioner. She did go to the station house, where she collected her paycheck, but was thereafter prevented from complaining to the Commissioner by the trio of Cruz, Ferrer, and V&#233;lez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ferrer told her not to leave, whereupon Cruz gave her a warning letter about her tardiness on an earlier occasion. Valent&#237;n said she wanted to speak with the Commissioner, and Cruz told her he was not in. Ferrer told her to wait at the dispatch officer's station, because he had to give her other documents. V&#233;lez then called Valent&#237;n into his office and told her she was the subject of an internal complaint pertaining to Valent&#237;n's allegedly telling Officer Wilfredo Nieves to \"go to hell\" a month and a half earlier, on December 28, 2000. Ferrer then came into V&#233;lez' office and gave Valent&#237;n another admonishment letter, this one pertaining to an allegedly unauthorized absence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ferrer left, Valent&#237;n started to tell V&#233;lez (who was in charge of conducting sexual harassment investigations) about the situation with Cruz, noting that she had not received any admonishments until that very day, just when she was planning to file a grievance. She told V&#233;lez that she was being sexually harassed; he asked her if she was going to file a complaint against Officer Nieves, and she told him \"he knew very well who it was going to be against\" &#8212; she had already complained to V&#233;lez about Cruz in October 2000. V&#233;lez told her that the Commissioner was not present and she would have to wait to meet with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a frustrating hour during which she got nowhere and received documents pertaining to three separate disciplinary matters, an agitated Valent&#237;n went to the dispatch area. There she attempted to call an organization that provides legal services to police officers, but Ferrer took the telephone from her hands. There are varying accounts of her behavior and that of other participants, but the upshot is that she left the station by ambulance, having suffered what she calls a nervous breakdown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She did not return to her job until October 1, 2001. Between February 14 and October 1, she received psychiatric treatment from the State Insurance Fund (SIF), which \"referred [her] for rest.\" It is unclear whether she received some disability payments during this period. She testified that she exhausted sick leave and vacation leave, ceased earning a salary in mid-April, and fell behind on her mortgage. She asked for permission to return to work because she needed the money. She continued treatment once she returned to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 2001, Valent&#237;n filed an administrative complaint before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor; the complaint was referred to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under a work-sharing agreement. On the complaint, Valent&#237;n lists the Municipality, Cruz, and V&#233;lez as having discriminated against her. The complaint alleges sexual harassment by Cruz and retaliation by Cruz \"and other supervisors.\" It was only after Valent&#237;n filed the administrative complaint that there was any investigation of her claims of harassment; the Mayor then ordered an internal investigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n returned to work on October 1, 2001 and was assigned to the San Antonio station house. She and another officer were assigned to do foot patrols. The other officer was armed; Valent&#237;n was not. Her psychiatrist recommended that she work at an office or on dispatch, to avoid having to intervene with people. After eighteen days of foot patrol, Valent&#237;n was assigned to a state police station classifying complaints, which she did until January 28, 2002. Valent&#237;n testified that she was supervised there by a state police sergeant, but also that she was visited once or twice a week by the Commissioner, Ferrer, and Cruz. She left because of these visits, which made her too uncomfortable to continue working and forced her to once again seek time off and treatment from the SIF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 3, 2003, while away from work and under treatment, Valent&#237;n filed this lawsuit in the Puerto Rico federal district court, alleging violations of Title VII and Law 17. She named as defendants the Municipality, Cruz, and V&#233;lez. She later added M&#233;ndez, the Mayor, as a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 2003, she received clearance from SIF to return to work. She returned that very day, signing in for duty and remaining at the station house until noon, when she was summoned to the Human Resources Department. There she was given a letter written by the Mayor, dated January 27, 2003. It was a letter of intent to lay off; the reason given was that she had not reported to work for over 360 days. The parties stipulated that Valent&#237;n was terminated from employment \"as per\" this letter. In response to this discharge, Valent&#237;n amended the complaint that she had already filed in the federal district court to include an additional retaliation claim and a due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Valent&#237;n's Title VII claims against M&#233;ndez, Cruz, and V&#233;lez, applying district court precedent to the effect that Title VII does not impose liability on individuals. Valent&#237;n does not appeal this determination. This left, as to the individual defendants, the Law 17 claims. The district court denied the individual defendants' motion to dismiss these claims as time-barred, holding that Valent&#237;n had tolled the statute of limitations on her Law 17 claims when she filed her administrative complaint on February 26, 2001. The court did grant M&#233;ndez' motion to dismiss the claims against him in his personal capacity. After Valent&#237;n rested her case at trial, the court dismissed the claims against V&#233;lez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found the Municipality liable for $250,000 in compensatory damages on the Title VII claim. The jury awarded $250,000 against the Municipality and $80,000 against Cruz individually in compensatory damages on the Law 17 claims. Finally, the jury found the Municipality liable for $125,000 in compensatory damages on the due process claim. The total initial jury award was $705,000. After the verdict, Valent&#237;n sought and obtained reinstatement and doubling of the damages on the Law 17 claims; this doubling of the Law 17 amounts resulted in a total jury award that just topped $1 million. The court denied the defendants' joint motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remittitur of the damages award, or a new trial. Cruz and the Municipality appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Legal Standards</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n's Title VII and Law 17 claims alleged both sexual harassment and retaliation for her complaints about the harassment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The sexual harassment case encompassed both the theories of hostile work environment and quid pro quo.

We review the evidence and draw inferences from it in the light most favorable to the verdict, making no determinations of our own as to the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence, reversing \"only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> The jury was not asked to distinguish among hostile work environment, other forms of sexual harassment (such as quid pro quo), and retaliation in finding liability under Title VII and Law 17. Each and every potential basis of liability was supported by ample evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Harassment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two themes to the defendants' arguments. The first is that the incidents here were too minimal to support a hostile work environment or quid pro quo claim as a matter of law. The second is a back-door attack on Valent&#237;n's credibility. The second can be quickly dispatched. Credibility of witnesses is simply not a basis for attacking a jury verdict in a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the first defense theory, the jury, which heard the witnesses, rejected the defense of triviality and, on the facts here, was entitled to do so. The picture painted by the defense focuses on Cruz' comments and argues that any woman, particularly a police officer, could handle them. The defense ignores the conduct of Cruz &#8212; his constant efforts at physical proximity, his repeatedly cruising by Valent&#237;n's house, the so-called \"chance\" meeting at the shopping mall, his leaving a note under the windshield wiper of her car saying she was his. The defense also ignores that the repeated visits of the Commissioner, Cruz, and Ferrer while Valent&#237;n was working at the state police station made her so uncomfortable that she was unable to continue working.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense ignores that Cruz threatened to and did make compliance with his demands a condition of avoiding punishment at work. He threatened Valent&#237;n that she would be \"screwed\" if she would not react more affectionately to his unwanted advances. The threat was not an empty one. He had already seen to it that she received unfavorable work assignments: he effectively admitted to her at Las Cascadas that her continued posting there was his doing (through his and his friend Ferrer's mutual control over the work assignments), and that it could be avoided if she would acquiesce. Valent&#237;n was removed from the privileged traffic division and singled out for extra double shifts and for extended posting at Las Cascadas, above and beyond what ordinarily would be expected. And the jury could conclude that Cruz delivered an admonishment letter to Valent&#237;n, had his friend Ferrer do the same, and had his friend V&#233;lez simultaneously deliver news of a month-and-a-half-old internal complaint, as a form of reprisal for her refusal to give in to his demands (and as a method of deterring her from complaining to the Commissioner).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Retaliation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that there was insufficient evidence of retaliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This argument is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 2000, Valent&#237;n engaged in protected conduct by complaining about Cruz' sexual harassment to Norma Gonzalez, attempting to complain to the Commissioner, and complaining to V&#233;lez. All three were proper people to whom to complain. And beginning in that very same month, Valent&#237;n was assigned extra double shifts, removed from her favorable traffic duty, and given an unusually long posting at Las Cascadas, where the work was remote and solitary. The jury could easily regard the totality of these assignments, following swiftly on the heels of her complaints, as well as the disciplinary letters, as adverse employment actions caused by Valent&#237;n's complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 14, 2001, Valent&#237;n said she was going to complain to the Commissioner, and Cruz responded as soon as she arrived by giving her an admonishment letter. When Valent&#237;n reiterated her desire to speak with the Commissioner, V&#233;lez gave her a document about an alleged disciplinary problem, and Ferrer gave her another admonishment letter. The letters were adverse employment actions. <i>See Calero-Cerezo,</i> 355 F.3d at 25 (memorandum of admonishment is adverse employment action). The jury could find that they were causally related to Valent&#237;n's protected conduct, both in the recent past and as contemplated in the immediate future &#8212; although her stated intentions to pursue the matter that very day never came to fruition, because she was driven past the breaking point by these very tactics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality does not, on appeal, address any of these pre-termination incidents. It focuses only on termination. Even assuming this narrow focus to be warranted, it fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, 2001, Valent&#237;n filed an administrative complaint about the sexual harassment and retaliation that she had suffered to date. On January 3, 2003, she filed this lawsuit. By the end of that month, she had been terminated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The Municipality says this was not an adverse employment action because it was a \"statutory termination\" that became \"self-executing\" when Valent&#237;n failed to avail herself of certain procedures under Puerto Rico law. The Municipality relies on P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 7, part of the Workmen's Compensation Act. That provision provides that an employer must reserve the position of an employee out on disability (as Valent&#237;n was here) and reinstate her, provided, inter alia, that the employee demands reinstatement within a year of the date her job-related disability began. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 7(1). The Municipality argues, on the basis of this provision, that Valent&#237;n's termination was \"statutory\" because she took too long to seek reinstatement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> The Municipality uses this same argument to say that even if Valent&#237;n made a prima facie showing of retaliation, it rebutted that showing by proving that it had a legitimate reason for the termination and that it would have taken the same action in any event, \"to comply with\" &#167; 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this provision of Puerto Rico law means that the employer is <i>obliged</i> to terminate an employee, even after a year has elapsed. The Municipality suggests that this provision, meant to protect disabled workers, somehow creates a duty to fire them if they have not requested reinstatement by a certain time, even if the employers are willing to grant extra time. The suggestion that the Municipality had to terminate Valent&#237;n \"to comply with\" this provision, or that hers was a \"statutory termination,\" contravenes the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's clear policy that the Workmen's Compensation Act \"must be liberally construed in favor of those whom it seeks to protect.\" <i>Garc&#237;a D&#237;az v.

Even so, the jury was not compelled to find that this was in fact the cause of her termination, or that the termination was not an adverse employment action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Lack of Faragher/Ellerth Jury Instruction</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that the court should have given it the benefit of a <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> instruction. The Municipality has taken the position that Cruz was Valent&#237;n's supervisor. It argues that even if the record shows that there was severe and pervasive harassment, there still was no tangible employment action taken against her, and so it was entitled to assert the affirmative defense under <i>Faragher/Ellerth.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality has not pointed to where in the record it ever requested a <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> instruction. Such a request does not appear in the defendants' joint proposed jury instructions, submitted before trial. In any event, the matter arose before the court instructed the jury, when the court noted that the Municipality's anti-sexual-harassment policy itself was not in evidence. The court reasoned that this omission meant the jury had no way of knowing what opportunities, provided by the Municipality, Valent&#237;n had failed to pursue. Counsel for Cruz said \"[w]e have no objections [to the court's not giving a <i>Faragher</i> instruction]. . . . We know the manual is not in evidence.\" Counsel for the Municipality stood silently by, as the Municipality concedes in its reply brief. There were no objections after the jury charge was given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n argues that the Municipality expressly waived the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> defense. The Municipality counters that Cruz' attorney did not speak for it. Although Valent&#237;n asserts that there was a work-sharing arrangement under which Cruz' waiver was binding on the Municipality, and it appears that defense counsel did de facto divide up many tasks, she has not pointed to any record evidence of a binding arrangement. We therefore give the Municipality the benefit of the doubt and treat the issue as forfeited, not waived, and we review for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 51(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means the Municipality must show that an error was committed, that it was plain (meaning obvious), that the error was prejudicial (meaning it affected substantial rights), and that review is needed to prevent a \"miscarriage of justice\" (meaning that the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\"). <i>Rivera Castillo v.

Plain error review requires that there be an error. There was none. As this court recently observed, \"[w]here the evidence shows that the defendant cannot prove an affirmative defense under the <i>Faragher</i> standard, there is no reason to remand for the giving of a <i>Faragher</i> instruction.\" <i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 87. Although there was testimony that the Municipality had an anti-sexual-harassment policy, there is no evidence that it was distributed or that employees of the police department knew about it until after several of the crucial events in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> There is no basis in the evidence that would permit a finding that the Municipality exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the Municipality has made no case that Valent&#237;n unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. Assuming such opportunities were even open to Valent&#237;n, in fact and not just on paper, she pursued them. She complained &#8212; and attempted to complain &#8212; repeatedly, to several different individuals who were proper people to whom to complain. She was ignored or worse at every turn. The Municipality's point that none of her complaints were in writing is a non sequitur in light of its failure to show that complaints had to be in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Due Process Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury awarded Valent&#237;n $125,000 in compensatory damages for the Municipality's failure to comply with her federal due process rights. The basis of this claim was that Valent&#237;n, as a tenured municipal employee, was entitled to a hearing before she was deprived of her employment, and that the Municipality did not provide such a pre-termination hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that the issue was a pure one of law for the court and it was an error to submit it to a jury. It argues that Valent&#237;n has no due process claim because even if she originally had a property interest in the position as a permanent employee, she lost that interest. That, it argues, is because as a matter of law, she lost her job by operation of the Workmen's Compensation Act, P.R.

Cruz argues that the last act of sexual harassment was in November of 2000, that the statute ran in November of 2001, and that the civil complaint was filed in January of 2003. There are several responses, including the response that Cruz ignores the fact that Valent&#237;n also complained of an ongoing pattern of harassment and retaliation well after November 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to resolve what may be a recurring issue, though, we focus on the legal ground used by the district court to reject Cruz' argument. The court held that Valent&#237;n tolled the statute of limitations on the Law 17 claim when she filed her administrative complaint on February 26, 2001, because the complaint contained \"the identical cause of action\" as that later raised in the civil suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, the statute of limitations is tolled by a plaintiff's extrajudicial claim.

This premise is incorrect. The claim was originally filed before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> and it was not brought exclusively under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Valent&#237;n listed Cruz among those who had discriminated against her. She alleged, inter alia, that she had been the victim of sexual harassment and reprisals by Cruz. Valent&#237;n's cause of action under Law 17 is identical to that raised in the administrative complaint. The administrative charge does not explicitly cite any law &#8212; Title VII, Law 17, or otherwise. But except for the fact that Law 17 expressly allows for individual liability, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167;&#167; 155a, 155d, 155j, Puerto Rico interprets Law 17 as congruent with Title VII. The administrative complaint stated all the elements necessary for a Law 17 claim and put Cruz on notice of the discrimination claim against him, as an individual. As for remedy, Valent&#237;n asked for various forms of relief, including compensatory damages &#8212; the same thing she sought from Cruz in the civil suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was enough to toll the statute of limitations. The tolling effect continued until the conclusion of the administrative proceeding. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201463\"><a href=\"/opinion/201463/rodriguez-torres-v-caribbean-forms/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.2005). Here, that conclusion was no earlier than April 1, 2002, the date on which the EEOC issued a determination that there was reason to believe the alleged sexual harassment and retaliation had in fact occurred. Valent&#237;n had a year from that date (and arguably from a later date, for reasons which are unnecessary to elaborate here) to file this lawsuit, and she did so with months to spare.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> <i>See Rodriguez Narvaez,</i> 895 F.2d at 43 (stating that \"the statute of limitations begins to run anew\" when the tolling ends).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. <i>Remitittur</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the damages awarded are duplicative and in any event excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues that the compensatory damages award is duplicative in two senses: there is an overlap between the Title VII and Law 17 claims and, second, there is an overlap between the due process claim and the Title VII/Law 17 claims. In the Municipality's view, Valent&#237;n was awarded damages for the same basic harms &#8212; sexual harassment and eventual termination &#8212; multiple times, under different legal theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality concedes that to the extent damages are properly awarded under Law 17, they are subject to mandatory doubling. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 155j(1). As to any possible overlap in damages between or among the Title VII, Law 17, and due process claims, in this circuit, the primary mechanisms to avoid impermissible duplicate awards for damages are the jury instructions and the structure of the verdict form. \"To the extent that a jury award on both claims would be duplicative, the proper practice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so as to allow the jury to recompense the plaintiff['s] injuries just once.\" <i>Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>, 569 (1st Cir.2003). Defendants should request instructions clearly directing the jury to compensate the plaintiff's injuries just once. <i>Id.</i> at 570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, this is a defense which was given away at trial. The Municipality concedes that it never objected at trial to the proposed verdict form or to the court's failure to charge the jury as to any possible overlap. Nor did it raise the argument after the jury returned the verdict and before the jury was discharged and the judgment was entered. In the post-trial motion seeking remitittur or a new trial, there was no argument as to duplication; the only argument raised was that the damages were simply \"excessive\" in light of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality falls back, in its reply brief, on plain error review. <i>See id.; Chestnut v.

But it still does not explain how the doctrine helps it. That argument is waived for lack of appellate development. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the claim that, aside from any possible duplication, the sums awarded were simply too great in light of the evidence. Even if we viewed the award as quite generous, that is not the test. The award will not be overturned unless it is grossly excessive or so high as to shock the conscience of this court. <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 733. Further, \"[w]e accord broad discretion to the trial court's decision to affirm the jury's award of damages because of that court's greater familiarity with local community standards and with the witnesses' demeanor at the trial.\" <i>Brown v.

Valent&#237;n was wrongfully deprived of her salary, both when she was driven by defendants' conduct to take disability leaves, and later when she was terminated outright.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Moreover, while she was out of work, she lost her house and her car, and she and her children were forced to move into an abandoned house. <i>Cf. Acevedo-Garcia,</i> 351 F.3d at 571 (jury may consider \"secondary economic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs' loss of earnings\"). Because of these damages and because of the harassment and threat of reprisals, Valent&#237;n suffered various forms of emotional damages and mental anguish, including, inter alia, insomnia, anxiety, guilt, and depression. The jury could believe this suffering was real and severe, based not only on Valent&#237;n's testimony that it was, but also on the fact of the nervous breakdown and the fact that she received extended psychological treatment from the SIF. <i>See O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 733-34 (upholding award based on similar emotional distress, and collecting cases). There was ample evidence that it was defendants' own continued and varied misconduct which caused the harms suffered by Valent&#237;n. The award was not excessive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cruz adds his own argument that even if he harassed Valent&#237;n, it was only from August of 2000 to November of 2000, or at most to February of 2001, and she did not suffer any financial damages or adequately proven emotional distress during this time. The argument ignores both the ample evidence of emotional damages during that very period and the fact that the evidence supported a conclusion that Cruz instigated and participated in later harassment and retaliation. More fundamentally, Cruz' artificial time limit is based on the mistaken legal premise that a defendant is not liable for damages which flow from his own actions in violation of law and are reasonably foreseeable. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 155j(1) (person responsible for harassment is liable for \"the damages that the action has <i>caused,</i>\" plus mandatory doubling) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">G. <i>Denial of Motion for New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions by the trial court to deny a motion for a new trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 89. Trial judges have more leeway to grant new trials than to set aside verdicts based on insufficiency of the evidence under Rule 50. They may consider their view of the credibility of the witnesses in doing so, but must be careful not to invade the jury's province. <i>See MacQuarrie v. Howard Johnson Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524956\"><a href=\"/opinion/524956/j-conrad-macquarrie-v-howard-johnson-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.1989). And they may grant a new trial only if they are convinced that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence, such that letting it stand would result in a miscarriage of justice. <i>Arrieta-Colon,</i> 434 F.3d at 89; <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 726. Given our account of the evidence supporting liability and damages, and the absence of any error at trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> the trial judge certainly did not abuse her discretion in denying a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">H. <i>Reinstatement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's decision to award equitable relief for an abuse of discretion. <i>Selgas v.

We review deferentially, keeping in mind the purposes of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, such as Title VII's \"dual purposes of eliminating discrimination and making its victims whole.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Municipality argues Valent&#237;n was not entitled to reinstatement, largely on the basis of its theory that Valent&#237;n's claim to her job automatically expired as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> Our earlier discussion disposes of that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second argument is made that a federal court, remedying a violation of a federal employment statute, may not order reinstatement because a state agency &#8212; here, the Puerto Rico agency known as JASAP &#8212; has exclusive jurisdiction over a personnel claim. Not surprisingly, there is no support offered for the Municipality's confusion of basic principles. The Municipality cites a statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 1334, which does not establish JASAP's exclusive power at all. It also relies on <i>Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197882\"><a href=\"/opinion/197882/baez-cruz-v-comerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998), a political discrimination case, which lends no support to the Municipality's position. The plaintiffs in <i>Baez-Cruz</i> lost before JASAP, which found that their dismissals were not politically motivated, and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed. <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. This court held that Puerto Rico's issue preclusion doctrine ended the matter for purposes of the lawsuit in federal courts. <i>Id.</i> at 29-31. Here, of course, there can be no argument that Valent&#237;n is collaterally estopped by any factual finding of JASAP or the Puerto Rico courts. <i>Baez-Cruz</i> did not in any way limit the principle that Congress specifies the remedies for violation of federal law such as Title VII and has not ceded that power to the states or to Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took into account the requisite equitable considerations, including the fact that Valent&#237;n's original hiring was valid, that she met the eligibility requirements for her job, and that she had not found comparable work. The Municipality cites not a single equitable factor in support of its position. There was no abuse of discretion in the decision to order reinstatement, which is, after all, the preferred remedy under Title VII. <i>Selgas,</i> 104 F.3d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Valent&#237;n also had been a police officer from 1988 or 1989 to 1990, leaving for reasons not material to this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cruz conceded frequently driving by, but he said this was because his house was nearby, and he denied honking his horn</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Gonzalez denied that Valent&#237;n had ever complained to her about Cruz.

In any event, the Municipality cites no additional authority for any time frame other than the one in &#167; 7</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The Municipality goes so far as to suggest that Valent&#237;n \"was not terminated.\" This contention is plainly contrary to the record, including the parties' stipulations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The Municipality goes beyond seeking a new trial. It claims it was actually entitled to judgment as a matter of law against any liability for Cruz' conduct. It argues that a properly instructed jury not only might have found, but would have been compelled to find, that the<i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> defense was satisfied. But in the post-trial motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the verdict and other relief, the defense failed to discuss the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> defense at all. The argument, even if it had been preserved, fails for the reasons stated in the text.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Valent&#237;n first received a copy of the Municipality's policy in November 2001; she had never, as an employee, attended a seminar where that policy was explained. Ortiz also testified that until 2001, she had never been given a copy of the Municipality's policy. V&#233;lez testified that he did not recall receiving any sexual harassment training from the Municipality before February 14, 2001. The Mayor testified that the policy \"should have\" been distributed to employees within weeks of its adoption in September 2000, but he did not recall how the policy was actually distributed</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The Municipality may be referring to an argument made by Cruz' attorney in support of a Rule 50 motion at the close of all the evidence. Even assuming Cruz' attorney spoke for the Municipality (contrary to the Municipality's own contentions elsewhere), the argument made was only that if Valent&#237;n had sought a hearing or taken an administrative appeal under Puerto Rico law, she could have avoided any damages \"even after the 360 days had elapsed.\" Cruz' attorney did not argue that the Municipality was somehow forced to fire Valent&#237;n</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The Municipality says the onus was on Valent&#237;n to follow certain procedures. It says that under Puerto Rico law, she should have sought a pre-termination hearing within fifteen days. The Municipality does not specify within fifteen days of what event-presumably of the date Valent&#237;n received the termination letter, which is the date her employment ended, as the parties stipulated. A later hearing can hardly have been \"pre-termination,\" and it was the Municipality's duty to provide such a hearing. The Municipality also points to Valent&#237;n's failure to appeal her termination to the Puerto Rico agency known as \"JASAP\" within thirty days. These procedural arguments are waived due to lack of development on appeal. The Municipality cites no authority for the existence, application, or effect of the Puerto Rico procedures said to have been ignored by Valent&#237;n</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The Municipality is affected by Law 17, which doubled a portion of the compensatory damages award, but it does not raise a timeliness challenge on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> This court has not decided the issue of whether Title VII liability can be imposed on individuals and need not do so here. Precedent in the District of Puerto Rico, which Valent&#237;n does not challenge, bars Title VII liability against individuals<i>Maldonado-Cordero v. AT &amp; T,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313499/maldonado-cordero-v-at-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 184 (D.P.R. 1999).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The parties have not briefed the issue of whether Law 17 actually requires the filing of a prior administrative claim. It appears there may be no such requirement<i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 155l (\"It shall not be necessary to exhaust all administrative remedies for the purpose of initiating judicial procedures under &#167;&#167; 155-155l of this title.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> The Municipality, as already stated, does not make a timeliness argument. Individual liability aside, it seems clear that the filing of an administrative complaint before<i>either</i> the Puerto Rico Department of Labor or the EEOC would have been sufficient to toll the Law 17 statute of limitations. Either is sufficient under Puerto Rico's Law 100. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres,</i> 399 F.3d at 61. This same rule applies to Law 69, and there is no reason to think the rule should be different for Law 17. <i>See id.</i> (noting that both Laws 69 and 100 \"serve the purpose of combating gender discrimination in employment,\" that \"Law 69 is merely an amplification of the principles contained in Law 100,\" and that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court would probably apply the tolling rules of Law 100 to Law 69); <i>Matos Ortiz,</i> 103 F.Supp.2d at 64 (making same observation as to Laws 17, 69, and 100, and concluding that \"Law 17 and Law 69 are . . . to be interpreted <i>in pari materia</i> with Law 100\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> The jury could have determined that Valent&#237;n suffered $705,000 in total damages &#8212; with no duplication whatsoever &#8212; and then divided that amount among the various spaces on the verdict form. The defense has not shown that such apportionment did not occur or, if it did occur, that it was impermissible</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The defendants argue that the verdict should be reversed because the district court did not let Valent&#237;n's ex-husband testify that Valent&#237;n had trumped up charges against him. They argue that this was relevant to her state of mind; it showed her to be a habitual liar who staged a nervous breakdown. There was no abuse of discretion in excluding this improper evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> The Municipality quotes the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's statement that if a worker is discharged by SIF<i>before</i> the one-year term elapses and \"does not apply for reinstatement under [&#167; 7], the employer is liberated from his obligation to reserve the employment.\" <i>Garc&#237;a D&#237;az,</i> 148 D.P.R. at 378 (certified translation). Of course, Valent&#237;n did not claim reinstatement based solely on &#167; 7 itself, but rather relied on her federal rights.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> To the extent the Municipality is arguing that JASAP has exclusive<i>initial</i> jurisdiction over reinstatement claims, and that a plaintiff bringing an action under federal law in federal court must first exhaust Puerto Rico administrative remedies, such a theory is no better supported by &#167; 1334 and <i>Baez-Cruz</i> than the theory rejected in the text.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
