Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                     Howard, Circuit Judge,\n              and Garcia-Gregory,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     James M. Fraser with whom Mark W. Pearlstein and McDermott\nWill & Emery LLP were on brief for appellant.\n     John A. Wortmann Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, U.S. Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        January 16, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.    Defendant Jameel Gibbons challenges\n\na sentence of ninety-two months' incarceration imposed on him after\n\nhe pled guilty to four crack cocaine offenses. Gibbons argues that\n\nthe district court miscalculated his criminal history category\n\n(\"CHC\") and, consequently, his Guidelines sentencing range (\"GSR\")\n\nby improperly assigning him criminal history points for two prior\n\njuvenile offenses.     That argument involves consideration of the\n\nlatitude given to federal trial judges to interpret state criminal\n\nand juvenile records.\n\n            Gibbons   also     asserts    that       the   district    court\n\nmisunderstood its authority to vary from the GSR in light of the\n\nsentencing   disparity   between    crack    and   powder   cocaine    under\n\nKimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007).               And finally\n\nGibbons contests the substantive reasonableness of his sentence\n\nbecause, in his view, the district court did not properly account\n\nfor the crack/powder sentencing disparity or his history of mental\n\nillness under the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\nThese arguments are not supported by the record.             We affirm his\n\nsentence.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            The Bromley-Heath public housing project, operated by the\n\nBoston   Housing   Authority   (\"BHA\"),     serves    Boston's    low-income\n\npopulation in need of affordable housing.          In early 2006, Bromley-\n\nHeath had an extremely high rate of drug offenses, violent crimes,\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffirearm incidents, fatal shootings, and sexual assaults.            Indeed,\n\none Bromley-Heath building, 279 Centre Street, was one of ten \"red\n\nzones\" designated by the City of Boston -- a red zone is a hot spot\n\nwhere a number of shootings have occurred.         The FBI and the Boston\n\nPolice Department (\"BPD\") worked together to fight crime in the\n\nproject, trying, among other things, to reduce drug trafficking and\n\nthe violent crime it breeds.      Despite the crime, Bromley-Heath had\n\na long waiting list of people hoping to live there.\n\n           Jameel Gibbons was well known to the BHA; he was under a\n\nno   trespass   order   issued   in   August   2005,   excluding   him   from\n\nBromley-Heath and all other BHA projects. Yet Gibbons continued to\n\nreturn to Bromley-Heath.     Indeed, he was arrested for trespassing\n\nat Bromley-Heath on the day after the order had issued.              And in\n\nSeptember 2005, less than three weeks after the issuance of the\n\norder, he was shot eight times at Bromley-Heath.\n\n           On February 8, 2006, DEA agents attempted to purchase\n\nheroin from Gibbons, who was inside Bromley-Heath, as part of an\n\ninvestigation unrelated to the FBI/BPD operation.             Gibbons fled\n\nbefore completing the sale, but DEA agents arrested him just\n\noutside of the project and found him in possession of 3.15 grams of\n\ncrack cocaine, packaged into twenty-four bags.          Later, the FBI/BPD\n\noperation in Bromley-Heath wired a cooperating witness (\"CW\"), who\n\nrecorded his drug transactions with Gibbons. Gibbons made separate\n\ndeliveries of crack cocaine to the CW on three dates in April 2006,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\feither inside the project or within 1000 feet of it.            All of these\n\nsales were recorded, and the total amount of crack cocaine involved\n\nin those three sales was 4.91 grams.\n\n            On May 17, 2006, a grand jury indicted Gibbons on one\n\ncount of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and\n\nthree counts of distribution of crack cocaine, all in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).      The indictment charged that each offense\n\ntook place within 1000 feet of a public housing project, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 860.       On September 21, 2007, Gibbons pled\n\nguilty to all four counts.\n\n            These crimes were not Gibbons's first.          At the time of\n\nhis federal sentencing, his criminal history included ten prior\n\nstate   convictions,   at   least   seven   of   which   were   for   violent\n\noffenses.    Since age thirteen, he had been under some form of\n\njudicial supervision for all but 103 days.                Even when under\n\njudicial supervision, Gibbons had not curbed his criminal conduct;\n\nmany of his crimes occurred while he was on probation or pretrial\n\nrelease. Moreover, the prosecution submitted to the district court\n\nmore than forty pages of disciplinary records about Gibbons's\n\nbehavior while in custody.\n\n            The district court made three things clear at the outset\n\nof Gibbons's sentencing hearing on January 16, 2008.              First, it\n\nrecognized that Gibbons's counsel could argue that \"the distinction\n\nbetween crack and powder cocaine[] warrants yet a further reduction\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fin the sentence\" under Kimbrough.            The Supreme Court had decided\n\nKimbrough a little more than a month before Gibbons's sentencing.\n\nSecond, the court acknowledged that many of Gibbons's arguments\n\ncould be treated both as departures under specific guideline\n\nprovisions, such as U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, and as variances under the\n\nsentencing factors included in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                 Third, it\n\nstated that its determination of Gibbons's CHC would not likely\n\nimpact     his   sentence   because    the     ninety-two   month     sentence\n\nrecommended by the government was at the low end of the GSR for CHC\n\nVI and in the middle of the GSR for CHC V.\n\n            The district court then considered the proper scoring of\n\nGibbons's criminal history as to three prior juvenile offenses,\n\ndescribed in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the presentence report\n\n(\"PSR\").    The primary issue on appeal is whether the court erred in\n\nits calculation of Gibbons's prior juvenile criminal history under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). The first juvenile offense was an armed\n\nassault with intent to kill and an assault and battery with a\n\ndangerous weapon, which occurred on June 18, 2000 when Gibbons was\n\nfifteen years old. Gibbons was adjudicated a youthful offender for\n\nthat   offense    on   August   31,   2000    and   was   committed    to   the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Youth Services (\"DYS\") custody until\n\nAugust 28, 2002, when he was transferred to adult custody until\n\nDecember 29, 2003.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            The second juvenile offense, an assault and battery and\n\nthreats to commit murder, occurred on April 3, 2001 when Gibbons\n\nwas sixteen years old.        Gibbons was adjudicated a delinquent for\n\nthat offense on June 14, 2001.          Gibbons was then already in DYS\n\ncustody, and DYS records indicate that he was transferred to a\n\ndifferent secure facility on the same day as his adjudication of\n\ndelinquency for that offense.\n\n            The    third   offense    was   an   assault     and   battery   --\n\noriginally charged as an assault and battery on a corrections\n\nofficer -- which occurred on November 26, 2001 while he was in DYS\n\ncustody.     Gibbons was sixteen years old at the time.                He was\n\nadjudicated a delinquent for that offense on January 22, 2002.                In\n\naddition to remaining in DYS -- and later adult -- custody, DYS\n\nrecords    state   that    Gibbons   received    counseling    following     his\n\nadjudication of delinquency for that offense.\n\n            Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A), a criminal defendant\n\nreceives two criminal history points \"for each adult or juvenile\n\nsentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was\n\nreleased    from    such    confinement     within    five    years   of     his\n\ncommencement of the instant offense.\"                Gibbons argued to the\n\ndistrict court that because his juvenile records were unclear about\n\nwhether his actual term of confinement was at least sixty days for\n\nthe second and third offenses described above (as he was already in\n\ncustody), he should receive, at most, one criminal history point\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ffor each offense. See id. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) (scoring one point \"for\n\neach adult or juvenile sentence . . . not covered in (A)\").\n\n          The district court concluded that Gibbons had received at\n\nleast sixty days' confinement for each of the three offenses\n\ndescribed in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the PSR and awarded him\n\ntwo criminal history points for each.      In making this finding, the\n\ncourt was well aware that the burden was on the government to show\n\nthat Gibbons's juvenile offenses were punished by at least sixty\n\ndays confinement.   See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57,\n\n74-75 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          In   total,   the   district   court   gave   Gibbons   thirteen\n\ncriminal history points, which put him into CHC VI with a GSR of 92\n\nto 115 months.   The district court also found that CHC VI did not\n\n\"overstate the seriousness\" of Gibbons's criminal history.            The\n\ncourt told Gibbons:\n\n          Your juvenile offenses and those committed\n          since you have been an adult are horrendous\n          crimes, and they deserve to be punished and to\n          be scored as the guidelines have scored them.\n          There is no justification, in this Court's\n          opinion, for deeming that they in some way --\n          or that Category VI in some way overstates the\n          seriousness of your criminal past.          If\n          anything, your criminal past deserves a longer\n          penalty than the one I am going to impose, but\n          in any event, it does not deserve a shorter\n          one.\n\n          The district court also considered and rejected Gibbons's\n\nargument that it should vary downward from the GSR in light of the\n\ncrack/powder sentencing disparity, saying:\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                   With respect to the problem of the\n          distinction between crack and powder cocaine,\n          the Court agrees with the government's\n          suggestion, that notwithstanding all of the\n          recent activity and the change of the statute\n          back in 2007 which shortens the amount of time\n          that crack cocaine criminals are subject to,\n          it   is    still    the   understanding   of   the\n          Sentencing Commission and of Congress itself\n          -- which, of course, has the right in the\n          ultimate end to change the statute if they\n          believe that it is inappropriate to consider\n          the crack and the powder cocaine discrepancy\n          one that needs to be amended. It is not for\n          this Court to legislate that.\n                   The Supreme Court has ruled properly in\n          connection with how the Court is to look at\n          these distinctions, but it has not instructed\n          this    Court    that   it   needs   to  discount\n          completely the statutory enactment which\n          attributes     to    crack   cocaine   a   greater\n          seriousness      than     to    powder   cocaine.\n          Therefore, the Court does not attribute to the\n          recent decision in Kimbrough any lessons for\n          the sentence in this case.\n\n          Additionally, the district court addressed Gibbons's\n\nrequest for a downward departure on the basis of his diminished\n\ncapacity under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, which was based on an opinion\n\nletter from forensic psychologist Dr. John Daignault that described\n\nGibbons's history of mental illness.     The court did not attribute\n\ngreat weight to Dr. Daignault's evaluation because his examination\n\nof Gibbons was very brief and his assessment did not \"instruct [the\n\ncourt] with respect to the facts that are prevalent from the\n\nwritten record before [it].\"    The court   denied Gibbons's request\n\nfor a downward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, saying:\n\n          I do not believe that you are of diminished\n          capacity. I believe that you know what you're\n\n                                 -8-\n\f           doing. You know what right and wrong is. And\n           you have the ability to act on that knowledge.\n           And you will have the ability to act on that\n           knowledge when you get out of prison.\n\n           Finally, the court considered the sentencing factors\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including Gibbons's arguments in favor\n\nof   varying   downward   in   light    of   the   crack/powder     sentencing\n\ndisparity and his history of mental illness.                Defense counsel\n\nargued eloquently that Gibbons was disadvantaged from the start,\n\ngrowing up in a home where both parents were drug addicts and\n\nrepeatedly incarcerated, and where Gibbons had seen his father beat\n\nhis mother.     Gibbons had received psychiatric care since he was\n\neight years old.    He had abused marijuana and alcohol even before\n\nhe was a teenager and was addicted to cocaine in 2005.                His few\n\nfederal offenses, for which he was being sentenced, netted him all\n\nof $700, which he had used to live on and to pay for his own\n\ncocaine habit.\n\n           The government countered by pointing out that Gibbons\n\nchose to sell crack cocaine, not powder, because crack was more\n\naddictive and cheaper.     There was a strong correlation between the\n\nravaging of Bromley-Heath and the crack dealing that occurred\n\nthere.    Further, Gibbons's criminal activity started when he was\n\nthirteen years old and had been continuous since.\n\n           Gibbons declined to address the court himself.               After\n\nhearing   these   arguments,    the    district    court   denied    Gibbons's\n\nrequest for a downward variance because it viewed a sentence within\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe GSR as \"eminently fair . . . under the circumstances . . .\n\nhaving    considered   all    of   the    written       materials   and     the   oral\n\narguments of counsel.\"         The district court sentenced Gibbons to\n\nninety-two months in prison followed by seventy-two months of\n\nsupervised release, a sentence recommended by the government at the\n\nlow end of the GSR.       Gibbons had requested forty-eight months in\n\nprison followed by seventy-two months of supervised release.                      The\n\ndistrict court noted that Gibbons's sentencing occurred on his\n\ntwenty-third birthday and expressed its hope that Gibbons would\n\nreflect on his situation and turn his life around.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            Gibbons's first argument is that the court erred in the\n\nscoring of the juvenile convictions described in paragraphs 57\n\nthrough 59 of the PSR by concluding that Gibbons had received\n\nsentences of confinement for sixty days or more for each of those\n\ncrimes.\n\n            The   parties     disagree     over     the    standard   of     review.\n\nGibbons argues that our review of this issue is de novo, quoting\n\nUnited States v. Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d 459, 463 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(\"A question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a\n\nparticular guideline determination is a question of law and,\n\ntherefore, engenders de novo review.\").                   Gibbons misunderstands\n\nRamos-Paulino,    which      was   concerned      not     with   disputed    factual\n\nfindings but with whether the facts found permitted a conclusion\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthat a defendant was \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\"\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c).      Indeed, in Ramos-Paulino the problem\n\nwas that the district court had failed to make any factual findings\n\nat all in support of its conclusions.            Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d at\n\n464.\n\n             Gibbons's argument is different in kind from the argument\n\nin   Ramos-Paulino.     His   argument      is   that   the    court's    factual\n\nfindings that his juvenile offenses were punished by more than\n\nsixty days of confinement each did not have sufficient evidentiary\n\nsupport.     We review this type of fact-bound challenge for clear\n\nerror.    See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 200 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    Gibbons cannot show clear error; he cannot show error\n\nat all.\n\n             Federal sentencing courts must do the best they can when\n\ndrawing conclusions from state court records that were not designed\n\nwith   the    federal   Sentencing    Guidelines        in    mind.      This   is\n\nparticularly true of state juvenile records. In Massachusetts, for\n\nexample, a juvenile court may commit a child adjudicated as a\n\ndelinquent to DYS custody without specifying a particular term of\n\nconfinement.      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 58.                     DYS then\n\ndetermines the placement appropriate for each offender, which could\n\nrange from parental release to confinement at a secure facility.\n\n             The district court considered Gibbons's juvenile records\n\nand concluded that he had received sentences of sixty days or more\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fof confinement for each of the offenses described in paragraphs 57\n\nto 59 of the PSR.            Gibbons wisely does not contest that he should\n\nhave       received   two     points    for    the    first   offense     described   in\n\nparagraph 57 of the PSR.             DYS records show that he began a sentence\n\nof confinement exceeding sixty days following his arraignment for\n\nthat offense on June 28, 2000.\n\n               With respect to the second and third offenses described\n\nin paragraphs 58 and 59, the record is less clear as to the length\n\nof the sentences that Gibbons received. His juvenile records state\n\nthat he was a \"committed juvenile\" both from June 14, 2001 until\n\nDecember 29, 2003 for the offense described in paragraph 58 and\n\nfrom January 22, 2002 until December 29, 2003 for the offense\n\ndescribed       in     paragraph        59.1         These    notations     support    a\n\ndetermination that he received concurrent or overlapping sentences\n\nfor the offenses described in paragraphs 58 and 59 of the PSR.                        DYS\n\nrecords       also    show    that     Gibbons    was   held    at   secure   juvenile\n\nfacilities, and later at an adult jail, for periods exceeding sixty\n\ndays following his adjudication of delinquency for those offenses.\n\n               Moreover, Gibbons's juvenile records show that although\n\nhe was already in DYS custody at the time of his adjudication on\n\n\n       1\n          Gibbons argues that his juvenile record shows that he\nreceived only counseling for the offense listed in paragraph 59.\nBut his juvenile record states that he was held at various secure\njuvenile facilities, as well as at an adult jail, following his\nadjudication of delinquency for that offense. It seems likely that\nGibbons received counseling in addition to a sentence to\nconfinement for the offense listed in paragraph 59.\n\n                                           -12-\n\fthe second offense, he was transferred to a different secure\n\nfacility on June 14, 2001.     This date matches the date of his\n\nadjudication of delinquency for the offense listed in paragraph 58\n\nand indicates that his confinement following that date was, at\n\nleast in part, punishment for that crime.\n\n          And finally, Gibbons's juvenile crimes were very serious;\n\nboth were assault and battery offenses, and one was with a threat\n\nto commit murder.   It is unlikely that Gibbons would have received\n\nless than sixty days' confinement for those crimes, given their\n\nviolent nature.   The district court's calculation of Gibbons's CHC\n\nand, consequently, his GSR was correct.2\n\n          Gibbons next argues that the district court misunderstood\n\nits authority under Kimbrough to vary downward from the GSR based\n\nupon the crack/powder sentencing disparity. Gibbons preserved this\n\nissue for appeal,3 and our review is de novo.   See United States v.\n\nSaldana, 109 F.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          We need not consider the government's alternative\nargument that even if the district court erroneously placed Gibbons\nin CHC VI, the error was harmless because he received a sentence\nthat overlapped with the GSR for CHC V.\n     3\n          The government argues that Gibbons forfeited this\nargument by failing to object contemporaneously to the district\ncourt's statements. But here, Gibbons consistently argued before\nthe district court that it could vary downward from the GSR under\nKimbrough based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity. He was\nnot required to make a formal objection after the district court's\nruling to preserve the issue for appeal.     Cf. United States v.\nGallant, 306 F.3d 1181, 1188-89 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                -13-\n\f          Of course, \"nothing in Kimbrough requires the district\n\ncourt to take [the crack/powder sentencing] disparity into account\n\nin every crack case.\" United States v. Díaz-Fontánez, No. 06-2061,\n\n2008 WL 3188152, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug. 8, 2008) (per curiam) (citing\n\nUnited States v. King, 518 F.3d 571, 576 (8th Cir. 2008)).   Thus,\n\nthe mere fact that the district court chose not to vary from the\n\nGSR based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity is, by itself,\n\nnot a basis for vacating Gibbons's sentence.   But if the district\n\ncourt chose not to account for the crack/powder disparity based\n\nupon a mistaken belief that the Guidelines on this issue are\n\nmandatory, that would constitute a \"significant procedural error,\"\n\nGall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007), requiring that\n\nwe remand for resentencing, see, e.g., United States v. Lipscomb,\n\n539 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          Here, the district court was well aware of Kimbrough and\n\nproperly understood its authority, saying:\n\n                  The Supreme Court has ruled properly in\n          connection with how the Court is to look at\n          these distinctions, but it has not instructed\n          this   Court   that   it   needs   to  discount\n          completely the statutory enactment which\n          attributes    to   crack   cocaine   a  greater\n          seriousness     than    to    powder   cocaine.\n          Therefore, the Court does not attribute to the\n          recent decision in Kimbrough any lessons for\n          the sentence in this case.\n\n          The district court chose not to vary from the GSR because\n\nit felt that Gibbons \"deserve[d] a lengthy prison sentence\" in\n\nlight of the harm that his crack dealing had caused in the public\n\n                               -14-\n\fhousing   project.    It   considered   a   sentence   within   the   GSR\n\n\"eminently fair . . . under the circumstances            . . . having\n\nconsidered the written material and the oral arguments of counsel.\"\n\nThis case is distinguishable from the one Gibbons cites, United\n\nStates v. Burns, 526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir. 2008), where, in\n\nresponse to a defendant's request for a downward variance on the\n\nbasis of the crack/powder sentencing disparity, the district court\n\nsaid: \"The Court finds it has no -- limited discretion, if any.\n\nAnd if I do have discretion, I exercise my discretion not to\n\ndownwardly depart on that basis.\"\n\n           Finally,    Gibbons      challenges     the     substantive\n\nreasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court\n\ngave inadequate weight to the crack/powder sentencing disparity and\n\nhis history of mental illness4 when considering the sentencing\n\n\n     4\n          Gibbons argues that the district court erred by\nconsidering his mental illness arguments only in the context of his\nrequest for a departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13 and not separately\nunder the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The record\ndoes not support this claim.     At the outset of the sentencing\nhearing, the district court stated: \"With respect to the downward\ndeparture issues and the 3553 issues, I will certainly hear\ncounsel. I have read and carefully considered all of the arguments\nthat have been made by both parties in anticipation for this\nsentencing.\" Just before pronouncing its sentence, the district\ncourt denied Gibbons's requests to vary from the GSR, saying: \"I\nbelieve the guideline sentence is an eminently fair one under the\ncircumstances that I find myself in today and having considered all\nof the written material and the oral arguments of counsel before me\ntoday.\"   Gibbons argued in his sentencing memorandum that the\ndistrict court should vary from the GSR under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\nin light of his history of mental illness. The district court's\ncomments demonstrate that it considered and rejected Gibbons's\nrequest for a downward variance on that basis.\n\n                                 -15-\n\ffactors   in   18   U.S.C.   §   3553(a).    We   review   the   substantive\n\nreasonableness of Gibbons's sentence under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard, considering the totality of the circumstances. Gall, 128\n\nS. Ct. at 597; see also United States v. Russell, 537 F.3d 6, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           The sentence was substantively reasonable.             Gibbons's\n\noffenses were serious drug crimes committed in and around a public\n\nhousing project.     Gibbons, although age twenty-one at the time of\n\nhis federal offenses, had a lengthy and violent criminal history.\n\nHe had been warned to stay away from the Bromley-Heath project and\n\nnonetheless ignored the warning.

Gibbons argues that the district court miscalculated his criminal history category (\"CHC\") and, consequently, his Guidelines sentencing range (\"GSR\") by improperly assigning him criminal history points for two prior juvenile offenses. That argument involves consideration of the latitude given to federal trial judges to interpret state criminal and juvenile records.</p>\n<p>Gibbons also asserts that the district court misunderstood its authority to vary from the GSR in light of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine under <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). And finally Gibbons contests the substantive reasonableness of his sentence because, in his view, the district court did not properly account for the crack/powder sentencing disparity or his history of mental illness under the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). These arguments are not supported by the record. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The Bromley-Heath public housing project, operated by the Boston Housing Authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> (\"BHA\"), serves Boston's low-income population in need of affordable housing. In early 2006, Bromley-Heath had an extremely high rate of drug offenses, violent crimes, firearm incidents, fatal shootings, and sexual assaults. Indeed, one Bromley-Heath building, 279 Centre Street, was one of ten \"red zones\" designated by the City of Bostona red zone is a hot spot where a number of shootings have occurred. The FBI and the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") worked together to fight crime in the project, trying, among other things, to reduce drug trafficking and the violent crime it breeds. Despite the crime, Bromley-Heath had a long waiting list of people hoping to live there.</p>\n<p>Jameel Gibbons was well known to the BHA; he was under a no trespass order issued in August 2005, excluding him from Bromley-Heath and all other BHA projects. Yet Gibbons continued to return to Bromley-Heath. Indeed, he was arrested for trespassing at Bromley-Heath on the day after the order had issued. And in September 2005, less than three weeks after the issuance of the order, he was shot eight times at Bromley-Heath.</p>\n<p>On February 8, 2006, DEA agents attempted to purchase heroin from Gibbons, who was inside Bromley-Heath, as part of an investigation unrelated to the FBI/BPD operation. Gibbons fled before completing the sale, but DEA agents arrested him just outside of the project and found him in possession of 3.15 grams of crack cocaine, packaged into twenty-four bags. Later, the FBI/BPD operation in Bromley-Heath wired a cooperating witness (\"CW\"), who recorded his drug transactions with Gibbons. Gibbons made separate deliveries of crack cocaine to the CW on three dates in April 2006, either inside the project or within 1000 feet of it. All of these sales were recorded, and the total amount of crack cocaine involved in those three sales was 4.91 grams.</p>\n<p>On May 17, 2006, a grand jury indicted Gibbons on one count of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and three counts of distribution of crack cocaine, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). The indictment charged that each offense took place within 1000 feet of a public housing project, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860. On September 21, 2007, Gibbons pled guilty to all four counts.</p>\n<p>These crimes were not Gibbons's first. At the time of his federal sentencing, his criminal history included ten prior state convictions, at least seven of which were for violent offenses. Since age thirteen, he had been under some form of judicial supervision for all but 103 days. Even when under judicial supervision, Gibbons had not curbed his criminal conduct; many of his crimes occurred while he was on probation or pretrial release. Moreover, the prosecution submitted to the district court more than forty pages of disciplinary records about Gibbons's behavior while in custody.</p>\n<p>The district court made three things clear at the outset of Gibbons's sentencing hearing on January 16, 2008. First, it recognized that Gibbons's counsel could argue that \"the distinction between crack and powder cocaine[] warrants yet a further reduction in the sentence\" under <i>Kimbrough.</i> The Supreme Court had decided <i>Kimbrough</i> a little more than a month before Gibbons's sentencing. Second, the court acknowledged that many of Gibbons's arguments could be treated both as departures under specific guideline provisions, such as U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, and as variances under the sentencing factors included in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Third, it stated that its determination of Gibbons's CHC would not likely impact his sentence because the ninety-two month sentence recommended by the government was at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> the low end of the GSR for CHC VI and in the middle of the GSR for CHC V.</p>\n<p>The district court then considered the proper scoring of Gibbons's criminal history as to three prior juvenile offenses, described in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the presentence report (\"PSR\"). The primary issue on appeal is whether the court erred in its calculation of Gibbons's prior juvenile criminal history under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). The first juvenile offense was an armed assault with intent to kill and an assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, which occurred on June 18, 2000 when Gibbons was fifteen years old. Gibbons was adjudicated a youthful offender for that offense on August 31, 2000 and was committed to the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (\"DYS\") custody until August 28, 2002, when he was transferred to adult custody until December 29, 2003.</p>\n<p>The second juvenile offense, an assault and battery and threats to commit murder, occurred on April 3, 2001 when Gibbons was sixteen years old. Gibbons was adjudicated a delinquent for that offense on June 14, 2001. Gibbons was then already in DYS custody, and DYS records indicate that he was transferred to a different secure facility on the same day as his adjudication of delinquency for that offense.</p>\n<p>The third offense was an assault and batteryoriginally charged as an assault and battery on a corrections officer which occurred on November 26, 2001 while he was in DYS custody. Gibbons was sixteen years old at the time. He was adjudicated a delinquent for that offense on January 22, 2002. In addition to remaining in DYSand later adultcustody, DYS records state that Gibbons received counseling following his adjudication of delinquency for that offense.</p>\n<p>Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A), a criminal defendant receives two criminal history points \"for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.\" Gibbons argued to the district court that because his juvenile records were unclear about whether his actual term of confinement was at least sixty days for the second and third offenses described above (as he was already in custody), he should receive, at most, one criminal history point for each offense. <i>See id.</i> § 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) (scoring one point \"for each adult or juvenile sentence... not covered in (A)\").</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that Gibbons had received at least sixty days' confinement for each of the three offenses described in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the PSR and awarded him two criminal history points for each. In making this finding, the court was well aware that the burden was on the government to show that Gibbons's juvenile offenses were punished by at least sixty days confinement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 510 F.3d 57, 74-75 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>In total, the district court gave Gibbons thirteen criminal history points, which put him into CHC VI with a GSR of 92 to 115 months. The district court also found that CHC VI did not \"overstate the seriousness\" of Gibbons's criminal history. The court told Gibbons:</p>\n<blockquote>Your juvenile offenses and those committed since you have been an adult are horrendous crimes, and they deserve to be punished and to be scored as the guidelines have scored them. There is no justification, in this Court's opinion, for deeming that they in some wayor that Category VI in some way overstates the seriousness of your criminal past. If anything, your criminal past deserves a longer penalty than the one I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> am going to impose, but in any event, it does not deserve a shorter one.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court also considered and rejected Gibbons's argument that it should vary downward from the GSR in light of the crack/powder sentencing disparity, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>With respect to the problem of the distinction between crack and powder cocaine, the Court agrees with the government's suggestion, that notwithstanding all of the recent activity and the change of the statute back in 2007 which shortens the amount of time that crack cocaine criminals are subject to, it is still the understanding of the Sentencing Commission and of Congress itself which, of course, has the right in the ultimate end to change the statute if they believe that it is inappropriate to consider the crack and the powder cocaine discrepancy one that needs to be amended. It is not for this Court to legislate that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Supreme Court has ruled properly in connection with how the Court is to look at these distinctions, but it has not instructed this Court that it needs to discount completely the statutory enactment which attributes to crack cocaine a greater seriousness than to powder cocaine. Therefore, the Court does not attribute to the recent decision in <i>Kimbrough</i> any lessons for the sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the district court addressed Gibbons's request for a downward departure on the basis of his diminished capacity under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, which was based on an opinion letter from forensic psychologist Dr. John Daignault that described Gibbons's history of mental illness. The court did not attribute great weight to Dr. Daignault's evaluation because his examination of Gibbons was very brief and his assessment did not \"instruct [the court] with respect to the facts that are prevalent from the written record before [it].\" The court denied Gibbons's request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>I do not believe that you are of diminished capacity. I believe that you know what you're doing. You know what right and wrong is. And you have the ability to act on that knowledge. And you will have the ability to act on that knowledge when you get out of prison.</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the court considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including Gibbons's arguments in favor of varying downward in light of the crack/powder sentencing disparity and his history of mental illness. Defense counsel argued eloquently that Gibbons was disadvantaged from the start, growing up in a home where both parents were drug addicts and repeatedly incarcerated, and where Gibbons had seen his father beat his mother. Gibbons had received psychiatric care since he was eight years old. He had abused marijuana and alcohol even before he was a teenager and was addicted to cocaine in 2005. His few federal offenses, for which he was being sentenced, netted him all of $700, which he had used to live on and to pay for his own cocaine habit.</p>\n<p>The government countered by pointing out that Gibbons chose to sell crack cocaine, not powder, because crack was more addictive and cheaper. There was a strong correlation between the ravaging of Bromley-Heath and the crack dealing that occurred there. Further, Gibbons's criminal activity started when he was thirteen years old and had been continuous since.</p>\n<p>Gibbons declined to address the court himself. After hearing these arguments, the district court denied Gibbons's request for a downward variance because it viewed a sentence within the GSR as \"eminently fair ... under the circumstances ... having <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> considered all of the written materials and the oral arguments of counsel.\" The district court sentenced Gibbons to ninety-two months in prison followed by seventy-two months of supervised release, a sentence recommended by the government at the low end of the GSR. Gibbons had requested forty-eight months in prison followed by seventy-two months of supervised release. The district court noted that Gibbons's sentencing occurred on his twenty-third birthday and expressed its hope that Gibbons would reflect on his situation and turn his life around.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Gibbons's first argument is that the court erred in the scoring of the juvenile convictions described in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the PSR by concluding that Gibbons had received sentences of confinement for sixty days or more for each of those crimes.</p>\n<p>The parties disagree over the standard of review. Gibbons argues that our review of this issue is de novo, quoting <i>United States v. Ramos-Paulino,</i> 488 F.3d 459, 463 (1st Cir.2007) (\"A question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular guideline determination is a question of law and, therefore, engenders de novo review.\"). Gibbons misunderstands <i>Ramos-Paulino,</i> which was concerned not with disputed factual findings but with whether the facts found permitted a conclusion that a defendant was \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c). Indeed, in <i>Ramos-Paulino</i> the problem was that the district court had failed to make any factual findings at all in support of its conclusions. <i>Ramos-Paulino,</i> 488 F.3d at 464.</p>\n<p>Gibbons's argument is different in kind from the argument in <i>Ramos-Paulino.</i> His argument is that the court's factual findings that his juvenile offenses were punished by more than sixty days of confinement each did not have sufficient evidentiary support. We review this type of fact-bound challenge for clear error. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d 194, 200 (1st Cir.2006). Gibbons cannot show clear error; he cannot show error at all.</p>\n<p>Federal sentencing courts must do the best they can when drawing conclusions from state court records that were not designed with the federal Sentencing Guidelines in mind. This is particularly true of state juvenile records. In Massachusetts, for example, a juvenile court may commit a child adjudicated as a delinquent to DYS custody without specifying a particular term of confinement. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 58. DYS then determines the placement appropriate for each offender, which could range from parental release to confinement at a secure facility.</p>\n<p>The district court considered Gibbons's juvenile records and concluded that he had received sentences of sixty days or more of confinement for each of the offenses described in paragraphs 57 to 59 of the PSR. Gibbons wisely does not contest that he should have received two points for the first offense described in paragraph 57 of the PSR. DYS records show that he began a sentence of confinement exceeding sixty days following his arraignment for that offense on June 28, 2000.</p>\n<p>With respect to the second and third offenses described in paragraphs 58 and 59, the record is less clear as to the length of the sentences that Gibbons received. His juvenile records state that he was a \"committed juvenile\" both from June 14, 2001 until December 29, 2003 for the offense described in paragraph 58 and from January 22, 2002 until December 29, 2003 for the offense described in paragraph 59.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> These notations support a determination that he received concurrent or overlapping sentences for the offenses described in paragraphs 58 and 59 of the PSR. DYS records also show that Gibbons was held at secure juvenile facilities, and later at an adult jail, for periods exceeding sixty days following his adjudication of delinquency for those offenses.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Gibbons's juvenile records show that although he was already in DYS custody at the time of his adjudication on the second offense, he was transferred to a different secure facility on June 14, 2001. This date matches the date of his adjudication of delinquency for the offense listed in paragraph 58 and indicates that his confinement following that date was, at least in part, punishment for that crime.</p>\n<p>And finally, Gibbons's juvenile crimes were very serious; both were assault and battery offenses, and one was with a threat to commit murder. It is unlikely that Gibbons would have received less than sixty days' confinement for those crimes, given their violent nature. The district court's calculation of Gibbons's CHC and, consequently, his GSR was correct.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Gibbons next argues that the district court misunderstood its authority under <i>Kimbrough</i> to vary downward from the GSR based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity. Gibbons preserved this issue for appeal,<sup>[3]</sup> and our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Saldana,</i> 109 F.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>Of course, \"nothing in <i>Kimbrough requires</i> the district court to take [the crack/powder sentencing] disparity into account in every crack case.\" <i>United States v. Díaz-Fontánez,</i> No. 06-2061, 2008 WL 3188152, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug.8, 2008) (per curiam) (citing <i>United States v. King,</i> 518 F.3d 571, 576 (8th Cir.2008)). Thus, the mere fact that the district court chose not to vary from the GSR based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity is, by itself, not a basis for vacating Gibbons's sentence. But if the district court chose not to account for the crack/powder disparity based upon a mistaken belief that the Guidelines on this issue are mandatory, that would constitute a \"significant procedural error,\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), requiring that we remand for resentencing, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lipscomb,</i> 539 F.3d 32, 43 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court was well aware of <i>Kimbrough</i> and properly understood its authority, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>The Supreme Court has ruled properly in connection with how the Court is to look at these distinctions, but it has not instructed this Court that it needs to discount completely the statutory enactment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> which attributes to crack cocaine a greater seriousness than to powder cocaine. Therefore, the Court does not attribute to the recent decision in <i>Kimbrough</i> any lessons for the sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court chose not to vary from the GSR because it felt that Gibbons \"deserve[d] a lengthy prison sentence\" in light of the harm that his crack dealing had caused in the public housing project. It considered a sentence within the GSR \"eminently fair ... under the circumstances... having considered the written material and the oral arguments of counsel.\" This case is distinguishable from the one Gibbons cites, <i>United States v. Burns,</i> 526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008), where, in response to a defendant's request for a downward variance on the basis of the crack/powder sentencing disparity, the district court said: \"The Court finds it has nolimited discretion, if any. And if I do have discretion, I exercise my discretion not to downwardly depart on that basis.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, Gibbons challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court gave inadequate weight to the crack/powder sentencing disparity and his history of mental illness<sup>[4]</sup> when considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). We review the substantive reasonableness of Gibbons's sentence under an abuse of discretion standard, considering the totality of the circumstances. <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Russell,</i> 537 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The sentence was substantively reasonable. Gibbons's offenses were serious drug crimes committed in and around a public housing project. Gibbons, although age twenty-one at the time of his federal offenses, had a lengthy and violent criminal history. He had been warned to stay away from the Bromley-Heath project and nonetheless ignored the warning. We will not disturb a well-reasoned decision to give greater weight to particular sentencing factors over others, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Deppe,</i> 509 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.2007), and the district court was well within its discretion to sentence Gibbons to ninety-two months' imprisonment, a sentence at the low end of the GSR.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Gibbons argues that his juvenile record shows that he received only counseling for the offense listed in paragraph 59. But his juvenile record states that he was held at various secure juvenile facilities, as well as at an adult jail, following his adjudication of delinquency for that offense. It seems likely that Gibbons received counseling in addition to a sentence to confinement for the offense listed in paragraph 59.</p>\n<p>[2]  We need not consider the government's alternative argument that even if the district court erroneously placed Gibbons in CHC VI, the error was harmless because he received a sentence that overlapped with the GSR for CHC V.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government argues that Gibbons forfeited this argument by failing to object contemporaneously to the district court's statements. But here, Gibbons consistently argued before the district court that it could vary downward from the GSR under <i>Kimbrough</i> based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity. He was not required to make a formal objection after the district court's ruling to preserve the issue for appeal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Gallant,</i> 306 F.3d 1181, 1188-89 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>[4]  Gibbons argues that the district court erred by considering his mental illness arguments only in the context of his request for a departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13 and not separately under the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The record does not support this claim. At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the district court stated: \"With respect to the downward departure issues and the 3553 issues, I will certainly hear counsel. I have read and carefully considered all of the arguments that have been made by both parties in anticipation for this sentencing.\" Just before pronouncing its sentence, the district court denied Gibbons's requests to vary from the GSR, saying: \"I believe the guideline sentence is an eminently fair one under the circumstances that I find myself in today and having considered all of the written material and the oral arguments of counsel before me today.\" Gibbons argued in his sentencing memorandum that the district court should vary from the GSR under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in light of his history of mental illness. The district court's comments demonstrate that it considered and rejected Gibbons's request for a downward variance on that basis.</p>\n\n</div>",

Gibbons argues that the district court miscalculated his criminal history category (\"CHC\") and, consequently, his Guidelines sentencing range (\"GSR\") by improperly assigning him criminal history points for two prior juvenile offenses. That argument involves consideration of the latitude given to federal trial judges to interpret state criminal and juvenile records.</p>\n<p>Gibbons also asserts that the district court misunderstood its authority to vary from the GSR in light of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine under <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And finally Gibbons contests the substantive reasonableness of his sentence because, in his view, the district court did not properly account for the crack/powder sentencing disparity or his history of mental illness under the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). These arguments are not supported by the record. We affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The Bromley-Heath public housing project, operated by the Boston Housing Authority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> (\"BHA\"), serves Boston's low-income population in need of affordable housing. In early 2006, Bromley-Heath had an extremely high rate of drug offenses, violent crimes, firearm incidents, fatal shootings, and sexual assaults. Indeed, one Bromley-Heath building, 279 Centre Street, was one of ten \"red zones\" designated by the City of Bostona red zone is a hot spot where a number of shootings have occurred. The FBI and the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") worked together to fight crime in the project, trying, among other things, to reduce drug trafficking and the violent crime it breeds. Despite the crime, Bromley-Heath had a long waiting list of people hoping to live there.</p>\n<p>Jameel Gibbons was well known to the BHA; he was under a no trespass order issued in August 2005, excluding him from Bromley-Heath and all other BHA projects. Yet Gibbons continued to return to Bromley-Heath. Indeed, he was arrested for trespassing at Bromley-Heath on the day after the order had issued. And in September 2005, less than three weeks after the issuance of the order, he was shot eight times at Bromley-Heath.</p>\n<p>On February 8, 2006, DEA agents attempted to purchase heroin from Gibbons, who was inside Bromley-Heath, as part of an investigation unrelated to the FBI/BPD operation. Gibbons fled before completing the sale, but DEA agents arrested him just outside of the project and found him in possession of 3.15 grams of crack cocaine, packaged into twenty-four bags. Later, the FBI/BPD operation in Bromley-Heath wired a cooperating witness (\"CW\"), who recorded his drug transactions with Gibbons. Gibbons made separate deliveries of crack cocaine to the CW on three dates in April 2006, either inside the project or within 1000 feet of it. All of these sales were recorded, and the total amount of crack cocaine involved in those three sales was 4.91 grams.</p>\n<p>On May 17, 2006, a grand jury indicted Gibbons on one count of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and three counts of distribution of crack cocaine, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). The indictment charged that each offense took place within 1000 feet of a public housing project, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860. On September 21, 2007, Gibbons pled guilty to all four counts.</p>\n<p>These crimes were not Gibbons's first. At the time of his federal sentencing, his criminal history included ten prior state convictions, at least seven of which were for violent offenses. Since age thirteen, he had been under some form of judicial supervision for all but 103 days. Even when under judicial supervision, Gibbons had not curbed his criminal conduct; many of his crimes occurred while he was on probation or pretrial release. Moreover, the prosecution submitted to the district court more than forty pages of disciplinary records about Gibbons's behavior while in custody.</p>\n<p>The district court made three things clear at the outset of Gibbons's sentencing hearing on January 16, 2008. First, it recognized that Gibbons's counsel could argue that \"the distinction between crack and powder cocaine[] warrants yet a further reduction in the sentence\" under <i>Kimbrough.</i> The Supreme Court had decided <i>Kimbrough</i> a little more than a month before Gibbons's sentencing. Second, the court acknowledged that many of Gibbons's arguments could be treated both as departures under specific guideline provisions, such as U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, and as variances under the sentencing factors included in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Third, it stated that its determination of Gibbons's CHC would not likely impact his sentence because the ninety-two month sentence recommended by the government was at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> the low end of the GSR for CHC VI and in the middle of the GSR for CHC V.</p>\n<p>The district court then considered the proper scoring of Gibbons's criminal history as to three prior juvenile offenses, described in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the presentence report (\"PSR\"). The primary issue on appeal is whether the court erred in its calculation of Gibbons's prior juvenile criminal history under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). The first juvenile offense was an armed assault with intent to kill and an assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, which occurred on June 18, 2000 when Gibbons was fifteen years old. Gibbons was adjudicated a youthful offender for that offense on August 31, 2000 and was committed to the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (\"DYS\") custody until August 28, 2002, when he was transferred to adult custody until December 29, 2003.</p>\n<p>The second juvenile offense, an assault and battery and threats to commit murder, occurred on April 3, 2001 when Gibbons was sixteen years old. Gibbons was adjudicated a delinquent for that offense on June 14, 2001. Gibbons was then already in DYS custody, and DYS records indicate that he was transferred to a different secure facility on the same day as his adjudication of delinquency for that offense.</p>\n<p>The third offense was an assault and batteryoriginally charged as an assault and battery on a corrections officer which occurred on November 26, 2001 while he was in DYS custody. Gibbons was sixteen years old at the time. He was adjudicated a delinquent for that offense on January 22, 2002. In addition to remaining in DYSand later adultcustody, DYS records state that Gibbons received counseling following his adjudication of delinquency for that offense.</p>\n<p>Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A), a criminal defendant receives two criminal history points \"for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense.\" Gibbons argued to the district court that because his juvenile records were unclear about whether his actual term of confinement was at least sixty days for the second and third offenses described above (as he was already in custody), he should receive, at most, one criminal history point for each offense. <i>See id.</i> § 4A1.2(d)(2)(B) (scoring one point \"for each adult or juvenile sentence... not covered in (A)\").</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that Gibbons had received at least sixty days' confinement for each of the three offenses described in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the PSR and awarded him two criminal history points for each. In making this finding, the court was well aware that the burden was on the government to show that Gibbons's juvenile offenses were punished by at least sixty days confinement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203058\"><a href=\"/opinion/203058/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 74-75 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>In total, the district court gave Gibbons thirteen criminal history points, which put him into CHC VI with a GSR of 92 to 115 months. The district court also found that CHC VI did not \"overstate the seriousness\" of Gibbons's criminal history. The court told Gibbons:</p>\n<blockquote>Your juvenile offenses and those committed since you have been an adult are horrendous crimes, and they deserve to be punished and to be scored as the guidelines have scored them. There is no justification, in this Court's opinion, for deeming that they in some wayor that Category VI in some way overstates the seriousness of your criminal past. If anything, your criminal past deserves a longer penalty than the one I <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> am going to impose, but in any event, it does not deserve a shorter one.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court also considered and rejected Gibbons's argument that it should vary downward from the GSR in light of the crack/powder sentencing disparity, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>With respect to the problem of the distinction between crack and powder cocaine, the Court agrees with the government's suggestion, that notwithstanding all of the recent activity and the change of the statute back in 2007 which shortens the amount of time that crack cocaine criminals are subject to, it is still the understanding of the Sentencing Commission and of Congress itself which, of course, has the right in the ultimate end to change the statute if they believe that it is inappropriate to consider the crack and the powder cocaine discrepancy one that needs to be amended. It is not for this Court to legislate that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Supreme Court has ruled properly in connection with how the Court is to look at these distinctions, but it has not instructed this Court that it needs to discount completely the statutory enactment which attributes to crack cocaine a greater seriousness than to powder cocaine. Therefore, the Court does not attribute to the recent decision in <i>Kimbrough</i> any lessons for the sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the district court addressed Gibbons's request for a downward departure on the basis of his diminished capacity under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, which was based on an opinion letter from forensic psychologist Dr. John Daignault that described Gibbons's history of mental illness. The court did not attribute great weight to Dr. Daignault's evaluation because his examination of Gibbons was very brief and his assessment did not \"instruct [the court] with respect to the facts that are prevalent from the written record before [it].\" The court denied Gibbons's request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>I do not believe that you are of diminished capacity. I believe that you know what you're doing. You know what right and wrong is. And you have the ability to act on that knowledge. And you will have the ability to act on that knowledge when you get out of prison.</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the court considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including Gibbons's arguments in favor of varying downward in light of the crack/powder sentencing disparity and his history of mental illness. Defense counsel argued eloquently that Gibbons was disadvantaged from the start, growing up in a home where both parents were drug addicts and repeatedly incarcerated, and where Gibbons had seen his father beat his mother. Gibbons had received psychiatric care since he was eight years old. He had abused marijuana and alcohol even before he was a teenager and was addicted to cocaine in 2005. His few federal offenses, for which he was being sentenced, netted him all of $700, which he had used to live on and to pay for his own cocaine habit.</p>\n<p>The government countered by pointing out that Gibbons chose to sell crack cocaine, not powder, because crack was more addictive and cheaper. There was a strong correlation between the ravaging of Bromley-Heath and the crack dealing that occurred there. Further, Gibbons's criminal activity started when he was thirteen years old and had been continuous since.</p>\n<p>Gibbons declined to address the court himself. After hearing these arguments, the district court denied Gibbons's request for a downward variance because it viewed a sentence within the GSR as \"eminently fair ... under the circumstances ... having <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> considered all of the written materials and the oral arguments of counsel.\" The district court sentenced Gibbons to ninety-two months in prison followed by seventy-two months of supervised release, a sentence recommended by the government at the low end of the GSR. Gibbons had requested forty-eight months in prison followed by seventy-two months of supervised release. The district court noted that Gibbons's sentencing occurred on his twenty-third birthday and expressed its hope that Gibbons would reflect on his situation and turn his life around.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Gibbons's first argument is that the court erred in the scoring of the juvenile convictions described in paragraphs 57 through 59 of the PSR by concluding that Gibbons had received sentences of confinement for sixty days or more for each of those crimes.</p>\n<p>The parties disagree over the standard of review. Gibbons argues that our review of this issue is de novo, quoting <i>United States v. Ramos-Paulino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202753\"><a href=\"/opinion/202753/united-states-v-ramos-paulino/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span>, 463 (1st Cir.2007) (\"A question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular guideline determination is a question of law and, therefore, engenders de novo review.\"). Gibbons misunderstands <i>Ramos-Paulino,</i> which was concerned not with disputed factual findings but with whether the facts found permitted a conclusion that a defendant was \"an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\" under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c). Indeed, in <i>Ramos-Paulino</i> the problem was that the district court had failed to make any factual findings at all in support of its conclusions. <i>Ramos-Paulino,</i> 488 F.3d at 464.</p>\n<p>Gibbons's argument is different in kind from the argument in <i>Ramos-Paulino.</i> His argument is that the court's factual findings that his juvenile offenses were punished by more than sixty days of confinement each did not have sufficient evidentiary support. We review this type of fact-bound challenge for clear error. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202231\"><a href=\"/opinion/202231/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir.2006). Gibbons cannot show clear error; he cannot show error at all.</p>\n<p>Federal sentencing courts must do the best they can when drawing conclusions from state court records that were not designed with the federal Sentencing Guidelines in mind. This is particularly true of state juvenile records. In Massachusetts, for example, a juvenile court may commit a child adjudicated as a delinquent to DYS custody without specifying a particular term of confinement. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 119, § 58. DYS then determines the placement appropriate for each offender, which could range from parental release to confinement at a secure facility.</p>\n<p>The district court considered Gibbons's juvenile records and concluded that he had received sentences of sixty days or more of confinement for each of the offenses described in paragraphs 57 to 59 of the PSR. Gibbons wisely does not contest that he should have received two points for the first offense described in paragraph 57 of the PSR. DYS records show that he began a sentence of confinement exceeding sixty days following his arraignment for that offense on June 28, 2000.</p>\n<p>With respect to the second and third offenses described in paragraphs 58 and 59, the record is less clear as to the length of the sentences that Gibbons received. His juvenile records state that he was a \"committed juvenile\" both from June 14, 2001 until December 29, 2003 for the offense described in paragraph 58 and from January 22, 2002 until December 29, 2003 for the offense described in paragraph 59.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> These notations support a determination that he received concurrent or overlapping sentences for the offenses described in paragraphs 58 and 59 of the PSR. DYS records also show that Gibbons was held at secure juvenile facilities, and later at an adult jail, for periods exceeding sixty days following his adjudication of delinquency for those offenses.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Gibbons's juvenile records show that although he was already in DYS custody at the time of his adjudication on the second offense, he was transferred to a different secure facility on June 14, 2001. This date matches the date of his adjudication of delinquency for the offense listed in paragraph 58 and indicates that his confinement following that date was, at least in part, punishment for that crime.</p>\n<p>And finally, Gibbons's juvenile crimes were very serious; both were assault and battery offenses, and one was with a threat to commit murder. It is unlikely that Gibbons would have received less than sixty days' confinement for those crimes, given their violent nature. The district court's calculation of Gibbons's CHC and, consequently, his GSR was correct.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Gibbons next argues that the district court misunderstood its authority under <i>Kimbrough</i> to vary downward from the GSR based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity. Gibbons preserved this issue for appeal,<sup>[3]</sup> and our review is de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Saldana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197274\"><a href=\"/opinion/197274/united-states-v-saldana/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>Of course, \"nothing in <i>Kimbrough requires</i> the district court to take [the crack/powder sentencing] disparity into account in every crack case.\" <i>United States v. Díaz-Fontánez,</i> No. 06-2061, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3188152</span></span>, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug.8, 2008) (per curiam) (citing <i>United States v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403923\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403923/united-states-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 576 (8th Cir.2008)). Thus, the mere fact that the district court chose not to vary from the GSR based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity is, by itself, not a basis for vacating Gibbons's sentence. But if the district court chose not to account for the crack/powder disparity based upon a mistaken belief that the Guidelines on this issue are mandatory, that would constitute a \"significant procedural error,\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 597, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007), requiring that we remand for resentencing, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lipscomb,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203508\"><a href=\"/opinion/203508/united-states-v-lipscomb/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court was well aware of <i>Kimbrough</i> and properly understood its authority, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>The Supreme Court has ruled properly in connection with how the Court is to look at these distinctions, but it has not instructed this Court that it needs to discount completely the statutory enactment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> which attributes to crack cocaine a greater seriousness than to powder cocaine. Therefore, the Court does not attribute to the recent decision in <i>Kimbrough</i> any lessons for the sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court chose not to vary from the GSR because it felt that Gibbons \"deserve[d] a lengthy prison sentence\" in light of the harm that his crack dealing had caused in the public housing project. It considered a sentence within the GSR \"eminently fair ... under the circumstances... having considered the written material and the oral arguments of counsel.\" This case is distinguishable from the one Gibbons cites, <i>United States v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"61735\"><a href=\"/opinion/61735/united-states-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 861 (5th Cir.2008), where, in response to a defendant's request for a downward variance on the basis of the crack/powder sentencing disparity, the district court said: \"The Court finds it has nolimited discretion, if any. And if I do have discretion, I exercise my discretion not to downwardly depart on that basis.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, Gibbons challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court gave inadequate weight to the crack/powder sentencing disparity and his history of mental illness<sup>[4]</sup> when considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). We review the substantive reasonableness of Gibbons's sentence under an abuse of discretion standard, considering the totality of the circumstances. <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Russell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203422\"><a href=\"/opinion/203422/united-states-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The sentence was substantively reasonable. Gibbons's offenses were serious drug crimes committed in and around a public housing project. Gibbons, although age twenty-one at the time of his federal offenses, had a lengthy and violent criminal history. He had been warned to stay away from the Bromley-Heath project and nonetheless ignored the warning. We will not disturb a well-reasoned decision to give greater weight to particular sentencing factors over others, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Deppe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203069\"><a href=\"/opinion/203069/united-states-v-deppe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2007), and the district court was well within its discretion to sentence Gibbons to ninety-two months' imprisonment, a sentence at the low end of the GSR.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Gibbons argues that his juvenile record shows that he received only counseling for the offense listed in paragraph 59. But his juvenile record states that he was held at various secure juvenile facilities, as well as at an adult jail, following his adjudication of delinquency for that offense. It seems likely that Gibbons received counseling in addition to a sentence to confinement for the offense listed in paragraph 59.</p>\n<p>[2]  We need not consider the government's alternative argument that even if the district court erroneously placed Gibbons in CHC VI, the error was harmless because he received a sentence that overlapped with the GSR for CHC V.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government argues that Gibbons forfeited this argument by failing to object contemporaneously to the district court's statements. But here, Gibbons consistently argued before the district court that it could vary downward from the GSR under <i>Kimbrough</i> based upon the crack/powder sentencing disparity. He was not required to make a formal objection after the district court's ruling to preserve the issue for appeal. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Gallant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200154\"><a href=\"/opinion/200154/united-states-v-gallant/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1188-89 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>[4]  Gibbons argues that the district court erred by considering his mental illness arguments only in the context of his request for a departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.13 and not separately under the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The record does not support this claim. At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the district court stated: \"With respect to the downward departure issues and the 3553 issues, I will certainly hear counsel. I have read and carefully considered all of the arguments that have been made by both parties in anticipation for this sentencing.\" Just before pronouncing its sentence, the district court denied Gibbons's requests to vary from the GSR, saying: \"I believe the guideline sentence is an eminently fair one under the circumstances that I find myself in today and having considered all of the written material and the oral arguments of counsel before me today.\" Gibbons argued in his sentencing memorandum that the district court should vary from the GSR under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in light of his history of mental illness. The district court's comments demonstrate that it considered and rejected Gibbons's request for a downward variance on that basis.</p>\n\n</div>",
