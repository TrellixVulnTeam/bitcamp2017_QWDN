Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                  Boudin, Howard and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Esteban Rivera-Lebron on brief pro se.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Julia M.\nMeconiates, Assistant U.S. Attorney,and Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-\nVelez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 28, 2011\n\f          Per Curiam. After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties' submissions, we affirm.     Appellant Esteban Rivera-\n\nLebron (\"Rivera\") has waived his right to appeal the denial of his\n\nmotion for a writ of audita querela because he failed to file an\n\nobjection to the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation. See\n\nUnited States v. Lugo Guerrero, 524 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nThat Report and Recommendation properly advised Rivera that a\n\nfailure to object would amount to a waiver.     See United States v.\n\nValencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n          Furthermore, we see no plain error that would cause us to\n\noverlook the waiver.   See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155 (1985).\n\n\"The armamentarium of common-law writs [is] available only to fill\n\nwhatever interstices exist in the post-conviction remedial scheme\n\nmade available to federal prisoners by way of [28 U.S.C. §] 2255.\"\n\nTrenkler v. United States, 536 F.3d 85, 97 (1st Cir. 2008).    Where\n\na prisoner has filed a motion for relief under one of the common\n\nlaw writs, the court must examine the substance of the motion to\n\ndetermine whether the claim is one that would be cognizable under\n\nsection 2255.   If so, the motion must satisfy the gate-keeping\n\nprovisions of section 2255(h) in order for the motion to proceed.\n\nId.\n\n          Rivera's motion clearly falls within the purview of\n\nsection 2255, as he challenges the validity of his sentence under\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).    The motion fails to\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fmeet the gate-keeping requirements of section 2255.    Rivera has\n\nalready filed a first section 2255 motion, so the instant filing\n\nwas, in essence, a second or successive section 2255 motion, and\n\nRivera failed to request permission first from this court to\n\nproceed with his second or successive motion as required by 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255(h).   Even if he had done so, the request would have\n\nbeen denied because the motion does not rely upon a new rule of\n\nconstitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review\n\nby the Supreme Court or upon newly discovered evidence.    See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255(h)(1) & (2).\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
