Coven, with whom Matthew L. Guadagno and Bretz &\nCoven, LLP were on brief for petitioner.\n     Laura L. Flippin, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nwith whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, and Emily\nAnne Radford, Assistant Director, and Andrew M. Eschen, Attorney,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, were on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                           May 5, 2004\n\f          CYR, Senior Circuit Judge. After petitioner De Xin Wang,\n\na citizen of the People’s Republic of China, attempted to enter the\n\nUnited States in June 1992 with a counterfeit alien registration\n\ncard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") commenced\n\nexclusion hearings. Wang thereupon submitted an asylum application\n\npredicated    on   the   contention    that   he   would    be   subjected     to\n\npolitical persecution – based on his opposition to the Communist\n\nParty – upon his return to China.           Wang was married in the United\n\nStates in 1996.      His wife gave birth to a boy in January 1997, and\n\nto a girl in May 2000.\n\n             In June 2000, an immigration judge (IJ) denied Wang’s\n\napplication    for    asylum,   and   Wang    appealed     to    the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA).      While the BIA appeal was pending, Wang\n\nhired new counsel, who submitted a motion to remand the case to the\n\nIJ based upon a “new set of circumstances”: China likely would\n\nrequire that Wang or his wife undergo forced sterilization under\n\nthe “One Child Policy” – which seeks to control the rate of China's\n\npopulation growth – because the couple already had two children.1\n\n             The BIA denied the Wang appeal, as well as his remand\n\nmotion, on the ground that (i) the birth of the second child did\n\nnot constitute “new evidence,” but instead had occurred prior to\n\n\n     1\n      The Immigration and Naturalization Act was amended in 1996 to\nprovide that a well-founded fear of forced sterilization could\nserve as a legitimate ground for granting asylum. See 8 U.S.C. §\n1101(a)(42)(B); Qin v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 302, 306-07 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe June 2000 exclusion hearing, and (ii) Wang had provided no\n\ntestimony before the IJ that he harbored any fear of coerced\n\nsterilization.\n\n           Once again Wang retained new counsel, who submitted a\n\nmotion to reopen and a second motion to remand with the BIA,\n\ncontending that Wang’s previous attorneys, who were well aware that\n\nWang had children, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by\n\nfailing to pursue the alternate sterilization defense before the\n\nIJ.2   In June 2003, the BIA denied both motions on two alternative\n\ngrounds.     First, Wang failed to satisfy the threshold procedural\n\nrequirement    that   he   submit    an    affidavit   setting    forth   the\n\nparticular    agreement    between   himself    and    his   former   counsel\n\nregarding the scope of counsel’s representation.             Second, the Wang\n\naffidavit neither established that any prejudice resulted to his\n\ncase from any omission on the part of his former counsel, nor that\n\nthere was a sufficient likelihood that he would be subjected to\n\nforced sterilization in the event he were to be returned to China.\n\nWang petitions for review of the June 2003 decision entered by the\n\nBIA.\n\n             We review the denial of a motion to reopen exclusion\n\nproceedings only for an abuse of discretion. See Mabikas v. INS,\n\n\n\n       2\n      A deportable alien possesses a Fifth Amendment due process\nright to be free from incompetent legal representation which\nrenders the deportation proceedings fundamentally unfair. See\nBetouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147, 149 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -3-\n\f358 F.3d 145, 148 (1st Cir. 2004).           An abuse of discretion will be\n\nfound   where   the    BIA    misinterprets     the    law,     or   acts   either\n\narbitrarily or capriciously. See Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Given the sheer volume of ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims asserted by deportable aliens, the BIA has developed\n\nthreshold procedural requirements in order to enable the efficient\n\nscreening of frivolous, collusive or dilatory claims. See Betouche\n\nv. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 147, 150 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing                 Matter of\n\nLozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (\"Lozada \"), and In re\n\nRivera-Claros, 21 I. & N. Dec. 599, 604-05 (BIA 1996)). One of\n\nthese threshold requirements mandates that an alien submit – with\n\nhis motion to reopen – an affidavit “describing in detail the\n\nagreement    between    the    alien   and    his     counsel    regarding    the\n\nlitigation matters the attorney was retained to address.” Id. at\n\n149 (emphasis added). The detailed information provided in this\n\nsworn affidavit enables the IJ and/or the BIA to pre-evaluate “the\n\nbona fides of the petitioner's claim in [order to] determin[e]\n\nwhether a hearing is even warranted.”           Id. at 150.\n\n            The affidavit submitted by Wang stated, in pertinent\n\npart, that his former counsel\n\n            never asked me questions about family planning\n            conditions in China. They only asked if I was\n            married and if we had children. They did not\n            mention to me that conditions in China were\n            arguments they could make for me in my\n            [asylum] petition.    They never asked about\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            what happens in China when a wife who already\n            has children becomes pregnant, about whether\n            we wanted to have more children, or whether we\n            feared being sterilized if we were sent back.\n            . . . They had many chances to add our fears\n            about sterilization to my case. . . . They\n            did not give us a chance to tell them that if\n            my wife got pregnant again we could be fined\n            or, because we already have a son, my wife\n            could be forced to have an abortion if she got\n            pregnant or that she and I would be sterilized\n            if we were sent back. . . . [H]e did not tell\n            us that we could raise the family planning\n            conditions in China in our petition. He did\n            not explain that after 1997 we could argue\n            that the family planning conditions in China\n            were a reason for asylum here. He did not ask\n            us what family conditions were like in China\n            or about our fears about what we would face if\n            we were sent back with regard to our dream of\n            having a larger family. If he did ask I would\n            have told him that my sister was forced to\n            undergo an abortion when she was almost nine\n            months pregnant with her second child.\n\nThe BIA determined that the affidavit submitted by Wang failed to\n\nsatisfy the screening test prescribed in Lozada.\n\n            In Azanor v. Ashcroft, [___ F.3d ___ (9th Cir. 2004)] No.\n\n02-73599, 2004 WL 720166 (9th Cir. Apr. 1, 2004), a virtually\n\nidentical contention was presented.         There the BIA had denied a\n\nNigerian citizen’s asylum application which contended that were she\n\nto be deported to Nigeria, she would be persecuted based upon her\n\nethnicity, religion, and political affiliation.          Thereafter, the\n\nalien retained new counsel, and submitted a motion to reopen her\n\ncase   on   the   ground   that   her    former   attorney   had   rendered\n\nineffective assistance by failing either to inquire whether she had\n\nundergone female genital mutilation (FGM) in Nigeria, or to inform\n\n                                   -5-\n\fher that fear of FGM constitutes a valid ground for asylum.         Id. at\n\n*8.\n\n             The Azanor court affirmed the BIA decision, on the ground\n\nthat Azanor failed to comply with the Lozada affidavit requirement:\n\n“[Azanor’s sworn declaration] does not describe the nature and\n\nscope of her agreement with [her former attorney] – facts essential\n\nto a full and complete evaluation of her ineffective assistance\n\nclaim.”   Id.   Like the Azanor declaration, the affidavit submitted\n\nby Wang focuses almost exclusively upon what his counsel did not\n\nsay, without ever indicating the scope of the legal representation\n\nagreed upon.    For all we can discern from the Wang affidavit, Wang\n\nmay   have   retained   these   attorneys   for   the   sole   purpose   of\n\nsubmitting an asylum application predicated upon his alleged fear\n\nof persecution due to his opposition to the Communist Party.             The\n\nWang affidavit includes no mention – nor suggestion – that Wang\n\nretained his counsel to pursue any of the other potential grounds\n\nfor asylum.\n\n             Moreover, in order to demonstrate ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel, the alien client must demonstrate that counsel’s action\n\nor inaction rendered the immigration proceeding “so fundamentally\n\nunfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his\n\ncase,\" and that there is a reasonable probability that counsel's\n\nconduct resulted in actual prejudice to the case.         See Saakian v.\n\nINS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).        The BIA did not abuse its\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fdiscretion       in    concluding   that   the   Wang   affidavit    failed   to\n\ndemonstrate that his case was prejudiced by any omission on the\n\npart       of   his    former   counsel.      Rather,   the   Wang   affidavit\n\nacknowledges that he never informed his former counsel that he\n\nfeared returning to China because he and his wife wanted to have\n\nmore children in the future, and he or she might be sterilized.3\n\nThis is a significant omission.              Although the affidavit asserts\n\nthat Wang had “no opportunity” to inform his attorneys of his fear\n\nof sterilization, Wang concedes on appeal that he was accorded the\n\nopportunity to inform his former counsel of his reasons for fearing\n\npersecution in the event he were deported to China, but that he\n\ninformed them only as to his past opposition to the Communist\n\ngovernment.           Wang now suggests that he would have advised his\n\nformer attorneys regarding his fear of sterilization as well, had\n\nhe known that it is a ground for asylum.            Yet he concedes that he\n\nwas unfamiliar with immigration law, and did not know which of his\n\nsubjective fears might entitle him to seek asylum.             Given even the\n\ngrotesque prospect of being subjected to coerced sterilization,\n\nhowever, one reasonably could be expected, at the very least, to\n\nmention any such prospect to his own counsel during the course of\n\nhis description of whatever fears he harbored in connection with\n\nreturning to China.\n\n\n\n       3\n      Nor did Wang ever testify before the IJ to any subjective\nfear of forced sterilization.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f           Additionally, Wang contends that his former attorneys,\n\nafter having been informed that Wang was a married man with\n\nchildren, should have anticipated that he would want to have more\n\nchildren, and therefore that he might harbor a fear of forced\n\nsterilization. Short of assuming either omniscience on the part of\n\ncounsel,   or    presupposing    that    Wang    retained    counsel      on   the\n\nunderstanding     that   they    would   ferret    out     every   conceivably\n\napplicable ground for asylum for which Wang might qualify, see\n\nsupra, the objective circumstances in the instant case certainly\n\ndid not compel a reasonable inference that Wang could prevail upon\n\nan   asylum     application     predicated      upon   a    fear   of     coerced\n\nsterilization.4     In order to present a viable asylum claim, the\n\napplicant must demonstrate both an objectively reasonable and a\n\nsubjective fear of persecution.            See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2);\n\nGuzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003).                     Thus, any\n\nprejudice to Wang’s case proximately flowed from Wang’s failure to\n\nconvey to counsel a predicate fact: Wang's subjective fear of such\n\npersecution.     See Azanor, [___ F.3d ___], No. 02-73599, 2004 WL\n\n720166, at *9 (“By her own admission, Azanor never informed [her\n\nformer counsel] that she had suffered FGM in Nigeria.                   Thus, any\n\n\n\n     4\n      Moreover, we note that the record evidence does not compel an\ninference that Wang’s subjective fear of sterilization would be\nconsidered objectively reasonable, as the record contains evidence\nthat the compelled sterilization policy is not enforced\nsystematically in the rural areas of China where Wang resided. Cf.\nQin, 360 F.3d at 307.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fprejudice arising from [her former attorney’s] failure to raise an\n\nFGM claim in her original deportation proceeding was directly\n\nattributable to Azanor’s failure to inform [her former attorney]\n\nrather than the quality of [his] representation.”); cf. Sims v.\n\nSingletary, 155 F.3d 1297, 1316 (11th Cir. 1998) (noting that\n\ncounsel’s performance cannot be considered deficient if counsel was\n\n\"unaware due to [the client’s] refusal to assist them in obtaining\n\nthe information”); Langford v. Day, 110 F.3d 1380, 1386-88 (9th\n\nCir. 1997) (noting that counsel’s failure to pursue a Miranda\n\ndefense did not constitute ineffective assistance, because the\n\ndefendant failed to inform his counsel of the events surrounding\n\nthe alleged Miranda violation).5\n\n          As the affidavit submitted by Wang failed to disclose\n\nsufficient   indicia   of   any   ineffective   assistance   of   counsel,\n\nSaakian, 252 F.3d at 25, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrejecting the motion to reopen the exclusion proceedings.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n     5\n      Before this court, Wang now contends, by way of analogy, that\na client charged with homicide who consults a criminal attorney,\nand merely tells him that he has an alibi defense, would expect the\nattorney to pursue other potentially available defenses as well,\nsuch as a statute-of-limitations bar. The analogy is seriously\nflawed. A criminal attorney in such a circumstance might verify\nthe viability of a limitations defense once apprised of one\nobjective fact (viz., the date of the alleged homicide), a fact\nwhich may or may not have been learned from the client.          In\ncontrast, the viability of the Wang sterilization claim would only\nbecome apparent to an attorney if and when the client expressed a\nsubjective fear, information which obviously can only be derived\nfrom the asylum applicant.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

If he did ask I would have told him that my sister was forced to undergo an abortion when she was almost nine months pregnant with her second child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA determined that the affidavit submitted by Wang failed to satisfy the screening test prescribed in <i>Lozada.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Azanor v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir.2004), a virtually identical contention was presented. There the BIA had denied a Nigerian citizen's asylum application which contended that were she to be deported to Nigeria, she would be persecuted based upon her ethnicity, religion, and political affiliation. Thereafter, the alien retained new counsel, and submitted a motion to reopen her case on the ground that her former attorney had rendered ineffective assistance by failing either to inquire whether she had undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) in Nigeria, or to inform her that fear of FGM constitutes a valid ground for asylum. <i>Id.</i> at 1022.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Azanor</i> court affirmed the BIA decision, on the ground that Azanor failed to comply with the <i>Lozada</i> affidavit requirement: \"[Azanor's sworn declaration] does not describe the nature and scope of her agreement with [her former attorney] &#8212; facts essential to a full and complete evaluation of her ineffective assistance claim.\" <i>Id.</i> Like the Azanor declaration, the affidavit submitted by Wang focuses almost exclusively upon what his counsel did <i>not</i> say, without ever indicating the scope of the legal representation agreed upon. For all we can discern from the Wang affidavit, Wang may have retained these attorneys for the sole purpose of submitting an asylum application predicated upon his alleged fear of persecution due to his opposition to the Communist Party. The Wang affidavit includes no mention &#8212; nor suggestion &#8212; that Wang retained his counsel to pursue any of the other potential grounds for asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien client must demonstrate that counsel's action or inaction rendered the immigration proceeding \"so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case,\" and that there is a reasonable probability that counsel's conduct resulted in actual prejudice to the case. <i>See Saakian v. INS,</i> 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2001). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Wang affidavit failed to demonstrate that his case was prejudiced by any omission on the part of his former counsel. Rather, the Wang affidavit acknowledges that he never informed his former counsel that he feared returning to China because he and his wife wanted to have more children in the future, and he or she might be sterilized.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This is a significant omission. Although the affidavit asserts that Wang had \"no opportunity\" to inform his attorneys of his fear of sterilization, Wang concedes on appeal that he was accorded the opportunity to inform his former counsel of his reasons for fearing persecution in the event he were deported to China, but that he informed them only as to his past opposition to the Communist government. Wang now suggests that he would have advised his former attorneys regarding his fear of sterilization as well, had he known that it is a ground for asylum. Yet he concedes that he was unfamiliar with immigration law, and did not know which of his subjective fears might entitle him to seek asylum. Given even the grotesque <i>prospect</i> of being subjected to coerced sterilization, however, one reasonably could be expected, at the very least, to mention any such prospect to his own counsel during the course of his description of whatever fears he harbored in connection with returning to China.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Wang contends that his former attorneys, after having been informed that Wang was a married man with children, should have anticipated that he would want to have more children, and therefore that he might harbor a fear of forced sterilization. Short of assuming either omniscience on the part of counsel, or presupposing that Wang retained counsel on the understanding that they would ferret out every conceivably applicable ground for asylum for which Wang might qualify, <i>see supra,</i> the objective circumstances in the instant case certainly did not compel a reasonable inference that Wang could prevail upon an asylum application predicated upon a fear of coerced sterilization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In order to present a viable asylum claim, the applicant must demonstrate both an objectively reasonable and a <i>subjective</i> fear of persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(2); <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, any prejudice to Wang's case proximately flowed from Wang's failure to convey to counsel a predicate fact: Wang's subjective fear of such persecution. <i>See Azanor,</i> 364 F.3d at 1023 (\"By her own admission, Azanor never informed [her former counsel] that she had suffered FGM in Nigeria. Thus, any prejudice arising from [her former attorney's] failure to raise an FGM claim in her original deportation proceeding was directly attributable to Azanor's failure to inform [her former attorney] rather than the quality of [his] representation.\"); <i>cf.

Wang thereupon submitted an asylum application predicated on the contention that he would be subjected to political persecution-based on his opposition to the Communist Party-upon his return to China.

While the BIA appeal was pending, Wang hired new counsel, who submitted a motion to remand the case to the IJ based upon a \"new set of circumstances\": China likely would require that Wang or his wife undergo forced sterilization under the \"One Child Policy\" &#8212; which seeks to control the rate of China's population growth &#8212; because the couple already had two children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA denied the Wang appeal, as well as his remand motion, on the ground that (i) the birth of the second child did not constitute \"new evidence,\" but instead had occurred prior to the June 2000 exclusion hearing, and (ii) Wang had provided no testimony before the IJ that he harbored any fear of coerced sterilization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again Wang retained new counsel, who submitted a motion to reopen and a second motion to remand with the BIA, contending that Wang's previous attorneys, who were well aware that Wang had children, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to pursue the alternate sterilization defense before the IJ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In June 2003, the BIA denied both motions on two alternative grounds. First, Wang failed to satisfy the threshold procedural requirement that he submit an affidavit setting forth the particular agreement between himself and his former counsel regarding the scope of counsel's representation. Second, the Wang affidavit neither established that any prejudice resulted to his case from any omission on the part of his former counsel, nor that there was a sufficient likelihood that he would be subjected to forced sterilization in the event he were to be returned to China.
