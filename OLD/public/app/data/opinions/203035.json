HOEY,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n          [Hon. George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mary Davis with whom Tisdale & Davis, P.A. was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, U.S. Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          November 29, 2007\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Two issues of law are raised as to\n\nthe   interpretation        of   the   sentencing       guideline,      U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.2(b)(4), for possession of sadistic or masochistic child\n\npornography.\n\n             Russell Hoey appeals from his sixty-three month sentence,\n\nbut not from his conviction, for possession of child pornography.\n\nHe primarily objects to the sentencing judge's application of a\n\nfour-level increase under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4) for possession of\n\nmaterial \"that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other\n\ndepictions of violence.\"         He argues (1) that the prosecution did\n\nnot   meet   its   burden   of   proving     these   images    were   of   actual\n\nchildren,    (2)   that   the    conduct     depicted   does   not    qualify   as\n\nsadomasochistic, and (3) that even if it did, the prosecutor also\n\nhad to prove the conduct actually occurred.              We reject the first\n\nargument because there was adequate evidence to support the court's\n\ndetermination that the image was of an actual child.                   As to the\n\nsecond argument, the district court did not err in defining sadism\n\nor masochism or in applying the definition to the pertinent image.\n\nWe reject the last argument as a matter of law: the Guidelines do\n\nnot require that the image represent actual sadism or masochism.\n\n\n\n                                       I.\n\n             As part of a broader investigation of a child pornography\n\nring in which Hoey was implicated as a customer, the U.S. Postal\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fInspection Service mailed Hoey a fake solicitation to purchase\n\nfurther    child   pornography    in    August    2004.      Based   on    Hoey's\n\naffirmative response and payment of $45 for two videotapes entitled\n\n\"Kissing Cousins\" and \"Boys and Girls,\" an undercover postal\n\ninspector   made   a   controlled      delivery   of   the   tapes    to   Hoey's\n\nresidence that November.        After Hoey accepted the package, other\n\ninspectors secured the residence while a warrant was obtained.\n\n            Upon questioning, Hoey admitted that he expected to see\n\nreal children involved in sexual situations in the videos and that\n\nhe stored child pornography on his computer.              The computer, seized\n\nduring the search, did contain pornographic images.              These images\n\nwere submitted to the National Center for Missing and Exploited\n\nChildren    (\"Center\")    for   identification      purposes.        The   Center\n\nreported that 131 of the images contained children previously\n\nidentified by law enforcement as actual children.\n\n            Hoey pleaded guilty on November 2, 2006, to a one-count\n\ninformation for possession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B).1       He agreed that some of the material depicted\n\nchildren under age twelve and that his offense involved the use of\n\na computer; he also admitted to the prosecution version of events,\n\nwhich stated that the 131 images and the two videos depicted actual\n\n\n     1\n          That section criminalizes, inter alia, the \"knowing[]\npossess[ion of] any . . . videotape, computer disk, or any other\nmaterial that contains an image of child pornography that has been\nmailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\nby any means, including by computer.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fchildren.         Consequently,    Hoey's     Presentence     Report   (\"PSR\")\n\nrecommended       Guidelines     increases    under    section    2G2.2(b)(2)\n\n(material involving minors under age twelve), section 2G2.2(b)(6)\n\n(use of a computer in the commission of the crime), and section\n\n2G2.2(b)(7)(B) (possession of more than 150 but fewer than 300\n\nimages).2\n\n             The PSR also recommended a four-level increase under\n\nsection 2G2.2(b)(4) for possession of at least one image \"that\n\nportrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of\n\nviolence.\"       It based this recommendation on four images depicting\n\nbondage     of   young   boys   obtained    from   Hoey's   computer   but   not\n\nincluded in the 131 images identified by the Center. The Assistant\n\nU.S. Attorney subsequently submitted an additional purportedly\n\nsadomasochistic image, not among the 131 images but also identified\n\nby the Center as appearing to depict a known child.\n\n             Hoey objected to the four-level increase recommended by\n\nthe PSR and raised during the sentencing hearing the same arguments\n\nhe makes on appeal.        He called a witness who owns a photography\n\nshop to testify to the ease with which digital pictures can be\n\nmanipulated.       That witness admitted that he had never created an\n\nimage of a person without using an actual person and knew no one\n\n\n     2\n          Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 cmt. n.4(B)(ii), each\nvideotape was counted as containing seventy-five images. The PSR\nconsequently imputed 281 images to Hoey. Throughout, references to\nthe Guidelines refer to the 2006 edition of the U.S. Sentencing\nGuidelines Manual.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwho had succeeded in doing so, and that he was unable to say\n\nwhether the images were of real children or not.         The judge\n\ndiscounted this testimony, finding that the witness was not a\n\nqualified expert and was not helpful.    Hoey also argued that his\n\nserious health problems, in addition to his lack of criminal record\n\nand his good conduct between the 2004 sting and Hoey's guilty plea\n\nin 2006, were grounds for a downward departure or variance.\n\n          The district court found that the last image submitted by\n\nthe prosecutor (\"Exhibit 3A\"), which the Center had identified as\n\na known child, and one of the images identified as sadomasochistic\n\nby the PSR (\"Exhibit 5\") depicted real children and portrayed\n\nsadistic conduct.   It agreed with the prosecutor that for purposes\n\nof this guideline, it made no difference if the pictures for the\n\nenhancement were composites of real children -- that is, if they\n\nwere not accurate depictions of events that actually occurred. The\n\ncourt then calculated Hoey's Guidelines range, adding a four-level\n\nincrease for the sadistic images; denied Hoey's requests for\n\ndownward departures; and sentenced him to sixty-three months, the\n\nbottom of the calculated Guidelines range, as well as to three\n\nyears of supervised release with numerous conditions and a $100\n\nmandatory assessment.\n\n                                II.\n\nA.        Application of U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4)\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f            In sentencing appeals, we review the district court's\n\ninterpretation of the Guidelines de novo and its determinations of\n\nfacts for clear error.           United States v. Woodward, 277 F.3d 87, 91\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).          \"The government has the burden of proving the\n\nfacts     central    to     upward     adjustments          in     offense    levels        by\n\npreponderance of the evidence, not by proof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"     Id.     For the enhancement under section 2G2.2(b)(4) to\n\napply, there is no requirement that the sadomasochistic image be\n\none of the images underlying the conviction.                       That is because the\n\npossession    of    sadistic       images     is     relevant      conduct        to   Hoey's\n\noffense.     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3; United States v. Barevitch, 445\n\nF.3d 956, 958-59 (7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Ellison, 113\n\nF.3d 77, 82 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\n            1.           The Depiction of Actual Children\n\n            Possession of child pornography that does not depict\n\nactual children is not criminalized.                  See Ashcroft v. Free Speech\n\nCoal., 535 U.S. 234 (2002).              Thus the prosecutor must show by a\n\npreponderance       of    the    evidence      that    a    picture    relied          on   for\n\nsentencing    purposes       depicts     a    real    child.        United        States    v.\n\nRodriguez-Pacheco, 475 F.3d 434, 439 (1st Cir. 2007).                         Given this\n\nstandard, the prosecutor need not \"rule out every conceivable way\n\nthe   pictures      could       have   been    made        other    than     by    ordinary\n\nphotography.\" Id. at 444 (quoting United States v. Nolan, 818 F.2d\n\n1015, 1020 (1st Cir. 1987)) (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f\"The question of whether or not a particular image is of a virtual\n\nchild or of a real child is an issue of fact, to be determined by\n\nthe trier of fact\"; that determination stands unless it is clearly\n\nerroneous.   Id. at 438.\n\n           Whether an image is that of an actual child is evaluated\n\non the evidence as a whole.       Id. at 442.    There is no per se rule\n\nthat the prosecution is required to produce expert testimony in\n\nevery case to establish that the depicted child is real, for either\n\nguilt or sentencing purposes.       Id. at 437.    That is the approach\n\ntaken in seven circuits.   Id. at 440-41 (collecting cases from the\n\nSecond, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits holding that no\n\nexpert testimony is required); United States v. Salcido, --- F.3d\n\n----, 2007 WL 3037350, at *3 (9th Cir. Oct. 19, 2007) (per curiam)\n\n(same).   No circuit has adopted a per se rule requiring expert\n\ntestimony.\n\n           Hoey argues that the judge cannot make this determination\n\nbased solely on his own examination of the image.             As we have\n\npreviously noted, however, many circuits agree that \"[factfinders]\n\nare capable of distinguishing between real and virtual images,\n\nwithout   expert   assistance.\"      Id.   at   441.   The   argument   is\n\nirrelevant here in any event.      The prosecutor submitted additional\n\nevidence -- the report from the Center -- that Exhibit 3A depicted\n\na real child.   See id. at 443 (relying upon similar evidence).         As\n\nto Exhibit 3A, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fto conclude the image depicted a real child.           It takes only one\n\nsuch image for § 2G2.2(b)(4) to apply.         We examine only Exhibit 3A\n\nas to Hoey's remaining arguments.\n\n           2.        What Constitutes Sadistic Conduct\n\n           We review the district court's interpretation of the\n\nGuidelines de novo. The Guidelines do not specify what constitutes\n\n\"sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\"\n\nU.S.S.G.   §    2G2.2(b)(4).     Webster's     Third   New   International\n\nDictionary defines \"sadism\" as \"the infliction of pain upon a love\n\nobject as a means of obtaining sexual release,\" \"the satisfaction\n\nof outwardly directed destructive impulses as a source of libidinal\n\ngratification,\" \"a delight in physical or mental cruelty,\" or\n\n\"excessive cruelty.\"       It follows that an image's portrayal of\n\nsadistic conduct includes portrayal of conduct a viewer would\n\nlikely think is causing pain to a depicted young child.         See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Myers, 355 F.3d 1040, 1043 (7th Cir. 2004).\n\n           Exhibit 3A portrays a young boy with an expression of\n\npain and disgust who is being anally penetrated by the penis of a\n\nmuch older man.      The relative sizes of the man's penis and the\n\nsmall boy, in addition to the boy's expression, all suggest the\n\nlikelihood of ongoing pain.      We agree with the many circuits which\n\nhave found that images depicting the sexual penetration of young\n\nand   prepubescent    children   by    adult   males   represent   conduct\n\nsufficiently likely to involve pain such as to support a finding\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthat it is inherently \"sadistic\" or similarly \"violent\" under the\n\nterms of section 2G2.2(b)(4).               See United States v. Belflower, 390\n\nF.3d 560, 562 (8th Cir. 2004) (per curiam); Myers, 355 F.3d at\n\n1043; United States v. Kimler, 335 F.3d 1132, 1143 (10th Cir.\n\n2003); United States v. Caro, 309 F.3d 1348, 1351-52 (11th Cir.\n\n2002); United States v. Lyckman, 235 F.3d 234, 238 (5th Cir. 2000);\n\nUnited States v. Delmarle, 99 F.3d 80, 83 (2d Cir. 1996).3\n\n                  Hoey   argues   that    the     image    depicts   a   man    about   to\n\npenetrate,         but   not   yet     penetrating,       the   child,   so    the   image\n\nnecessarily cannot be of sadism.                  The record does not support the\n\nargument; more importantly, as a matter of law, the proposition is\n\nwrong.      First, the district court found that the image depicted \"a\n\nyoung boy, prepubescent, being . . . penetrated by the sexual organ\n\nof a much older man,\" a finding of fact that we can only overturn\n\nif clearly erroneous, which it is not.\n\n                  Second, even if the image depicted only the moment and\n\nnot    the    consummation        of     actual    penetration,      the      conduct   is\n\nsadistic.          Here an image of attempted sexual penetration combined\n\nwith       this    young   child's       pained    expression      is    sufficient     to\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The bondage of children has also been held to constitute\nsadistic behavior. See United States v. Wolk, 337 F.3d 997, 1008\n(8th Cir. 2003); Caro, 309 F.3d at 1352; see also United States v.\nKimbrough, 69 F.3d 723, 734 (5th Cir. 1995).     Exhibit 5, which\ninvolves a young boy gagged and hanging in chains from a wall,\nclearly depicts sadistic conduct.\n\n                                            -9-\n\festablish that the picture is intended to give the viewer pleasure\n\nbased on the child's actual or anticipated pain.\n\n           Finally, Hoey argues that these pictures do not depict\n\n\"the gratuitous infliction of pain above and beyond that of child\n\npornography.\"      This argument fails to acknowledge that pictures of\n\nnaked children alone can constitute child pornography if they\n\ninvolve a \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of\n\nany person.\"        18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A)(v), (8).               A four-level\n\nincrease is warranted when a young child has been subjected to the\n\nadditional pain of penetration or similarly violent conduct.                 See\n\nMyers, 355 F.3d at 1044; Lyckman, 235 F.3d at 240.\n\n           3.        What Constitutes the Portrayal of Sadistic Conduct\n\n           Hoey argues that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport    the    finding   that    the     image   portrayed     sadistic    or\n\nmasochistic      conduct.   He     argues   that    the   image   must   portray\n\nsadistic conduct that actually occurred: the prosecutor must show\n\nnot only that the child is real, but that the sadism is as well.\n\nThis is a matter of interpretation of the Guidelines, which provide\n\nthat \"[i]f the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or\n\nmasochistic conduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4\n\nlevels.\"   U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4).\n\n              The premise of Hoey's argument is wrong, and we reject\n\nit.   That an image \"portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct\" does\n\nnot require that it depict actual sadistic conduct, id. (emphasis\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fadded); if that were the Sentencing Commission's intent, there\n\nwould be express language to that effect.            The language it did\n\nchoose is to the contrary.         Webster's Third New International\n\nDictionary defines \"portray\" as \"to represent by drawing, painting,\n\nengraving,\" \"to describe in words,\" and to \"enact.\" The Guidelines\n\nsimply do not require the image to be an accurate documentation of\n\nreal sadistic conduct.\n\n           There is no conflict between section 2G2.2(b)(4) and the\n\nchild pornography statute as interpreted by Ashcroft v. Free Speech\n\nCoalition and New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982).             Ferber\n\nupheld a criminal ban on the distribution of child pornography\n\nbecause   of   the   legitimate   state   interest   in   protecting   \"the\n\nphysiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.\"         Id. at\n\n758.   The Court emphasized that the child is harmed not only\n\nthrough the actual production of pornography, but also by the\n\nknowledge of its continued circulation.       Id. at 756-59 & n.10; see\n\nalso Ashcroft, 535 U.S. at 249 (\"Like a defamatory statement, each\n\nnew publication of the speech would cause new injury to the child's\n\nreputation and emotional well-being.\").       Based in significant part\n\non this psychological harm, the Court later upheld a statute\n\ncriminalizing the mere possession of child pornography. Osborne v.\n\nOhio, 495 U.S. 103, 110-11 (1990) (\"[T]he materials produced by\n\nchild pornographers permanently record the victim's abuse.             The\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fpornography's         continued       existence        causes     the     child      victims\n\ncontinuing harm by haunting the children in years to come.\").\n\n               It    is   this    continuing         psychological      harm    that    Hoey\n\noverlooks.          An image of an identifiable, real child involving\n\nsadistic conduct -- even if manipulated to portray conduct that was\n\nnot actually inflicted on that child -- is still harmful, and the\n\namount of emotional harm inflicted will likely correspond to the\n\nseverity of the conduct depicted.\n\n               For these reasons, the child pornography statute defines\n\n\"child pornography\" as including a \"visual depiction [that] has\n\nbeen created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable\n\nminor    is    engaging     in     sexually     explicit     conduct.\"          18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2256(8)(C) (emphasis added). While the Supreme Court in Ashcroft\n\nheld that the definitions of child pornography previously contained\n\nin § 2256(8)(B) and (D) were unconstitutional because they reached\n\nimages that were completely fabricated, it carefully reserved\n\nconsideration of § 2256(8)(C) and noted that manipulated images of\n\nidentifiable children \"implicate the interests of real children and\n\nare in that sense closer to the images in Ferber.\"                         Aschroft, 535\n\nU.S. at 242.         Based on similar reasoning, the Eighth Circuit has\n\nheld    that    an    image      in   which    the    face   of   a     known   child   was\n\ntransposed onto the naked body of an unidentified child constituted\n\nchild pornography outside the scope of First Amendment protection.\n\nUnited States v. Bach, 400 F.3d 622, 629-32 (8th Cir. 2005).                             We\n\n\n                                              -12-\n\fagree.   The district court committed no error in interpreting or\n\napplying the guideline.\n\nB.        Reasonableness of the Sentence\n\n          There was no error by the court in calculating the\n\nGuidelines range, including the relevant departures.     We turn to\n\nwhether the district court provided a reasoned explanation for the\n\nsentence imposed.   See United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\n514, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n          Hoey argues that the district court did not provide an\n\nadequate explanation because it did not address to his satisfaction\n\nhis arguments for downward departures or variances, and that as a\n\nresult the sentence imposed was unreasonably severe. This argument\n\nfails.\n\n          First, the court directly addressed Hoey's concerns.    It\n\nnoted that even though Hoey possessed very few sadistic images, the\n\nnumber   he   possessed   did   not    make   a   difference   under\n\nsection 2G2.2(b)(4); at any rate, those he did possess were so\n\ngraphic as to warrant no lenity.       The court also acknowledged\n\nHoey's serious health problems, but explained that \"the extent of\n\nthat illness is not such that it could not be adequately treated in\n\na prison facility and is not such that it calls for a departure.\"\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4 (a departure may be warranted in the case of\n\n\"an extraordinary physical impairment\" (emphasis added)); United\n\nStates v. Derbes, 369 F.3d 579, 582 (1st Cir. 2004) (a health-\n\n\n                                -13-\n\frelated departure might be justified in the unusual case where the\n\ndefendant \"would not get, or was at least unlikely to get, adequate\n\ntreatment in prison\").       Hoey complains that the court did not\n\nconsider his lack of criminal history beyond assigning him to\n\ncriminal history category I, yet that is exactly how criminal\n\nhistories are accounted for under the Guidelines.\n\n           Second, the court did discuss the applicability of the 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, emphasizing the number of images Hoey\n\npossessed, \"the nature of some of these images, the nature of the\n\nchildren depicted in these images,\" and the very young age of the\n\nvictims.   No more detailed analysis of these factors is required.\n\nUnited States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[The\n\ncourt] is not required to address those factors, one by one, in\n\nsome sort of rote incantation when explicating its sentencing\n\ndecision.\").\n\n           Third,     to   the    extent     that   Hoey      argues   these\n\nconsiderations were cursory, we note once more that \"a court's\n\nreasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the\n\nparties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge\n\ndid.\"   Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519; see also Rita v. United\n\nStates, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2469 (2007) (\"Where a matter is as\n\nconceptually simple as in the case at hand and the record makes\n\nclear   that   the   sentencing   judge    considered   the   evidence   and\n\narguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fmore extensively.\").     The court heard all of Hoey's concerns,\n\ndiscussed many of them with the attorneys during the hearing, and\n\nnoted that it had taken them all into account.       This was not an\n\nunusual   case,   and   the   court's   subsequent   explanation   was\n\nsufficient.\n\n          The court correctly determined the applicable Guidelines\n\nrange, provided an adequate explanation for its sentence, and\n\nimposed a sentence that is reasonable.     The sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f",

He primarily objects to the sentencing judge's application of a four-level increase under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4) for possession of material \"that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\" He argues (1) that the prosecution did not meet its burden of proving these images were of actual children, (2) that the conduct depicted does not qualify as sadomasochistic, and (3) that even if it did, the prosecutor also had to prove the conduct actually occurred. We reject the first argument because there was adequate evidence to support the court's determination that the image was of an actual child. As to the second argument, the district court did not err in defining sadism or masochism or in applying the definition to the pertinent image. We reject the last argument as a matter of law: the Guidelines do not require that the image represent actual sadism or masochism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>As part of a broader investigation of a child pornography ring in which Hoey was implicated as a customer, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service mailed Hoey a fake solicitation to purchase further child pornography in August 2004. Based on Hoey's affirmative response and payment of $45 for two videotapes entitled \"Kissing Cousins\" and \"Boys and Girls,\" an undercover postal inspector made a controlled delivery of the tapes to Hoey's residence that November. After Hoey accepted the package, other inspectors secured the residence while a warrant was obtained.</p>\n<p>Upon questioning, Hoey admitted that he expected to see real children involved in sexual situations in the videos and that he stored child pornography on his computer. The computer, seized during the search, did contain pornographic images. These images were submitted to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (\"Center\") for identification purposes. The Center reported that 131 of the images contained children previously identified by law enforcement as actual children.</p>\n<p>Hoey pleaded guilty on November 2, 2006, to a one-count information for possession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).<sup>[1]</sup> He agreed that some of the material depicted children under age twelve and that his offense involved the use of a computer; he also admitted to the prosecution version of events, which stated that the 131 images and the two videos depicted actual children. Consequently, Hoey's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended Guidelines increases under section 2G2.2(b)(2) (material involving minors under age twelve), section 2G2.2(b)(6) (use of a computer in the commission of the crime), and section 2G2.2(b)(7)(B) (possession of more than 150 but fewer than 300 images).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*690</span> The PSR also recommended a four-level increase under section 2G2.2(b)(4) for possession of at least one image \"that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\" It based this recommendation on four images depicting bondage of young boys obtained from Hoey's computer but not included in the 131 images identified by the Center. The Assistant U.S. Attorney subsequently submitted an additional purportedly sadomasochistic image, not among the 131 images but also identified by the Center as appearing to depict a known child.</p>\n<p>Hoey objected to the four-level increase recommended by the PSR and raised during the sentencing hearing the same arguments he makes on appeal. He called a witness who owns a photography shop to testify to the ease with which digital pictures can be manipulated. That witness admitted that he had never created an image of a person without using an actual person and knew no one who had succeeded in doing so, and that he was unable to say whether the images were of real children or not. The judge discounted this testimony, finding that the witness was not a qualified expert and was not helpful. Hoey also argued that his serious health problems, in addition to his lack of criminal record and his good conduct between the 2004 sting and Hoey's guilty plea in 2006, were grounds for a downward departure or variance.</p>\n<p>The district court found that the last image submitted by the prosecutor (\"Exhibit 3A\"), which the Center had identified as a known child, and one of the images identified as sadomasochistic by the PSR (\"Exhibit 5\") depicted real children and portrayed sadistic conduct. It agreed with the prosecutor that for purposes of this guideline, it made no difference if the pictures for the enhancement were composites of real children  that is, if they were not accurate depictions of events that actually occurred. The court then calculated Hoey's Guidelines range, adding a four-level increase for the sadistic images; denied Hoey's requests for downward departures; and sentenced him to sixty-three months, the bottom of the calculated Guidelines range, as well as to three years of supervised release with numerous conditions and a $100 mandatory assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Application of U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4)</i></p>\n<p>In sentencing appeals, we review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and its determinations of facts for clear error. <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 277 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.2002). \"The government has the burden of proving the facts central to upward adjustments in offense levels by preponderance of the evidence, not by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> For the enhancement under section 2G2.2(b)(4) to apply, there is no requirement that the sadomasochistic image be one of the images underlying the conviction. That is because the possession of sadistic images is relevant conduct to Hoey's offense. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3; <i>United States v. Barevich,</i> 445 F.3d 956, 958-59 (7th Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Ellison,</i> 113 F.3d 77, 82 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>1. <i>The Depiction of Actual Children</i></p>\n<p>Possession of child pornography that does not depict actual children is not criminalized. <i>See </i><i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal.,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*691</span> L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). Thus the prosecutor must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a picture relied on for sentencing purposes depicts a real child. <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Pacheco,</i> 475 F.3d 434, 439 (1st Cir.2007). Given this standard, the prosecutor need not \"rule out every conceivable way the pictures could have been made other than by ordinary photography.\" <i>Id.</i> at 444 (quoting <i>United States v. Nolan,</i> 818 F.2d 1015, 1020 (1st Cir.1987)) (internal quotation mark omitted). \"The question of whether or not a particular image is of a virtual child or of a real child is an issue of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact\"; that determination stands unless it is clearly erroneous. <i>Id.</i> at 438.</p>\n<p>Whether an image is that of an actual child is evaluated on the evidence as a whole. <i>Id.</i> at 442. There is no per se rule that the prosecution is required to produce expert testimony in every case to establish that the depicted child is real, for either guilt or sentencing purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 437. That is the approach taken in seven circuits. <i>Id.</i> at 440-41 (collecting cases from the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits holding that no expert testimony is required); <i>United States v. Salcido,</i> 506 F.3d 729, 733-34 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (same). No circuit has adopted a per se rule requiring expert testimony.</p>\n<p>Hoey argues that the judge cannot make this determination based solely on his own examination of the image. As we have previously noted, however, many circuits agree that \"[factfinders] are capable of distinguishing between real and virtual images, without expert assistance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 441. The argument is irrelevant here in any event. The prosecutor submitted additional evidence  the report from the Center  that Exhibit 3A depicted a real child. <i>See id.</i> at 443 (relying upon similar evidence). As to Exhibit 3A, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude the image depicted a real child. It takes only one such image for § 2G2.2(b)(4) to apply. We examine only Exhibit 3A as to Hoey's remaining arguments.</p>\n<p>2. <i>What Constitutes Sadistic Conduct</i></p>\n<p>We review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. The Guidelines do not specify what constitutes \"sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\" U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4). Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"sadism\" as \"the infliction of pain upon a love object as a means of obtaining sexual release,\" \"the satisfaction of outwardly directed destructive impulses as a source of libidinal gratification,\" \"a delight in physical or mental cruelty,\" or \"excessive cruelty.\" It follows that an image's portrayal of sadistic conduct includes portrayal of conduct a viewer would likely think is causing pain to a depicted young child. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Myers,</i> 355 F.3d 1040, 1043 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Exhibit 3A portrays a young boy with an expression of pain and disgust who is being anally penetrated by the penis of a much older man. The relative sizes of the man's penis and the small boy, in addition to the boy's expression, all suggest the likelihood of ongoing pain. We agree with the many circuits which have found that images depicting the sexual penetration of young and prepubescent children by adult males represent conduct sufficiently likely to involve pain such as to support a finding that it is inherently \"sadistic\" or similarly \"violent\" under the terms of section 2G2.2(b)(4). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Belflower,</i> 390 F.3d 560, 562 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam); <i>Myers,</i> 355 F.3d at 1043; <i>United States v. Kimler,</i> 335 F.3d 1132, 1143 (10th <span class=\"star-pagination\">*692</span> Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Caro,</i> 309 F.3d 1348, 1351-52 (11th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Lyckman,</i> 235 F.3d 234, 238 (5th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Delmarle,</i> 99 F.3d 80, 83 (2d Cir.1996).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Hoey argues that the image depicts a man about to penetrate, but not yet penetrating, the child, so the image necessarily cannot be of sadism. The record does not support the argument; more importantly, as a matter of law, the proposition is wrong. First, the district court found that the image depicted \"a young boy, prepubescent, being . . . penetrated by the sexual organ of a much older man,\" a finding of fact that we can only overturn if clearly erroneous, which it is not.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the image depicted only the moment and not the consummation of actual penetration, the conduct is sadistic. Here an image of attempted sexual penetration combined with this young child's pained expression is sufficient to establish that the picture is intended to give the viewer pleasure based on the child's actual or anticipated pain.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hoey argues that these pictures do not depict \"the gratuitous infliction of pain above and beyond that of child pornography.\" This argument fails to acknowledge that pictures of naked children alone can constitute child pornography if they involve a \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A)(v), (8). A four-level increase is warranted when a young child has been subjected to the additional pain of penetration or similarly violent conduct. <i>See </i><i>Myers,</i> 355 F.3d at 1044; <i>Lyckman,</i> 235 F.3d at 240.</p>\n<p>3. <i>What Constitutes the Portrayal of Sadistic Conduct</i></p>\n<p>Hoey argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that the image portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct. He argues that the image must portray sadistic conduct that actually occurred: the prosecutor must show not only that the child is real, but that the sadism is as well. This is a matter of interpretation of the Guidelines, which provide that \"[i]f the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.\" U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4).</p>\n<p>The premise of Hoey's argument is wrong, and we reject it. That an image \"<i>portrays</i> sadistic or masochistic conduct\" does not require that it depict actual sadistic conduct, <i>id.</i> (emphasis added); if that were the Sentencing Commission's intent, there would be express language to that effect. The language it did choose is to the contrary. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"portray\" as \"to represent by drawing, painting, engraving,\" \"to describe in words,\" and to \"enact.\" The Guidelines simply do not require the image to be an accurate documentation of real sadistic conduct.</p>\n<p>There is no conflict between section 2G2.2(b)(4) and the child pornography statute as interpreted by <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech</i><i> Coalition</i> and <i>New York v. Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). <i>Ferber</i> upheld a criminal ban on the distribution of child pornography because of the legitimate state interest in protecting \"the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.\" <i>Id.</i> at 758, 102 S.Ct. 3348. The Court emphasized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*693</span> that the child is harmed not only through the actual production of pornography, but also by the knowledge of its continued circulation. <i>Id.</i> at 756-59 &amp; n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 3348; <i>see also </i><i>Ashcroft,</i> 535 U.S. at 249, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (\"Like a defamatory statement, each new publication of the speech would cause new injury to the child's reputation and emotional well-being.\"). Based in significant part on this psychological harm, the Court later upheld a statute criminalizing the mere possession of child pornography. <i>Osborne v. Ohio,</i> 495 U.S. 103, 110-11, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990) (\"[T]he materials produced by child pornographers permanently record the victim's abuse. The pornography's continued existence causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come.\").</p>\n<p>It is this continuing psychological harm that Hoey overlooks. An image of an identifiable, real child involving sadistic conduct  even if manipulated to portray conduct that was not actually inflicted on that child  is still harmful, and the amount of emotional harm inflicted will likely correspond to the severity of the conduct depicted.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the child pornography statute defines \"child pornography\" as including a \"visual depiction [that] has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an <i>identifiable minor</i> is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(C) (emphasis added). While the Supreme Court in <i>Ashcroft</i> held that the definitions of child pornography previously contained in § 2256(8)(B) and (D) were unconstitutional because they reached images that were completely fabricated, it carefully reserved consideration of § 2256(8)(C) and noted that manipulated images of identifiable children \"implicate the interests of real children and are in that sense closer to the images in <i>Ferber.</i>\" <i>Ashcroft,</i> 535 U.S. at 242, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Based on similar reasoning, the Eighth Circuit has held that an image in which the face of a known child was transposed onto the naked body of an unidentified child constituted child pornography outside the scope of First Amendment protection. <i>United States v. Bach,</i> 400 F.3d 622, 629-32 (8th Cir.2005). We agree. The district court committed no error in interpreting or applying the guideline.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Reasonableness of the Sentence</i></p>\n<p>There was no error by the court in calculating the Guidelines range, including the relevant departures. We turn to whether the district court provided a reasoned explanation for the sentence imposed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Hoey argues that the district court did not provide an adequate explanation because it did not address to his satisfaction his arguments for downward departures or variances, and that as a result the sentence imposed was unreasonably severe. This argument fails.</p>\n<p>First, the court directly addressed Hoey's concerns. It noted that even though Hoey possessed very few sadistic images, the number he possessed did not make a difference under section 2G2.2(b)(4); at any rate, those he did possess were so graphic as to warrant no lenity. The court also acknowledged Hoey's serious health problems, but explained that \"the extent of that illness is not such that it could not be adequately treated in a prison facility and is not such that it calls for a departure.\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4 (a departure <i>may</i> be warranted in the case of \"an <i>extraordinary</i> physical impairment\" (emphasis added)); <i>United States v. Derbes,</i> 369 F.3d 579, 582 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*694</span> Cir.2004) (a health-related departure might be justified in the unusual case where the defendant \"would not get, or was at least unlikely to get, adequate treatment in prison\"). Hoey complains that the court did not consider his lack of criminal history beyond assigning him to criminal history category I, yet that is exactly how criminal histories are accounted for under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Second, the court did discuss the applicability of the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, emphasizing the number of images Hoey possessed, \"the nature of some of these images, the nature of the children depicted in these images,\" and the very young age of the victims. No more detailed analysis of these factors is required. <i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[The court] is not required to address those factors, one by one, in some sort of rote incantation when explicating its sentencing decision.\").</p>\n<p>Third, to the extent that Hoey argues these considerations were cursory, we note once more that \"a court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\" <i>Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519; <i>see also </i><i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\"Where a matter is as conceptually simple as in the case at hand and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.\"). The court heard all of Hoey's concerns, discussed many of them with the attorneys during the hearing, and noted that it had taken them all into account. This was not an unusual case, and the court's subsequent explanation was sufficient.</p>\n<p>The court correctly determined the applicable Guidelines range, provided an adequate explanation for its sentence, and imposed a sentence that is reasonable. The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  That section criminalizes, inter alia, the \"knowing[] possess[ion of] any . . . videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>[2]  Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 cmt. n. 4(B)(ii), each videotape was counted as containing seventy-five images. The PSR consequently imputed 281 images to Hoey. Throughout, references to the Guidelines refer to the 2006 edition of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual.</p>\n<p>[3]  The bondage of children has also been held to constitute sadistic behavior. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wolk,</i> 337 F.3d 997, 1008 (8th Cir. 2003); <i>Caro,</i> 309 F.3d at 1352; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Kimbrough,</i> 69 F.3d 723, 734 (5th Cir.1995).

As to the second argument, the district court did not err in defining sadism or masochism or in applying the definition to the pertinent image. We reject the last argument as a matter of law: the Guidelines do not require that the image represent actual sadism or masochism.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>As part of a broader investigation of a child pornography ring in which Hoey was implicated as a customer, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service mailed Hoey a fake solicitation to purchase further child pornography in August 2004. Based on Hoey's affirmative response and payment of $45 for two videotapes entitled \"Kissing Cousins\" and \"Boys and Girls,\" an undercover postal inspector made a controlled delivery of the tapes to Hoey's residence that November. After Hoey accepted the package, other inspectors secured the residence while a warrant was obtained.</p>\n<p>Upon questioning, Hoey admitted that he expected to see real children involved in sexual situations in the videos and that he stored child pornography on his computer. The computer, seized during the search, did contain pornographic images. These images were submitted to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (\"Center\") for identification purposes. The Center reported that 131 of the images contained children previously identified by law enforcement as actual children.</p>\n<p>Hoey pleaded guilty on November 2, 2006, to a one-count information for possession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).<sup>[1]</sup> He agreed that some of the material depicted children under age twelve and that his offense involved the use of a computer; he also admitted to the prosecution version of events, which stated that the 131 images and the two videos depicted actual children. Consequently, Hoey's Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended Guidelines increases under section 2G2.2(b)(2) (material involving minors under age twelve), section 2G2.2(b)(6) (use of a computer in the commission of the crime), and section 2G2.2(b)(7)(B) (possession of more than 150 but fewer than 300 images).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*690</span> The PSR also recommended a four-level increase under section 2G2.2(b)(4) for possession of at least one image \"that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\" It based this recommendation on four images depicting bondage of young boys obtained from Hoey's computer but not included in the 131 images identified by the Center. The Assistant U.S. Attorney subsequently submitted an additional purportedly sadomasochistic image, not among the 131 images but also identified by the Center as appearing to depict a known child.</p>\n<p>Hoey objected to the four-level increase recommended by the PSR and raised during the sentencing hearing the same arguments he makes on appeal. He called a witness who owns a photography shop to testify to the ease with which digital pictures can be manipulated. That witness admitted that he had never created an image of a person without using an actual person and knew no one who had succeeded in doing so, and that he was unable to say whether the images were of real children or not. The judge discounted this testimony, finding that the witness was not a qualified expert and was not helpful. Hoey also argued that his serious health problems, in addition to his lack of criminal record and his good conduct between the 2004 sting and Hoey's guilty plea in 2006, were grounds for a downward departure or variance.</p>\n<p>The district court found that the last image submitted by the prosecutor (\"Exhibit 3A\"), which the Center had identified as a known child, and one of the images identified as sadomasochistic by the PSR (\"Exhibit 5\") depicted real children and portrayed sadistic conduct. It agreed with the prosecutor that for purposes of this guideline, it made no difference if the pictures for the enhancement were composites of real children  that is, if they were not accurate depictions of events that actually occurred. The court then calculated Hoey's Guidelines range, adding a four-level increase for the sadistic images; denied Hoey's requests for downward departures; and sentenced him to sixty-three months, the bottom of the calculated Guidelines range, as well as to three years of supervised release with numerous conditions and a $100 mandatory assessment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Application of U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4)</i></p>\n<p>In sentencing appeals, we review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and its determinations of facts for clear error. <i>United States v.

That is because the possession of sadistic images is relevant conduct to Hoey's offense. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3; <i>United States v. Barevich,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794095\"><a href=\"/opinion/794095/united-states-v-francis-barevich/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 958-59 (7th Cir.2006); <i>United States v.

Free Speech Coal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></a></span>, 152 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*691</span> L.Ed.2d 403 (2002). Thus the prosecutor must show by a preponderance of the evidence that a picture relied on for sentencing purposes depicts a real child. <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Pacheco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202637\"><a href=\"/opinion/202637/united-states-v-rodriguez-pacheco/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 439 (1st Cir.2007). Given this standard, the prosecutor need not \"rule out every conceivable way the pictures could have been made other than by ordinary photography.\" <i>Id.</i> at 444 (quoting <i>United States v. Nolan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488519\"><a href=\"/opinion/488519/united-states-v-edward-f-nolan-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span>, 1020 (1st Cir.1987)) (internal quotation mark omitted). \"The question of whether or not a particular image is of a virtual child or of a real child is an issue of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact\"; that determination stands unless it is clearly erroneous. <i>Id.</i> at 438.</p>\n<p>Whether an image is that of an actual child is evaluated on the evidence as a whole. <i>Id.</i> at 442. There is no per se rule that the prosecution is required to produce expert testimony in every case to establish that the depicted child is real, for either guilt or sentencing purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 437. That is the approach taken in seven circuits. <i>Id.</i> at 440-41 (collecting cases from the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits holding that no expert testimony is required); <i>United States v. Salcido,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1291722\"><a href=\"/opinion/1291722/united-states-v-salcido/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 733-34 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (same). No circuit has adopted a per se rule requiring expert testimony.</p>\n<p>Hoey argues that the judge cannot make this determination based solely on his own examination of the image. As we have previously noted, however, many circuits agree that \"[factfinders] are capable of distinguishing between real and virtual images, without expert assistance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 441. The argument is irrelevant here in any event. The prosecutor submitted additional evidence  the report from the Center  that Exhibit 3A depicted a real child. <i>See id.</i> at 443 (relying upon similar evidence). As to Exhibit 3A, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude the image depicted a real child. It takes only one such image for § 2G2.2(b)(4) to apply. We examine only Exhibit 3A as to Hoey's remaining arguments.</p>\n<p>2. <i>What Constitutes Sadistic Conduct</i></p>\n<p>We review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. The Guidelines do not specify what constitutes \"sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\" U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4). Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"sadism\" as \"the infliction of pain upon a love object as a means of obtaining sexual release,\" \"the satisfaction of outwardly directed destructive impulses as a source of libidinal gratification,\" \"a delight in physical or mental cruelty,\" or \"excessive cruelty.\" It follows that an image's portrayal of sadistic conduct includes portrayal of conduct a viewer would likely think is causing pain to a depicted young child. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784828\"><a href=\"/opinion/784828/united-states-v-martin-c-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1043 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Exhibit 3A portrays a young boy with an expression of pain and disgust who is being anally penetrated by the penis of a much older man. The relative sizes of the man's penis and the small boy, in addition to the boy's expression, all suggest the likelihood of ongoing pain. We agree with the many circuits which have found that images depicting the sexual penetration of young and prepubescent children by adult males represent conduct sufficiently likely to involve pain such as to support a finding that it is inherently \"sadistic\" or similarly \"violent\" under the terms of section 2G2.2(b)(4). <i>See </i><i>United States v. Belflower,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788472\"><a href=\"/opinion/788472/united-states-v-gary-belflower/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 562 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam); <i>Myers,</i> 355 F.3d at 1043; <i>United States v.

The record does not support the argument; more importantly, as a matter of law, the proposition is wrong. First, the district court found that the image depicted \"a young boy, prepubescent, being . . . penetrated by the sexual organ of a much older man,\" a finding of fact that we can only overturn if clearly erroneous, which it is not.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the image depicted only the moment and not the consummation of actual penetration, the conduct is sadistic. Here an image of attempted sexual penetration combined with this young child's pained expression is sufficient to establish that the picture is intended to give the viewer pleasure based on the child's actual or anticipated pain.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hoey argues that these pictures do not depict \"the gratuitous infliction of pain above and beyond that of child pornography.\" This argument fails to acknowledge that pictures of naked children alone can constitute child pornography if they involve a \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A)(v), (8). A four-level increase is warranted when a young child has been subjected to the additional pain of penetration or similarly violent conduct. <i>See </i><i>Myers,</i> 355 F.3d at 1044; <i>Lyckman,</i> 235 F.3d at 240.</p>\n<p>3. <i>What Constitutes the Portrayal of Sadistic Conduct</i></p>\n<p>Hoey argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that the image portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct. He argues that the image must portray sadistic conduct that actually occurred: the prosecutor must show not only that the child is real, but that the sadism is as well. This is a matter of interpretation of the Guidelines, which provide that \"[i]f the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.\" U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(4).</p>\n<p>The premise of Hoey's argument is wrong, and we reject it. That an image \"<i>portrays</i> sadistic or masochistic conduct\" does not require that it depict actual sadistic conduct, <i>id.</i> (emphasis added); if that were the Sentencing Commission's intent, there would be express language to that effect. The language it did choose is to the contrary. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"portray\" as \"to represent by drawing, painting, engraving,\" \"to describe in words,\" and to \"enact.\" The Guidelines simply do not require the image to be an accurate documentation of real sadistic conduct.</p>\n<p>There is no conflict between section 2G2.2(b)(4) and the child pornography statute as interpreted by <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech</i><i> Coalition</i> and <i>New York v. Ferber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span> (1982). <i>Ferber</i> upheld a criminal ban on the distribution of child pornography because of the legitimate state interest in protecting \"the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.\" <i>Id.</i> at 758, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court emphasized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*693</span> that the child is harmed not only through the actual production of pornography, but also by the knowledge of its continued circulation. <i>Id.</i> at 756-59 &amp; n. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></a></span> (\"Like a defamatory statement, each new publication of the speech would cause new injury to the child's reputation and emotional well-being.\"). Based in significant part on this psychological harm, the Court later upheld a statute criminalizing the mere possession of child pornography. <i>Osborne v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112417\"><a href=\"/opinion/112417/osborne-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 110-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112417\"><a href=\"/opinion/112417/osborne-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span> (1990) (\"[T]he materials produced by child pornographers permanently record the victim's abuse. The pornography's continued existence causes the child victims continuing harm by haunting the children in years to come.\").</p>\n<p>It is this continuing psychological harm that Hoey overlooks. An image of an identifiable, real child involving sadistic conduct  even if manipulated to portray conduct that was not actually inflicted on that child  is still harmful, and the amount of emotional harm inflicted will likely correspond to the severity of the conduct depicted.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the child pornography statute defines \"child pornography\" as including a \"visual depiction [that] has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an <i>identifiable minor</i> is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(C) (emphasis added). While the Supreme Court in <i>Ashcroft</i> held that the definitions of child pornography previously contained in § 2256(8)(B) and (D) were unconstitutional because they reached images that were completely fabricated, it carefully reserved consideration of § 2256(8)(C) and noted that manipulated images of identifiable children \"implicate the interests of real children and are in that sense closer to the images in <i>Ferber.</i>\" <i>Ashcroft,</i> 535 U.S. at 242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></a></span>. Based on similar reasoning, the Eighth Circuit has held that an image in which the face of a known child was transposed onto the naked body of an unidentified child constituted child pornography outside the scope of First Amendment protection. <i>United States v. Bach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789506\"><a href=\"/opinion/789506/united-states-of-america-v-dale-robert-bach/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 629-32 (8th Cir.2005). We agree. The district court committed no error in interpreting or applying the guideline.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Reasonableness of the Sentence</i></p>\n<p>There was no error by the court in calculating the Guidelines range, including the relevant departures. We turn to whether the district court provided a reasoned explanation for the sentence imposed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 518-19 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p>Hoey argues that the district court did not provide an adequate explanation because it did not address to his satisfaction his arguments for downward departures or variances, and that as a result the sentence imposed was unreasonably severe. This argument fails.</p>\n<p>First, the court directly addressed Hoey's concerns. It noted that even though Hoey possessed very few sadistic images, the number he possessed did not make a difference under section 2G2.2(b)(4); at any rate, those he did possess were so graphic as to warrant no lenity. The court also acknowledged Hoey's serious health problems, but explained that \"the extent of that illness is not such that it could not be adequately treated in a prison facility and is not such that it calls for a departure.\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4 (a departure <i>may</i> be warranted in the case of \"an <i>extraordinary</i> physical impairment\" (emphasis added)); <i>United States v. Derbes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201042\"><a href=\"/opinion/201042/united-states-v-derbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 582 (1st <span class=\"star-pagination\">*694</span> Cir.2004) (a health-related departure might be justified in the unusual case where the defendant \"would not get, or was at least unlikely to get, adequate treatment in prison\"). Hoey complains that the court did not consider his lack of criminal history beyond assigning him to criminal history category I, yet that is exactly how criminal histories are accounted for under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Second, the court did discuss the applicability of the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, emphasizing the number of images Hoey possessed, \"the nature of some of these images, the nature of the children depicted in these images,\" and the very young age of the victims. No more detailed analysis of these factors is required. <i>United States v. Dixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202231\"><a href=\"/opinion/202231/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[The court] is not required to address those factors, one by one, in some sort of rote incantation when explicating its sentencing decision.\").</p>\n<p>Third, to the extent that Hoey argues these considerations were cursory, we note once more that \"a court's reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\" <i>Jiménez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519; <i>see also </i><i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court heard all of Hoey's concerns, discussed many of them with the attorneys during the hearing, and noted that it had taken them all into account. This was not an unusual case, and the court's subsequent explanation was sufficient.</p>\n<p>The court correctly determined the applicable Guidelines range, provided an adequate explanation for its sentence, and imposed a sentence that is reasonable. The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  That section criminalizes, inter alia, the \"knowing[] possess[ion of] any . . . videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>[2]  Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 cmt. n. 4(B)(ii), each videotape was counted as containing seventy-five images.
