These transportation services were performed under a contract with the United States wherein the carrier agreed that the rates to be applied in computing its compensation were to be:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Rates as found in tariffs: New England Motor Rate Bureau, Inc., &amp; Middle Atlantic States Motor Carrier Conference, Inc., but not to exceed the applicable railroad rates for the same quantity between the same points.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant-appellant billed the United States for its services at the motor carrier rate and the United States pursuant to &#167; 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 955, 49 U.S.C.A. &#167; 66, paid the bills on presentation.

Then, construing the word \"points\" as meaning in transportation parlance the entire geographical area within the corporate limits of a city or town, it ruled that the plaintiff-appellant had agreed, perhaps improvidently, to provide motor carrier service from the Naval Ammunition Depot in Hingham to the Naval Reservation at Price's Neck for the same tariff that the railroad would charge for providing its more limited type of service from Hingham to Newport.

We have nothing to add to what Judge Ford said except to comment upon the defendant-appellant's contention that it performed extra services, in addition to those indicated on the bills of lading, for which it is entitled to compensation from the United States. We think it clear from United States v. New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Co., 78 S.Ct. 212, that defendant-appellant had the burden of proving the performance of such services. It cannot be said that it sustained this burden merely by presenting evidence that such services were often performed without proving that such services were performed in connection with transportation covered by specific bills of lading at issue in the case, particularly when the bills at issue showed nothing more than transportation from Hingham (in one instance from Cohasset) to Price's Neck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
