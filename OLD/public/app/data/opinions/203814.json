F. Dennis Saylor, IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                  Torruella, Stahl, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Andrew Good, with whom Philip G. Cormier and Good & Cormier,\nwere on brief for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 11, 2009\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.           This appeal arises from an\n\nongoing grand jury investigation.            The appellant, a non-target,\n\ntestified before the grand jury concerning highly technical and\n\nancient   subject   matter.        After    approximately   three   hours   of\n\ntestimony, during which the government reminded the appellant\n\nrepeatedly that a failure to testify truthfully would be subject to\n\npossible perjury charges, the government continued its examination\n\nto a later date.    In the interim, the appellant sought access to a\n\ntranscript of his prior testimony pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E)(i).           The district court denied the\n\nrequest, finding that the appellant failed to provide a strong\n\nshowing of a particularized need for access to the transcript. The\n\nappellant refused to testify further, and, on the government's\n\nmotion, the district court found the appellant in contempt.             This\n\nappeal followed.      After careful consideration, we reverse and\n\nremand.\n\n                              I.    Background\n\n           To avoid compromising the grand jury investigation, we\n\nonly discuss the bare minimum of facts necessary to dispose of this\n\nappeal.\n\n           In May 2008, the government issued a subpoena to the\n\nappellant to testify before a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts, and subsequently issued a subpoena\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdirecting him to produce documents related to the subject matter of\n\nhis testimony.\n\n            After receipt of the subpoenas, the appellant indicated\n\nthrough counsel that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right\n\nagainst    self-incrimination      and   would     refuse     to    testify.      In\n\nresponse, the government applied for and obtained an order granting\n\nthe appellant use immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002 & 6003,\n\nand compelled him to testify before the grand jury.\n\n            About a week later, in June 2008, the appellant testified\n\nbefore the grand jury for approximately three hours and fifteen\n\nminutes.     During his examination, which was conducted by three\n\nassistant U.S. attorneys simultaneously, the prosecutors warned the\n\nappellant multiple times that the use immunity order did not\n\nprotect him from prosecution for testifying falsely.                      In some\n\ninstances,    the    prosecutors     asked       repetitive        questions,    and\n\nsuggested inconsistencies in the appellant's testimony.                         Other\n\ntimes, the prosecutors verbally abused the appellant. However, the\n\nprosecutors did not indicate that they were planning to indict the\n\nappellant on perjury or obstruction of justice charges.                  Moreover,\n\nthe   appellant     was   questioned     about    events    and      documents    of\n\nsignificant complexity.        A number of these events and documents\n\ndated back to 1999.1\n\n\n1\n We note that during the course of this appeal we requested a copy\nof the transcript and exhibits from the appellant's appearance for\nour own independent review.\n\n                                       -3-\n\f              The   government        did    not       complete    its     examination.\n\nConsequently, the government ordered the appellant to return and\n\ncomplete his testimony the following week.                        At the appellant's\n\nrequest, the government agreed to continue his return to the grand\n\njury for an additional two weeks, until early July 2008.\n\n              In the interim, counsel for the appellant sent a letter\n\nto the government seeking an opportunity for the appellant to\n\nreview the transcript of his grand jury testimony in advance of his\n\nsecond day of testimony.            The government declined the request.\n\n              As a result, the appellant filed an emergency motion for\n\naccess to a transcript of his grand jury testimony pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i), which authorizes a court to order\n\ndisclosure     of     grand    jury    materials         \"preliminarily        to   or    in\n\nconnection with a judicial proceeding.\"                   In particular, appellant\n\nsought to review his transcript at the U.S. Attorney's office or a\n\nsimilar location, and further requested that his lawyer accompany\n\nhim and that the appellant be allowed to take notes.\n\n              In support of his motion, the appellant cited a recent\n\nD.C. Circuit decision, In re Grand Jury, 490 F.3d 978 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007), in which the court held that grand jury witnesses are\n\nentitled under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) to review transcripts of their\n\nown   grand    jury    testimony.           See    id.    at    980,   990.         In   the\n\nalternative,        the      appellant      argued       that     he     has    shown      a\n\nparticularized        need    for   access        to   the     transcript      given     the\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fprosecutors' warnings of possible perjury prosecution and the\n\ncomplexity of the subject matter of his testimony.   The government\n\nopposed, and argued that, under First Circuit law, the appellant\n\nmust provide \"a strong showing of particularized need\" to obtain\n\naccess, see In re Special Proceedings, 373 F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quotation marks omitted), and that the appellant had failed\n\nto do so.\n\n            A hearing was held on the same day as the filing of the\n\nemergency motion, which, as the district court noted, did \"not\n\nprovide[] a great deal of time for reflection.\"   In ruling on the\n\nmotion, the district court first acknowledged that \"at least at\n\nfirst reading I agree with the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit case.\"\n\nIn particular, the district court noted that the benefit to the\n\nwitness of access far outweighs the \"very mild burden on grand jury\n\nsecrecy, so mild as to be close to nonexistent,\" since a witness is\n\nnot bound to keep his testimony secret, and could easily debrief\n\nhis or her attorney after testifying.       Moreover, although the\n\ndistrict court recognized the \"potential administrative burden\"\n\ncaused by the D.C. Circuit rule in permitting access, it concluded,\n\nin its own view, that \"the benefit to the witness greatly outweighs\n\nthe burden to the government.\"\n\n            Nevertheless, the district court concluded that it was\n\nbound by First Circuit precedent, and thus required the appellant\n\nto provide a strong showing of a particularized need for the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ftranscript in order to obtain access.        In examining whether the\n\nappellant had made a showing of particularized need, the district\n\ncourt stated:\n\n            I do not find that there is a particularized\n            need here, that is, as I interpret the case\n            law, as to what is required to show a\n            particularized need; that there are three\n            unusual aspects to this:    The first is that\n            the testimony spread over two days or more\n            than one day; the second is that the witness\n            was confronted by the prosecutor and given\n            perjury warnings about the accuracy of some of\n            his statements; and the third is that the\n            subject matter is quite complex.     While to\n            some extent those facts are unusual, they're\n            not highly unusual, and I don't think under\n            the [In re] Bianchi [542 F.2d 98 (1st Cir.\n            1976)] and In Re: Special Proceedings line of\n            cases are enough to show particularized need.\n\nAccordingly, the district court denied the motion.\n\n            One week later, in mid-July 2008, the appellant appeared\n\nbefore the grand jury but refused to answer questions.       That same\n\nday, the government petitioned the district court to hold the\n\nappellant in civil contempt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1826.        Still\n\nthat same day, the district court conducted a hearing during which\n\nit allowed the government's petition for contempt in an oral ruling\n\nand written order.    However, the district court stayed that order\n\nduring the pendency of any appeal.\n\n            Counsel for the appellant also pointed out that the\n\ntranscript of the appellant's first day of grand jury testimony was\n\nnow available, and moved the district court to order the government\n\nto   file   the   transcript   with   the   court.   After   initially\n\n                                  -6-\n\fentertaining the request, the district court denied the motion,\n\nbecause    it    was   concerned    about    the   \"mechanical     difficulties\n\ninvolved,\" and since it was \"not relying on what the transcript\n\nsaid, I don't feel I need to see the transcript.             I won't make it\n\npart of the record.\"\n\n                              II.     Discussion\n\n            On appeal, the appellant contends that the district court\n\nerred in denying his request to review a transcript of his grand\n\njury testimony prior to his second day of examination.               We review\n\nany rulings of law de novo, and, to the extent we find no legal\n\nerror, any denial of disclosure for abuse of discretion.              See In re\n\nGrand Jury Proceedings, 580 F.2d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 1978).\n\n            A.     Standard That Applies to a Request for Access\n\n            The appellant first contends that the district court\n\nerred as a matter of law in requiring him to provide a \"strong\n\nshowing of particularized need\" in order to obtain access to his\n\ntranscript.       Instead, the appellant argues that a \"less demanding\"\n\nstandard of particularized need applies when a grand jury witness\n\nseeks only access to a transcript of his testimony, rather than a\n\ncopy.    For support, appellant relies on In re Grand Jury, a recent\n\nD.C.    Circuit    decision   where    the   court   held   that    grand   jury\n\nwitnesses are entitled \"to review transcripts of their own grand\n\njury testimony in private at the U.S. Attorney's Office or a place\n\nagreed to by the parties or designated by the district court.\"              490\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fF.3d at 990.      Given its importance to the appellant's claims, we\n\ndiscuss the D.C. Circuit's decision in some detail.\n\n                     1.   The D.C. Circuit Decision\n\n           Grand Jury involved a grand jury investigation into a\n\ncompany and its employees.          Id. at 980.        Two employees of the\n\ncompany testified before the grand jury, and were subpoenaed to\n\ntestify an additional time.            Id.     Both moved for access to a\n\ntranscript of their prior grand jury testimony before testifying\n\nfurther,   \"in    order   to   avoid     the   possibility    of   inconsistent\n\nstatements occasioned by the passage of years since the events in\n\nquestion and many months\" since they last testified, as well as the\n\npossible need \"to take advantage of recantation pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1623.\"       Id. at 984.         The district court denied both\n\nmotions,   finding    that     neither    employee    provided     a   sufficient\n\nshowing    of    \"particularized       need\"    for   the    transcripts     that\n\n\"outweighed the interests in maintaining grand jury secrecy.\"                 Id.\n\nat 984 & n.4.\n\n           On appeal, the D.C. Circuit, addressing the issue for the\n\nfirst time, see id. at 987, noted that the district court, in\n\nrequiring a showing of particularized need, relied on Supreme Court\n\nprecedent that concerned third parties seeking copies of such\n\nmaterials.       See id. at 984 & n.3 (citing, among other cases,\n\nDouglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 222-23\n\n(1979)).     However, in contrast to a third party, a grand jury\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwitness is under no obligation to maintain the secrecy of grand\n\njury proceedings.       Id. at 985; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 6,\n\nAdvisory Committee Notes, 1944 Adoption, Note to Subdivision (e)\n\n(\"[R]ule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on witnesses.\").\n\n            With this background in mind, the D.C. Circuit addressed\n\n\"when courts should\" provide access.         Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 986.\n\nNoting that the text of Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) is \"open-ended,\" and\n\nfollowing the \"general analytic approach\" of other circuits that\n\nhave addressed the issue, the court \"weigh[ed] the competing\n\ninterests of the Government and grand jury witnesses.\" Id. at 987.\n\nAs to witnesses, the district court identified two interests in\n\nobtaining    access:     (1)    the   need    to   \"ensur[e]    that      their\n\nrecollections are accurately reflected in the transcripts,\" and\n\n(2)   for   those   witnesses   who   \"may   testify   again   in   the   same\n\ninvestigation . . . to help prepare for the upcoming testimony.\"\n\nId. at 988.         As to the government, the court identified two\n\ncompeting interests: (1) to maintain grand jury secrecy, and (2) to\n\nprevent witness intimidation.         Id.\n\n            The court concluded that the witness interests in access\n\noutweighed the government's interests in prohibiting such access.\n\nAs to secrecy, the court noted that the secrecy rationale was meant\n\nto prevent \"the public or others from learning what a grand jury\n\nwitness said to the grand jury.\"             Id.   Thus, while preventing\n\naccess to a third party was necessary to maintain the secrecy of\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fgrand jury witness testimony, preventing access to the witness\n\nhimself \"makes little sense,\" since a witness already knows the\n\ncontent of his testimony and, in any event, has the right to\n\nbroadcast the substance of his testimony if he so desired.               Id. at\n\n988-89 (noting that \"the witness can stand on the courthouse steps\n\nand   tell    the    public    everything   the   witness   was    asked   and\n\nanswered\"). The D.C. Circuit therefore concluded that \"the Supreme\n\nCourt's 'particularized need' standard, which the Court crafted to\n\ndeal with third-party requests for secret transcripts of other\n\nwitnesses' testimony, does not apply in this first-party context.\"\n\nId. at 989.\n\n             As to witness intimidation, the court found compelling\n\nthe concern that providing copies to a witness would result in\n\nthird   parties      forcing   disclosure   of    the   copies    and   thereby\n\n\"deter[ring] witnesses from testifying freely and candidly in the\n\nfirst place.\"       Id. at 989.   However, the concern with intimidation\n\n\"lacks force with respect to a witness's merely reviewing the\n\ntranscript in private at the U.S. Attorney's office or a place\n\nagreed to by the parties or designated by the district court.\"             Id.\n\nat 990.      The court, in particular, saw little difference between\n\npressure to divulge the contents after a private review of the\n\ntranscript and pressure to \"recall their testimony from memory.\"\n\nId.   Based on this weighing of interests, the court concluded that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ffirst-party witnesses are entitled to access of their transcripts\n\nunder Rule 6(e).\n\n                   2.   Analysis\n\n           The appellant contends that the D.C. Circuit's reasoning\n\nin Grand Jury supports his claim of a less demanding standard,\n\nsince he seeks the same access to a transcript of his own testimony\n\nthat the D.C. Circuit permitted.     We agree.   To be clear, we do not\n\nadopt the D.C. Circuit's holding that a grand jury witness is\n\nentitled to access to a transcript of his grand jury testimony.\n\nInstead, we hold that, in light of the considerations supporting\n\nthe D.C. Circuit decision and our own review of our precedent, a\n\nless demanding requirement of particularized need applies when a\n\ngrand jury witness demands access to a transcript, rather than a\n\ncopy of the transcript.2\n\n           Admittedly, we have held that \"a grand jury witness has\n\nno general right to the transcripts of his testimony.\"        Bianchi,\n\n542 F.2d at 100 (citing In re Bottari, 453 F.2d 370 (1st Cir.\n\n1972)).   Instead, in this circuit a witness must provide \"a strong\n\n\n\n2\n The dissent unfortunately misconstrues our decision by stating\nthat \"[t]he panel majority adopts an approach based on the\nreasoning and rationale of a recent D.C. Circuit opinion, which\npermits relatively unfettered access even for non-defendant\nwitnesses.\" (Dissent at 25). As the decision makes clear, we do\nnot adopt the D.C. Circuit approach, and although we discuss the\nD.C. Circuit at great length, we base our decision on a review of\nour precedent as well as our independent assessment of the\ninterests at stake, many of which were not addressed by the D.C.\nCircuit.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fshowing of particularized need\" in order to obtain a copy of a\n\ntranscript.       Special Proceedings, 373 F.3d at 47 (quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n              However, as the appellant correctly points out, our prior\n\ncase law has solely concerned grand jury witnesses seeking copies\n\nof    their   transcript,       while   the     appellant       seeks    only   access,\n\nunderstood as an opportunity to review the transcript. In Bottari,\n\nour    earliest    case    on    the    issue,       the   witness      sought,    as   a\n\nprecondition      to   testifying,      a     copy    of   \"a   transcript        of   the\n\nquestions and answers following his appearance before the grand\n\njury.\"    453 F.2d at 371.        Likewise, in Bianchi, the witness sought\n\n\"copies of his prior grand jury testimony.\"                        542 F.2d at 100\n\n(emphasis added).         And in Special Proceedings, a case outside the\n\ngrand jury context, but involving what we determined an analogous\n\nsituation, a special investigation, we rejected a witness's claim\n\nfor a copy of his deposition transcript.3                  373 F.3d at 47.\n\n\n3\n The dissent points out that in Special Proceedings we stated the\nfollowing:\n\n       Taricani may be arguing that as a witness he has an\n       elevated right to copies of his own deposition\n       transcript.   However, in this circuit \"a grand jury\n       witness has no general right to transcripts of his\n       testimony.\" In re Bianchi, 542 F.2d 98, 100 (1st Cir.\n       1976). Similarly, a majority of circuits hold that a\n       non-defendant witness seeking access to his own\n       deposition transcript must make \"a strong showing of\n       particularized need\" for such disclosure.\n\n373 F.3d at 47 (emphasis added). According to the dissent, the use\nof the word \"access\" above means that our precedent equally\n\n                                         -12-\n\f           In none of these cases did we have the occasion to\n\naddress whether a demand for access, which imposes a lesser burden\n\non the governmental interests of grand jury secrecy and witness\n\nintimidation, still requires a strong showing of particularized\n\nneed.   Nor has the Supreme Court opined on the issue.   However, the\n\nSupreme Court, in articulating a standard of particularized need\n\nfor third parties, has noted that its \"standard is a highly\n\nflexible one, adaptable to different circumstances and sensitive to\n\nthe fact that the requirements of secrecy are greater in some\n\n\n\n\nrequires a \"strong showing of particularized need\" for requests for\na review of a transcript. (Dissent at 26-28).\n\n     We disagree. First, the sentence in which \"access\" appears\nonly describes what the \"majority of circuits\" have held. More\nimportantly, it notes that such a holding is only \"[s]imilar[]\" to\nour own rule, which, described in the previous sentence, does not\ndeal with \"access\" but with copies, or, to borrow the words of the\nBianchi court, with \"a general right to transcripts.\" 542 F.2d at\n100 (emphasis added).\n\n     Second, the dissent relies upon Awuah v. Coverall N. Am.,\nInc., 554 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 2009), for the proposition that we give\neffect to the language of a prior panel decision even if it is\n\"perhaps broader than the precise controversy at issue.\" (Dissent\nat 27). In Awuah, however, we gave effect to broader language in\na prior decision because, although broader, it \"constitute[d] the\nrationale for the decision.\" 554 F.3d at 11. In contrast, the\nbroader statement in Special Proceedings did not \"constitute the\nrationale for the decision,\" but was a description of the holdings\nof a \"majority of circuits.\" In fact, and as discussed below, had\nthe court in Special Proceedings intended to reach access as\ndefined here, it would have at least expressed some disapproval\nwith the district court's sua sponte offer of access. Instead, the\ncourt in Special Proceedings cited the option with approval. 373\nF.3d at 47.\n\n                                -13-\n\fsituations than in others.\"       United States v. John Doe, Inc. I, 481\n\nU.S. 102, 112 (1987).     We take the same approach.\n\n           We begin by discussing the significant interest a witness\n\nhas in reviewing a transcript of his or her grand jury testimony.\n\nAs the D.C. Circuit recognized, even witnesses who intend to\n\ntestify truthfully have an interest in avoiding inaccuracies and\n\ninconsistencies that may subject them to a potential perjury\n\nprosecution.      See Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 988 (noting that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1623(a) provides for \"inconsistent statements as [a] basis\n\nfor a perjury conviction\").        The interest in avoiding inaccuracies\n\nand inconsistencies increases significantly when a grand jury\n\nwitness has to testify over multiple days, and thus has to prepare\n\nfor upcoming testimony.     Id.\n\n           Moreover,     federal     law    \"strongly     reinforces\"     that\n\ninterest. Id.      A grand jury witness has a statutory right to\n\nrecant, one that would be difficult to exercise without a review of\n\nthe transcript.    See 18 U.S.C. § 1623(d); see also Grand Jury, 490\n\nF.3d at 988 (\"A witness would have difficulty taking full advantage\n\nof the statutory recantation provision . . . without obtaining\n\nprompt   access   to   transcripts    of    their   own   testimony.\").    In\n\naddition, the federal rules contemplate the disclosure of grand\n\njury transcripts.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i) (\"The court\n\nmay authorize disclosure . . . of a grand jury matter . . .\n\npreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding\").\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fFinally, the government is subject to a higher burden of proof to\n\nestablish perjury, which lessens the risk of perjury prosecution\n\nand, therefore, allows witnesses to be less evasive and more\n\nforthcoming in answering questions.4\n\n           We   also   stress    that    the   interest    a   witness   has   in\n\nmaintaining the accuracy of his or her testimony is not just\n\npersonal to the witness.        It is systemic, as both the courts and\n\nthe government have a substantial interest in ensuring the accuracy\n\nof grand jury testimony.\n\n           With the witness's interests in mind, we consider the\n\ninterests of the government, particularly how those interests are\n\naffected in the access context as compared to the copy context.                As\n\nthe D.C. Circuit points out, there are significant differences\n\nbetween   the   access   and    copy    context   with    respect   to   witness\n\nintimidation.    Specifically, \"if a witness could routinely obtain\n\na copy of the grand jury transcript . . . an interested party could\n\nin turn pressure the witness to obtain the transcript and to give\n\nit to that third party.\"        Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 989.        Likewise a\n\n\"witness's fear of being forced to disclose the transcript to a\n\nthreatening third party could deter witnesses from testifying\n\n\n4\n The dissent only views these protections as \"abundant . . . for\nall grand jury witnesses,\" and thus concludes that we \"vastly\noverstate[] a witness's interest in access to prior grand jury\ntestimony.\"    (Dissent at 32-33).       Instead, we view these\nprotections as a recognition of the significant interest a witness\nhas in maintaining the accuracy of his testimony, such that we do\nnot overstate it, but simply take it into account.\n\n                                       -15-\n\ffreely and candidly in the first place.\"                Id.     Both of these\n\nconcerns     are    alleviated    significantly     when      only    access   is\n\npermitted.       Unlike in the copy context, a witness granted only\n\naccess could, in the face of intimidation, simply decline to reveal\n\nhis testimony.       See id. at 990 (noting that, in general, a grand\n\njury witness could decline to discuss his or her testimony, and\n\nthat this option \"is not realistically affected by whether the\n\nwitness    can     review   the   transcript   at   a   secure       location\").5\n\nMoreover, because of this option, the witness will feel less\n\ninclined to withhold truthful testimony.\n\n            Although the D.C. Circuit did not address it, the access\n\ncontext also differs from the copy context with respect to grand\n\njury secrecy.       As both the D.C. Circuit and the district court in\n\nthis case point out, a grand jury witness is under no obligation to\n\nmaintain the secrecy of his or her testimony.           To use the colorful\n\n\n\n5\n The D.C. Circuit, in fact, found this difference so significant\nthat it expressly reserved the issue of whether \"the possibility of\nwitness intimidation would justify denying copies of transcripts.\"\nId. at 989-90.\n\n    The dissent contends that our conclusion is \"naive,\" because\n\"[t]he same people who would cajole a witness to obtain a copy of\nhis testimony and reveal it would be able to use similar methods to\ncoerce the witness into reviewing his testimony and reporting its\ncontents.\" (Dissent at 30). However, the dissent does not fully\ntake into account the evasive measures a witness can undertake if\nhe only obtains access. After all, a witness, even after review,\ncould be less than forthcoming about his testimony, and a third\nparty would never know to cajole further. If the witness obtains\na copy, however, no amount of evasion can hide his testimony,\nprinted in black and white, from a determined third party.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fexample of the district court, a grand jury witness has the right\n\nto \"put up that information on a billboard on the Mass. Pike.\"\n\nThus, any concern with maintaining grand jury secrecy is already\n\ndiminished in the grand jury witness context.6 However, permitting\n\naccess does not exacerbate the situation in the way making a copy\n\navailable does.   Unlike access, a copy can take on a life of its\n\nown, and, despite the efforts of a well-intentioned grand jury\n\nwitness, a copy can float around and land in the wrong hands.\n\nAccordingly, the access context better maintains grand jury secrecy\n\nvis-a-vis the copy context.\n\n           Finally, although we have not had the occasion to address\n\nthe issue, our decision in Special Proceedings lends some support\n\nto the distinction we make between granting access and granting a\n\ncopy.   There, we found that a deponent in a special investigation\n\nfailed to articulate, let alone show, a particularized need for a\n\ncopy of his deposition transcript, in part because \"the district\n\ncourt took steps to accommodate any need [the witness] might have\n\nfor the transcript by offering [the witness] and his counsel access\n\nto the deposition testimony as long as they agreed to keep the\n\n\n\n6\n In fact, our precedent has failed to acknowledge the fact that a\ngrand jury witness is not under any obligation to maintain grand\njury secrecy. Some courts, most notably the D.C. Circuit, have\nviewed this fact as cutting in favor of witness access.      Other\ncourts have not. See, e.g., Bast v. United States, 542 F.2d 893,\n896 (4th Cir. 1976) (requiring a showing of particularized need,\nbut \"recogniz[ing] that Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 imposes no condition of\nsecrecy on the witness.\").\n\n                                -17-\n\ftranscript confidential.\"      373 F.3d at 47.            Not only did we cite\n\nthe option of access with approval, but we also indicated that a\n\ngreater showing of need was required to move from the access\n\ncontext to the copy context.\n\n            We   also   recognize   one    other       important   interest   not\n\ndiscussed by the D.C. Circuit but cited by the district court\n\nbelow,   efficiency.         Articulating          a     lesser    standard   of\n\nparticularized need with respect to access may increase the burdens\n\non the government in grand jury proceedings.                 However, we agree\n\nwith the district court that \"the benefit to the witness greatly\n\noutweighs the burden to the government.\"                  As the D.C. Circuit\n\nnoted, \"the Federal Rules . . . mandate that grand jury proceedings\n\nbe transcribed or taped,\" with such records being kept by the\n\ngovernment.      Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 986 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n6(e)(1)).   Thus, the cost of providing a transcript, which must be\n\ncreated anyway, and the slight delay caused by the review of the\n\ntranscript would not impede an investigation significantly.                   In\n\nfact, there is no evidence that the D.C. Circuit's more lenient\n\nrule has had any detrimental affect on grand jury investigations in\n\nthat circuit.\n\n            We conclude by noting that our \"less demanding\" standard\n\nof particularized need does not apply to appellant's request to\n\ntake notes.       Permitting notetaking blurs the line between the\n\naccess and copy contexts, since one can imagine an appellant\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ftranscribing his transcript and, in effect, creating a copy. Thus,\n\nour requirement of a strong showing of particularized need applies\n\nequally to the notetaking context.7\n\n            For all of the above reasons, we find that the district\n\ncourt committed error in applying our precedent, which has solely\n\ninvolved requests for copies, to the appellant's request for access\n\nto a transcript of his grand jury testimony.\n\n            B.   Showing of Particularized Need\n\n            Because the district court did not make any factual\n\nfindings, but assumed as true the contentions in support of the\n\nappellant's request for access, we address whether appellant has\n\nmade   a   showing   of   particularized   need   in   light   of   the   less\n\ndemanding standard we articulated above.8\n\n\n7\n Permitting the appellant's counsel to be present during the\nreview, which the appellant also requests, is a closer call. Thus,\nfollowing the D.C. Circuit, we leave it up to the \"sound\ndiscretion\" of the district court on remand to determine whether\nappellant's counsel can be present. See Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at\n990.\n8\n Because we hold that our former standard of \"a strong showing of\nparticularized need\" still applies to the appellant's request to\ntake notes, we still must review the district court's finding of no\nparticularized need.      In our view, there was no abuse of\ndiscretion.     The district court, assuming the appellant's\ncontentions as true, ultimately determined that the appellant's\ncircumstances, which included the prosecutors' perjury warnings and\nthe   complexity   of  his   testimony,   were   not   sufficiently\nparticularized to meet our standard. Given that we have not found\na sufficiently particularized need where only an \"ill-defined\"\npotential for perjury prosecution exists, see, e.g., Bianchi, 542\nF.2d at 100, we do not see how the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying notetaking.\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f            The   appellant    argues   that    his     need      for    access   is\n\nsufficiently particularized to justify access for two reasons: (1)\n\nthe threats of perjury prosecution given by the prosecutors during\n\nhis examination, and (2) the complexity of the subject matter of\n\nhis testimony, which involved \"ancient activity.\"                 We agree.\n\n            The appellant contends that his need was particularized\n\nbecause he was \"threatened by . . . powerful authorities with life-\n\nwrecking perjury convictions and years of imprisonment.\"                    Our own\n\nreview of the grand jury transcript supports his claim.                     In some\n\ninstances the prosecutors made pointed comments to the appellant,\n\nasking in places if he \"ha[d] a hearing problem\" or whether he\n\n\"speak[s] the English language.\"\n\n            Under our case law in the copy context, we have held that\n\npotential    perjury   prosecution      alone        does   not     arise    to   a\n\nparticularized    need.       In   Bottari,    for    example,      we    found   no\n\nparticularized need due to potential perjury prosecution because\n\nthat potential alone made \"th[e] appellant . . . no different from\n\nany other witness who testifies before a grand jury, or elsewhere.\"\n\n453 F.2d at 371.     Likewise in Bianchi, where the witness also had\n\nuse immunity under 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002 and 6003, we found no\n\n\n   Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in not\nmaking the transcript a part of the record, as the appellant\nclaims.   In examining whether the appellant provided a strong\nshowing of particularized need, the district court assumed as true\nthe appellant's contentions in support of why his need was\nparticularized.   Thus, the appellant would have received little\nbenefit from having the district court review the transcript.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fparticularized need where the witness's \"ill-defined fear\" of a\n\n\"'slight inconsistency' between past and present testimony [that]\n\nmight subject him to perjury prosecution [wa]s unfounded.\"                  542\n\nF.2d at 100.\n\n            In this context, however, it is a close call whether the\n\nstrongly worded, even abusive warnings of the prosecutors alone\n\nsuffice to demonstrate a particularized need under our lesser\n\nstandard for access.       Some circuits have permitted access based\n\nupon such conduct, although they did so on other grounds.                   See,\n\ne.g., Bursey v. United States, 466 F.2d 1059, 1080 (9th Cir. 1972)\n\n(holding that \"the concepts of fundamental fairness inherent in due\n\nprocess require that a grand jury witness be given some protection\n\nfrom the[] risks [of perjury] before he is compelled to answer\n\nrepetitious questions\").         However, we do not need to address the\n\nissue, because the threats of perjury prosecution, combined with\n\nthe    complexity     of   the    appellant's      testimony,     sufficiently\n\nestablishes a particularized need. As the witness attested to, and\n\nas the grand jury transcript and exhibits bear out, the subject\n\nmatter of his testimony was significantly complex, involving not\n\nonly   complex   technical       material,   but   also    events   and    dates\n\noccurring    nearly    a   decade    ago.       Thus,     any   concerns    with\n\ninconsistencies in his testimony (concerns which were repeatedly\n\ninflamed by the prosecutors) were magnified by the potential traps\n\nposed by the highly technical and ancient nature of his testimony.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fAccordingly, the threats of perjury prosecution, combined with the\n\ncomplexity of the witness's testimony, supplies the necessary\n\nparticularized need to permit access.\n\n           We conclude by discussing our application of this lesser\n\ndemand for \"particularized need\" going forward.             In this case we\n\nhave found such a need satisfied given the abusive warnings of the\n\nprosecutors during testimony and the complexity of the appellant's\n\ntestimony. We emphasize that, based upon our review of the record,\n\nthe   warnings    were   not   only   strongly    worded,   but    were   also\n\nbuttressed   by    repetitious    questions      and   insulting   language.\n\nMoreover, the subject matter of the testimony concerned complex,\n\nnearly decade-old technical material that was integral to the\n\nexamination.9\n\n\n9\n The dissent disagrees, and contends that our rule \"is likely\nsatisfied in many -- if not most -- grand jury investigations.\"\n(Dissent at 34). The dissent misstates the basis of our finding\nfor a particularized need.    Prosecutor's warnings combined with\ntestimony only \"involv[ing] complex subjects that occurred some\ntime in the past\" are not sufficient to establish a particularized\nneed under our lower standard, as the dissent suggests. (See id.\nat 35). Something more is required, and we articulated above what\nthat more was in this case.\n\n  Moreover, we disagree with the dissent's characterization of the\nwarnings made during the examination.    The dissent quotes four\nwarnings during the examination to show that they were innocuous,\nignoring other warnings as \"infrequent[] and inconsequential[].\"\n(Dissent at 39-41). It is the third quoted warning on which we\ndisagree.   The dissent seeks to explain that the warning is\njustifiably strongly worded because the appellant was being\n\"evasive.\"   (Id. at 40).     However, we read the exchange as\nsupporting our view that the examination was highly technical, as\nthe government immediately stated after giving the warning that\n\"Okay. So stop playing games with us. This jury is composed of a\n\n                                      -22-\n\f          We are also cognizant of the effect the application of\n\nour rule will have on grand jury proceedings, since we do not want\n\nto \"saddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings\n\n[that] would assuredly impede its investigation.\" United States v.\n\nDionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 17 (1973).   However, the lesser standard of\n\nparticularized need we apply here would not impose undue hardship\n\non grand jury investigations.   A district court in its discretion\n\ncan utilize procedures, such as the expedited hearing the district\n\ncourt conducted in this case, to minimize any undue effect on the\n\ngrand jury investigation.   Moreover, although we had the advantage\n\nof reviewing the transcript in this case, nothing we say here\n\nrequires the government to submit one in response to a motion for\n\naccess.   To the extent that the transcript is not available, a\n\ngrand jury witness can testify (or make a proffer) in camera as to\n\nhis or her examination to support his or her claim, with the\n\ngovernment having an opportunity to rebut.10 Finally, to the extent\n\n\ngroup of laymen. . . . so talk to us like we're regular people and\nstop playing word games with us.\" Moreover, the dissent dismisses\nthe other warnings given during this exchange, such as \"Now I'm\ntelling you to answer the questions straightforwardly and\ntruthfully,\" followed shortly thereafter by \"Okay. Can you answer\nthe question straightforwardly?,\" and still later by \"Again, answer\nthe question that's asked of you. Answer is directly. Answer it\ntruthfully. All right?\" and, after a five minute break, \"I remind\nyou that you're still under oath.\" From here, the government's\nwarnings took an abusive turn: \"Please, again, do you have a\nhearing problem?\" and \"And you speak the English language, that's\nyour first language, right?\"\n10\n Thus, we disagree with the dissent that under our rule \"a district\ncourt will abuse its discretion if it fails to review the\n\n                                -23-\n\fthat   a   grand    jury    witness    games   the    system   to   establish   a\n\nparticularized need, a district court can take evidence of that\n\ninto account.        A witness cannot establish a need, let alone a\n\nparticularized one, if the purported need was self-induced.11\n\n                                III.   Conclusion\n\n            For    the     foregoing   reasons,      we   reverse   the   district\n\ncourt's finding of contempt, and, on remand, direct the district\n\ncourt to permit the appellant access to a transcript of his grand\n\njury testimony consistent with this opinion.\n\n            Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                         \"Dissenting opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\ntranscript.\"       (Dissent at 36 n.23).\n11\n The dissent claims that we \"too quickly dismisses the witness's\nobstreperous conduct.\" (Dissent at 41 n.28). Our own review of\nthe transcript does not suggest to us that the appellant was being\nobstreperous during the examination given the highly technical\nnature of the questions asked.       Moreover, the appellant has\nproceeded in good faith throughout the course of these proceedings.\nAs the district court found in staying its contempt order pending\nappeal, the appellant's claims were \"not frivolous\" and that the\nappellant was not \"being contumacious in the way [of an] ordinary\ngrand jury witness, who simply refuses to testify without good\nreason.\"\n\n                                       -24-\n\f               HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.        Neither the Federal\n\nRules     of     Criminal   Procedure        nor   Supreme   Court   precedent\n\nspecifically address the circumstances in which a non-defendant\n\ngrand jury witness may access his testimony, regardless of the\n\nformat of such access. The panel majority adopts an approach based\n\non the reasoning and rationale of a recent D.C. Circuit opinion,\n\nwhich permits relatively unfettered access even for non-defendant\n\nwitnesses.        Were we writing on a blank slate, I believe this\n\napproach would be problematic.          But we are not writing on a blank\n\nslate; an unbroken line of our cases going back over thirty years\n\nforecloses the majority's result.              Thus, because the majority's\n\nconclusion is contrary to our precedent, unwise as a matter of\n\npolicy, and insupportable on this record, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                        I.\n\n               Since at least 1972, we have made clear that grand jury\n\nwitnesses have no general right of access to transcripts of their\n\nprior grand jury testimony.       See In Re Bottari, 453 F.2d 370 (1st\n\nCir.    1972).    We have since elaborated on this rule, making just as\n\nclear that fear of future perjury prosecution cannot constitute a\n\ncognizable reason for a witness to have access to a transcript of\n\nhis testimony.      See In Re Bianchi, 542 F.2d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 1976)\n\n(citing United States v. Chevoor, 526 F.2d 178, 181 (1st Cir.\n\n1975)).        We later confirmed our adherence to the majority rule\n\namong the circuits that a \"non-defendant witness seeking access to\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fhis own [grand jury] transcript must make a 'strong showing of\n\nparticularized    need'     for   such   disclosure.\"12      In   Re    Special\n\nProceedings, 373 F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting In Re Grand\n\nJury Subpoena, 72 F.3d 271, 274 (2d Cir. 1995)) (emphases added).\n\n           It is true that during the course of In Re Special\n\nProceedings, we noted that the district court afforded the witness\n\nseeking access to his testimony the opportunity to review it, so\n\nlong as the witness kept the information confidential.                 Id.   But\n\nthat comment was made in the context of explaining why the witness\n\nfailed to make the requisite \"strong showing of particularized\n\nneed.\"    The majority attempts to treat this summary comment as\n\nlending   \"some   support    to   the    distinction\"   it   draws     \"between\n\ngranting access and granting a copy.\"           Maj. Op. at 17; see also\n\nMaj. Op. at 12-13 n.3.       But this short aside did not (and indeed\n\ncould not) change the ratio decidendi of our decision in In Re\n\nSpecial Proceedings, which requires that even a non-defendant\n\nwitness make a \"strong showing of particularized need\" for \"access\"\n\nto his own grand jury testimony.\n\n\n12\n The panel majority attempts to avoid the full scope of this\nholding by highlighting the fact that In Re Special Proceedings\narticulated this result as the holding of \"a majority of circuits,\"\nand that our rule is \"similar.\" Maj. Op. at 12-13 n.3 (quoting In\nRe Special Proceedings, 373 F.3d at 47). But the majority neglects\nthe next sentence of In Re Special Proceedings, which makes clear\nthat we too subscribe to the rule in the majority of circuits: \"[a]\nfew circuits take a contrary view . . . but are at odds with\nBianchi.\"   373 F.3d at 47.    It is therefore clear that a fair\nreading of In Re Special Proceedings cannot limit its reach merely\nto copies.\n\n                                    -26-\n\f            Where, as here, the language of a prior panel decision is\n\nperhaps broader than the precise controversy at issue in that prior\n\ndecision, we still give effect to the language of the prior panel\n\ndecision.     Awuah v. Coverall, N. Am., Inc., 554 F.3d 7, 11 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).    Absent contravening authority from this court sitting\n\nen banc or the Supreme Court, we must continue to honor the In Re\n\nSpecial Proceedings doctrine.          Id.; United States v. Holloway, 499\n\nF.3d 114, 118 (1st Cir. 2007).13\n\n            Thus,   our   case   law    does   not   permit   the   majority's\n\nconclusion that a less demanding standard of particularized need is\n\nappropriate where a witness seeks access to his prior grand jury\n\ntestimony.    The majority attempts to elide decades of case law by\n\ndrawing a distinction between access to prior testimony and the\n\navailability of copies of prior testimony.             But, for the reasons\n\n\n\n\n13\n The majority's second attempt to reconcile its holding with our\nprecedent is equally unavailing. As explained in note 1, the ratio\ndecidendi of In Re Special Proceedings extends to access and does\nnot end with the provision of copies. Consequently, both Awuah and\nHolloway require that the panel use the \"strong showing of\nparticularized need\" standard for access as well as copies.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fdescribed above, unlike in the D.C. Circuit,14 our precedent does\n\nnot countenance such a distinction.15\n\n                               II.\n\n          Even if it were permissible for us to sweep away our\n\nprecedent and to create an entirely new rule regarding a non-\n\ndefendant witness's right to access his grand jury testimony, the\n\nmajority's chosen rule permitting access based on a \"less demanding\n\nrequirement of particularized need\" is unwise.   First, in creating\n\nthis less demanding standard, the majority fails to give due weight\n\nto important interests of grand jury secrecy and preventing witness\n\nintimidation, while at the same time, the majority overemphasizes\n\na witness's interest in access to his testimony.       Second, the\n\nmajority's preferred approach will improvidently hamstring the\n\noperation of grand juries.\n\n\n\n14\n The D.C. Circuit case, In Re Grand Jury, 490 F.3d 978 (D.C. Cir.\n2007), is factually distinguishable from the case at bar, and the\nmajority has significantly expanded this precedent in order for its\nrule to encompass cases such as the appellant's. Unlike in In Re\nGrand Jury, where witnesses without immunity testified as many as\nthree times, with months between such testimony, the appellant in\nthis case had immunity. See id. at 980. Moreover, the appellant's\ntestimony was originally continued for one week, and was later\ncontinued for another two weeks to accommodate appellant's counsel.\nAll other delays in this case have resulted from the appellant's\nprotracted efforts to gain access to his prior testimony.\n15\n Our circuit's view of the law finds significant support in the\n\"majority of appellate decisions dealing with this issue.\" In Re\nGrand Jury Subpoena, 72 F.3d at 274-75 (citing Davis v. United\nStates, 641 A.2d 484, 490-91 (D.C. App. 1994); Bast v. United\nStates, 542 F.2d 893, 895-96 (4th Cir. 1976); In Re Bianchi, 542\nF.2d 98; In Re Bottari, 450 F.2d 370).\n\n                               -28-\n\f                                  A.\n\n                                  1.\n\n          The majority has identified three interests militating\n\nagainst witness access to grand jury testimony,16 but has not given\n\nfull weight to those interests.   The majority dismisses the notion\n\nthat grand jury secrecy is an important interest in this context\n\nbecause grand jury witnesses have no obligation to keep their\n\ntestimony secret.   Although the majority is correct that a witness\n\nis under no obligation to keep his testimony secret, Maj. Op. at 10\n\n(citing In Re Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 988-89), it does not follow\n\nthat permitting a witness access to his own testimony \"does not\n\nexacerbate\" the threat to grand jury secrecy.      Maj. Op. at 17\n\n(emphasis in original).   On the contrary, a witness -- even if he\n\nis denied the ability to review his testimony with counsel -- will\n\nnow have an additional opportunity to think about his testimony and\n\npotentially disclose it.17   Moreover, we can expect that a witness\n\n\n16\n Because of the profound threat the majority's proposed rule poses\nto the efficiency of grand juries, I discuss this interest in Part\nII.B, infra.\n17\n The majority leaves open the question of whether the appellant is\nentitled to have his counsel review the transcript. Maj. Op. at 19\nn.7.   It suffices here to note the district court's ruling on\nremand from the D.C. Circuit, in which the court held that \"the\nexpertise of legal counsel is not necessary for the [witness] to\nassess whether the transcripts reflect inconsistencies or\nfalsehoods that place [the witness] at risk for a perjury\nprosecution or warrant recantation . . . .\" In Re Grand Jury\nProceeding, 520 F. Supp. 2d 61, 64 (D.D.C. 2007). Moreover, as the\ndistrict court further noted, since attorneys are not permitted in\nthe grand jury room when a witness testifies, it would be anomalous\n\n                                -29-\n\fwill be likely to remember a significantly greater portion of his\n\ntestimony during a private review than while undergoing questioning\n\nbefore the grand jury, making any subsequent disclosure more\n\nproblematic from the standpoint of the important interest in\n\nsecrecy.    Thus, as a practical matter, the majority's rule will\n\nhave an adverse impact on grand jury secrecy.\n\n           Similarly, witness intimidation will almost certainly\n\nincrease under this new standard.          The majority asserts that \"a\n\nwitness granted only access could, in the face of intimidation,\n\nsimply decline to reveal his testimony.\"       Maj. Op. at 16 (citing In\n\nRe Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 990).        Respectfully, this assertion is\n\nnaive.   The same people who would cajole a witness to obtain a copy\n\nof his testimony and reveal it would be able to use similar methods\n\nto coerce the witness into reviewing his testimony and reporting\n\nits contents.      The majority's claim that a witness can undertake\n\n\"evasive measures\" to avoid commenting on a recollection refreshed\n\nby   a   lengthy    review   of   the   witness's   prior   testimony   is\n\nunpersuasive.      See Maj. Op. at 16 n.5.    As the majority correctly\n\nnotes, such evasive measures are unlikely to succeed with respect\n\nto the existence of a transcript copy; these measures are similarly\n\nlikely to fail when determined individuals demand a witness divulge\n\nthe contents of his testimony. Given that most witnesses will have\n\n\n\nto permit an attorney to be present during a review of                  the\ntranscript. Id. at 64 n.4.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fbetter recollections of their testimony after the opportunity to\n\nreview it in private, a fact that will not elude those seeking\n\nadditional         information,     the     rule   we    are     now    adopting     will\n\nexacerbate the threat of witness intimidation.\n\n                                            2.\n\n              By     contrast,     again     relying     on     the    D.C.    Circuit's\n\napproach, the majority overemphasizes a witness's interest in\n\naccess to his grand jury testimony.                     The guiding light in the\n\nmajority's balancing is a witness's supposed need to ensure that\n\npast testimony is accurate, presumably to innoculate him from\n\ncriminal charges of providing false declarations to the grand jury,\n\nwith secondary consideration for a witness's need to prepare for\n\nfuture testimony where such testimony is spread over several days.\n\nMaj. Op. at 14 (citing In Re Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 988); see also\n\n18   U.S.C.    §     1623.18     Though     well-intentioned,          the    majority's\n\nsolicitude for witnesses in this regard is misplaced; although the\n\nmajority      claims      that   \"even     witnesses      who    intend       to   testify\n\ntruthfully         have    an    interest     in   avoiding       inaccuracies         and\n\ninconsistencies           that   may   subject     them    to     potential        perjury\n\nprosecution,\" Maj. Op. at 14, federal law already provides ample\n\n\n\n\n18\n The most obvious and greatest antidote to this concern, of course,\nis that the witness \"should testify truthfully in the first\ninstance.\" In Re Grand Jury Proceedings, 520 F. Supp. 2d at 64.\n\n                                           -31-\n\fprotection to such witnesses, which should serve to obviate the\n\nmajority's concern over the plight of these witnesses.19\n\n               The law already provides abundant protections for all\n\ngrand jury witnesses.        Testimony is punishable only when the\n\ngovernment proves beyond a reasonable doubt that it is false, made\n\nknowingly, and is material to the work of the grand jury.                   18\n\nU.S.C. § 1623(a); United States v. Silveira, 426 F.3d 514, 518-19\n\n(1st    Cir.    2005).    Similarly,   the     relevant     statute   provides\n\nsignificant protection to those charged with making inconsistent\n\nstatements.      Such statements are actionable only if the government\n\nproves beyond a reasonable doubt that they were made (1) knowingly\n\nand (2) they are inconsistent to the degree that one of them is\n\nnecessarily false.       18 U.S.C. § 1623(c).         Even then, it is an\n\naffirmative defense that the defendant \"at the time he made each\n\ndeclaration believed the declaration was true.\"             Id.   Furthermore,\n\nin certain circumstances, witnesses have the right to recant any\n\nfalse    declarations.      18   U.S.C.    §   1623(d).20    As   courts   have\n\n\n19\n In addition, as a further argument for disclosure, the majority\ncorrectly notes that in certain circumstances, the Federal Rules of\nCriminal   Procedure   contemplate   disclosure   of   grand   jury\ntranscripts.     Maj. Op. at 14 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P.\n6(e)(3)(E)(i)). But the majority neglects to acknowledge that such\ndisclosure is only permitted on a strong showing of particularized\nneed, see Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 221\n(1979), which the majority concedes is not met in this case. Maj.\nOp. at 19 n.8.    Thus, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nprovide no reason to tip the balance in favor of access.\n20\n The majority's conclusion that it \"would be difficult to exercise\n[the statutory right to recant] without a review of the transcript\"\n\n                                    -32-\n\frecognized, these are copious protections for those who fear\n\nprosecution for failing to provide less than perfectly accurate\n\ntestimony to the grand jury.           See In Re Grand Jury Proceedings, 520\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 64 (citing Doe v. United States, 72 F.3d 271 (2d\n\nCir. 1995)).\n\n            The majority acknowledges the robust protections against\n\nunwarranted perjury charges afforded grand jury witnesses, see Maj.\n\nOp. at 14-15, but nevertheless (erroneously in my view) concludes\n\nthat \"federal law strongly reinforces\" a witness's interest in\n\naccess.     Maj.    Op.    at   14    (internal    quotation     marks    omitted).\n\nRather,   the   substantial          protections   available     to   grand      jury\n\nwitnesses   militate      in    favor    of   affording   less    weight    to    the\n\nwitness's interest in obtaining access to grand jury testimony.\n\nConsequently,      the    majority      has   vastly   overstated     a   witness's\n\ninterest in access to prior grand jury testimony, and as a result,\n\n\n\ndoes not follow.    Maj. Op. at 14.    As explained above, because\nother provisions of federal law provide witnesses with significant\nprotections, recantation is not needed to resolve minor\ninconsistencies or slight errors. A witness will have a better\nmemory of the major points of his testimony, and after testifying,\nin consultation with counsel, he will be able to exercise his right\nto recant without a detailed review of the record of his testimony.\nAlthough we require a witness attempting to recant admit that his\ntestimony is false, we have never required any greater level of\ndetail in order to permit recantation.      E.g., United States v.\nScivola, 766 F.2d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 1985); United States v. Goguen,\n723 F.2d 1012, 1018 (1st Cir. 1983).      The majority's continued\ninsistence on transcript access for this purpose exalts recantation\nabove these other protections available to grand jury witnesses,\nand   unnecessarily   burdens   the   efficiency   of  grand   jury\ninvestigations.\n\n                                         -33-\n\fhas created a new rule that will needlessly and unduly interfere\n\nwith the efficient operation of grand juries, contrary to the\n\nteachings of the Supreme Court.\n\n                                           B.\n\n            It is axiomatic that grand juries are integral to the\n\n\"fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.\" United\n\nStates v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 17 (1973) (citations omitted).\n\nTheir   role     is    to    investigate        potential   criminal      violations\n\n\"independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge,\" and they\n\nare therefore imbued with \"necessarily broad\" investigative powers.\n\nSee id. at 13, 17 (citing Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 688\n\n(1972)). The Supreme Court has therefore long held that grand jury\n\nproceedings should be free of procedural delays and that \"[a]ny\n\nholding   that       would   saddle   a    grand    jury    with    minitrials   and\n\npreliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and\n\nfrustrate      the     public's    interest        in   fair       and   expeditious\n\nadministration of the criminal laws.\"               Id. at 17; see also United\n\nStates v. R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 292, 300-01 (1991); United\n\nStates v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 350 (1974); Stern v. United\n\nStates Dist. Court, 214 F.3d 4, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The majority's approach of permitting witnesses to access\n\ntheir testimony based on a lesser standard of particularized need\n\nthat is likely satisfied in many -- if not most -- grand jury\n\ninvestigations threatens to unleash precisely the mischief that the\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\fSupreme Court has warned against.     The majority believes that the\n\ncombination of a prosecutor's use of perjury warnings during\n\nquestioning of a witness and the fact that a witness's testimony\n\ninvolves complex subjects that occurred some time in the past is\n\nsufficient to meet its lower threshold of particularized need.\n\nMaj. Op. at 20, 22.       But all grand jury investigations are\n\nnecessarily retrospective, and they frequently focus on complex\n\nmatters.21   Moreover, through evasive and unresponsive testimony,\n\nany witness could elicit perjury warnings from those questioning\n\nhim.22   Thus, under the majority's standard, any witness who\n\n\n21\n The majority claims \"something more\" is required to meet its\ndiminished standard, Maj. Op. at 22 n.9, but its opinion refers\nonly to perjury warnings, which are appropriate, necessary, and\nencouraged in our case law, see infra note 22, the fact that the\nsubject matter involved technical material, and that some events\noccurred less than ten years in the past. But these are common\ncircumstances and it is likely that many –- if not most –- grand\njury investigations will be encompassed in the ambit of the\nmajority's new rule.\n22\n The majority's decision to consider perjury warnings in\ndetermining whether a witness has satisfied a less demanding\nstandard will inevitably chill prosecutors' proper use of perjury\nwarnings, which is a disservice to prosecutors, witnesses, and the\ngrand jury's quest for the truth. The record in this case reveals\nthat the prosecutors' perjury warnings were limited and\nappropriate. See infra pp. 39-41.\n     These warnings are particularly appropriate in light of our\nprevious expressions of strong displeasure with prosecutors in this\ncircuit who attempt to skirt warnings to grand jury witnesses.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Pancheco-Ortiz, 889 F.2d 301 (1st Cir.\n1989); United States v. Babb, 807 F.3d 272 (1st Cir. 1986). In\ndrawing an adverse inference from four reasonable and appropriate\nperjury warnings, we are acting at cross-purposes with our firm\nguidance regarding warnings in grand juries, and unnecessarily\nburdening prosecutors who legitimately offer appropriate perjury\nwarnings.\n\n                               -35-\n\freceived a perjury warning and testified over several days in a\n\ncomplex case about events occurring in the past, can advance at\n\nleast a strong claim for access to his prior testimony, thereby\n\ncreating precisely the kind of procedural delay the Supreme Court\n\nhas warned against.\n\n          The prosecutors responsible for coordinating the grand\n\njury investigation will now have to defend these claims, which the\n\ndistrict courts will need to adjudicate.23   Handling these tasks\n\nwill inevitably distract prosecutors and judges while delaying and\n\nsometimes even derailing important grand jury investigations. This\n\nproblem is only compounded by the fact that our lenient new test\n\nwill give witnesses every incentive to engage in obstreperous\n\n\n\n23\n The majority claims that its opinion does not require a district\ncourt to review the transcript of grand jury proceedings in all\ncases, Maj. Op. at 23 & n.10, but, under the logic of the\nmajority's analysis, the district court necessarily must review the\ntranscript to determine whether the witness can satisfy the \"less\ndemanding requirement of particularized need.\"      Without such a\nreview, it is difficult to imagine how a district court can\ndetermine whether perjury warnings were sufficiently numerous and\nabusive or a witness's testimony sufficiently complex to justify\nrelief.\n    The majority claims that other procedures, such as witness\ntestimony or proffers and government rebuttal, might allow the\ndistrict court to determine whether a witness has satisfied the\nmajority's lower standard. Maj. Op. at 23. But the district court\nwill be unable to accept as true a witness's statements in this\nposture, see Maj. Op. at 19-20 n.8, and as this case demonstrates,\nwitnesses and prosecutors will disagree sharply over what\ntranspired before the grand jury. Consequently, as a practical\nmatter, a district court will abuse its discretion if it fails to\nreview the transcript of a witness's grand jury testimony to\ndetermine whether the less demanding requirement of particularized\nneed has been satisfied.\n\n                               -36-\n\fconduct in an effort to cause their testimony to continue over to\n\na second day in the hope of gaining access to a transcript.24\n\n            This case is proof that all but the most stringent\n\nstandards of witness access will create slippage that threatens to\n\nundermine   the   orderly       operation       of   grand   juries.      As   these\n\nproceedings demonstrate, witnesses, advocates, and even judges can\n\nand   do    disagree         regarding     a     witness's       evasiveness     and\n\nobstreperousness,       as    well   as    the       propriety   of    prosecutors'\n\nquestioning.      Because such disagreements have the potential to\n\nstymie the efficient operation of grand juries and the interests of\n\nwitnesses are protected under other provisions of federal law, the\n\nSupreme Court and our own precedents require that grand juries be\n\npermitted to pursue their work without the threat of these types of\n\nproceedings.\n\n            Moreover,     the    break     in    the     appellant's    testimony,\n\noccasioned by the need to hear another witness, would have been\n\nabout one week in length had the appellant not delayed it further\n\nfirst to accommodate his counsel, and then again, to wage this\n\n\n\n24\n The majority suggests that \"[a] witness cannot establish a need,\nlet alone a particularized one, if the purported need was self-\ninduced.\" Maj. Op. at 24. The problem, of course, is that the\nneed in this case was self-induced.      The witness responded to\nstraightforward questions with evasive and sometimes misleading\nresponses, which the majority fails to acknowledge. See infra note\n27.   It was these responses to questions (and the prosecutors'\nsensible attempts to follow-up) rather than any particularly\ntechnical details of the testimony that occasioned the witness's\nunease in this case.\n\n                                         -37-\n\fprotracted     battle      over    access.      Indeed,    a    transcript   of   the\n\nappellant's testimony was not available until approximately one\n\nmonth after his initial testimony.              The majority claims that such\n\na one month delay is \"slight\" and will not \"impede an investigation\n\nsignificantly,\" Maj. Op. at 18, but I simply cannot agree.                    Grand\n\njuries are normally limited to eighteen month terms, Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP.    6(g),    and   a     delay    of   one    month     is    hardly   slight    or\n\ninsignificant.       Moreover, the majority's ruling leaves open the\n\nstrong likelihood that there will be multiple witnesses appearing\n\nbefore a single grand jury who may be able to assert a right to\n\nreview grand jury transcripts, which will further degrade a grand\n\njury's ability to execute its functions in an expeditious manner.25\n\nThus, as this case also demonstrates, the majority's rule has\n\nsignificant potential needlessly to saddle grand jury proceedings\n\nwith delay and unnecessarily encrust them with precisely the sorts\n\nof procedural requirements that the Supreme Court has warned\n\nagainst.\n\n                                         III.\n\n              The facts of this case only confirm the adverse effect\n\nthe   majority's     new    standard     will    have   on     the   efficiency   and\n\n\n25\n I can take no comfort in the majority's observation that \"there\nis no evidence that the D.C. Circuit's more lenient rule has had\nany detrimental [e]ffect on grand jury investigations in that\ncircuit,\" Maj. Op. at 18, because no such evidence was offered by\neither party or requested by this court, and in view of the secrecy\nthat properly shrouds grand jury proceedings, such evidence should\nnot be readily discernible.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fexpeditiousness of the grand jury process.          The majority claims\n\nthat threats of perjury prosecution and the complexity of testimony\n\njointly suffice to meet its lower threshold.            Maj. Op. at 20, 22.\n\nBut   the   record   reflects   only   four   perjury    warnings   and    no\n\nparticularly outrageous conduct on the part of the prosecutors, nor\n\ndoes it bear out the majority's claim of complexity.\n\n            During the course of three hours and fifteen minutes of\n\ntestimony, the record reveals only four perjury warnings.                 The\n\nfirst was given at the beginning of the witness's testimony,\n\nreminding him that the use immunity order does not extend to\n\nperjury or obstruction of justice:\n\n            PROSECUTOR: [Y]ou also understand that the\n            order [granting use immunity] does not protect\n            you if you lie, mislead or obstruct this grand\n            jury's investigation, do you understand that?\n\n            WITNESS: I do understand that yes.26\n\n            The second warning was given when a different prosecutor\n\nfirst began questioning the witness:\n\n            PROSECUTOR: All right. Well you know [name\n            redacted] I'm going to caution you, and [the\n            other prosecutor] told you this earlier.\n            Despite the fact that you have received\n            immunity today, if your testimony is designed\n            to mislead this grand jury or is evasive or\n            equivocal, you can be charged with obstruction\n            of justice, do you understand that?\n\n\n26\n Ofttimes, a prosecutor will have more than one purpose for this\nintroductory perjury warning, including the buttressing of the\nwitness's anticipated testimony by suggesting -- through the\nperjury warning -- that the immunized witness has every incentive\nto tell the truth.\n\n                                  -39-\n\f          WITNESS:   I do understand that.\n\n          The third perjury warning was given after the witness\n\noffered a series of evasive answers to straightforward questions:\n\n          PROSECUTOR: No, no. Look. Look, [name of\n          witness redacted], again let's make a --\n          you're here to tell the truth. Okay? This\n          isn't a game. All right? You're not here to\n          defend [third party] or defend your own\n          actions. You have immunity. The only way you\n          get into trouble here is if you lie or mislead\n          this grand jury.     Do you understand this\n          concept?\n\n          WITNESS:   I do.27\n\n          The fourth and final perjury warning was given purely\n\nprophylactically after a two hour lunch break:\n\n\n\n\n27\n The majority relies on a prosecutor's admonition that the lawyers\npresenting and the grand jurors hearing the case were \"laymen\" to\nconclude that the witness's answers were not evasive or\nobstreperous but rather \"highly technical.\" Maj. Op. at 22 n.9.\nWhat the majority overlooks is that the prosecutors in this case\nwere attempting to elicit from the witness basic facts regarding\nwhether a third party was warned of a particular danger, and if so,\nwhen and in what level of detail. The witness claimed that such a\nwarning was provided at a meeting at which he was present, but when\npressed, conceded that the warning was not given at the meeting.\nUnlike the details of a warning, which may be technical, the fact\nof whether a warning was given, and if given, its subject is not\nnormally, and in this case was not \"highly technical.\"          The\nwitness's failure to address this question in a straightforward or\neven consistent manner is one of many examples of his evasiveness.\n     Furthermore, I note that the witness requested and was granted\nthe opportunity to consult with counsel shortly after the exchange\nthe majority describes. This further reinforces my conclusion that\nthe prosecutors were not behaving abusively or attempting to\noverbear the witness.    Instead,   the prosecutors respected the\nwitness's rights and were only interested in eliciting the truth,\nwhich the witness was obfuscating considerably.\n\n                               -40-\n\f          PROSECUTOR: [Name redacted], just to remind\n          you, can you please acknowledge that you\n          understand that you are still under oath?\n\n          WITNESS: I do understand that, yes.\n\n          Other than these warnings reminding the witness that use\n\nimmunity does not extend to perjury or obstruction of justice, the\n\nwords \"perjury,\" \"lie,\" \"obstruct,\" or other similar words and\n\nphrases   appear   in   the   transcript   only   infrequently   and\n\ninconsequentially. The record further clarifies that the few times\n\nthe prosecutors acted in a way that could be characterized as\n\nconfrontational, see Maj. Op. at 20, 22 n.9, the witness was\n\nproviding obviously evasive and non-responsive answers.28\n\n\n\n\n28\n The majority too quickly dismisses the witness's obstreperous\nconduct and his consistently unresponsive and insufficient answers\nto legitimate questions, and the majority further fails to\nacknowledge the obvious systemic harm that flows from such conduct.\nMaj. Op. at 24 n.11. This omission is puzzling in light of the\nmajority's concern for systemic benefits that come from access.\nSee Maj. Op. at 15. When one considers the appellant's conduct in\nthis case, it is clear that any hardship that he has experienced is\n\"self-induced,\" that prosecutors provided him with warnings in\ncompliance with our case law, see supra note 22, and that the\nmajority's new rule will grant witnesses wide latitude to avoid\ncooperating with grand juries and prosecutors searching for the\ntruth.\n     Finally, the fact that I disagree so sharply with the majority\nover what transpired in this case and the severity of the\nprosecutors' perjury warnings reaffirms the wisdom of our decisions\nin Bottari, Bianchi, and Special Proceedings -- consistent with\nSupreme Court precedent -- to avoid such disputes altogether by\napplying a rigorous \"strong showing of particularized need\"\nstandard for all access to grand jury transcripts, while relying on\nthe other substantial protections found in federal law to protect\nthe interests of witnesses.\n\n                                -41-\n\f           In addition, it is important to note that although some\n\nof the substantive subject matter in this case may be technical,\n\nfor the most part, the prosecutors did not dwell on the technical\n\ncomplexities. It is also worth noting that the witness admitted to\n\nhaving reviewed many of the documents pertinent to his testimony\n\nwith his attorney in the days and weeks prior to his testimony.\n\nThis preparation should substantially ameliorate the majority's\n\nconcern regarding both the technical and the \"ancient\" nature of\n\nthe testimony.    Moreover, the witness was given the opportunity to\n\nconsult with counsel, who was available outside of the grand jury\n\nroom, and the record reflects that the witness consulted with\n\ncounsel at least twice, which should further palliate concerns that\n\nanything unfair occurred here.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n           Because I find that the majority's newly invented lesser\n\nstandard of need is inconsistent with our precedent, significantly\n\ndetracts   from   important   interests   of   grand   jury   secrecy   and\n\npreventing witness intimidation, substantially overemphasizes the\n\ninterests of a witness, encrusts grand jury proceedings with\n\nneedless procedural complications, and is insupportable on this\n\nrecord, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -42-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 11, 2009\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.           This appeal arises from an\n\nongoing grand jury investigation.            The appellant, a non-target,\n\ntestified before the grand jury concerning highly technical and\n\nancient   subject   matter.        After    approximately   three   hours   of\n\ntestimony, during which the government reminded the appellant\n\nrepeatedly that a failure to testify truthfully would be subject to\n\npossible perjury charges, the government continued its examination\n\nto a later date.    In the interim, the appellant sought access to a\n\ntranscript of his prior testimony pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E)(i).           The district court denied the\n\nrequest, finding that the appellant failed to provide a strong\n\nshowing of a particularized need for access to the transcript. The\n\nappellant refused to testify further, and, on the government's\n\nmotion, the district court found the appellant in contempt.             This\n\nappeal followed.      After careful consideration, we reverse and\n\nremand.\n\n                              I.    Background\n\n           To avoid compromising the grand jury investigation, we\n\nonly discuss the bare minimum of facts necessary to dispose of this\n\nappeal.\n\n           In May 2008, the government issued a subpoena to the\n\nappellant to testify before a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts, and subsequently issued a subpoena\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdirecting him to produce documents related to the subject matter of\n\nhis testimony.\n\n            After receipt of the subpoenas, the appellant indicated\n\nthrough counsel that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right\n\nagainst    self-incrimination      and   would     refuse     to    testify.      In\n\nresponse, the government applied for and obtained an order granting\n\nthe appellant use immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002 & 6003,\n\nand compelled him to testify before the grand jury.\n\n            About a week later, in June 2008, the appellant testified\n\nbefore the grand jury for approximately three hours and fifteen\n\nminutes.     During his examination, which was conducted by three\n\nassistant U.S. attorneys simultaneously, the prosecutors warned the\n\nappellant multiple times that the use immunity order did not\n\nprotect him from prosecution for testifying falsely.                      In some\n\ninstances,    the    prosecutors     asked       repetitive        questions,    and\n\nsuggested inconsistencies in the appellant's testimony.                         Other\n\ntimes, the prosecutors verbally abused the appellant. However, the\n\nprosecutors did not indicate that they were planning to indict the\n\nappellant on perjury or obstruction of justice charges.                  Moreover,\n\nthe   appellant     was   questioned     about    events    and      documents    of\n\nsignificant complexity.        A number of these events and documents\n\ndated back to 1999.1\n\n\n1\n We note that during the course of this appeal we requested a copy\nof the transcript and exhibits from the appellant's appearance for\nour own independent review.\n\n                                       -3-\n\f              The   government        did    not       complete    its     examination.\n\nConsequently, the government ordered the appellant to return and\n\ncomplete his testimony the following week.                        At the appellant's\n\nrequest, the government agreed to continue his return to the grand\n\njury for an additional two weeks, until early July 2008.\n\n              In the interim, counsel for the appellant sent a letter\n\nto the government seeking an opportunity for the appellant to\n\nreview the transcript of his grand jury testimony in advance of his\n\nsecond day of testimony.            The government declined the request.\n\n              As a result, the appellant filed an emergency motion for\n\naccess to a transcript of his grand jury testimony pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i), which authorizes a court to order\n\ndisclosure     of     grand    jury    materials         \"preliminarily        to   or    in\n\nconnection with a judicial proceeding.\"                   In particular, appellant\n\nsought to review his transcript at the U.S. Attorney's office or a\n\nsimilar location, and further requested that his lawyer accompany\n\nhim and that the appellant be allowed to take notes.\n\n              In support of his motion, the appellant cited a recent\n\nD.C. Circuit decision, In re Grand Jury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186944\"><a href=\"/opinion/186944/in-re-grand-jury/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007), in which the court held that grand jury witnesses are\n\nentitled under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) to review transcripts of their\n\nown   grand    jury    testimony.           See    id.    at    980,   990.         In   the\n\nalternative,        the      appellant      argued       that     he     has    shown      a\n\nparticularized        need    for   access        to   the     transcript      given     the\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fprosecutors' warnings of possible perjury prosecution and the\n\ncomplexity of the subject matter of his testimony.   The government\n\nopposed, and argued that, under First Circuit law, the appellant\n\nmust provide \"a strong showing of particularized need\" to obtain\n\naccess, see In re Special Proceedings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201071\"><a href=\"/opinion/201071/in-re-special-proc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (quotation marks omitted), and that the appellant had failed\n\nto do so.\n\n            A hearing was held on the same day as the filing of the\n\nemergency motion, which, as the district court noted, did \"not\n\nprovide[] a great deal of time for reflection.\"   In ruling on the\n\nmotion, the district court first acknowledged that \"at least at\n\nfirst reading I agree with the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit case.\"\n\nIn particular, the district court noted that the benefit to the\n\nwitness of access far outweighs the \"very mild burden on grand jury\n\nsecrecy, so mild as to be close to nonexistent,\" since a witness is\n\nnot bound to keep his testimony secret, and could easily debrief\n\nhis or her attorney after testifying.       Moreover, although the\n\ndistrict court recognized the \"potential administrative burden\"\n\ncaused by the D.C. Circuit rule in permitting access, it concluded,\n\nin its own view, that \"the benefit to the witness greatly outweighs\n\nthe burden to the government.\"\n\n            Nevertheless, the district court concluded that it was\n\nbound by First Circuit precedent, and thus required the appellant\n\nto provide a strong showing of a particularized need for the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ftranscript in order to obtain access.        In examining whether the\n\nappellant had made a showing of particularized need, the district\n\ncourt stated:\n\n            I do not find that there is a particularized\n            need here, that is, as I interpret the case\n            law, as to what is required to show a\n            particularized need; that there are three\n            unusual aspects to this:    The first is that\n            the testimony spread over two days or more\n            than one day; the second is that the witness\n            was confronted by the prosecutor and given\n            perjury warnings about the accuracy of some of\n            his statements; and the third is that the\n            subject matter is quite complex.     While to\n            some extent those facts are unusual, they're\n            not highly unusual, and I don't think under\n            the [In re] Bianchi [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339148\"><a href=\"/opinion/339148/in-re-leonard-l-bianchi/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n            1976)] and In Re: Special Proceedings line of\n            cases are enough to show particularized need.\n\nAccordingly, the district court denied the motion.\n\n            One week later, in mid-July 2008, the appellant appeared\n\nbefore the grand jury but refused to answer questions.       That same\n\nday, the government petitioned the district court to hold the\n\nappellant in civil contempt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1826.        Still\n\nthat same day, the district court conducted a hearing during which\n\nit allowed the government's petition for contempt in an oral ruling\n\nand written order.    However, the district court stayed that order\n\nduring the pendency of any appeal.\n\n            Counsel for the appellant also pointed out that the\n\ntranscript of the appellant's first day of grand jury testimony was\n\nnow available, and moved the district court to order the government\n\nto   file   the   transcript   with   the   court.   After   initially\n\n                                  -6-\n\fentertaining the request, the district court denied the motion,\n\nbecause    it    was   concerned    about    the   \"mechanical     difficulties\n\ninvolved,\" and since it was \"not relying on what the transcript\n\nsaid, I don't feel I need to see the transcript.             I won't make it\n\npart of the record.\"\n\n                              II.     Discussion\n\n            On appeal, the appellant contends that the district court\n\nerred in denying his request to review a transcript of his grand\n\njury testimony prior to his second day of examination.               We review\n\nany rulings of law de novo, and, to the extent we find no legal\n\nerror, any denial of disclosure for abuse of discretion.              See In re\n\nGrand Jury Proceedings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"358148\"><a href=\"/opinion/358148/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-appeal-of-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 1978).\n\n            A.     Standard That Applies to a Request for Access\n\n            The appellant first contends that the district court\n\nerred as a matter of law in requiring him to provide a \"strong\n\nshowing of particularized need\" in order to obtain access to his\n\ntranscript.       Instead, the appellant argues that a \"less demanding\"\n\nstandard of particularized need applies when a grand jury witness\n\nseeks only access to a transcript of his testimony, rather than a\n\ncopy.    For support, appellant relies on In re Grand Jury, a recent\n\nD.C.    Circuit    decision   where    the   court   held   that    grand   jury\n\nwitnesses are entitled \"to review transcripts of their own grand\n\njury testimony in private at the U.S. Attorney's Office or a place\n\nagreed to by the parties or designated by the district court.\"              490\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fF.3d at 990.      Given its importance to the appellant's claims, we\n\ndiscuss the D.C. Circuit's decision in some detail.\n\n                     1.   The D.C. Circuit Decision\n\n           Grand Jury involved a grand jury investigation into a\n\ncompany and its employees.          Id. at 980.        Two employees of the\n\ncompany testified before the grand jury, and were subpoenaed to\n\ntestify an additional time.            Id.     Both moved for access to a\n\ntranscript of their prior grand jury testimony before testifying\n\nfurther,   \"in    order   to   avoid     the   possibility    of   inconsistent\n\nstatements occasioned by the passage of years since the events in\n\nquestion and many months\" since they last testified, as well as the\n\npossible need \"to take advantage of recantation pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1623.\"       Id. at 984.         The district court denied both\n\nmotions,   finding    that     neither    employee    provided     a   sufficient\n\nshowing    of    \"particularized       need\"    for   the    transcripts     that\n\n\"outweighed the interests in maintaining grand jury secrecy.\"                 Id.\n\nat 984 & n.4.\n\n           On appeal, the D.C. Circuit, addressing the issue for the\n\nfirst time, see id. at 987, noted that the district court, in\n\nrequiring a showing of particularized need, relied on Supreme Court\n\nprecedent that concerned third parties seeking copies of such\n\nmaterials.       See id. at 984 & n.3 (citing, among other cases,\n\nDouglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110060\"><a href=\"/opinion/110060/douglas-oil-co-of-cal-v-petrol-stops-northwest/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222-23\n\n(1979)).     However, in contrast to a third party, a grand jury\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwitness is under no obligation to maintain the secrecy of grand\n\njury proceedings.       Id. at 985; see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 6,\n\nAdvisory Committee Notes, 1944 Adoption, Note to Subdivision (e)\n\n(\"[R]ule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on witnesses.\").\n\n            With this background in mind, the D.C. Circuit addressed\n\n\"when courts should\" provide access.         Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 986.\n\nNoting that the text of Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) is \"open-ended,\" and\n\nfollowing the \"general analytic approach\" of other circuits that\n\nhave addressed the issue, the court \"weigh[ed] the competing\n\ninterests of the Government and grand jury witnesses.\" Id. at 987.\n\nAs to witnesses, the district court identified two interests in\n\nobtaining    access:     (1)    the   need    to   \"ensur[e]    that      their\n\nrecollections are accurately reflected in the transcripts,\" and\n\n(2)   for   those   witnesses   who   \"may   testify   again   in   the   same\n\ninvestigation . . . to help prepare for the upcoming testimony.\"\n\nId. at 988.         As to the government, the court identified two\n\ncompeting interests: (1) to maintain grand jury secrecy, and (2) to\n\nprevent witness intimidation.         Id.\n\n            The court concluded that the witness interests in access\n\noutweighed the government's interests in prohibiting such access.\n\nAs to secrecy, the court noted that the secrecy rationale was meant\n\nto prevent \"the public or others from learning what a grand jury\n\nwitness said to the grand jury.\"             Id.   Thus, while preventing\n\naccess to a third party was necessary to maintain the secrecy of\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fgrand jury witness testimony, preventing access to the witness\n\nhimself \"makes little sense,\" since a witness already knows the\n\ncontent of his testimony and, in any event, has the right to\n\nbroadcast the substance of his testimony if he so desired.               Id. at\n\n988-89 (noting that \"the witness can stand on the courthouse steps\n\nand   tell    the    public    everything   the   witness   was    asked   and\n\nanswered\"). The D.C. Circuit therefore concluded that \"the Supreme\n\nCourt's 'particularized need' standard, which the Court crafted to\n\ndeal with third-party requests for secret transcripts of other\n\nwitnesses' testimony, does not apply in this first-party context.\"\n\nId. at 989.\n\n             As to witness intimidation, the court found compelling\n\nthe concern that providing copies to a witness would result in\n\nthird   parties      forcing   disclosure   of    the   copies    and   thereby\n\n\"deter[ring] witnesses from testifying freely and candidly in the\n\nfirst place.\"       Id. at 989.   However, the concern with intimidation\n\n\"lacks force with respect to a witness's merely reviewing the\n\ntranscript in private at the U.S. Attorney's office or a place\n\nagreed to by the parties or designated by the district court.\"             Id.\n\nat 990.      The court, in particular, saw little difference between\n\npressure to divulge the contents after a private review of the\n\ntranscript and pressure to \"recall their testimony from memory.\"\n\nId.   Based on this weighing of interests, the court concluded that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ffirst-party witnesses are entitled to access of their transcripts\n\nunder Rule 6(e).\n\n                   2.   Analysis\n\n           The appellant contends that the D.C. Circuit's reasoning\n\nin Grand Jury supports his claim of a less demanding standard,\n\nsince he seeks the same access to a transcript of his own testimony\n\nthat the D.C. Circuit permitted.     We agree.   To be clear, we do not\n\nadopt the D.C. Circuit's holding that a grand jury witness is\n\nentitled to access to a transcript of his grand jury testimony.\n\nInstead, we hold that, in light of the considerations supporting\n\nthe D.C. Circuit decision and our own review of our precedent, a\n\nless demanding requirement of particularized need applies when a\n\ngrand jury witness demands access to a transcript, rather than a\n\ncopy of the transcript.2\n\n           Admittedly, we have held that \"a grand jury witness has\n\nno general right to the transcripts of his testimony.\"        Bianchi,\n\n542 F.2d at 100 (citing In re Bottari, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"300723\"><a href=\"/opinion/300723/in-re-samuel-bottari-aka-santo-bottari/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n\n1972)).

Circuit approach, and although we discuss the\nD.C. Circuit at great length, we base our decision on a review of\nour precedent as well as our independent assessment of the\ninterests at stake, many of which were not addressed by the D.C.\nCircuit.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fshowing of particularized need\" in order to obtain a copy of a\n\ntranscript.

In Bottari,\n\nour    earliest    case    on    the    issue,       the   witness      sought,    as   a\n\nprecondition      to   testifying,      a     copy    of   \"a   transcript        of   the\n\nquestions and answers following his appearance before the grand\n\njury.\"    453 F.2d at 371.

And in Special Proceedings, a case outside the\n\ngrand jury context, but involving what we determined an analogous\n\nsituation, a special investigation, we rejected a witness's claim\n\nfor a copy of his deposition transcript.3                  373 F.3d at 47.\n\n\n3\n The dissent points out that in Special Proceedings we stated the\nfollowing:\n\n       Taricani may be arguing that as a witness he has an\n       elevated right to copies of his own deposition\n       transcript.

Similarly, a majority of circuits hold that a\n       non-defendant witness seeking access to his own\n       deposition transcript must make \"a strong showing of\n       particularized need\" for such disclosure.\n\n373 F.3d at 47 (emphasis added). According to the dissent, the use\nof the word \"access\" above means that our precedent equally\n\n                                         -12-\n\f           In none of these cases did we have the occasion to\n\naddress whether a demand for access, which imposes a lesser burden\n\non the governmental interests of grand jury secrecy and witness\n\nintimidation, still requires a strong showing of particularized\n\nneed.   Nor has the Supreme Court opined on the issue.   However, the\n\nSupreme Court, in articulating a standard of particularized need\n\nfor third parties, has noted that its \"standard is a highly\n\nflexible one, adaptable to different circumstances and sensitive to\n\nthe fact that the requirements of secrecy are greater in some\n\n\n\n\nrequires a \"strong showing of particularized need\" for requests for\na review of a transcript. (Dissent at 26-28).\n\n     We disagree. First, the sentence in which \"access\" appears\nonly describes what the \"majority of circuits\" have held. More\nimportantly, it notes that such a holding is only \"[s]imilar[]\" to\nour own rule, which, described in the previous sentence, does not\ndeal with \"access\" but with copies, or, to borrow the words of the\nBianchi court, with \"a general right to transcripts.\" 542 F.2d at\n100 (emphasis added).\n\n     Second, the dissent relies upon Awuah v.

In Awuah, however, we gave effect to broader language in\na prior decision because, although broader, it \"constitute[d] the\nrationale for the decision.\" 554 F.3d at 11. In contrast, the\nbroader statement in Special Proceedings did not \"constitute the\nrationale for the decision,\" but was a description of the holdings\nof a \"majority of circuits.\" In fact, and as discussed below, had\nthe court in Special Proceedings intended to reach access as\ndefined here, it would have at least expressed some disapproval\nwith the district court's sua sponte offer of access. Instead, the\ncourt in Special Proceedings cited the option with approval. 373\nF.3d at 47.\n\n                                -13-\n\fsituations than in others.\"       United States v.

We take the same approach.\n\n           We begin by discussing the significant interest a witness\n\nhas in reviewing a transcript of his or her grand jury testimony.\n\nAs the D.C. Circuit recognized, even witnesses who intend to\n\ntestify truthfully have an interest in avoiding inaccuracies and\n\ninconsistencies that may subject them to a potential perjury\n\nprosecution.      See Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 988 (noting that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1623(a) provides for \"inconsistent statements as [a] basis\n\nfor a perjury conviction\").        The interest in avoiding inaccuracies\n\nand inconsistencies increases significantly when a grand jury\n\nwitness has to testify over multiple days, and thus has to prepare\n\nfor upcoming testimony.     Id.\n\n           Moreover,     federal     law    \"strongly     reinforces\"     that\n\ninterest. Id.      A grand jury witness has a statutory right to\n\nrecant, one that would be difficult to exercise without a review of\n\nthe transcript.    See 18 U.S.C. § 1623(d); see also Grand Jury, 490\n\nF.3d at 988 (\"A witness would have difficulty taking full advantage\n\nof the statutory recantation provision . . . without obtaining\n\nprompt   access   to   transcripts    of    their   own   testimony.\").    In\n\naddition, the federal rules contemplate the disclosure of grand\n\njury transcripts.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i) (\"The court\n\nmay authorize disclosure . . . of a grand jury matter . . .\n\npreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding\").\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fFinally, the government is subject to a higher burden of proof to\n\nestablish perjury, which lessens the risk of perjury prosecution\n\nand, therefore, allows witnesses to be less evasive and more\n\nforthcoming in answering questions.4\n\n           We   also   stress    that    the   interest    a   witness   has   in\n\nmaintaining the accuracy of his or her testimony is not just\n\npersonal to the witness.        It is systemic, as both the courts and\n\nthe government have a substantial interest in ensuring the accuracy\n\nof grand jury testimony.\n\n           With the witness's interests in mind, we consider the\n\ninterests of the government, particularly how those interests are\n\naffected in the access context as compared to the copy context.                As\n\nthe D.C. Circuit points out, there are significant differences\n\nbetween   the   access   and    copy    context   with    respect   to   witness\n\nintimidation.    Specifically, \"if a witness could routinely obtain\n\na copy of the grand jury transcript . . . an interested party could\n\nin turn pressure the witness to obtain the transcript and to give\n\nit to that third party.\"        Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 989.        Likewise a\n\n\"witness's fear of being forced to disclose the transcript to a\n\nthreatening third party could deter witnesses from testifying\n\n\n4\n The dissent only views these protections as \"abundant . . . for\nall grand jury witnesses,\" and thus concludes that we \"vastly\noverstate[] a witness's interest in access to prior grand jury\ntestimony.\"    (Dissent at 32-33).       Instead, we view these\nprotections as a recognition of the significant interest a witness\nhas in maintaining the accuracy of his testimony, such that we do\nnot overstate it, but simply take it into account.\n\n                                       -15-\n\ffreely and candidly in the first place.\"                Id.     Both of these\n\nconcerns     are    alleviated    significantly     when      only    access   is\n\npermitted.       Unlike in the copy context, a witness granted only\n\naccess could, in the face of intimidation, simply decline to reveal\n\nhis testimony.       See id. at 990 (noting that, in general, a grand\n\njury witness could decline to discuss his or her testimony, and\n\nthat this option \"is not realistically affected by whether the\n\nwitness    can     review   the   transcript   at   a   secure       location\").5\n\nMoreover, because of this option, the witness will feel less\n\ninclined to withhold truthful testimony.\n\n            Although the D.C. Circuit did not address it, the access\n\ncontext also differs from the copy context with respect to grand\n\njury secrecy.       As both the D.C. Circuit and the district court in\n\nthis case point out, a grand jury witness is under no obligation to\n\nmaintain the secrecy of his or her testimony.           To use the colorful\n\n\n\n5\n The D.C. Circuit, in fact, found this difference so significant\nthat it expressly reserved the issue of whether \"the possibility of\nwitness intimidation would justify denying copies of transcripts.\"\nId. at 989-90.\n\n    The dissent contends that our conclusion is \"naive,\" because\n\"[t]he same people who would cajole a witness to obtain a copy of\nhis testimony and reveal it would be able to use similar methods to\ncoerce the witness into reviewing his testimony and reporting its\ncontents.\" (Dissent at 30). However, the dissent does not fully\ntake into account the evasive measures a witness can undertake if\nhe only obtains access. After all, a witness, even after review,\ncould be less than forthcoming about his testimony, and a third\nparty would never know to cajole further. If the witness obtains\na copy, however, no amount of evasion can hide his testimony,\nprinted in black and white, from a determined third party.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fexample of the district court, a grand jury witness has the right\n\nto \"put up that information on a billboard on the Mass. Pike.\"\n\nThus, any concern with maintaining grand jury secrecy is already\n\ndiminished in the grand jury witness context.6 However, permitting\n\naccess does not exacerbate the situation in the way making a copy\n\navailable does.   Unlike access, a copy can take on a life of its\n\nown, and, despite the efforts of a well-intentioned grand jury\n\nwitness, a copy can float around and land in the wrong hands.\n\nAccordingly, the access context better maintains grand jury secrecy\n\nvis-a-vis the copy context.\n\n           Finally, although we have not had the occasion to address\n\nthe issue, our decision in Special Proceedings lends some support\n\nto the distinction we make between granting access and granting a\n\ncopy.   There, we found that a deponent in a special investigation\n\nfailed to articulate, let alone show, a particularized need for a\n\ncopy of his deposition transcript, in part because \"the district\n\ncourt took steps to accommodate any need [the witness] might have\n\nfor the transcript by offering [the witness] and his counsel access\n\nto the deposition testimony as long as they agreed to keep the\n\n\n\n6\n In fact, our precedent has failed to acknowledge the fact that a\ngrand jury witness is not under any obligation to maintain grand\njury secrecy. Some courts, most notably the D.C. Circuit, have\nviewed this fact as cutting in favor of witness access.      Other\ncourts have not. See, e.g., Bast v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339357\"><a href=\"/opinion/339357/in-re-richard-l-bast-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n896 (4th Cir. 1976) (requiring a showing of particularized need,\nbut \"recogniz[ing] that Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 imposes no condition of\nsecrecy on the witness.\").\n\n                                -17-\n\ftranscript confidential.\"      373 F.3d at 47.            Not only did we cite\n\nthe option of access with approval, but we also indicated that a\n\ngreater showing of need was required to move from the access\n\ncontext to the copy context.\n\n            We   also   recognize   one    other       important   interest   not\n\ndiscussed by the D.C. Circuit but cited by the district court\n\nbelow,   efficiency.         Articulating          a     lesser    standard   of\n\nparticularized need with respect to access may increase the burdens\n\non the government in grand jury proceedings.                 However, we agree\n\nwith the district court that \"the benefit to the witness greatly\n\noutweighs the burden to the government.\"                  As the D.C. Circuit\n\nnoted, \"the Federal Rules . . . mandate that grand jury proceedings\n\nbe transcribed or taped,\" with such records being kept by the\n\ngovernment.      Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 986 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n6(e)(1)).   Thus, the cost of providing a transcript, which must be\n\ncreated anyway, and the slight delay caused by the review of the\n\ntranscript would not impede an investigation significantly.                   In\n\nfact, there is no evidence that the D.C. Circuit's more lenient\n\nrule has had any detrimental affect on grand jury investigations in\n\nthat circuit.\n\n            We conclude by noting that our \"less demanding\" standard\n\nof particularized need does not apply to appellant's request to\n\ntake notes.       Permitting notetaking blurs the line between the\n\naccess and copy contexts, since one can imagine an appellant\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ftranscribing his transcript and, in effect, creating a copy. Thus,\n\nour requirement of a strong showing of particularized need applies\n\nequally to the notetaking context.7\n\n            For all of the above reasons, we find that the district\n\ncourt committed error in applying our precedent, which has solely\n\ninvolved requests for copies, to the appellant's request for access\n\nto a transcript of his grand jury testimony.\n\n            B.   Showing of Particularized Need\n\n            Because the district court did not make any factual\n\nfindings, but assumed as true the contentions in support of the\n\nappellant's request for access, we address whether appellant has\n\nmade   a   showing   of   particularized   need   in   light   of   the   less\n\ndemanding standard we articulated above.8\n\n\n7\n Permitting the appellant's counsel to be present during the\nreview, which the appellant also requests, is a closer call. Thus,\nfollowing the D.C. Circuit, we leave it up to the \"sound\ndiscretion\" of the district court on remand to determine whether\nappellant's counsel can be present. See Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at\n990.\n8\n Because we hold that our former standard of \"a strong showing of\nparticularized need\" still applies to the appellant's request to\ntake notes, we still must review the district court's finding of no\nparticularized need.      In our view, there was no abuse of\ndiscretion.     The district court, assuming the appellant's\ncontentions as true, ultimately determined that the appellant's\ncircumstances, which included the prosecutors' perjury warnings and\nthe   complexity   of  his   testimony,   were   not   sufficiently\nparticularized to meet our standard. Given that we have not found\na sufficiently particularized need where only an \"ill-defined\"\npotential for perjury prosecution exists, see, e.g., Bianchi, 542\nF.2d at 100, we do not see how the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying notetaking.\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f            The   appellant    argues   that    his     need      for    access   is\n\nsufficiently particularized to justify access for two reasons: (1)\n\nthe threats of perjury prosecution given by the prosecutors during\n\nhis examination, and (2) the complexity of the subject matter of\n\nhis testimony, which involved \"ancient activity.\"                 We agree.\n\n            The appellant contends that his need was particularized\n\nbecause he was \"threatened by . . . powerful authorities with life-\n\nwrecking perjury convictions and years of imprisonment.\"                    Our own\n\nreview of the grand jury transcript supports his claim.                     In some\n\ninstances the prosecutors made pointed comments to the appellant,\n\nasking in places if he \"ha[d] a hearing problem\" or whether he\n\n\"speak[s] the English language.\"\n\n            Under our case law in the copy context, we have held that\n\npotential    perjury   prosecution      alone        does   not     arise    to   a\n\nparticularized    need.       In   Bottari,    for    example,      we    found   no\n\nparticularized need due to potential perjury prosecution because\n\nthat potential alone made \"th[e] appellant . . . no different from\n\nany other witness who testifies before a grand jury, or elsewhere.\"\n\n453 F.2d at 371.     Likewise in Bianchi, where the witness also had\n\nuse immunity under 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002 and 6003, we found no\n\n\n   Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in not\nmaking the transcript a part of the record, as the appellant\nclaims.   In examining whether the appellant provided a strong\nshowing of particularized need, the district court assumed as true\nthe appellant's contentions in support of why his need was\nparticularized.   Thus, the appellant would have received little\nbenefit from having the district court review the transcript.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fparticularized need where the witness's \"ill-defined fear\" of a\n\n\"'slight inconsistency' between past and present testimony [that]\n\nmight subject him to perjury prosecution [wa]s unfounded.\"                  542\n\nF.2d at 100.\n\n            In this context, however, it is a close call whether the\n\nstrongly worded, even abusive warnings of the prosecutors alone\n\nsuffice to demonstrate a particularized need under our lesser\n\nstandard for access.       Some circuits have permitted access based\n\nupon such conduct, although they did so on other grounds.                   See,\n\ne.g., Bursey v.

However, we do not need to address the\n\nissue, because the threats of perjury prosecution, combined with\n\nthe    complexity     of   the    appellant's      testimony,     sufficiently\n\nestablishes a particularized need. As the witness attested to, and\n\nas the grand jury transcript and exhibits bear out, the subject\n\nmatter of his testimony was significantly complex, involving not\n\nonly   complex   technical       material,   but   also    events   and    dates\n\noccurring    nearly    a   decade    ago.       Thus,     any   concerns    with\n\ninconsistencies in his testimony (concerns which were repeatedly\n\ninflamed by the prosecutors) were magnified by the potential traps\n\nposed by the highly technical and ancient nature of his testimony.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fAccordingly, the threats of perjury prosecution, combined with the\n\ncomplexity of the witness's testimony, supplies the necessary\n\nparticularized need to permit access.\n\n           We conclude by discussing our application of this lesser\n\ndemand for \"particularized need\" going forward.             In this case we\n\nhave found such a need satisfied given the abusive warnings of the\n\nprosecutors during testimony and the complexity of the appellant's\n\ntestimony. We emphasize that, based upon our review of the record,\n\nthe   warnings    were   not   only   strongly    worded,   but    were   also\n\nbuttressed   by    repetitious    questions      and   insulting   language.\n\nMoreover, the subject matter of the testimony concerned complex,\n\nnearly decade-old technical material that was integral to the\n\nexamination.9\n\n\n9\n The dissent disagrees, and contends that our rule \"is likely\nsatisfied in many -- if not most -- grand jury investigations.\"\n(Dissent at 34). The dissent misstates the basis of our finding\nfor a particularized need.    Prosecutor's warnings combined with\ntestimony only \"involv[ing] complex subjects that occurred some\ntime in the past\" are not sufficient to establish a particularized\nneed under our lower standard, as the dissent suggests. (See id.\nat 35). Something more is required, and we articulated above what\nthat more was in this case.\n\n  Moreover, we disagree with the dissent's characterization of the\nwarnings made during the examination.    The dissent quotes four\nwarnings during the examination to show that they were innocuous,\nignoring other warnings as \"infrequent[] and inconsequential[].\"\n(Dissent at 39-41). It is the third quoted warning on which we\ndisagree.   The dissent seeks to explain that the warning is\njustifiably strongly worded because the appellant was being\n\"evasive.\"   (Id. at 40).     However, we read the exchange as\nsupporting our view that the examination was highly technical, as\nthe government immediately stated after giving the warning that\n\"Okay.

However, the lesser standard of\n\nparticularized need we apply here would not impose undue hardship\n\non grand jury investigations.   A district court in its discretion\n\ncan utilize procedures, such as the expedited hearing the district\n\ncourt conducted in this case, to minimize any undue effect on the\n\ngrand jury investigation.   Moreover, although we had the advantage\n\nof reviewing the transcript in this case, nothing we say here\n\nrequires the government to submit one in response to a motion for\n\naccess.   To the extent that the transcript is not available, a\n\ngrand jury witness can testify (or make a proffer) in camera as to\n\nhis or her examination to support his or her claim, with the\n\ngovernment having an opportunity to rebut.10 Finally, to the extent\n\n\ngroup of laymen. . . . so talk to us like we're regular people and\nstop playing word games with us.\" Moreover, the dissent dismisses\nthe other warnings given during this exchange, such as \"Now I'm\ntelling you to answer the questions straightforwardly and\ntruthfully,\" followed shortly thereafter by \"Okay. Can you answer\nthe question straightforwardly?,\" and still later by \"Again, answer\nthe question that's asked of you. Answer is directly. Answer it\ntruthfully. All right?\" and, after a five minute break, \"I remind\nyou that you're still under oath.\" From here, the government's\nwarnings took an abusive turn: \"Please, again, do you have a\nhearing problem?\" and \"And you speak the English language, that's\nyour first language, right?\"\n10\n Thus, we disagree with the dissent that under our rule \"a district\ncourt will abuse its discretion if it fails to review the\n\n                                -23-\n\fthat   a   grand    jury    witness    games   the    system   to   establish   a\n\nparticularized need, a district court can take evidence of that\n\ninto account.        A witness cannot establish a need, let alone a\n\nparticularized one, if the purported need was self-induced.11\n\n                                III.   Conclusion\n\n            For    the     foregoing   reasons,      we   reverse   the   district\n\ncourt's finding of contempt, and, on remand, direct the district\n\ncourt to permit the appellant access to a transcript of his grand\n\njury testimony consistent with this opinion.\n\n            Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                         \"Dissenting opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\ntranscript.\"       (Dissent at 36 n.23).\n11\n The dissent claims that we \"too quickly dismisses the witness's\nobstreperous conduct.\" (Dissent at 41 n.28). Our own review of\nthe transcript does not suggest to us that the appellant was being\nobstreperous during the examination given the highly technical\nnature of the questions asked.       Moreover, the appellant has\nproceeded in good faith throughout the course of these proceedings.\nAs the district court found in staying its contempt order pending\nappeal, the appellant's claims were \"not frivolous\" and that the\nappellant was not \"being contumacious in the way [of an] ordinary\ngrand jury witness, who simply refuses to testify without good\nreason.\"\n\n                                       -24-\n\f               HOWARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.        Neither the Federal\n\nRules     of     Criminal   Procedure        nor   Supreme   Court   precedent\n\nspecifically address the circumstances in which a non-defendant\n\ngrand jury witness may access his testimony, regardless of the\n\nformat of such access. The panel majority adopts an approach based\n\non the reasoning and rationale of a recent D.C. Circuit opinion,\n\nwhich permits relatively unfettered access even for non-defendant\n\nwitnesses.        Were we writing on a blank slate, I believe this\n\napproach would be problematic.          But we are not writing on a blank\n\nslate; an unbroken line of our cases going back over thirty years\n\nforecloses the majority's result.              Thus, because the majority's\n\nconclusion is contrary to our precedent, unwise as a matter of\n\npolicy, and insupportable on this record, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                        I.\n\n               Since at least 1972, we have made clear that grand jury\n\nwitnesses have no general right of access to transcripts of their\n\nprior grand jury testimony.

We have since elaborated on this rule, making just as\n\nclear that fear of future perjury prosecution cannot constitute a\n\ncognizable reason for a witness to have access to a transcript of\n\nhis testimony.      See In Re Bianchi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339148\"><a href=\"/opinion/339148/in-re-leonard-l-bianchi/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1st Cir. 1976)\n\n(citing United States v.

Id.   But\n\nthat comment was made in the context of explaining why the witness\n\nfailed to make the requisite \"strong showing of particularized\n\nneed.\"    The majority attempts to treat this summary comment as\n\nlending   \"some   support    to   the    distinction\"   it   draws     \"between\n\ngranting access and granting a copy.\"           Maj. Op. at 17; see also\n\nMaj. Op. at 12-13 n.3.       But this short aside did not (and indeed\n\ncould not) change the ratio decidendi of our decision in In Re\n\nSpecial Proceedings, which requires that even a non-defendant\n\nwitness make a \"strong showing of particularized need\" for \"access\"\n\nto his own grand jury testimony.\n\n\n12\n The panel majority attempts to avoid the full scope of this\nholding by highlighting the fact that In Re Special Proceedings\narticulated this result as the holding of \"a majority of circuits,\"\nand that our rule is \"similar.\" Maj. Op. at 12-13 n.3 (quoting In\nRe Special Proceedings, 373 F.3d at 47). But the majority neglects\nthe next sentence of In Re Special Proceedings, which makes clear\nthat we too subscribe to the rule in the majority of circuits: \"[a]\nfew circuits take a contrary view . . . but are at odds with\nBianchi.\"   373 F.3d at 47.    It is therefore clear that a fair\nreading of In Re Special Proceedings cannot limit its reach merely\nto copies.\n\n                                    -26-\n\f            Where, as here, the language of a prior panel decision is\n\nperhaps broader than the precise controversy at issue in that prior\n\ndecision, we still give effect to the language of the prior panel\n\ndecision.

The majority attempts to elide decades of case law by\n\ndrawing a distinction between access to prior testimony and the\n\navailability of copies of prior testimony.             But, for the reasons\n\n\n\n\n13\n The majority's second attempt to reconcile its holding with our\nprecedent is equally unavailing. As explained in note 1, the ratio\ndecidendi of In Re Special Proceedings extends to access and does\nnot end with the provision of copies. Consequently, both Awuah and\nHolloway require that the panel use the \"strong showing of\nparticularized need\" standard for access as well as copies.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fdescribed above, unlike in the D.C.

First, in creating\n\nthis less demanding standard, the majority fails to give due weight\n\nto important interests of grand jury secrecy and preventing witness\n\nintimidation, while at the same time, the majority overemphasizes\n\na witness's interest in access to his testimony.       Second, the\n\nmajority's preferred approach will improvidently hamstring the\n\noperation of grand juries.\n\n\n\n14\n The D.C.

Cir.\n2007), is factually distinguishable from the case at bar, and the\nmajority has significantly expanded this precedent in order for its\nrule to encompass cases such as the appellant's. Unlike in In Re\nGrand Jury, where witnesses without immunity testified as many as\nthree times, with months between such testimony, the appellant in\nthis case had immunity. See id. at 980. Moreover, the appellant's\ntestimony was originally continued for one week, and was later\ncontinued for another two weeks to accommodate appellant's counsel.\nAll other delays in this case have resulted from the appellant's\nprotracted efforts to gain access to his prior testimony.\n15\n Our circuit's view of the law finds significant support in the\n\"majority of appellate decisions dealing with this issue.\" In Re\nGrand Jury Subpoena, 72 F.3d at 274-75 (citing Davis v.

The majority dismisses the notion\n\nthat grand jury secrecy is an important interest in this context\n\nbecause grand jury witnesses have no obligation to keep their\n\ntestimony secret.   Although the majority is correct that a witness\n\nis under no obligation to keep his testimony secret, Maj. Op. at 10\n\n(citing In Re Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 988-89), it does not follow\n\nthat permitting a witness access to his own testimony \"does not\n\nexacerbate\" the threat to grand jury secrecy.      Maj. Op. at 17\n\n(emphasis in original).   On the contrary, a witness -- even if he\n\nis denied the ability to review his testimony with counsel -- will\n\nnow have an additional opportunity to think about his testimony and\n\npotentially disclose it.17   Moreover, we can expect that a witness\n\n\n16\n Because of the profound threat the majority's proposed rule poses\nto the efficiency of grand juries, I discuss this interest in Part\nII.B, infra.\n17\n The majority leaves open the question of whether the appellant is\nentitled to have his counsel review the transcript. Maj. Op. at 19\nn.7.   It suffices here to note the district court's ruling on\nremand from the D.C. Circuit, in which the court held that \"the\nexpertise of legal counsel is not necessary for the [witness] to\nassess whether the transcripts reflect inconsistencies or\nfalsehoods that place [the witness] at risk for a perjury\nprosecution or warrant recantation . . . .\" In Re Grand Jury\nProceeding, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1445827\"><a href=\"/opinion/1445827/in-re-grand-jury-proceeding/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (D.D.C. 2007). Moreover, as the\ndistrict court further noted, since attorneys are not permitted in\nthe grand jury room when a witness testifies, it would be anomalous\n\n                                -29-\n\fwill be likely to remember a significantly greater portion of his\n\ntestimony during a private review than while undergoing questioning\n\nbefore the grand jury, making any subsequent disclosure more\n\nproblematic from the standpoint of the important interest in\n\nsecrecy.    Thus, as a practical matter, the majority's rule will\n\nhave an adverse impact on grand jury secrecy.\n\n           Similarly, witness intimidation will almost certainly\n\nincrease under this new standard.          The majority asserts that \"a\n\nwitness granted only access could, in the face of intimidation,\n\nsimply decline to reveal his testimony.\"       Maj. Op. at 16 (citing In\n\nRe Grand Jury, 490 F.3d at 990).        Respectfully, this assertion is\n\nnaive.   The same people who would cajole a witness to obtain a copy\n\nof his testimony and reveal it would be able to use similar methods\n\nto coerce the witness into reviewing his testimony and reporting\n\nits contents.      The majority's claim that a witness can undertake\n\n\"evasive measures\" to avoid commenting on a recollection refreshed\n\nby   a   lengthy    review   of   the   witness's   prior   testimony   is\n\nunpersuasive.      See Maj. Op. at 16 n.5.    As the majority correctly\n\nnotes, such evasive measures are unlikely to succeed with respect\n\nto the existence of a transcript copy; these measures are similarly\n\nlikely to fail when determined individuals demand a witness divulge\n\nthe contents of his testimony. Given that most witnesses will have\n\n\n\nto permit an attorney to be present during a review of                  the\ntranscript. Id. at 64 n.4.\n\n                                    -30-\n\fbetter recollections of their testimony after the opportunity to\n\nreview it in private, a fact that will not elude those seeking\n\nadditional         information,     the     rule   we    are     now    adopting     will\n\nexacerbate the threat of witness intimidation.\n\n                                            2.\n\n              By     contrast,     again     relying     on     the    D.C.    Circuit's\n\napproach, the majority overemphasizes a witness's interest in\n\naccess to his grand jury testimony.                     The guiding light in the\n\nmajority's balancing is a witness's supposed need to ensure that\n\npast testimony is accurate, presumably to innoculate him from\n\ncriminal charges of providing false declarations to the grand jury,\n\nwith secondary consideration for a witness's need to prepare for\n\nfuture testimony where such testimony is spread over several days.\n\nMaj.

Maj.    Op.    at   14    (internal    quotation     marks    omitted).\n\nRather,   the   substantial          protections   available     to   grand      jury\n\nwitnesses   militate      in    favor    of   affording   less    weight    to    the\n\nwitness's interest in obtaining access to grand jury testimony.\n\nConsequently,      the    majority      has   vastly   overstated     a   witness's\n\ninterest in access to prior grand jury testimony, and as a result,\n\n\n\ndoes not follow.    Maj. Op. at 14.    As explained above, because\nother provisions of federal law provide witnesses with significant\nprotections, recantation is not needed to resolve minor\ninconsistencies or slight errors. A witness will have a better\nmemory of the major points of his testimony, and after testifying,\nin consultation with counsel, he will be able to exercise his right\nto recant without a detailed review of the record of his testimony.\nAlthough we require a witness attempting to recant admit that his\ntestimony is false, we have never required any greater level of\ndetail in order to permit recantation.

The majority believes that the\n\ncombination of a prosecutor's use of perjury warnings during\n\nquestioning of a witness and the fact that a witness's testimony\n\ninvolves complex subjects that occurred some time in the past is\n\nsufficient to meet its lower threshold of particularized need.\n\nMaj. Op. at 20, 22.       But all grand jury investigations are\n\nnecessarily retrospective, and they frequently focus on complex\n\nmatters.21   Moreover, through evasive and unresponsive testimony,\n\nany witness could elicit perjury warnings from those questioning\n\nhim.22   Thus, under the majority's standard, any witness who\n\n\n21\n The majority claims \"something more\" is required to meet its\ndiminished standard, Maj. Op. at 22 n.9, but its opinion refers\nonly to perjury warnings, which are appropriate, necessary, and\nencouraged in our case law, see infra note 22, the fact that the\nsubject matter involved technical material, and that some events\noccurred less than ten years in the past. But these are common\ncircumstances and it is likely that many –- if not most –- grand\njury investigations will be encompassed in the ambit of the\nmajority's new rule.\n22\n The majority's decision to consider perjury warnings in\ndetermining whether a witness has satisfied a less demanding\nstandard will inevitably chill prosecutors' proper use of perjury\nwarnings, which is a disservice to prosecutors, witnesses, and the\ngrand jury's quest for the truth. The record in this case reveals\nthat the prosecutors' perjury warnings were limited and\nappropriate. See infra pp. 39-41.\n     These warnings are particularly appropriate in light of our\nprevious expressions of strong displeasure with prosecutors in this\ncircuit who attempt to skirt warnings to grand jury witnesses.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Pancheco-Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532022\"><a href=\"/opinion/532022/united-states-v-francisco-j-pacheco-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\n1989); United States v. Babb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1986). In\ndrawing an adverse inference from four reasonable and appropriate\nperjury warnings, we are acting at cross-purposes with our firm\nguidance regarding warnings in grand juries, and unnecessarily\nburdening prosecutors who legitimately offer appropriate perjury\nwarnings.\n\n                               -35-\n\freceived a perjury warning and testified over several days in a\n\ncomplex case about events occurring in the past, can advance at\n\nleast a strong claim for access to his prior testimony, thereby\n\ncreating precisely the kind of procedural delay the Supreme Court\n\nhas warned against.\n\n          The prosecutors responsible for coordinating the grand\n\njury investigation will now have to defend these claims, which the\n\ndistrict courts will need to adjudicate.23   Handling these tasks\n\nwill inevitably distract prosecutors and judges while delaying and\n\nsometimes even derailing important grand jury investigations. This\n\nproblem is only compounded by the fact that our lenient new test\n\nwill give witnesses every incentive to engage in obstreperous\n\n\n\n23\n The majority claims that its opinion does not require a district\ncourt to review the transcript of grand jury proceedings in all\ncases, Maj. Op. at 23 & n.10, but, under the logic of the\nmajority's analysis, the district court necessarily must review the\ntranscript to determine whether the witness can satisfy the \"less\ndemanding requirement of particularized need.\"      Without such a\nreview, it is difficult to imagine how a district court can\ndetermine whether perjury warnings were sufficiently numerous and\nabusive or a witness's testimony sufficiently complex to justify\nrelief.\n    The majority claims that other procedures, such as witness\ntestimony or proffers and government rebuttal, might allow the\ndistrict court to determine whether a witness has satisfied the\nmajority's lower standard. Maj. Op. at 23. But the district court\nwill be unable to accept as true a witness's statements in this\nposture, see Maj. Op. at 19-20 n.8, and as this case demonstrates,\nwitnesses and prosecutors will disagree sharply over what\ntranspired before the grand jury. Consequently, as a practical\nmatter, a district court will abuse its discretion if it fails to\nreview the transcript of a witness's grand jury testimony to\ndetermine whether the less demanding requirement of particularized\nneed has been satisfied.\n\n                               -36-\n\fconduct in an effort to cause their testimony to continue over to\n\na second day in the hope of gaining access to a transcript.24\n\n            This case is proof that all but the most stringent\n\nstandards of witness access will create slippage that threatens to\n\nundermine   the   orderly       operation       of   grand   juries.      As   these\n\nproceedings demonstrate, witnesses, advocates, and even judges can\n\nand   do    disagree         regarding     a     witness's       evasiveness     and\n\nobstreperousness,       as    well   as    the       propriety   of    prosecutors'\n\nquestioning.      Because such disagreements have the potential to\n\nstymie the efficient operation of grand juries and the interests of\n\nwitnesses are protected under other provisions of federal law, the\n\nSupreme Court and our own precedents require that grand juries be\n\npermitted to pursue their work without the threat of these types of\n\nproceedings.\n\n            Moreover,     the    break     in    the     appellant's    testimony,\n\noccasioned by the need to hear another witness, would have been\n\nabout one week in length had the appellant not delayed it further\n\nfirst to accommodate his counsel, and then again, to wage this\n\n\n\n24\n The majority suggests that \"[a] witness cannot establish a need,\nlet alone a particularized one, if the purported need was self-\ninduced.\" Maj. Op. at 24. The problem, of course, is that the\nneed in this case was self-induced.      The witness responded to\nstraightforward questions with evasive and sometimes misleading\nresponses, which the majority fails to acknowledge. See infra note\n27.   It was these responses to questions (and the prosecutors'\nsensible attempts to follow-up) rather than any particularly\ntechnical details of the testimony that occasioned the witness's\nunease in this case.\n\n                                         -37-\n\fprotracted     battle      over    access.      Indeed,    a    transcript   of   the\n\nappellant's testimony was not available until approximately one\n\nmonth after his initial testimony.              The majority claims that such\n\na one month delay is \"slight\" and will not \"impede an investigation\n\nsignificantly,\" Maj. Op. at 18, but I simply cannot agree.                    Grand\n\njuries are normally limited to eighteen month terms, Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP.    6(g),    and   a     delay    of   one    month     is    hardly   slight    or\n\ninsignificant.       Moreover, the majority's ruling leaves open the\n\nstrong likelihood that there will be multiple witnesses appearing\n\nbefore a single grand jury who may be able to assert a right to\n\nreview grand jury transcripts, which will further degrade a grand\n\njury's ability to execute its functions in an expeditious manner.25\n\nThus, as this case also demonstrates, the majority's rule has\n\nsignificant potential needlessly to saddle grand jury proceedings\n\nwith delay and unnecessarily encrust them with precisely the sorts\n\nof procedural requirements that the Supreme Court has warned\n\nagainst.\n\n                                         III.\n\n              The facts of this case only confirm the adverse effect\n\nthe   majority's     new    standard     will    have   on     the   efficiency   and\n\n\n25\n I can take no comfort in the majority's observation that \"there\nis no evidence that the D.C. Circuit's more lenient rule has had\nany detrimental [e]ffect on grand jury investigations in that\ncircuit,\" Maj. Op. at 18, because no such evidence was offered by\neither party or requested by this court, and in view of the secrecy\nthat properly shrouds grand jury proceedings, such evidence should\nnot be readily discernible.\n\n                                         -38-\n\fexpeditiousness of the grand jury process.          The majority claims\n\nthat threats of perjury prosecution and the complexity of testimony\n\njointly suffice to meet its lower threshold.            Maj. Op. at 20, 22.\n\nBut   the   record   reflects   only   four   perjury    warnings   and    no\n\nparticularly outrageous conduct on the part of the prosecutors, nor\n\ndoes it bear out the majority's claim of complexity.\n\n            During the course of three hours and fifteen minutes of\n\ntestimony, the record reveals only four perjury warnings.                 The\n\nfirst was given at the beginning of the witness's testimony,\n\nreminding him that the use immunity order does not extend to\n\nperjury or obstruction of justice:\n\n            PROSECUTOR: [Y]ou also understand that the\n            order [granting use immunity] does not protect\n            you if you lie, mislead or obstruct this grand\n            jury's investigation, do you understand that?\n\n            WITNESS: I do understand that yes.26\n\n            The second warning was given when a different prosecutor\n\nfirst began questioning the witness:\n\n            PROSECUTOR: All right. Well you know [name\n            redacted] I'm going to caution you, and [the\n            other prosecutor] told you this earlier.\n            Despite the fact that you have received\n            immunity today, if your testimony is designed\n            to mislead this grand jury or is evasive or\n            equivocal, you can be charged with obstruction\n            of justice, do you understand that?\n\n\n26\n Ofttimes, a prosecutor will have more than one purpose for this\nintroductory perjury warning, including the buttressing of the\nwitness's anticipated testimony by suggesting -- through the\nperjury warning -- that the immunized witness has every incentive\nto tell the truth.\n\n                                  -39-\n\f          WITNESS:   I do understand that.\n\n          The third perjury warning was given after the witness\n\noffered a series of evasive answers to straightforward questions:\n\n          PROSECUTOR: No, no. Look. Look, [name of\n          witness redacted], again let's make a --\n          you're here to tell the truth. Okay? This\n          isn't a game. All right? You're not here to\n          defend [third party] or defend your own\n          actions. You have immunity. The only way you\n          get into trouble here is if you lie or mislead\n          this grand jury.     Do you understand this\n          concept?\n\n          WITNESS:   I do.27\n\n          The fourth and final perjury warning was given purely\n\nprophylactically after a two hour lunch break:\n\n\n\n\n27\n The majority relies on a prosecutor's admonition that the lawyers\npresenting and the grand jurors hearing the case were \"laymen\" to\nconclude that the witness's answers were not evasive or\nobstreperous but rather \"highly technical.\" Maj. Op. at 22 n.9.\nWhat the majority overlooks is that the prosecutors in this case\nwere attempting to elicit from the witness basic facts regarding\nwhether a third party was warned of a particular danger, and if so,\nwhen and in what level of detail. The witness claimed that such a\nwarning was provided at a meeting at which he was present, but when\npressed, conceded that the warning was not given at the meeting.\nUnlike the details of a warning, which may be technical, the fact\nof whether a warning was given, and if given, its subject is not\nnormally, and in this case was not \"highly technical.\"          The\nwitness's failure to address this question in a straightforward or\neven consistent manner is one of many examples of his evasiveness.\n     Furthermore, I note that the witness requested and was granted\nthe opportunity to consult with counsel shortly after the exchange\nthe majority describes. This further reinforces my conclusion that\nthe prosecutors were not behaving abusively or attempting to\noverbear the witness.    Instead,   the prosecutors respected the\nwitness's rights and were only interested in eliciting the truth,\nwhich the witness was obfuscating considerably.\n\n                               -40-\n\f          PROSECUTOR: [Name redacted], just to remind\n          you, can you please acknowledge that you\n          understand that you are still under oath?\n\n          WITNESS: I do understand that, yes.\n\n          Other than these warnings reminding the witness that use\n\nimmunity does not extend to perjury or obstruction of justice, the\n\nwords \"perjury,\" \"lie,\" \"obstruct,\" or other similar words and\n\nphrases   appear   in   the   transcript   only   infrequently   and\n\ninconsequentially. The record further clarifies that the few times\n\nthe prosecutors acted in a way that could be characterized as\n\nconfrontational, see Maj. Op. at 20, 22 n.9, the witness was\n\nproviding obviously evasive and non-responsive answers.28\n\n\n\n\n28\n The majority too quickly dismisses the witness's obstreperous\nconduct and his consistently unresponsive and insufficient answers\nto legitimate questions, and the majority further fails to\nacknowledge the obvious systemic harm that flows from such conduct.\nMaj. Op. at 24 n.11. This omission is puzzling in light of the\nmajority's concern for systemic benefits that come from access.\nSee Maj. Op. at 15. When one considers the appellant's conduct in\nthis case, it is clear that any hardship that he has experienced is\n\"self-induced,\" that prosecutors provided him with warnings in\ncompliance with our case law, see supra note 22, and that the\nmajority's new rule will grant witnesses wide latitude to avoid\ncooperating with grand juries and prosecutors searching for the\ntruth.\n     Finally, the fact that I disagree so sharply with the majority\nover what transpired in this case and the severity of the\nprosecutors' perjury warnings reaffirms the wisdom of our decisions\nin Bottari, Bianchi, and Special Proceedings -- consistent with\nSupreme Court precedent -- to avoid such disputes altogether by\napplying a rigorous \"strong showing of particularized need\"\nstandard for all access to grand jury transcripts, while relying on\nthe other substantial protections found in federal law to protect\nthe interests of witnesses.\n\n                                -41-\n\f           In addition, it is important to note that although some\n\nof the substantive subject matter in this case may be technical,\n\nfor the most part, the prosecutors did not dwell on the technical\n\ncomplexities. It is also worth noting that the witness admitted to\n\nhaving reviewed many of the documents pertinent to his testimony\n\nwith his attorney in the days and weeks prior to his testimony.\n\nThis preparation should substantially ameliorate the majority's\n\nconcern regarding both the technical and the \"ancient\" nature of\n\nthe testimony.    Moreover, the witness was given the opportunity to\n\nconsult with counsel, who was available outside of the grand jury\n\nroom, and the record reflects that the witness consulted with\n\ncounsel at least twice, which should further palliate concerns that\n\nanything unfair occurred here.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n           Because I find that the majority's newly invented lesser\n\nstandard of need is inconsistent with our precedent, significantly\n\ndetracts   from   important   interests   of   grand   jury   secrecy   and\n\npreventing witness intimidation, substantially overemphasizes the\n\ninterests of a witness, encrusts grand jury proceedings with\n\nneedless procedural complications, and is insupportable on this\n\nrecord, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -42-\n\f</pre>",
