GONZALEZ,\n\n                     Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n      THE JUSTICES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF BOSTON ET AL.,\n\n                     Respondents, Appellees.\n\n\n         ON REMAND FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                Porfilio,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Robert W. Hagopian on supplemental brief for appellant.\n     Thomas   F.  Reilly,   Attorney   General,  Commonwealth   of\nMassachusetts, and David M. Lieber, Assistant Attorney General, on\nsupplemental brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         August 24, 2005\n\n\n__________\n*Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.       In Gonzalez v. Justices of the\n\nMunicipal Court, 382 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), we affirmed the\n\ndistrict court's denial of petitioner-appellant Jorge J. Gonzalez's\n\nrequest for federal habeas relief from a pending state prosecution.\n\nConcluding that an initial proceeding based on the same complaint\n\nhad not resulted in an acquittal within the cognizance of the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause, we held that the pending prosecution did\n\nnot compromise the petitioner's right not to be twice put in\n\njeopardy for the same offense.        See id. at 10-12.     The petitioner\n\nrepaired to the United States Supreme Court, where he filed a\n\npetition for a writ of certiorari.         That petition argued, inter\n\nalia, that the initial proceeding had terminated in an acquittal\n\nand, thus, triggered double jeopardy concerns.\n\n            While the certiorari petition was pending, the Court\n\ndecided Smith v. Massachusetts, 125 S. Ct. 1129 (2005), a case that\n\npresented   a   variant   of   the   question   of   what   constitutes   an\n\nacquittal for double jeopardy purposes.              There, the Justices\n\nconcluded that the state court's midtrial grant of the defendant's\n\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25(a)\n\n(known colloquially as a required finding of not guilty) was an\n\nacquittal within the cognizance of the Double Jeopardy Clause\n\nbecause it had emanated from the trial court's evaluation of the\n\nevidence and, accordingly, constituted \"a substantive determination\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthat the prosecution ha[d] failed to carry its burden.\"             Id. at\n\n1134.\n\n           Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court granted Gonzalez's\n\npetition for certiorari pro forma, vacated our judgment, and\n\nremanded the case for consideration in light of Smith. Gonzalez v.\n\nJustices of the Mun. Ct., 125 S. Ct. 1640 (2005) (mem.).                We\n\ndirected the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the\n\neffect (if any) of Smith on our prior decision.         Having studied the\n\ndecision in Smith and the parties' submissions, we reinstate our\n\nearlier judgment.\n\n           Our prior opinion chronicles the factual and procedural\n\nbackground of the case, see Gonzalez, 382 F.3d at 2-5, and it would\n\nserve no useful purpose to rehearse those details here.           Instead,\n\nwe assume the reader's familiarity with our original opinion and\n\nmove directly to the implications of the remand order.             We then\n\nexamine what effect, if any, Smith may have upon the conclusions we\n\nreached in Gonzalez.\n\n           We are required to revisit this case because of the\n\nSupreme Court's use of a procedure known as a \"GVR\" — an acronym\n\ncommonly   used   to   describe   the   steps   of   granting   certiorari,\n\nvacating the judgment below, and remanding a case to the lower\n\ncourt for further consideration.          See, e.g., Stutson v. United\n\nStates, 516 U.S. 193, 194 (1996); Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U.S. 163,\n\n165-66 (1996).    In Lawrence, the Court noted that the occasion for\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fa GVR order typically arises \"[w]here intervening developments . .\n\n. reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests\n\nupon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the\n\nopportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that\n\nsuch a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the\n\nlitigation.\"     516 U.S. at 167.\n\n           It is important to remember, however, that a GVR order is\n\nneither an outright reversal nor an invitation to reverse; it is\n\nmerely a device that allows a lower court that had rendered its\n\ndecision without the benefit of an intervening clarification to\n\nhave an opportunity to reconsider that decision and, if warranted,\n\nto revise or correct it.     See Pratt v. Philbrook, 109 F.3d 18, 19-\n\n20 (1st Cir. 1997).     The GVR order itself does not constitute a\n\nfinal   determination   on   the      merits;    it   does   not   even   carry\n\nprecedential weight.     See Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 666 n.6\n\n(2001); Henry v. City of Rock Hill, 376 U.S. 776, 777 (1964); see\n\nalso Lawrence, 516 U.S. at 178 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (suggesting\n\nthat the GVR ought to be termed \"no fault V & R\" because it\n\nrepresents   a   \"vacation   of   a   judgment    and   remand     without   any\n\ndetermination of error in the judgment below\").              Consequently, we\n\ndo not treat the Court's GVR order as a thinly-veiled direction to\n\nalter our course; rather, the order recognizes — as do we — that\n\nthe Smith decision is pertinent and requires us to determine\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwhether anything that the Smith Court said demands a different\n\nresult.\n\n          The scope of our reconsideration is limited.         As a\n\ngeneral rule, \"when the Supreme Court remands in a civil case, the\n\ncourt of appeals should confine its ensuing inquiry to matters\n\ncoming within the specified scope of the remand.\"     Kotler v. Am.\n\nTobacco Co., 981 F.2d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1992).    While we retain the\n\npower \"to reexamine an issue that lies beyond the circumference of\n\nthe Supreme Court's specific order,\" the petitioner here has relied\n\nsolely on the perceived commonalities between his case and Smith in\n\nhis supplemental brief.   There is, therefore, no reason to enlarge\n\nthe scope of our review beyond the Court's direction to reconsider\n\nour original decision in light of Smith.1\n\n          Like Gonzalez, Smith arose from a criminal proceeding in\n\na Massachusetts trial court.    The Commonwealth had indicted Smith\n\non three counts, including a charge of unlawful possession of a\n\nfirearm. A jury trial commenced and, after the prosecution rested,\n\nthe defendant moved under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25(a) for a required\n\nfinding of not guilty on the firearms count, arguing that the\n\nCommonwealth had not proved an essential element of the offense.\n\nSmith, 125 S. Ct. at 1132.   At sidebar, the trial judge granted the\n\n\n\n     1\n      In carrying out that mission, our standard of review is\nunchanged. See Gonzalez, 382 F.3d at 7 (stating that this court\nwould defer to the state court's findings of fact but would\nundertake plenary review of its resolution of issues of law).\n\n                                 -5-\n\fmotion, agreeing that the prosecution had not introduced sufficient\n\nevidence to prove that element.         Id. at 1132-33.       The judge\n\nendorsed her ruling on the docket but did not notify the jury of\n\nthe acquittal on the count in question.       Id. at 1133.\n\n          Smith then presented a defense to the two remaining\n\ncharges. After both sides had rested but before closing arguments,\n\nthe Commonwealth renewed its objection to the judgment of acquittal\n\non the firearms charge and called the judge's attention to a\n\npreviously unmentioned precedent.      Id.   The judge, announcing that\n\nshe was \"reversing\" her earlier ruling, granted the Commonwealth's\n\nrequest to defer the sufficiency of the evidence determination\n\nuntil after the verdict.   Id.   The jury proceeded to convict Smith\n\non all three counts and the judge allowed the verdict to stand.\n\nId.\n\n          After exhausting avenues of appellate review available in\n\nthe state courts, Smith sought a writ of certiorari from the United\n\nStates Supreme Court.   He posited that the trial court's grant of\n\nthe Rule 25(a) motion at sidebar was an acquittal and that its\n\nlater submission of the firearms count to the jury subjected him to\n\n\"postacquittal factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence\"\n\nin violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.           See id. at 1134\n\n(quoting Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U.S. 140, 145 (1986)).\n\n          The Court granted certiorari and, in a 5-4 decision,\n\nreversed Smith's conviction on the firearms charge.          The Court's\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fanalysis of \"whether the judge's initial ruling on petitioner's\n\nmotion was, in fact, a judgment of acquittal,\" id., grounds our\n\ninquiry.    Significantly,      the   Smith   Court   did   not    purport   to\n\nunsettle the foundations of what constitutes an acquittal for\n\ndouble jeopardy purposes but, rather, relied on the traditional\n\ndefinition, which equates such an acquittal with a disposition that\n\n\"actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all\n\nof the factual elements of the offense charged.\"                  Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 571\n\n(1977)).\n\n           The Court rejected the Commonwealth's effort to draw\n\ndistinctions   for     double    jeopardy     purposes      based     on     the\n\ncharacterization of a finding of insufficiency of the evidence as\n\na legal rather than a factual determination and held that a finding\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law is a\n\nresolution of the factual elements of the charge.           See id. at 1134-\n\n35.   It emphasized that \"the judge 'evaluated the [Commonwealth's]\n\nevidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain\n\na conviction.'\"      Id. at 1135 (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nMartin Linen, 430 U.S. at 572).\n\n           Seen in this light, it is readily evident that Smith did\n\nnot alter the definition of an acquittal previously articulated by\n\nthe Court in Martin Linen.            To the contrary, the Smith Court\n\nconfirmed that definition.       See id. at 1134 (explaining that \"a\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fsubstantive determination that the prosecution has failed to carry\n\nits   burden,\"   made   by   the    judge        pursuant   to    a    procedure    for\n\nrendering a directed verdict of acquittal, is an acquittal for\n\ndouble jeopardy purposes).          There was no serious question in Smith\n\nabout whether the trial judge had, in the ordinary course of\n\nbusiness,    entered    a    judgment       of    acquittal       at   sidebar;     the\n\nperplexing question was whether that acquittal was open to later\n\nrevision by the trial court.          See id. at 1135.           The Supreme Court\n\nconcluded that it was not.          Id. at 1137.\n\n            We   followed    the    same    general     approach        in   Gonzalez.\n\nThere, we relied on the Martin Linen definition and applied the\n\nsame language from that case to determine whether the trial court's\n\nactions had resulted in what amounted to an acquittal for double\n\njeopardy purposes.      See Gonzalez, 382 F.3d at 10-11.                 Thus, Smith\n\nbears witness to the fact that we applied the correct definition of\n\nan acquittal. The only question that remains, then, is whether the\n\nsimilarities     between     this    case     and    Smith       indicate    that   we\n\nmisapplied the Martin Linen definition of an acquittal.                      We answer\n\nthat question in the negative because this case is factually\n\ndistinct from Smith in relevant respects.\n\n            To be sure, both cases involved a request, made in\n\naccordance with Massachusetts procedural rules, for a required\n\nfinding of not guilty and the trial judge's subsequent granting of\n\nthat request.    But the similarities end there.              In Smith, there was\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fno doubt that when the trial judge entertained the Rule 25(a)\n\nmotion at sidebar, her examination involved a genuine effort to\n\ndetermine the sufficiency of the evidence presented.               See Smith,\n\n125 S. Ct. at 1132-33.       There was no suggestion that the judge's\n\nfinding was anything other than what it appeared to be:             a merits-\n\ndirected   finding   of    not   guilty   predicated   on    the    perceived\n\ninsufficiency of the prosecution's evidence.         Right or wrong, that\n\nfinding resulted in a bona fide acquittal.\n\n           Here, however, the trial court's \"finding\" had no basis\n\nin any assessment of the legal sufficiency of the facts presented.\n\nIndeed, no facts of any relevance to the defendant's guilt or\n\ninnocence were presented. The sole witness, called by the defense,\n\nwas the petitioner's daughter, who possessed no knowledge relevant\n\nto the charged crimes.       See Gonzalez, 382 F.3d at 10.           Taking a\n\nfunctional   approach     comporting   with   the   Martin   Linen    Court's\n\ninstruction that we determine whether \"the ruling of the judge,\n\nwhatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or\n\nnot\" of the sufficiency of the factual elements of the case, 430\n\nU.S. at 571 (emphasis supplied), we concluded that the so-called\n\nacquittal was a sheep in wolf's clothing — \"an artifice designed to\n\ndress a dismissal without prejudice in a raiment more protective of\n\na possible double jeopardy defense.\"          Gonzalez, 382 F.3d at 10.\n\n           Refined to bare essence, we concluded that Martin Linen's\n\nfunctional approach to the task of characterizing a trial court's\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdetermination as an acquittal vel non counseled against our taking\n\nthe judge's ukase at face value.        See id.   Because the judge had\n\nlabeled what was (and should have been) a dismissal for want of\n\nprosecution as a required finding of not guilty, and thus had\n\nmanufactured a pseudo-acquittal, we refused to accord that pseudo-\n\nacquittal preclusive effect for double jeopardy purposes.         Id. at\n\n10.\n\n           While the Supreme Court may ultimately determine that the\n\nlanguage in Martin Linen, 430 U.S. at 571, though suggesting a\n\nfunctional approach to the characterization of actions that might\n\nbe deemed an acquittal, should not be so read, nothing in Smith\n\nspeaks either to that question or to the more specific question of\n\nhow   to   characterize   a   dismissal    for    want   of   prosecution\n\ndeliberately and misleadingly packaged as a judgment of acquittal.\n\nNor does Smith suggest any potential limits on Martin Linen's\n\nfunctional approach.      Therefore, Smith neither contradicts nor\n\nundermines our application of the Martin Linen definition of an\n\nacquittal.2\n\n           We need go no further.   Because Smith does not indicate\n\nthat our original decision rested on a faulty premise, we adhere to\n\n\n\n      2\n      Because we conclude that Smith, fairly read, does not alter\nour determination that the state court proceedings in this case did\nnot result in an acquittal, we need not address the related\nquestion, taken up in Smith, 125 S. Ct. at 1135-37, as to when an\nacquittal, once issued, might be deemed \"automatically, or even\npresumptively, nonfinal,\" id. at 1137.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthat decision and once again affirm the district court's denial of\n\nthe petitioner's request for habeas relief.   Our earlier judgment\n\nmust, therefore, be reinstated.\n\n\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

Consequently, we must address a series of related questions, some of apparent first impression, about the nature of the habeas proceeding, its statutory underpinnings, and the applicable standard of review. Once those issues are resolved, our attention shifts to the merits of the petitioner's double jeopardy claim. Here too the circumstances are out of the ordinary: the case turns on whether a disposition labeled by the state trial judge as an acquittal should be regarded as such for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause despite having been characterized by the state supreme court as resulting from a \"sham trial.\" Although the question is close, we answer it in the negative and, accordingly, affirm the district court's refusal to grant a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than four years ago, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts charged the petitioner with (i) distribution of a Class A controlled substance (heroin) and (ii) trafficking in that substance within 1,000 feet of a school. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167;&#167; 32, 32J. On May 1, 2000, a justice of the BMC held a pretrial conference, during which the Commonwealth agreed to provide the petitioner with evidence concerning drug analysis and school distance measurements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because the petitioner was on probation at the time of his arrest, the state judge scheduled both a probation surrender hearing and a trial on the merits for June 8, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of June 8, both sides reported that they were ready for trial. The probation surrender hearing ensued. After receiving into evidence drug analysis certificates and police testimony detailing the circumstances of the petitioner's arrest, the presiding judge determined that the Commonwealth had failed to prove a violation of the terms of the petitioner's probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties returned for the merits trial that afternoon. Before the trial began, the petitioner filed a motion in limine seeking the exclusion of all evidence concerning drug analysis and school distance measurements. He predicated this motion on the ground that the prosecution had not disclosed this evidence to the defense in a timely manner (i.e., as per the disclosure deadline fixed at the pretrial conference). The prosecutor offered to furnish the relevant data immediately. The judge responded that this offer was \"not good enough\" and granted the motion in limine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ruling effectively gutted the Commonwealth's case. In light of it, the prosecutor informed the court that she was no longer ready for trial. The judge announced that the case would nonetheless proceed as scheduled. <i>See Commonwealth v. Super,</i> 431 Mass. 492, 727 N.E.2d 1175, 1181 (2000) (concluding \"that there is no requirement that the prosecution answer ready for trial as a condition precedent to commencing a criminal trial\"). The prosecutor could have nol-prossed the case or attempted to file an interlocutory appeal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but she took neither of these steps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner waived his right to a jury trial, and the judge instructed the prosecutor to call her first witness. The prosecutor demurred, again explaining that she could not go forward because of the court's allowance of the motion in limine. Defense counsel then moved for a judgment of acquittal (in state court parlance, a required finding of not guilty). The prosecutor reiterated her objection to proceeding further and suggested that the court dismiss the case for noncompliant discovery. The trial judge promptly took the bull by the horns and interjected:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n order for the motion for required finding of not guilty to be allowed, there has to be a witness called and a witness sworn in in this matter. Otherwise there is no jeopardy that attaches and this matter would be basically dismissal without prejudice at this point. So if counsel wishes to call a witness in this matter, that's up to counsel....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel took the hint. She immediately called the petitioner's daughter to the witness stand. Although there is no suggestion in the record that the daughter had been a percipient witness to the events underlying the criminal complaints, this lack of knowledge proved not to be an impediment. The lawyer only asked the witness to state her name and to declare whether she knew the petitioner. After the witness replied in kind,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the lawyers eschewed any additional questioning. Neither side called any further witnesses, and the petitioner renewed his motion for a required finding of not guilty.

Gen. Laws ch. 211, &#167; 3. The SJC accepted the Commonwealth's application and, on July 1, 2002, vacated both the exclusion order and the judgment. <i>Commonwealth v. Gonzalez,</i> 437 Mass. 276, 771 N.E.2d 134, 136 (2002) (<i>Gonzalez I</i>). In the SJC's view, the exclusion order was erroneous because no definitive date for disclosure had been specified; defense counsel had not exercised due diligence in endeavoring to obtain the evidence; there was no indication that the prosecution had acted in bad faith; and in all events, no prejudice had been shown. <i>Id.</i> at 138. The SJC further found that the effects of this \"error [were] exacerbated by the judge's lightning rush to sanction the Commonwealth, and then immediately to call the case to trial, in an effort unjustly to deprive the Commonwealth of its right to pursue an interlocutory appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> On the constitutional issue, the SJC concluded that \"[b]ecause there was no trial on the merits, and no risk of the defendant's conviction, jeopardy did not attach.\" <i>Id.</i> at 140. Characterizing the BMC proceeding as a \"sham trial,\" <i>id.</i> at 142, the court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings on the existing complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez unsuccessfully petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. <i>Gonzalez v. Massachusetts,</i> 538 U.S. 962, 123 S.Ct. 1748, 155 L.Ed.2d 514 (2003). He then repaired to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. There he made three filings: a petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on an alleged double jeopardy violation, a motion to stay proceedings in the BMC, and a motion for injunctive relief pendente lite. He named as respondents the Justices of the BMC, the Massachusetts Attorney General, and the Suffolk County District Attorney (hereinafter collectively the Commonwealth). The district court issued an order temporarily blocking further prosecution of the state criminal charges. In due course, however, the court found the habeas petition wanting. <i>Gonzalez v. Justices of Municipal Court,</i> Civ.A. No. 03-10859, 2003 WL 22937727 (D.Mass. Nov.25, 2003) (<i>Gonzalez II</i>). The court discerned \"no reason to quarrel\" with the SJC's characterization of the original proceeding as a sham trial. <i>Id.</i> at *4. It specifically noted that there had been no presentation of evidence concerning any of the factual elements of the criminal charges and, thus, \"there was no risk to the defendant that he would be found guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the district court not only refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus but also dissolved the stay that it previously had issued. <i>Id.</i> at *5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed to this court and sought a further stay of the state criminal proceedings. When the Commonwealth agreed to postpone any trial in the BMC until after the termination of this appeal, we denied the petitioner's request for a stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Briefing and oral argument followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary point, we pause to ponder a pertinent puzzle posed by the procedural posture of the present proceeding. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. In this case, the petitioner originally premised the district court's jurisdiction on a smorgasbord of statutes, including 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2241 and 2254. In time, he narrowed his jurisdictional claim to section 2241 (the general habeas provision). He reasoned that section 2241 was a suitable vehicle for redressing the perceived wrongs because that provision offers habeas relief to any person who \"is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c)(3). Conversely, he viewed section 2254&#8212;section 2241's more famous relative&#8212;as inapplicable because that statute requires a state habeas petitioner to be \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2254(a)&#8212; a description that does not fit his circumstances. The Commonwealth took the opposite position, but the court below agreed with the petitioner on this point. <i>See Gonzalez II,</i> 2003 WL 22937727, at *3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the Commonwealth continues to insist that section 2254 controls the case at hand. It claims that the petitioner is \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\" because the SJC's reinstatement of the state criminal proceedings is the proximate cause of the petitioner's current custody. The question of which statute governs is not merely of taxonomic interest; the classification matters because, as we shall see, it influences the applicable standard of federal court review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both section 2241 and section 2254, there is an \"in custody\" requirement. To be in custody for purposes of either statute, a person need not be actually incarcerated. <i>See Jones v. Cunningham,</i> 371 U.S. 236, 240, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963); <i>Jackson v. Coalter,</i> 337 F.3d 74, 78-79 (1st Cir.2003). The requirement may be satisfied if the petitioner is subject to state-imposed \"restraints not shared by the public generally.\" <i>Jones,</i> 371 U.S. at 240, 83 S.Ct. 373.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the petitioner has been released on personal recognizance, subject to certain conditions that restrain his liberty in a way not shared by the public generally. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, &#167;&#167; 58, 82A. He therefore meets the \"in custody\" requirement. <i>See Justices of BMC v. Lydon,</i> 466 U.S. 294, 300-01, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984) (holding that a petitioner who had been released on personal recognizance pending retrial in the court was \"in custody\" for purposes of federal habeas relief). Against that backdrop, we turn to the problem of identifying the nature of the instant proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the Commonwealth's position. A fundamental purpose of section 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, &#167; 104, 110 Stat. 1214, 1218-19 (1996), is to ensure that federal courts accord due deference to state court judgments. Here, unlike in most pretrial situations, there is a state court judgment to which the provisions of section 2254 theoretically could attach. The Commonwealth argues that a textual reading of the statute supports jurisdiction in this case because \"if section 2254 were intended to apply only to post-trial situations, it would refer to persons held in custody pursuant to a `conviction' of a state court, rather than to persons held in custody pursuant to a `judgment' of a state court.\" Respondents' Br. at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the Commonwealth's interpretation. In view of the plain language of the two statutory provisions, the travel of this case leads inexorably to the conclusion that section 2241 controls. The SJC judgment set aside the required finding of not guilty and reinstated the case for further proceedings before the BMC on the existing complaints. <i>Gonzalez I,</i> 437 Mass. at 285, 771 N.E.2d 134. Those further proceedings have yet to take place. As one awaiting trial on state criminal charges, the petitioner is not in custody pursuant to the SJC's judgment. Rather, he is in custody as a result of the BMC's personal recognizance order, and that is the custody which he alleges violates the Constitution. Seen in that light, his petition is squarely within the maw of section 2241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the BMC proceeding would be over and done with (and, thus, the recognizance order would be a dead letter) were it not for the SJC's judgment. But that is irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes. Unless we are prepared to adopt a protean rule of \"but for\" causation in this context&#8212;and we are not&#8212;the plain language of the statutory scheme dictates that the petitioner's case must be adjudicated within the confines of section 2241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law confirms this intuition. Although we find little guidance in our own reported decisions, <i>see, e.g., Jackson,</i> 337 F.3d at 79 (raising, but not resolving, a question as to whether a pretrial detainee was correct in filing for habeas relief under section 2254), the precedents elsewhere are uniform. Several other courts of appeals have decided, on sufficiently analogous facts, that section 2241&#8212;not section 2254&#8212;applies. <i>See, e.g., Jacobs v. McCaughtry,</i> 251 F.3d 596, 597-98 (7th Cir.2001) (per curiam); <i>Stringer v. Williams,</i> 161 F.3d 259, 261-62 (5th Cir.1998); <i>Mars v. Mounts,</i> 895 F.2d 1348, 1351 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990). The Commonwealth does nothing to discredit, and little to counter, this impressive array of authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's principal effort to find support in the case law revolves around the decision in <i>Harpster v. Ohio,</i> 128 F.3d 322 (6th Cir.1997). That decision, carefully read, lends no assistance to the Commonwealth's cause. The <i>Harpster</i> court simply analyzed the habeas petition before it in accordance with section 2254 without any discussion of whether that section or section 2241 actually controlled. <i>See id.</i> at 326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily. We hold that jurisdiction in this case was properly premised on 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, this determination dictates the standard of review. Prior to the enactment of the AEDPA, federal courts sitting in habeas jurisdiction typically deferred to state court findings of fact but reviewed conclusions of law de novo. <i>See Townsend v. Sain,</i> 372 U.S. 293, 318, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1994). Courts applied this standard of review indiscriminately to petitions brought under both sections 2241 and 2254. <i>See, e.g., Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 (reviewing a section 2254 petition); <i>United States ex rel. Hall v. Illinois,</i> 329 F.2d 354, 356-57 (7th Cir.1964) (reviewing a section 2241 petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, the AEDPA ushered in a new, particularized framework for adjudicating certain habeas cases. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 104-132 &#167; 104, 110 Stat. 1214, 1218-19 (1996). That mode of review is quite respectful of state court judgments. <i>See, e.g., Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <i>Mastracchio v. Vose,</i> 274 F.3d 590, 596-98 (1st Cir.2001). Yet Congress chose to insert the new review framework in section 2254 without mentioning section 2241. <i>Compare</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)-(e) (describing the conditions under which a federal court may grant an \"application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"), <i>with id.</i> &#167; 2241 (containing no descriptive conditions). The AEDPA left section 2241 unscathed and unchanged, and there are no cross-references in the new version of section 2254 to section 2241. Nor does the legislative history contain any indication of a congressional intention to apply the neoteric review standards to section 2241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the well-settled rule that when \"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 173, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). That principle militates strongly in favor of a conclusion that the AEDPA's review standards should govern only those habeas petitions cognizable under section 2254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the logic of this position, the only court of appeals that appears to have confronted the issue has, without any deliberate analysis, simply applied the AEDPA standard to section 2241 petitions. <i>See Powell v. Ray,</i> 301 F.3d 1200, 1201 (10th Cir.2002) (citing other Tenth Circuit cases), <i>cert. denied,</i> 538 U.S. 927, 123 S.Ct. 1578, 155 L.Ed.2d 321 (2003). With respect, we are inclined to believe that this approach is incorrect and that section 2241 maintains its historical posture, evoking de novo review as to state courts' conclusions of law. Thus, we proceed on the assumption that we, as a federal habeas court reviewing a petition under section 2241, must defer to the SJC's findings of fact, <i>see Sumner v. Mata,</i> 455 U.S. 591, 591-92, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) (per curiam), but must undertake plenary review of that court's resolution of issues of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause guarantees that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. Through the instrumentality of the Fourteenth Amendment, the prophylaxis of the Double Jeopardy Clause extends to state prosecutions. <i>Benton v. Maryland,</i> 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). The Clause \"protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense.\" <i>Lydon,</i> 466 U.S. at 306-07, 104 S.Ct. 1805. The petitioner invoked the first of these three prongs. That safeguard \"restrains the government from using its power and resources to subject a defendant to serial prosecutions, thus prolonging his ordeal and unfairly enhancing the prospect of his ultimate conviction.\" <i>United States v. Toribio-Lugo,</i> 376 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Green v. United States,</i> 355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, the petitioner maintains that the original BMC proceeding constituted a full trial, resulting in an acquittal; retrial would, therefore, place him twice in jeopardy for the same offenses. The Commonwealth resists this appraisal. It joins the SJC in labeling the proceeding a sham that bore none of the hallmarks of a true acquittal. Retrial would, therefore, not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resolving this type of dispute, the Supreme Court has implicitly endorsed a twofold inquiry. <i>See, e.g., Richardson v. United States,</i> 468 U.S. 317, 325, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984); <i>Lydon,</i> 466 U.S. at 309, 104 S.Ct. 1805. First, a reviewing court must determine whether jeopardy attached in the original state court proceeding. If it did, the court must then ask whether the state court terminated jeopardy in a way that prevents reprosecution. <i>See</i> 15B Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3919.5, at 637 (2d ed. 1992 &amp; Supp.2004). Unless both of these queries generate affirmative answers, the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy does not bar reprosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the sequence of events, it is at least arguable that the initial inquiry should be answered in the negative. The Supreme Court has described the precise moment that jeopardy attaches in a bench trial in various ways. <i>Compare, e.g., Serfass v. United States,</i> 420 U.S. 377, 388, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975) (focusing on when the court begins to hear evidence), <i>with, e.g., Crist v. Bretz,</i> 437 U.S. 28, 37 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978) (focusing on when the first witness is sworn). The former phrasing&#8212;\"when the court begins to hear evidence\"&#8212;is the most frequently invoked. <i>See</i> 15B Federal Practice and Procedure, <i>supra</i> &#167; 3919.6, at 700 (collecting cases); 21 Am.Jur.2d <i>Crim. Law</i> &#167; 338 (1998 &amp; Supp.2004) (same). Regardless of phraseology, this requirement seems to have been met in a technical or superficial sense here; prior to the entry of judgment, the petitioner's daughter took the witness stand and testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, treating that event as conclusive on the issue elevates form over substance. This is significant because a long line of cases teaches that jeopardy connotes risk. <i>See, e.g., Abney v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 661, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977); <i>Breed v. Jones,</i> 421 U.S. 519, 528, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975); <i>Price v. Georgia,</i> 398 U.S. 323, 329, 90 S.Ct. 1757, 26 L.Ed.2d 300 (1970). No less an authority than the Supreme Court itself has decreed that \"[w]ithout risk of a determination of guilt, jeopardy does not attach, and neither an appeal nor further prosecution constitutes double jeopardy.\" <i>Serfass,</i> 420 U.S. at 391-92, 95 S.Ct. 1055; <i>accord United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,</i> 430 U.S. 564, 569, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977) (\"The protections afforded by the [Double Jeopardy] Clause are implicated only when the accused has <i>actually</i> been placed in jeopardy.\" (emphasis supplied)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What transpired before the BMC hardly can be said to have imposed any risk of conviction on the petitioner. The chronology of the proceeding indicates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the risk of a guilty finding was, as a practical matter, non-existent. The prosecutor repeatedly refused to move for trial and apprised the court that she had no evidence with which to mount a prosecution at that point in time. The judge, for his part, assured the petitioner, in so many words, that he (the petitioner) faced no risk of conviction. Indeed, after defense counsel made his initial request for a judgment of acquittal, the judge conducted an impromptu tutorial on what he thought were the steps necessary to ensure that the requested disposition would preclude further prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a witness was sworn and evidence taken during the effort to tailor the proceeding to the measurements of the double jeopardy bar does not alter the reality that the petitioner was never in actual danger of conviction. Where the only evidence received does not subject a defendant to any real risk that he will be found guilty, courts sometimes have held that jeopardy does not attach. <i>See, e.g., Aleman v. Hon. Judges of the Circuit Court,</i> 138 F.3d 302, 307-09 (7th Cir.1998) (concluding that defendant who secured an acquittal by bribing the trial judge was never in jeopardy \"because he was never truly at risk of conviction\"); <i>United States v. Olson,</i> 751 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (holding that jeopardy did not attach when trial court merely heard proffers of evidence because the court \"did so without subjecting [defendant] to the risk that he would be found guilty\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result makes eminently good sense. The rule that jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence stems partially from the knowledge that, in almost all cases, the first evidence heard will emanate from the mouth of a witness tapped by the prosecution. <i>See Newman v. United States,</i> 410 F.2d 259, 260 (D.C.Cir.1969) (per curiam); <i>People v. Deems,</i> 81 Ill.2d 384, 43 Ill.Dec. 8, 410 N.E.2d 8, 11 (Ill.1980). This act is an affirmative step by the government into the trial&#8212;a step that places the defendant at actual risk of conviction. Once that step is taken, jeopardy attaches and there is no turning back.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the contrast is stark. The only person sworn in the petitioner's case was a witness whom he selected and the only evidence heard was totally unrelated to any issue in the case. Consequently, we think it likely that jeopardy never attached in the BMC proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having said this much about the attachment of jeopardy, we stop short of definitively resolving the point. Even were we to assume for argument's sake that jeopardy did attach, the petitioner would face a second hurdle. On these facts, we deem that hurdle insurmountable. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.\" <i>Serfass,</i> 420 U.S. at 390, 95 S.Ct. 1055 (quoting <i>Illinois v. Somerville,</i> 410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973)). To succeed on a double jeopardy challenge, the defendant also must show that the court in the original proceeding terminated jeopardy in a way that makes retrial constitutionally impermissible. <i>See Richardson,</i> 468 U.S. at 325, 104 S.Ct. 3081; <i>Lydon,</i> 466 U.S. at 309, 104 S.Ct. 1805. That requirement is not satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is settled beyond serious question that an acquittal bars further prosecution of a defendant for the same offense, it is not always apparent what judicial action constitutes an acquittal for this purpose. <i>See</i> 15B Federal Practice and Procedure, <i>supra</i> &#167; 3919.5, at 637. We do know, however, that the word \"acquittal,\" in and of itself, enjoys no talismanic significance. <i>Serfass,</i> 420 U.S. at 392, 95 S.Ct. 1055. An acquittal involves \"a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at the trial relating to the general issue of the case.\" <i>United States v. Sisson,</i> 399 U.S. 267, 290 n. 19, 90 S.Ct. 2117, 26 L.Ed.2d 608 (1970). The appropriate inquiry is functional, not semantic. Thus, an inquiring court is duty bound to ascertain \"whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" <i>Martin Linen Supply,</i> 430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349; <i>accord United States v. Scott,</i> 437 U.S. 82, 97, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, an examination of the record discloses that the BMC proceeding did not end in an acquittal, as that word has been defined by the Supreme Court. As said, the lone witness called was the petitioner's daughter. There is no basis for suggesting that she possessed any information relevant to the pending criminal charges. <i>See Gonzalez II,</i> 2003 WL 22937727, at *2 n. 1. Her testimony spoke neither to the factual elements of the offenses charged nor to the general issue of the case. By the same token, the trial judge disposed of the case on a basis wholly unrelated to the petitioner's factual guilt or innocence. Thus, despite the nomenclature that the judge employed the proceeding was merely an artifice designed to dress a dismissal without prejudice in a raiment more protective of a possible double jeopardy defense. That sort of masquerade, perpetrated by the judge's incantation of a few magic words,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> cannot suffice to transmogrify an ordinary trial vicissitude into an injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most judges play by the rules and, fortunately, manipulation of this sort is a rare occurrence. Cases on point are, therefore, hard to find. We have, however, located a string of decisions in the Illinois state courts that conclude, on analogous facts, that such a mislabeled \"acquittal\" is not an acquittal at all for double jeopardy purposes. <i>See, e.g., People v. Rudi,</i> 103 Ill.2d 216, 82 Ill.Dec. 936, 469 N.E.2d 580, 583-84 (1984) (discerning no double jeopardy bar when the prosecution had refused to present evidence after its request for a continuance had been denied, the defendant was sworn, and the judge entered a finding of not guilty without taking any testimony); <i>Deems,</i> 43 Ill.Dec. 8, 410 N.E.2d at 10-11 (similar); <i>People v. Verstat,</i> 112 Ill.App.3d 90, 67 Ill.Dec. 691, 444 N.E.2d 1374, 1380 (1983) (deciding that acquittals amounted to appealable dismissals when the trial judge denied the prosecution's requests for continuance, swore in the defendants, asked only their names and addresses, and found them not guilty); <i>People v. Edwards,</i> 97 Ill.App.3d 407, 52 Ill.Dec. 908, 422 N.E.2d 1117, 1119-20 (1981) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the petitioner directs our attention to the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>Goolsby v. Hutto,</i> 691 F.2d 199 (4th Cir. 1982). While that panel did find a double jeopardy violation on similar facts, <i>see id.</i> at 202, the decision makes no attempt to determine \"whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represent[ed] a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" <i>Martin Linen Supply,</i> 430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349. Without any such inquiry, we do not find <i>Goolsby</i> persuasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also seeks shelter under the umbrella of <i>Fong Foo v. U.S. Standard Coil Prods. Co.,</i> 369 U.S. 141, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962) (per curiam). In that case, the Justices ruled that directed verdicts of acquittal entered by a trial judge after seven days of testimony were final and, even though those acquittals were \"based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,\" could not be reviewed without putting the defendants twice in jeopardy. <i>Id.</i> at 143, 82 S.Ct. 671. The petitioner asseverates that, on the logic of <i>Fong Foo,</i> we should refrain from punishing him for any errors committed by the trial judge in entering the judgment of acquittal. This asseveration misperceives the nature of the problem in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Fong Foo</i> is merely one iteration of a well-established rule. The law is pellucid that \"when a defendant has been acquitted at trial he may not be retried on the same offense, even if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous.\" <i>Sanabria v. United States,</i> 437 U.S. 54, 64, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978). Here, however, our determination that the BMC proceeding did not end in an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes is not premised on a finding that the trial judge erred in his assessment of either the evidence adduced at trial or the law applicable to that evidence. Rather, we conclude that the so-called acquittal entered by the trial judge was not an acquittal at all because it did not actually represent a resolution&#8212; correct or incorrect&#8212;of some or all of the factual elements of the offenses charged. <i>See Martin Linen Supply,</i> 430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that the interests protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause would not be advanced by barring further prosecution here. The core purpose of the Clause is to guard against a tyrannical state run amok. <i>See Scott,</i> 437 U.S. at 96, 98 S.Ct. 2187; <i>Green,</i> 355 U.S. at 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221. Far from being an instance of despotic state conduct, this is a tale of human frailty. The protagonists include a prosecutor who clumsily tried to throw in the towel before jeopardy attached; a skillful defense lawyer who spied an opportunity to manufacture an artificial acquittal; and a rogue judge who attempted to reshape the reality of events. A ruling in the petitioner's favor would require us to pay obeisance to the very type of rigid, mechanical rule that the Supreme Court consistently has disparaged in its double jeopardy jurisprudence. <i>See, e.g., Serfass,</i> 420 U.S. at 390, 95 S.Ct. 1055; <i>Somerville,</i> 410 U.S. at 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066. The public has an important interest \"in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\" <i>United States v. Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. 470, 480, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (plurality op.) (quoting <i>Wade v. Hunter,</i> 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949)). Treating the ersatz acquittal here as an acquittal in fact would offend that interest. We therefore hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the petitioner's retrial on the existing complaints.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A coda is in order. The petitioner maintains that, at the point he waived his right to trial by jury, he acquired a \"right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\" <i>Wade,</i> 336 U.S. at 689, 69 S.Ct. 834. In his view, it follows that, if his case is to be retried at all, it must be assigned to the same judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's first line of defense is a claim that a certificate of appealability is required as a precondition to pressing this issue on appeal. That contention is baseless. Where, as here, a habeas petition is governed by section 2241, a certificate of appealability is not essential. <i>See Drax v. Reno,</i> 338 F.3d 98, 106 n. 12 (2d Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Barrett,</i> 178 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir.1999); <i>McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm'n,</i> 115 F.3d 809, 810 n. 1 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite having overcome this procedural obstacle, the petitioner's argument fails. At bottom, the petitioner misunderstands the right to have one's trial completed by a particular tribunal. To the extent that such a right is recognized, it only safeguards a defendant's interest in having a particular judge or jury see his case through to an initial conclusion once jeopardy has attached. It is not meant to give the defendant a protected interest in having the same judge or jury arrive at a <i>second</i> conclusion in a subsequent proceeding once the initial proceeding has terminated in a way that does not implicate double jeopardy concerns. <i>Cf. Crist,</i> 437 U.S. at 36, 98 S.Ct. 2156 (\"Regardless of its historic origin ... the defendant's `valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal' is now within the protection of the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy....\" (quoting <i>Wade,</i> 336 U.S. at 689, 69 S.Ct. 834)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the right to have one's factual guilt or innocence adjudged by a particular factfinder is not absolute, and it \"must in some instances be subordinated to the public's interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\" <i>Wade,</i> 336 U.S. at 689, 69 S.Ct. 834. The petitioner here is no more entitled to be retried by the same judge than a defendant would be entitled to the reconvening of the same jury following the declaration of a mistrial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Consequently, we must address a series of related questions, some of apparent first impression, about the nature of the habeas proceeding, its statutory underpinnings, and the applicable standard of review. Once those issues are resolved, our attention shifts to the merits of the petitioner's double jeopardy claim. Here too the circumstances are out of the ordinary: the case turns on whether a disposition labeled by the state trial judge as an acquittal should be regarded as such for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause despite having been characterized by the state supreme court as resulting from a \"sham trial.\" Although the question is close, we answer it in the negative and, accordingly, affirm the district court's refusal to grant a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than four years ago, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts charged the petitioner with (i) distribution of a Class A controlled substance (heroin) and (ii) trafficking in that substance within 1,000 feet of a school. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167;&#167; 32, 32J. On May 1, 2000, a justice of the BMC held a pretrial conference, during which the Commonwealth agreed to provide the petitioner with evidence concerning drug analysis and school distance measurements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Because the petitioner was on probation at the time of his arrest, the state judge scheduled both a probation surrender hearing and a trial on the merits for June 8, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of June 8, both sides reported that they were ready for trial. The probation surrender hearing ensued. After receiving into evidence drug analysis certificates and police testimony detailing the circumstances of the petitioner's arrest, the presiding judge determined that the Commonwealth had failed to prove a violation of the terms of the petitioner's probation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties returned for the merits trial that afternoon. Before the trial began, the petitioner filed a motion in limine seeking the exclusion of all evidence concerning drug analysis and school distance measurements. He predicated this motion on the ground that the prosecution had not disclosed this evidence to the defense in a timely manner (i.e., as per the disclosure deadline fixed at the pretrial conference). The prosecutor offered to furnish the relevant data immediately. The judge responded that this offer was \"not good enough\" and granted the motion in limine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ruling effectively gutted the Commonwealth's case. In light of it, the prosecutor informed the court that she was no longer ready for trial. The judge announced that the case would nonetheless proceed as scheduled. <i>See Commonwealth v. Super,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></span>, 1181 (2000) (concluding \"that there is no requirement that the prosecution answer ready for trial as a condition precedent to commencing a criminal trial\"). The prosecutor could have nol-prossed the case or attempted to file an interlocutory appeal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but she took neither of these steps.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner waived his right to a jury trial, and the judge instructed the prosecutor to call her first witness. The prosecutor demurred, again explaining that she could not go forward because of the court's allowance of the motion in limine. Defense counsel then moved for a judgment of acquittal (in state court parlance, a required finding of not guilty). The prosecutor reiterated her objection to proceeding further and suggested that the court dismiss the case for noncompliant discovery. The trial judge promptly took the bull by the horns and interjected:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n order for the motion for required finding of not guilty to be allowed, there has to be a witness called and a witness sworn in in this matter.

She immediately called the petitioner's daughter to the witness stand. Although there is no suggestion in the record that the daughter had been a percipient witness to the events underlying the criminal complaints, this lack of knowledge proved not to be an impediment. The lawyer only asked the witness to state her name and to declare whether she knew the petitioner. After the witness replied in kind,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the lawyers eschewed any additional questioning. Neither side called any further witnesses, and the petitioner renewed his motion for a required finding of not guilty.

In the SJC's view, the exclusion order was erroneous because no definitive date for disclosure had been specified; defense counsel had not exercised due diligence in endeavoring to obtain the evidence; there was no indication that the prosecution had acted in bad faith; and in all events, no prejudice had been shown. <i>Id.</i> at 138. The SJC further found that the effects of this \"error [were] exacerbated by the judge's lightning rush to sanction the Commonwealth, and then immediately to call the case to trial, in an effort unjustly to deprive the Commonwealth of its right to pursue an interlocutory appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> On the constitutional issue, the SJC concluded that \"[b]ecause there was no trial on the merits, and no risk of the defendant's conviction, jeopardy did not attach.\" <i>Id.</i> at 140.

The district court issued an order temporarily blocking further prosecution of the state criminal charges. In due course, however, the court found the habeas petition wanting. <i>Gonzalez v. Justices of Municipal Court,</i> Civ.A. No. 03-10859, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22937727</span></span> (D.Mass. Nov.25, 2003) (<i>Gonzalez II</i>). The court discerned \"no reason to quarrel\" with the SJC's characterization of the original proceeding as a sham trial. <i>Id.</i> at *4. It specifically noted that there had been no presentation of evidence concerning any of the factual elements of the criminal charges and, thus, \"there was no risk to the defendant that he would be found guilty.\" <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the district court not only refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus but also dissolved the stay that it previously had issued. <i>Id.</i> at *5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed to this court and sought a further stay of the state criminal proceedings.

THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary point, we pause to ponder a pertinent puzzle posed by the procedural posture of the present proceeding. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. In this case, the petitioner originally premised the district court's jurisdiction on a smorgasbord of statutes, including 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2241 and 2254. In time, he narrowed his jurisdictional claim to section 2241 (the general habeas provision). He reasoned that section 2241 was a suitable vehicle for redressing the perceived wrongs because that provision offers habeas relief to any person who \"is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c)(3). Conversely, he viewed section 2254&#8212;section 2241's more famous relative&#8212;as inapplicable because that statute requires a state habeas petitioner to be \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2254(a)&#8212; a description that does not fit his circumstances. The Commonwealth took the opposite position, but the court below agreed with the petitioner on this point. <i>See Gonzalez II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22937727</span></span>, at *3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the Commonwealth continues to insist that section 2254 controls the case at hand. It claims that the petitioner is \"in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\" because the SJC's reinstatement of the state criminal proceedings is the proximate cause of the petitioner's current custody. The question of which statute governs is not merely of taxonomic interest; the classification matters because, as we shall see, it influences the applicable standard of federal court review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both section 2241 and section 2254, there is an \"in custody\" requirement. To be in custody for purposes of either statute, a person need not be actually incarcerated. <i>See Jones v.

Against that backdrop, we turn to the problem of identifying the nature of the instant proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the Commonwealth's position. A fundamental purpose of section 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, &#167; 104, 110 Stat. 1214, 1218-19 (1996), is to ensure that federal courts accord due deference to state court judgments. Here, unlike in most pretrial situations, there is a state court judgment to which the provisions of section 2254 theoretically could attach. The Commonwealth argues that a textual reading of the statute supports jurisdiction in this case because \"if section 2254 were intended to apply only to post-trial situations, it would refer to persons held in custody pursuant to a `conviction' of a state court, rather than to persons held in custody pursuant to a `judgment' of a state court.\" Respondents' Br. at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the Commonwealth's interpretation. In view of the plain language of the two statutory provisions, the travel of this case leads inexorably to the conclusion that section 2241 controls. The SJC judgment set aside the required finding of not guilty and reinstated the case for further proceedings before the BMC on the existing complaints. <i>Gonzalez I,</i> 437 Mass. at 285, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></span>. Those further proceedings have yet to take place. As one awaiting trial on state criminal charges, the petitioner is not in custody pursuant to the SJC's judgment. Rather, he is in custody as a result of the BMC's personal recognizance order, and that is the custody which he alleges violates the Constitution. Seen in that light, his petition is squarely within the maw of section 2241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the BMC proceeding would be over and done with (and, thus, the recognizance order would be a dead letter) were it not for the SJC's judgment. But that is irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes. Unless we are prepared to adopt a protean rule of \"but for\" causation in this context&#8212;and we are not&#8212;the plain language of the statutory scheme dictates that the petitioner's case must be adjudicated within the confines of section 2241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law confirms this intuition. Although we find little guidance in our own reported decisions, <i>see, e.g., Jackson,</i> 337 F.3d at 79 (raising, but not resolving, a question as to whether a pretrial detainee was correct in filing for habeas relief under section 2254), the precedents elsewhere are uniform. Several other courts of appeals have decided, on sufficiently analogous facts, that section 2241&#8212;not section 2254&#8212;applies. <i>See, e.g., Jacobs v. McCaughtry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773424\"><a href=\"/opinion/773424/chris-jacobs-applicant-v-gary-r-mccaughtry/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 597-98 (7th Cir.2001) (per curiam); <i>Stringer v.

The Commonwealth does nothing to discredit, and little to counter, this impressive array of authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth's principal effort to find support in the case law revolves around the decision in <i>Harpster v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747623\"><a href=\"/opinion/747623/donald-ray-harpster-v-state-of-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1997). That decision, carefully read, lends no assistance to the Commonwealth's cause. The <i>Harpster</i> court simply analyzed the habeas petition before it in accordance with section 2254 without any discussion of whether that section or section 2241 actually controlled. <i>See id.</i> at 326.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.

Prior to the enactment of the AEDPA, federal courts sitting in habeas jurisdiction typically deferred to state court findings of fact but reviewed conclusions of law de novo. <i>See Townsend v.

Courts applied this standard of review indiscriminately to petitions brought under both sections 2241 and 2254. <i>See, e.g., Scarpa,</i> 38 F.3d at 9 (reviewing a section 2254 petition); <i>United States ex rel.

Yet Congress chose to insert the new review framework in section 2254 without mentioning section 2241. <i>Compare</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)-(e) (describing the conditions under which a federal court may grant an \"application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\"), <i>with id.</i> &#167; 2241 (containing no descriptive conditions). The AEDPA left section 2241 unscathed and unchanged, and there are no cross-references in the new version of section 2254 to section 2241.

The chronology of the proceeding indicates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the risk of a guilty finding was, as a practical matter, non-existent. The prosecutor repeatedly refused to move for trial and apprised the court that she had no evidence with which to mount a prosecution at that point in time. The judge, for his part, assured the petitioner, in so many words, that he (the petitioner) faced no risk of conviction. Indeed, after defense counsel made his initial request for a judgment of acquittal, the judge conducted an impromptu tutorial on what he thought were the steps necessary to ensure that the requested disposition would preclude further prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That a witness was sworn and evidence taken during the effort to tailor the proceeding to the measurements of the double jeopardy bar does not alter the reality that the petitioner was never in actual danger of conviction. Where the only evidence received does not subject a defendant to any real risk that he will be found guilty, courts sometimes have held that jeopardy does not attach. <i>See, e.g., Aleman v. Hon. Judges of the Circuit Court,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752093\"><a href=\"/opinion/752093/harry-aleman-v-the-honorable-judges-of-the-circuit-court-of-cook-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 307-09 (7th Cir.1998) (concluding that defendant who secured an acquittal by bribing the trial judge was never in jeopardy \"because he was never truly at risk of conviction\"); <i>United States v.

The rule that jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence stems partially from the knowledge that, in almost all cases, the first evidence heard will emanate from the mouth of a witness tapped by the prosecution. <i>See Newman v.

This act is an affirmative step by the government into the trial&#8212;a step that places the defendant at actual risk of conviction.

Her testimony spoke neither to the factual elements of the offenses charged nor to the general issue of the case. By the same token, the trial judge disposed of the case on a basis wholly unrelated to the petitioner's factual guilt or innocence. Thus, despite the nomenclature that the judge employed the proceeding was merely an artifice designed to dress a dismissal without prejudice in a raiment more protective of a possible double jeopardy defense. That sort of masquerade, perpetrated by the judge's incantation of a few magic words,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> cannot suffice to transmogrify an ordinary trial vicissitude into an injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most judges play by the rules and, fortunately, manipulation of this sort is a rare occurrence.

The protagonists include a prosecutor who clumsily tried to throw in the towel before jeopardy attached; a skillful defense lawyer who spied an opportunity to manufacture an artificial acquittal; and a rogue judge who attempted to reshape the reality of events. A ruling in the petitioner's favor would require us to pay obeisance to the very type of rigid, mechanical rule that the Supreme Court consistently has disparaged in its double jeopardy jurisprudence. <i>See, e.g., Serfass,</i> 420 U.S. at 390, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109204\"><a href=\"/opinion/109204/serfass-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is not meant to give the defendant a protected interest in having the same judge or jury arrive at a <i>second</i> conclusion in a subsequent proceeding once the initial proceeding has terminated in a way that does not implicate double jeopardy concerns. <i>Cf.
