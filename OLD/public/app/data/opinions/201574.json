Petitioners Pajtim and Violeta Mana, natives\n\nof Albania, seek review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndecision   affirming    an   Immigration    Judge's   denial    of    their\n\napplication for asylum and withholding of removal. For the reasons\n\nexplained below, the petition for review of the BIA's order denying\n\nasylum and withholding of removal is dismissed as untimely. To the\n\nextent   that   the   petitioners   also   seek   review   of   the   BIA's\n\nsubsequent order denying reconsideration, that order is affirmed.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Petitioner Pajtim Mana is a member of the Albanian\n\nDemocratic Party who asserts that he was threatened and assaulted\n\nwhile living in Albania between 1993 and 1997 as a result of his\n\npolitical beliefs and his role in disarming the former Communist\n\ngovernment.     In late 1997, Pajtim and his wife Violeta sent their\n\nson to live with relatives in Greece, where their daughter also now\n\nresides.   The petitioners stayed behind in Albania.       During a trip\n\nto Greece in December 1999, they obtained visas to travel to the\n\nUnited States.     The Manas then returned to Albania, making three\n\nmore trips in and out of the country before they departed for the\n\nUnited States in October 2000.       They entered the United States on\n\nOctober 31, 2000 as nonimmigrant visitors with permission to remain\n\nuntil April 30, 2001.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           The    petitioners   applied     for    political      asylum   and\n\nwithholding of removal2 in July 2001, prompting the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization    Service   (\"INS\")3   to    issue   a   Notice    to   Appear\n\ncharging them with removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) for\n\nremaining in the United States for longer than permitted.               Having\n\nconceded removability, the petitioners presented their asylum claim\n\nto an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on November 8, 2002.               In an oral\n\ndecision at the conclusion of the proceeding, the IJ found that\n\nPajtim \"has failed to establish any effective basis for fearing\n\nharm in Albania at this time.\"      The IJ emphasized that regardless\n\nof whether Pajtim had been persecuted before 1997, he then remained\n\nin his home village in Albania without incident for more than three\n\nyears before departing for the United States.              The IJ therefore\n\ndenied   both    Pajtim's   application     for   asylum   and    his   wife's\n\nderivative application, and ordered them removed to Albania.4\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Pajtim Mana is the lead petitioner in this case.              His wife,\nVioleta Mana, filed a derivative application.\n     3\n      In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security and reorganized\nas the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"BICE\"). For\nsimplicity we refer to the agency throughout this opinion as the\nINS.\n     4\n      Although the government did not oppose voluntary departure,\nthe IJ concluded that the petitioners were ineligible because they\nwere not physically present in the United States for more than a\nyear before they were placed in removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229c(b). The petitioners have not challenged this ruling.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          The petitioners appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA,\n\nwhich summarily affirmed on February 5, 2004.        The petitioners did\n\nnot file a timely petition for review of the BIA's decision in this\n\ncourt.    They   did,   however,    file     a   timely   motion   seeking\n\nreconsideration by the BIA, arguing that the BIA erred in giving\n\nthe case only a \"cursory review\" and that, instead, it should have\n\nbeen reviewed by a three-member panel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)\n\n(2004) (describing procedure for affirmance without opinion);          id.\n\n§ 1003.1(e)(6) (describing circumstances in which cases may be\n\nreviewed by a three-member panel).         The BIA denied the motion to\n\nreconsider on April 7, 2004, finding that the petitioners had \"not\n\ndemonstrated any error in our decision of February 5, 2004.\"           The\n\nBIA also noted that motions to reconsider based solely on the\n\nargument that the prior appeal should have been reviewed by a\n\nthree-member panel rather than by summary affirmance are barred by\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(3).5   The petitioners timely appealed from the\n\nBIA's April 7, 2004 denial of the motion to reconsider.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          Petitions for review of a BIA order \"must be filed not\n\nlater than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (2004). This requirement of timely filing is\n\n\n     5\n      8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(3) provides that \"[a] motion to\nreconsider based solely on an argument that the case should not\nhave been affirmed without opinion by a single Board Member, or by\na three-Member panel, is barred.\"\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fjurisdictional.    See Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 359 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   The BIA's February 5, 2004 order affirming the IJ's denial\n\nof asylum was a final order of removal triggering the thirty-day\n\nappeals period, and that period was not tolled by the motion to\n\nreconsider.   See id. at 359-60; see also Nascimento v. I.N.S., 274\n\nF.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001) (explaining that the thirty-day period\n\n\"runs from the date of the BIA's affirmance of the Immigration\n\nJudge's order, not from the BIA's denial of reconsideration\"). The\n\npetitioners did not file the present appeal until May 6, 2004,\n\nwhich is within thirty days of the BIA's April 7, 2004 decision\n\ndenying the motion to reconsider but more than thirty days after\n\nthe BIA's February 5, 2004 decision affirming the underlying\n\ndeportation order.\n\n           We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the denial of\n\nasylum and withholding, the focus of the petitioners' brief.    The\n\nonly issue properly before us on appeal is whether the BIA abused\n\nits discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.6     Ven,\n\n386 F.3d at 360.   The petitioners have advanced no argument before\n\nus that would warrant overturning the BIA's denial of their motion\n\nunder the deferential abuse of discretion standard. In fact, their\n\nbrief is entirely silent on this point.\n\n\n     6\n      The petitioners also request that we remand to the IJ to\nallow them to present a claim for relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture (CAT). Because they offer no argument in support\nof this summary request, we consider the argument waived.    See\nMakhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          We therefore affirm the BIA's denial of the Manas' motion\n\nto reconsider and dismiss their appeal of the BIA's denial of\n\nasylum for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
