Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Godwin Aldarondo-Girald for appellants.\n     James W. McCartney with whom Cancio, Nadal, Rivera & Díaz was\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 31, 2005\n\f       COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.             Appellants Marcos Mercado and\n\nSuzanne     Hebert-Jomp       claim       that    they        experienced      unlawful\n\ndiscrimination while working at the Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel,\n\nSpa & Casino (\"Ritz-Carlton\"), and they brought suit under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and\n\nsimilar Puerto Rico laws. To sue under Title VII, individuals must\n\nhave     filed   a   charge       with    the    Equal    Employment      Opportunity\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\") within a specified time after the alleged\n\nunlawful practices occurred.              See id. § 2000e-5(e)(1).          Appellants\n\ndid not file their charges within the statutory period, and the\n\ndistrict court dismissed their claims on that ground.                       On appeal,\n\nappellants assert that the court erred in refusing to give them the\n\nbenefit of equitable tolling.               As we shall explain, we conclude\n\nthat appellants are entitled to factual development of their\n\ntolling claim, and we therefore vacate the dismissals and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n          This suit was filed by appellants and a co-worker, Sandra\n\nMegwinoff,       each   of        whom    alleged       different       instances   of\n\ndiscriminatory       conduct       on     the    part    of     their    Ritz-Carlton\n\nsupervisors. Appellant Mercado claimed discrimination on the basis\n\nof national origin; appellants Hebert and Megwinoff both alleged\n\nsexual     harassment,       as    well     as   gender       and   national     origin\n\ndiscrimination; Megwinoff additionally asserted age discrimination.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fAll three employees, who began working at the hotel in 1997,\n\nclaimed that their unlawful treatment and \"unsustainable working\n\nconditions\" forced them to resign from their jobs in 1999.1    The\n\nthree employees met with an attorney on November 11, 1999, and\n\nfiled charges with the EEOC on December 14, 1999.\n\n     It is undisputed that Mercado's and Hebert's filings were\n\nuntimely. Under Title VII, they were required to file charges with\n\nthe EEOC within 300 days after the allegedly unlawful practice, see\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1),2 and the most generous calculation of\n\nthe trigger date renders Mercado's filing 32 days late and Hebert's\n\n23 days late.3   The EEOC, without making either a determination on\n\nthe merits or a finding on timeliness, issued all three plaintiffs\n\nright-to-sue letters.   They filed their joint suit in March 2003,\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Mercado and Hebert resigned in January 1999; Megwinoff\nresigned on November 1, 1999.\n     2\n       Because Puerto Rico is a so-called \"deferral jurisdiction,\"\nthe 300-day period, rather than a shorter 180-day filing period, is\napplicable. See Lebron-Rios v. U.S. Marshal Serv., 341 F.3d 7, 11\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2003); Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194\nF.3d 275, 278 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).\n     3\n        For purposes of this appeal, Ritz-Carlton accepts the\neffective dates of appellants' terminations as the trigger dates\nfor the statutory filing period: January 15, 1999, for Mercado, and\nJanuary 24, 1999, for Hebert. Ritz-Carlton has noted, however,\nthat the dates of their resignation letters, rather than the\neffective date of the resignations, arguably should be considered\nthe starting point, in which case the filings would be even more\nuntimely. We offer no view on the appropriate start date, assuming\nfor purposes of this appeal, as did Ritz-Carlton, that the actual\nresignation dates are the applicable ones.\n\n                                -3-\n\fand Ritz-Carlton subsequently filed a motion seeking dismissal of\n\nMercado's and Hebert's claims based on their untimely EEOC charges.\n\n     In    their   opposition   to   the   dismissal   motion,   appellants\n\ncontended first that the timeliness defense was waived because it\n\nhad not been raised before the EEOC.          In addition, they claimed\n\nthat Ritz-Carlton was barred from asserting timeliness as a defense\n\nbecause the hotel failed to comply with EEOC regulations requiring\n\nemployers to post notices advising employees of their legal rights\n\nrelating to employment discrimination.           See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n10(a).4    Invoking the doctrine of equitable tolling, appellants\n\nclaimed that the filing period did not begin to run until they\n\nreceived notice of their rights when they met with an attorney.\n\n     The    district   court    rejected     appellants'   arguments   and\n\nconcluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of\n\ntheir claims because of the late EEOC filings.         The court reasoned\n\nthat the equitable tolling doctrine may be utilized only when there\n\nis \"active misleading\" on the part of the employer, and it held\n\nthat Ritz-Carlton's failure to post the mandatory notices was\n\ninsufficient to satisfy that standard.             The court implicitly\n\n\n\n     4\n      Section 2000e-10 provides, in pertinent part, that an\nemployer \"shall post . . . in conspicuous places upon its premises\n. . . a notice to be prepared or approved by the [EEOC] setting\nforth excerpts from or, summaries of, the pertinent provisions of\nthis subchapter and information pertinent to the filing of a\ncomplaint.\" See also 29 C.F.R. § 1601.30(a) (\"Such notice must be\nposted in prominent and accessible places where notices to\nemployees, applicants and members are customarily maintained.\").\n\n                                     -4-\n\frejected appellants' argument that Ritz-Carlton had waived the\n\ntimeliness issue by failing to raise it with the EEOC, noting that\n\nthe agency's issuance of right-to-sue letters did not insulate the\n\nfiling defect from independent evaluation by the court.\n\n     On appeal, Mercado and Hebert reiterate both their waiver and\n\nequitable   tolling   arguments.     We   first   briefly   address   the\n\nthreshold question of waiver, along with Ritz-Carlton's contention\n\nthat the appeal is premature, and then turn to the equitable\n\ntolling doctrine.\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n     A. Waiver\n\n     Appellants contend that Ritz-Carlton waived the timeliness\n\ndefense by failing to bring the issue to the attention of the EEOC;\n\nthey claim it was raised for the first time in Ritz-Carlton's\n\nmotion for partial dismissal in the district court. Appellants are\n\nwrong both legally and factually.\n\n     First, appellants offer no support for their assertion that\n\nthe failure to initially raise the defense before the EEOC was\n\nfatal, given that the EEOC did not reach a decision on the merits.\n\nBoth of their cited cases involve instances in which parties\n\nbelatedly sought to rely in court on procedural flaws that had not\n\nbeen raised in earlier administrative proceedings that reached\n\nsubstantive outcomes.     See United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck\n\nLines, 344 U.S. 33, 36-38 (1952); Ester v. Principi, 250 F.3d 1068\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f(7th Cir. 2001).     In Ester, the Seventh Circuit held that an agency\n\nwaives a timeliness defense in a subsequent lawsuit if it decides\n\nthe merits of a complaint, but noted the court's adherence to \"the\n\nwell-settled rule that agencies do not waive a timeliness defense\n\nmerely by accepting and investigating a discrimination complaint.\"\n\nId. at 1072 n.1 (citing Fifth, Ninth and D.C. Circuit cases); see\n\nalso Belgrave v. Pena, 254 F.3d 384, 387 (2d Cir. 2001); cf. Bruce\n\nv. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 314 F.3d 71, 74-75 (2d Cir. 2002)\n\n(concluding that timeliness defense was waived where a government\n\nagency made \"an express determination that [a complaint] was timely\n\nbased on a specific factual finding\").           We find that principle to\n\nbe applicable here, where the EEOC issued right-to-sue letters\n\nwithout reaching the merits of appellants' claims.\n\n     Nor did appellee belatedly raise the claim in the district\n\ncourt.   In   its    answer   to   appellants'    complaint,   Ritz-Carlton\n\nasserted as its initial affirmative defense that \"[t]he claims\n\nalleged in the plaintiffs' complaint are partially and/or totally\n\nbarred   by    the     applicable     statute    of   limitations   and/or\n\njurisdictional time frames.\"        Although conclusory, this assertion\n\nadequately identified the issue. The subsequent motion for partial\n\ndismissal elaborated on the untimeliness defense by setting out the\n\nargument that Mercado and Hebert exceeded the 300-day statutory\n\nperiod for filing a charge with the EEOC.               Thus, contrary to\n\nappellants' contention, the issue was raised by Ritz-Carlton at its\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffirst    opportunity   in   the   litigation   and   it   was   thus   fully\n\npreserved.\n\n     B. Rule 54(b)\n\n     Ritz-Carlton, meanwhile, seeks dismissal of the appeal as\n\npremature.    It argues that no final, appealable judgment has been\n\nrendered because the district court has not yet resolved the case\n\nof their co-plaintiff, Megwinoff.         Although the district court\n\ncertified the judgments with respect to Mercado and Hebert as final\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), finding that there is \"no just reason\n\nfor delay,\" see, e.g., Quinn v. Boston, 325 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), Ritz-Carlton claims the court erred in doing so.          The hotel\n\nmaintains that the equities counsel against a \"piecemeal appeal.\"\n\n     The district court did not explain its Rule 54(b) decision,\n\nbut we think it sufficiently apparent why it acted as it did.5           If\n\nthe court's ruling dismissing Mercado's and Hebert's claims proved\n\nto be incorrect, the most efficient course of action would be for\n\nall three employees' claims to proceed together.           Although their\n\nindividual factual contentions and theories vary, the same general\n\nenvironment is at issue and at least some witnesses would be\n\nexpected to testify on each case.         By certifying the judgments\n\n\n\n     5\n       We do not condone the lack of explicit findings and the\nreasoning underlying the court's certification, see Quinn v.\nBoston, 325 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir. 2003); Spiegel v. Trustees of\nTufts Coll., 843 F.2d 38, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1988), but conclude that\nthis is a case in which the circumstances plainly support an appeal\nfrom the partial judgment. See Quinn, 325 F.3d at 26.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fagainst Mercado and Hebert as final and allowing this court to\n\nreview the discrete legal issue underlying them without delay, the\n\ndistrict    court     was    maximizing     the   potential      for   the   most\n\nexpeditious resolution of the entire case.           We see no error in this\n\napproach.\n\n     We thus turn to the substance of the appeal.\n\n     C. Equitable Tolling\n\n     Appellants contend that their late filing of charges with the\n\nEEOC should be forgiven under the doctrine of equitable tolling\n\nbecause of Ritz-Carlton's failure to post statutorily mandated\n\nnotices    of    their   employment   rights.6      As   noted    earlier,   the\n\ndistrict court rejected this excuse.          The court relied on a line of\n\nprecedent       describing   equitable    tolling   as   a    narrow    doctrine\n\n\"reserved for exceptional cases,\" see Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods.,\n\nInc., 139 F.3d 56, 58-59 (1st Cir. 1998), and permitted \"only where\n\nthe employer has actively misled the employee,\" Thomas v. Eastman\n\nKodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 53 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       The filing requirement is mandatory but not jurisdictional\nand, like a statute of limitations, is subject to equitable\nexceptions. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393\n(1982); Jorge v. Rumsfeld, 404 F.3d 556, 565 (1st Cir. 2005);\nBonilla, 194 F.3d at 278. Ritz-Carlton has acknowledged that, as\na consequence of that precedent, its motion to dismiss the Title\nVII claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(1) is more properly considered a motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\nAccordingly, we treat it as such.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f     The district court correctly identified \"[t]he baseline rule\n\n. . . that time limitations are important in discrimination cases,\n\nand that federal courts therefore should employ equitable tolling\n\nsparingly,\" Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275,\n\n278 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,\n\n536 U.S. 101, 113-14 (2002).     After careful review of the case law,\n\nhowever, we conclude the court erred in utilizing the \"actively\n\nmisled\" standard in the context of a failure-to-post claim.\n\n     While    an   employer's   affirmative       misconduct   provides    one\n\nrationale for extending the filing period, we have recognized that\n\nan employer's violation of the EEOC posting requirement may provide\n\na second basis for an extended filing period \"where the employee\n\nhad no other actual or constructive knowledge of [the] complaint\n\nprocedures,\" Earnhardt v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 691 F.2d 69,\n\n72 (1st Cir. 1982).7      In Earnhardt, we first discussed plaintiff's\n\ncontention that his employer's silence in the face of inquiries\n\nprevented    him   from   learning   that   his    discharge   stemmed    from\n\ndiscrimination, resulting in his untimely EEOC filing.              See 691\n\n\n     7\n       Although a number of the cases we cite for this proposition\ninvolved the ADEA, rather than Title VII, we have held repeatedly\nthat \"the ADEA and Title VII 'stand[] in pari passu' and that\n'judicial   precedents   interpreting  one   such   statute   [are]\ninstructive in decisions involving [the other],'\" Camacho v. P.R.\nPorts Auth., 369 F.3d 570, 578 n.5 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting\nSerapion v. Martinez, 119 F.3d 982, 985 (1st Cir. 1997)); see also\nEarnhardt v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 691 F.2d 69, 72 (1st Cir.\n1982) (\"[C]ourts often accept ADEA precedents as persuasive\ninterpretations of similar provisions appearing in Title VII.\").\nWe continue that approach here.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fF.2d       at   71-72.      We   rejected      this   basis    for    tolling   because\n\n\"equitable modification is appropriate only where the employer\n\nactively        misled    the    employee    concerning       the    reasons    for    the\n\ndischarge.\"         Id. at 71.     We then separately addressed plaintiff's\n\nargument that the failure to post statutory notice excused his\n\nuntimely filing and remanded for inquiry into the facts concerning,\n\ninter       alia,   the     plaintiff's      knowledge.       We    thus   treated     the\n\nemployer's violation of the posting duty as a possible alternative\n\npath       to   equitable    tolling,     an    approach      we    adopted    again    in\n\nsubsequent cases.           See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of Am., 861 F.2d\n\n746, 752-53 (1st Cir. 1988) (where an employee's ignorance of his\n\nstatutory rights \"is caused . . . by failure of that employer to\n\nconspicuously post the informational EEOC notices . . . , there may\n\nbe a valid claim for equitable tolling\"); Cano v. U.S. Postal\n\nServ., 755 F.2d 221, 222-23 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1985) (per curiam).8\n\n\n       8\n       Ritz-Carlton attempts to blur the distinction between the\ntwo different bases for equitable tolling by quoting, out of\ncontext, our statement in Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38,\n53 (1st Cir. 1999), that \"First Circuit law permits equitable\ntolling only where the employer has actively misled the employee.\"\nViewed in context, it is clear that the \"active misleading\"\nrequirement applies when the employee invokes equitable tolling\nbased on lack of knowledge of the reasons for the adverse action –\nand not when the employer effectively has prevented the plaintiff\nfrom learning of his legal rights by failing to post the required\nnotice. In asserting the First Circuit standard, Thomas relied on\ntwo earlier cases involving claims that employees lacked knowledge\nof the employer's discriminatory motivation. See Jensen v. Frank,\n912 F.2d 517, 521 (1st Cir. 1990) (plaintiff could only qualify for\nequitable tolling if he could demonstrate \"not only that he had no\nreason to be aware of his employer's improper motivation when the\nputative violation occurred, but also that the employer actively\n\n                                            -10-\n\f      Many other courts similarly view lack of notice as adequate\n\njustification for equitable tolling.               See, e.g., Baldwin County\n\nWelcome   Ctr.   v.    Brown,    466   U.S.    147,   151   (1984)   (rejecting\n\nequitable tolling because \"[t]his is not a case in which a claimant\n\nhas received inadequate notice\" or where \"affirmative misconduct on\n\nthe part of a defendant lulled the plaintiff into inaction\"); EEOC\n\nv. Ky. State Police Dep't, 80 F.3d 1086, 1096 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"If\n\nan employer fails to comply with § 627 by not posting the required\n\nADEA notices, 'the charge-filing period will not begin to run until\n\nthe   employee   either    retains      an    attorney   or    acquires   actual\n\nknowledge   of   his    rights    under      the   ADEA.'\");   Unterreiner   v.\n\nVolkswagen of Am., 8 F.3d 1206, 1209 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"Under some\n\ncircumstances, a company's failure to post a notice of employees'\n\nrights under the ADEA may toll the statute of limitations.\");\n\nCallowhill v. Allen-Sherman-Hoff Co., 832 F.2d 269, 272 (3rd Cir.\n\n1987) (\"[A]n employer's neglect to post the notice . . . will toll\n\nthe running of the period for filing the administrative charges, at\n\nleast until the 'aggrieved person seeks out an attorney or acquires\n\nactual knowledge of his rights under the [ADEA]'\");                  English v.\n\n\n\nmisled him and that he relied on the (mis)conduct to his\ndetriment\"); Mack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 185\n(1st Cir. 1989) (no equitable tolling because no active deception\nin company's failure to post job openings). In short, our case law\nreflects two distinct lines of cases applying two distinct\nstandards to two distinct bases for equitable tolling.       As we\nexplain infra, the failure to post notice of legal rights triggers\na \"totality of the circumstances\" kind of review.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fPabst Brewing Co., 828 F.2d 1047, 1049 (4th Cir. 1987) (\"If an\n\nemployer violates the posting requirement, the charging period is\n\ntolled until the plaintiff 'acquires actual knowledge of his rights\n\nor retains an attorney.'\"); but see Wilkerson v. Siegfried Ins.\n\nAgency, 683 F.2d 344, 347 (10th Cir. 1982) (stating that failure to\n\npost EEOC notices will not toll absent employer's \"intent to\n\nactively mislead the plaintiff\").\n\n     Here, where appellants have asserted that no informational\n\nnotices were posted and that they had no knowledge of their legal\n\nrights   until   informed   by   their    attorney,9   they   have   met   the\n\nthreshold requirements for avoiding dismissal of their Title VII\n\nsuit.    See Kale, 861 F.2d at 753 (\"If . . . the employee has no\n\nknowledge of his rights and his ignorance is due to misleading\n\nconduct by the defendant or failure of the defendant to post the\n\n\n\n     9\n       We note that appellants made these assertions not in their\ncomplaint but in sworn statements submitted in response to Ritz-\nCarlton's motion for partial dismissal, and we further note that\nthe district court referred to the failure-to-post allegation in\nits decision.    Although a court's consideration of materials\noutside the pleadings typically converts a motion to dismiss into\none for summary judgment, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b); Greene v.\nRhode Island, 398 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2005), an affirmative\ndefense may be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim \"'[i]n an appropriate case,'\" Greene, 398 F.3d at 49\n(quoting In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 16\n(1st Cir. 2003)). We need not dwell on whether the district court\nproperly looked beyond the pleadings in this case. The bottom line\nis that the court made a legal error in viewing \"active misleading\"\nas a prerequisite to equitable tolling and, as we shall discuss,\nfactual issues pertinent to the tolling question thus remain.\nJudgment of dismissal, however framed, was therefore premature.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\frequired EEOC notices, then an initial case for equitable tolling\n\nhas been made.\") (emphasis added).    The viability of their claims\n\nbeyond that preliminary stage will depend, however, upon facts that\n\nhave yet to be developed.\n\n     Courts generally weigh five factors when considering whether\n\nto allow equitable tolling in a particular case: \"'(1) lack of\n\nactual notice of the filing requirement; (2) lack of constructive\n\nknowledge of the filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing\n\none's rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant; and (5) a\n\nplaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the [filing]\n\nrequirement.'\"   Kelley v. N.L.R.B., 79 F.3d 1238, 1248 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (quoting Kale, 861 F.2d at 752).      These factors are not\n\nexhaustive, however; \"[i]t is in the nature of equity to entertain\n\ncase-specific factors that may counsel in favor of tolling.\" Kale,\n\n861 F.2d at 753 n.9.\n\n     The factual inquiry in this case thus must begin with an\n\nexamination of whether – despite their assertion of ignorance –\n\nappellants had either actual or constructive knowledge of their\n\nTitle VII rights within the meaning of our case law.         Actual\n\nknowledge does not mean specific awareness of the 300-day statutory\n\nfiling period; rather, actual knowledge occurs when an employee\n\nbecomes generally aware that he possesses a legal right to be free\n\nfrom the type of discrimination he has alleged.   Kale, 861 F.2d at\n\n753 (\"Once an employee is 'generally aware of his legal right to\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fobtain redress for that wrong . . . , he possesses sufficient\n\nknowledge to enable him to vindicate his rights[,] if he so\n\ndesires.'\") (quoting McClinton v. Ala. By-Products Corp., 743 F.2d\n\n1483, 1486 (11th Cir. 1984)).10 Constructive knowledge, meanwhile,\n\nwould be presumed if the employer had complied with its statutory\n\nobligation to post the EEOC notices in conspicuous locations, and\n\nit also is presumed when an employee has retained an attorney – in\n\nboth instances, regardless of whether the plaintiff in fact is\n\naware of his rights.    Id.\n\n     Factual development may well show that appellants possessed\n\nsufficient knowledge to entitle Ritz-Carlton to summary judgment.\n\n\n     10\n          We elaborated in Kale as follows:\n\n     [E]quitable tolling is not properly invoked where a\n     plaintiff alleges mere ignorance of a specific provision\n     contained in a statute.      Instead, ignorance in the\n     context of equitable tolling under the ADEA, means\n     ignorance of the unlawfulness of the defendant's conduct\n     that is proscribed by the statute. Equity only requires\n     that a plaintiff be aware that a statute has been passed\n     that protects workers against age discrimination.     It\n     does not require that he know of all the filing periods\n     and technicalities contained in the law. . . . Thus, a\n     plaintiff who is aware of his ADEA rights but unaware of\n     the filing deadlines cannot, without more, invoke the\n     doctrine of equitable tolling.\n\n861 F.2d at 754. See also, e.g., Schroeder v. Copley Newspaper,\n879 F.2d 266, 271 (7th Cir. 1989) (\"The information [plaintiff]\nneeded to know before filing a charge was straightforward: that it\nwas unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age, and that he was\nrequired to file a charge with the EEOC to pursue a discrimination\nclaim.\"); Clark v. Resistoflex Co., 854 F.2d 762, 769 (5th Cir.\n1988) (plaintiff need only have general knowledge of his ADEA\nrights \"'or the means of obtaining such knowledge'\") (quoting\nMcClinton, 743 F.2d at 1486).\n\n                                 -14-\n\fRitz-Carlton argued below that the required notices had been\n\nposted, a factual assertion that the district court could not\n\ncredit in the context of a motion to dismiss.         In addition,\n\nappellants admit receiving Ritz-Carlton's \"Ladies & Gentlemen's\n\nHandbook,\" which they say contains a \"general 'Equal Employment\n\nStandard' and a 'Sexual Harassment Policy.'\"      If the handbook\n\nadvises employees that they have a right under Title VII to seek\n\nredress in the event of gender or national origin discrimination,\n\nappellants may be deemed to have notice sufficient to foreclose\n\nequitable tolling. Their sworn statements also refer to complaints\n\nthey lodged with the hotel about discriminatory treatment.   These\n\ncomplaints may or may not reflect knowledge of their statutory\n\nrights; if the handbook simply advised about company policy without\n\nreference to the availability of legal redress, for example, these\n\ninternal complaints may signal neither actual nor constructive\n\nknowledge of their Title VII rights.11\n\n     The next point of inquiry – appellants' diligence in pursuing\n\ntheir rights – also needs factual development.   Appellants did not\n\nconsult with an attorney until nearly ten months after leaving\n\ntheir jobs.   Appellants suggest that they were unaware for those\n\nmonths that they had a right to seek redress for discrimination;\n\n\n\n     11\n       We note that the complaint specifically alleges that Hebert\nspoke to her supervisor about \"the illegality of his discriminatory\nconduct,\" but the significance of this allegation needs to be\nassessed in context.\n\n                               -15-\n\fwhether their eventual visit to an attorney was prompted by new\n\ninformation or reflected long-standing general awareness of a\n\npotential claim is also relevant. Appellants met with the attorney\n\none day before the 300 days had run for Mercado and ten days before\n\nit had run for Jomp, but their charges were not filed with the EEOC\n\nuntil   33   days   later.         Did   this   reflect   diligence   under   the\n\ncircumstances?      See, e.g., Callowhill, 832 F.2d at 270-71, 274\n\n(noting that plaintiffs promptly filed charges after retaining\n\ncounsel; longest time lapse was eleven days).\n\n     These questions and others bearing on the appropriateness of\n\nequitable relief, including possible prejudice to the defendants\n\nand appellants' reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the 300-day\n\nfiling period, must be considered before a judgment may be made on\n\nappellants'    request       for    tolling.       Moreover,    in    evaluating\n\nappellants' claims, the district court may need to address the\n\nunresolved issue of the start date for the filing period, a\n\nquestion outside the scope of this appeal.                See supra note 3.   We\n\nhave given no consideration to that question and intimate no view\n\nas to its outcome or, for that matter, its relevancy in the\n\nparticular context of this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f     We therefore vacate the dismissal of appellants' claims and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.12\n\n     Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        At oral argument, appellants' attorney argued that his\nclients were \"actively misled\" by Ritz-Carlton based on facts\nunrelated to the failure to post notice. That view was not argued\nin appellants' brief, and it therefore is not before us.      See,\ne.g., Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 358 F.3d 110, 114 n.1\n(1st Cir. 2004) (issues not raised in an opening brief on appeal\nare waived).\n\n                              -17-\n\f",

Appellants Marcos Mercado and\n\nSuzanne     Hebert-Jomp       claim       that    they        experienced      unlawful\n\ndiscrimination while working at the Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel,\n\nSpa & Casino (\"Ritz-Carlton\"), and they brought suit under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and\n\nsimilar Puerto Rico laws. To sue under Title VII, individuals must\n\nhave     filed   a   charge       with    the    Equal    Employment      Opportunity\n\nCommission (\"EEOC\") within a specified time after the alleged\n\nunlawful practices occurred.              See id. § 2000e-5(e)(1).          Appellants\n\ndid not file their charges within the statutory period, and the\n\ndistrict court dismissed their claims on that ground.                       On appeal,\n\nappellants assert that the court erred in refusing to give them the\n\nbenefit of equitable tolling.               As we shall explain, we conclude\n\nthat appellants are entitled to factual development of their\n\ntolling claim, and we therefore vacate the dismissals and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n          This suit was filed by appellants and a co-worker, Sandra\n\nMegwinoff,       each   of        whom    alleged       different       instances   of\n\ndiscriminatory       conduct       on     the    part    of     their    Ritz-Carlton\n\nsupervisors. Appellant Mercado claimed discrimination on the basis\n\nof national origin; appellants Hebert and Megwinoff both alleged\n\nsexual     harassment,       as    well     as   gender       and   national     origin\n\ndiscrimination; Megwinoff additionally asserted age discrimination.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fAll three employees, who began working at the hotel in 1997,\n\nclaimed that their unlawful treatment and \"unsustainable working\n\nconditions\" forced them to resign from their jobs in 1999.1    The\n\nthree employees met with an attorney on November 11, 1999, and\n\nfiled charges with the EEOC on December 14, 1999.\n\n     It is undisputed that Mercado's and Hebert's filings were\n\nuntimely. Under Title VII, they were required to file charges with\n\nthe EEOC within 300 days after the allegedly unlawful practice, see\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1),2 and the most generous calculation of\n\nthe trigger date renders Mercado's filing 32 days late and Hebert's\n\n23 days late.3   The EEOC, without making either a determination on\n\nthe merits or a finding on timeliness, issued all three plaintiffs\n\nright-to-sue letters.   They filed their joint suit in March 2003,\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Mercado and Hebert resigned in January 1999; Megwinoff\nresigned on November 1, 1999.\n     2\n       Because Puerto Rico is a so-called \"deferral jurisdiction,\"\nthe 300-day period, rather than a shorter 180-day filing period, is\napplicable.

Ritz-Carlton has noted, however,\nthat the dates of their resignation letters, rather than the\neffective date of the resignations, arguably should be considered\nthe starting point, in which case the filings would be even more\nuntimely. We offer no view on the appropriate start date, assuming\nfor purposes of this appeal, as did Ritz-Carlton, that the actual\nresignation dates are the applicable ones.\n\n                                -3-\n\fand Ritz-Carlton subsequently filed a motion seeking dismissal of\n\nMercado's and Hebert's claims based on their untimely EEOC charges.\n\n     In    their   opposition   to   the   dismissal   motion,   appellants\n\ncontended first that the timeliness defense was waived because it\n\nhad not been raised before the EEOC.          In addition, they claimed\n\nthat Ritz-Carlton was barred from asserting timeliness as a defense\n\nbecause the hotel failed to comply with EEOC regulations requiring\n\nemployers to post notices advising employees of their legal rights\n\nrelating to employment discrimination.           See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n10(a).4    Invoking the doctrine of equitable tolling, appellants\n\nclaimed that the filing period did not begin to run until they\n\nreceived notice of their rights when they met with an attorney.\n\n     The    district   court    rejected     appellants'   arguments   and\n\nconcluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of\n\ntheir claims because of the late EEOC filings.         The court reasoned\n\nthat the equitable tolling doctrine may be utilized only when there\n\nis \"active misleading\" on the part of the employer, and it held\n\nthat Ritz-Carlton's failure to post the mandatory notices was\n\ninsufficient to satisfy that standard.             The court implicitly\n\n\n\n     4\n      Section 2000e-10 provides, in pertinent part, that an\nemployer \"shall post . . . in conspicuous places upon its premises\n. . . a notice to be prepared or approved by the [EEOC] setting\nforth excerpts from or, summaries of, the pertinent provisions of\nthis subchapter and information pertinent to the filing of a\ncomplaint.\" See also 29 C.F.R. § 1601.30(a) (\"Such notice must be\nposted in prominent and accessible places where notices to\nemployees, applicants and members are customarily maintained.\").\n\n                                     -4-\n\frejected appellants' argument that Ritz-Carlton had waived the\n\ntimeliness issue by failing to raise it with the EEOC, noting that\n\nthe agency's issuance of right-to-sue letters did not insulate the\n\nfiling defect from independent evaluation by the court.\n\n     On appeal, Mercado and Hebert reiterate both their waiver and\n\nequitable   tolling   arguments.     We   first   briefly   address   the\n\nthreshold question of waiver, along with Ritz-Carlton's contention\n\nthat the appeal is premature, and then turn to the equitable\n\ntolling doctrine.\n\n                           II. Discussion\n\n     A. Waiver\n\n     Appellants contend that Ritz-Carlton waived the timeliness\n\ndefense by failing to bring the issue to the attention of the EEOC;\n\nthey claim it was raised for the first time in Ritz-Carlton's\n\nmotion for partial dismissal in the district court. Appellants are\n\nwrong both legally and factually.\n\n     First, appellants offer no support for their assertion that\n\nthe failure to initially raise the defense before the EEOC was\n\nfatal, given that the EEOC did not reach a decision on the merits.\n\nBoth of their cited cases involve instances in which parties\n\nbelatedly sought to rely in court on procedural flaws that had not\n\nbeen raised in earlier administrative proceedings that reached\n\nsubstantive outcomes.

We find that principle to\n\nbe applicable here, where the EEOC issued right-to-sue letters\n\nwithout reaching the merits of appellants' claims.\n\n     Nor did appellee belatedly raise the claim in the district\n\ncourt.   In   its    answer   to   appellants'    complaint,   Ritz-Carlton\n\nasserted as its initial affirmative defense that \"[t]he claims\n\nalleged in the plaintiffs' complaint are partially and/or totally\n\nbarred   by    the     applicable     statute    of   limitations   and/or\n\njurisdictional time frames.\"        Although conclusory, this assertion\n\nadequately identified the issue. The subsequent motion for partial\n\ndismissal elaborated on the untimeliness defense by setting out the\n\nargument that Mercado and Hebert exceeded the 300-day statutory\n\nperiod for filing a charge with the EEOC.               Thus, contrary to\n\nappellants' contention, the issue was raised by Ritz-Carlton at its\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\ffirst    opportunity   in   the   litigation   and   it   was   thus   fully\n\npreserved.\n\n     B. Rule 54(b)\n\n     Ritz-Carlton, meanwhile, seeks dismissal of the appeal as\n\npremature.    It argues that no final, appealable judgment has been\n\nrendered because the district court has not yet resolved the case\n\nof their co-plaintiff, Megwinoff.         Although the district court\n\ncertified the judgments with respect to Mercado and Hebert as final\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), finding that there is \"no just reason\n\nfor delay,\" see, e.g., Quinn v. Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200396\"><a href=\"/opinion/200396/quinn-v-menino/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), Ritz-Carlton claims the court erred in doing so.          The hotel\n\nmaintains that the equities counsel against a \"piecemeal appeal.\"\n\n     The district court did not explain its Rule 54(b) decision,\n\nbut we think it sufficiently apparent why it acted as it did.5           If\n\nthe court's ruling dismissing Mercado's and Hebert's claims proved\n\nto be incorrect, the most efficient course of action would be for\n\nall three employees' claims to proceed together.           Although their\n\nindividual factual contentions and theories vary, the same general\n\nenvironment is at issue and at least some witnesses would be\n\nexpected to testify on each case.

The viability of their claims\n\nbeyond that preliminary stage will depend, however, upon facts that\n\nhave yet to be developed.\n\n     Courts generally weigh five factors when considering whether\n\nto allow equitable tolling in a particular case: \"'(1) lack of\n\nactual notice of the filing requirement; (2) lack of constructive\n\nknowledge of the filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing\n\none's rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant; and (5) a\n\nplaintiff's reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the [filing]\n\nrequirement.'\"   Kelley v.

Actual\n\nknowledge does not mean specific awareness of the 300-day statutory\n\nfiling period; rather, actual knowledge occurs when an employee\n\nbecomes generally aware that he possesses a legal right to be free\n\nfrom the type of discrimination he has alleged.

Id.\n\n     Factual development may well show that appellants possessed\n\nsufficient knowledge to entitle Ritz-Carlton to summary judgment.\n\n\n     10\n          We elaborated in Kale as follows:\n\n     [E]quitable tolling is not properly invoked where a\n     plaintiff alleges mere ignorance of a specific provision\n     contained in a statute.      Instead, ignorance in the\n     context of equitable tolling under the ADEA, means\n     ignorance of the unlawfulness of the defendant's conduct\n     that is proscribed by the statute. Equity only requires\n     that a plaintiff be aware that a statute has been passed\n     that protects workers against age discrimination.     It\n     does not require that he know of all the filing periods\n     and technicalities contained in the law. . . . Thus, a\n     plaintiff who is aware of his ADEA rights but unaware of\n     the filing deadlines cannot, without more, invoke the\n     doctrine of equitable tolling.\n\n861 F.2d at 754.

In addition,\n\nappellants admit receiving Ritz-Carlton's \"Ladies & Gentlemen's\n\nHandbook,\" which they say contains a \"general 'Equal Employment\n\nStandard' and a 'Sexual Harassment Policy.'\"      If the handbook\n\nadvises employees that they have a right under Title VII to seek\n\nredress in the event of gender or national origin discrimination,\n\nappellants may be deemed to have notice sufficient to foreclose\n\nequitable tolling. Their sworn statements also refer to complaints\n\nthey lodged with the hotel about discriminatory treatment.   These\n\ncomplaints may or may not reflect knowledge of their statutory\n\nrights; if the handbook simply advised about company policy without\n\nreference to the availability of legal redress, for example, these\n\ninternal complaints may signal neither actual nor constructive\n\nknowledge of their Title VII rights.11\n\n     The next point of inquiry – appellants' diligence in pursuing\n\ntheir rights – also needs factual development.   Appellants did not\n\nconsult with an attorney until nearly ten months after leaving\n\ntheir jobs.   Appellants suggest that they were unaware for those\n\nmonths that they had a right to seek redress for discrimination;\n\n\n\n     11\n       We note that the complaint specifically alleges that Hebert\nspoke to her supervisor about \"the illegality of his discriminatory\nconduct,\" but the significance of this allegation needs to be\nassessed in context.\n\n                               -15-\n\fwhether their eventual visit to an attorney was prompted by new\n\ninformation or reflected long-standing general awareness of a\n\npotential claim is also relevant. Appellants met with the attorney\n\none day before the 300 days had run for Mercado and ten days before\n\nit had run for Jomp, but their charges were not filed with the EEOC\n\nuntil   33   days   later.         Did   this   reflect   diligence   under   the\n\ncircumstances?      See, e.g., Callowhill, 832 F.2d at 270-71, 274\n\n(noting that plaintiffs promptly filed charges after retaining\n\ncounsel; longest time lapse was eleven days).\n\n     These questions and others bearing on the appropriateness of\n\nequitable relief, including possible prejudice to the defendants\n\nand appellants' reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the 300-day\n\nfiling period, must be considered before a judgment may be made on\n\nappellants'    request       for    tolling.       Moreover,    in    evaluating\n\nappellants' claims, the district court may need to address the\n\nunresolved issue of the start date for the filing period, a\n\nquestion outside the scope of this appeal.                See supra note 3.   We\n\nhave given no consideration to that question and intimate no view\n\nas to its outcome or, for that matter, its relevancy in the\n\nparticular context of this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f     We therefore vacate the dismissal of appellants' claims and\n\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.12\n\n     Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        At oral argument, appellants' attorney argued that his\nclients were \"actively misled\" by Ritz-Carlton based on facts\nunrelated to the failure to post notice. That view was not argued\nin appellants' brief, and it therefore is not before us.      See,\ne.g., Sullivan v.
