Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n         and Bownes and R. Arnold,* Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Heidi B. Shore for appellant.\n     John A. Wortmann, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nthe United States.\n\n\n\n                            July 28, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f           R. ARNOLD, Senior Circuit Judge.            As part of a plea\n\nagreement, Sylvester Gendraw pleaded guilty to two counts of\n\npossession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).     Mr. Gendraw and the United States agreed\n\nthat his base offense level was 32, that the District Court could\n\ngive a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and\n\nthat Mr. Gendraw qualified as a career offender under United States\n\nSentencing Guidelines §§ 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.         The defendant, however,\n\nreserved the right to request a downward departure under § 4A1.3 of\n\nthe Guidelines, on the basis that his designation as a career\n\noffender   overstated   his   criminal    history    and    the   threat   of\n\nrecidivism.    The District Court accepted his plea, rejected his\n\nmotion for a downward departure, and sentenced Mr. Gendraw to 151\n\nmonths’ imprisonment. Defendant is before this Court appealing the\n\nDistrict Court’s conclusion that it lacked the authority to grant\n\na downward departure in this case.        We affirm.     The facts of this\n\ncase do not come close to placing it outside the heartland of the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           Mr. Gendraw has a long history of convictions in both\n\nstate   and   federal   courts   dating    from   1983     to   1995.      His\n\nconvictions, in chronological order, are:           two counts of assault\n\nand battery, one count of assault and battery (committed while on\n\nprobation), one count of assault and battery with a dangerous\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fweapon (committed while on probation), larceny from a person and\n\nthreat to commit a crime (committed while on probation), larceny\n\nfrom   a   person   and   assault   and    battery   (committed   while   on\n\nprobation), attempt to commit larceny from a person, armed home\n\ninvasion and threats with intent to extort, witness intimidation,\n\nand possession of marijuana. The Pre-Sentence Investigatory Report\n\nindicated that he has also been arrested some eighteen additional\n\ntimes on various charges and has received seven disciplinary\n\nreports while incarcerated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nTo say the least, Mr. Gendraw is not new to the criminal justice\n\nsystem.\n\n            It is undisputed that Mr. Gendraw qualifies as a career\n\ncriminal on the basis of just three of these convictions:          attempt\n\nto commit larceny from a person, armed home invasion and threats\n\nwith intent to extort, and witness intimidation. His sole argument\n\nbefore the District Court was that he should receive a downward\n\ndeparture on the ground that his designation as a career criminal\n\noverstates his criminal history.          He argued, and still maintains,\n\nthat the less severe nature of his qualifying crimes and their\n\nremoteness in time provide sufficient grounds for a downward\n\ndeparture.    The District Court denied the motion because the judge\n\nfelt that he lacked the authority to grant it.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                                   II.\n\n            Mr. Gendraw asks this Court to hold that the District\n\nCourt erred in concluding that it lacked the authority to depart\n\ndownward.    We need not reach this question, however, because we\n\nconclude that even if the District Court was authorized to grant\n\ndownward    departures   based   upon   the    “smallness”   of   qualifying\n\noffenses and their age, Mr. Gendraw simply would not qualify.\n\n            As a general rule, this Court has no authority to review\n\nDistrict Court decisions to deny a downward departure.             When the\n\nDistrict Court’s conclusion is that it lacks the legal authority to\n\ndepart, however, we will review this decision de novo.                United\n\nStates v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).                  Although\n\ndeparture decisions should be made by the sentencing judge in the\n\nfirst instance, see United States v. Hardy, 99 F.3d 1242, 1250 (1st\n\nCir. 1996), where the record provides no basis for departure on any\n\nground, we are not required to remand to the District Court.             See\n\nUnited States v. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            This Court has held that § 4A1.3 departures are available\n\nto career offenders in some cases.            United States v. Lindia, 82\n\nF.3d 1154, 1165 (1st Cir. 1996).              To be entitled to such a\n\ndeparture, however, the defendant must demonstrate that his case is\n\nso exceptional that it is set apart from typical cases.           See United\n\nStates v. Perez, 160 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc) (per\n\ncuriam) (“Under Koon, if an encouraged factor (e.g., criminal\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fhistory under § 4A1.3) is already taken into account by a Guideline\n\n(as is criminal history in the career offender guideline), ‘the\n\ncourt should depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional\n\ndegree or in some other way makes the case different from the\n\nordinary case where the factor is present.’ ”); see also United\n\nStates v. Pearce, 191 F.3d 488, 497 (4th Cir. 1991) (recognizing\n\nthat § 4A1.3 departures for career offenders “are reserved for the\n\ntruly unusual case”).\n\n           According to these cases, then, Mr. Gendraw would be\n\neligible for a departure only if he could prove that his criminal\n\nbackground was so over-represented by his designation as a career\n\ncriminal as to put him beyond the normal case in which the career-\n\noffender classification comes into play.       He cannot make such a\n\nshowing.   A defendant is a career offender:\n\n\n\n           if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen\n           years old at the time of the instant offense,\n           (2) the instant offense of conviction is a\n           felony that is either a crime of violence or a\n           controlled substance offense, and (3) the\n           defendant has at least two prior felony\n           convictions of either a crime of violence or a\n           controlled substance offense.\n\n\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.   A felony qualifies as a crime of violence if the\n\npermissible term of imprisonment exceeds one year, and the crime\n\n“has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of\n\nphysical force against another” or involves burglary of a dwelling,\n\n                                -5-\n\farson, extortion, the use of explosives, or otherwise presents a\n\n“serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”                 U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4B1.2.\n\n               All parties agree that Mr. Gendraw’s convictions for\n\narmed home invasion and witness intimidation qualify as crimes of\n\nviolence, as does his conviction for attempt to commit larceny from\n\na    person.      Mr.    Gendraw    argues,    however,     that   because   these\n\nconvictions did not involve egregious behavior and because they\n\noccurred over ten years ago, his designation as a career offender\n\noverstates his criminal history and therefore exaggerates his\n\ndanger of recidivism.         We do not find this argument persuasive.\n\n               Even assuming that these qualifying convictions, when\n\nconsidered alone, are so trivial and remote as to render Mr.\n\nGendraw’s      case     exceptional,   Mr.     Gendraw’s    argument   faces    an\n\ninsurmountable hurdle because these are not his only convictions.\n\nMr. Gendraw has been convicted of six other crimes, many of which\n\nwere committed while he was on probation.              It is true that many of\n\nthese convictions would not qualify him as a career offender and\n\nthat we do not consider them in placing him in this category, but\n\nwe    cannot    disregard    them    when     trying   to   decide   whether   his\n\ndesignation so overstates his criminal history as to qualify him\n\nfor a downward departure.           He has been given the benefit of the\n\ndoubt many times, yet he has wholly failed to reform himself.\n\nGiven that Mr. Gendraw has so many convictions, there is simply no\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fmerit to his assertion that his designation as a career offender\n\noverstates his criminal history.          We observe, in addition, that\n\ndefendant’s remoteness-in-time argument is weak.            A considerable\n\namount of time did pass between the defendant’s last offense and\n\nhis commission of the crime for which he is now being prosecuted,\n\nbut the defendant was imprisoned during much of that time, with no\n\nopportunity to commit new crimes against the public.\n\n          In light of this conclusion, remanding this case would be\n\npointless,   as   any   decision   by   the   District   Court   granting   a\n\ndownward departure would have to be reversed.1               The District\n\nCourt’s refusal to grant Mr. Gendraw a downward departure is,\n\ntherefore, affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      At oral argument, the United States asked this Court to\naddress the question of whether any such ruling would be subject to\nde novo or abuse-of-discretion review in light of the PROTECT Act,\nPub. Law No. 108-21 Sec. 401(d), 117 Stat. 650 (2003) (mandating de\nnovo review of all downward departures). Because we feel that any\ndownward departure would require reversal under either standard, we\nneed not address this question.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

The Pre-Sentence Investigatory Report indicated that he has also been arrested some eighteen additional times on various charges and has received seven disciplinary reports while incarcerated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. To say the least, Mr. Gendraw is not new to the criminal justice system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Mr. Gendraw qualifies as a career criminal on the basis of just three of these convictions: attempt to commit larceny from a person, armed home invasion and threats with intent to extort, and witness intimidation. His sole argument before the District Court was that he should receive a downward departure on the ground that his designation as a career criminal overstates his criminal history. He argued, and still maintains, that the less severe nature of his qualifying crimes and their remoteness in time provide sufficient grounds for a downward departure. The District Court denied the motion because the judge felt that he lacked the authority to grant it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Gendraw asks this Court to hold that the District Court erred in concluding that it lacked the authority to depart downward. We need not reach this question, however, because we conclude that even if the District Court was authorized to grant downward departures based upon the \"smallness\" of qualifying offenses and their age, Mr. Gendraw simply would not qualify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, this Court has no authority to review District Court decisions to deny a downward departure. When the District Court's conclusion is that it lacks the legal authority to depart, however, we will review this decision <i>de novo. United States v. Snyder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197800\"><a href=\"/opinion/197800/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.1998). Although departure decisions should be made by the sentencing judge in the first instance, see <i>United States v. Hardy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197072\"><a href=\"/opinion/197072/united-states-v-hardy/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1242</span></a></span>, 1250 (1st Cir.1996), where the record provides no basis for departure on any ground, we are not required to remand to the District Court. <i>See United States v. Rushby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563223\"><a href=\"/opinion/563223/united-states-v-john-rushby/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has held that &#167; 4A1.3 departures are available to career offenders in some cases. <i>United States v. Lindia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196710\"><a href=\"/opinion/196710/united-states-v-lindia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1165 (1st Cir.1996). To be entitled to such a departure, however, the defendant must demonstrate that his case is so exceptional that it is set apart from typical cases. <i>See United States v. Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759121\"><a href=\"/opinion/759121/united-states-v-alina-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc) (per curiam) (\"Under <i>Koon,</i> if an encouraged factor (e.g., criminal history under &#167; 4A1.3) is already taken into account by a Guideline (as is criminal history in the career offender guideline), `the court should depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.'\"); see also <i>United States v. Pearce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766128\"><a href=\"/opinion/766128/united-states-v-kenneth-robert-pearce-united-states-of-america-v-homer/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 497 (4th Cir.1999) (recognizing that &#167; 4A1.3 departures for career offenders \"are reserved for the truly unusual case\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to these cases, then, Mr. Gendraw would be eligible for a departure only if he could prove that his criminal background was so over-represented by his designation as a career criminal as to put him beyond the normal case in which the career-offender classification comes into play. He cannot make such a showing. A defendant is a career offender:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. A felony qualifies as a crime of violence if the permissible term of imprisonment exceeds one year, and the crime \"has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another\" or involves burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, the use of explosives, or otherwise presents a \"serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All parties agree that Mr. Gendraw's convictions for armed home invasion and witness intimidation qualify as crimes of violence, as does his conviction for attempt to commit larceny from a person. Mr. Gendraw argues, however, that because these convictions did not involve egregious behavior and because they occurred over ten years ago, his designation as a career offender overstates his criminal history and therefore exaggerates his danger of recidivism. We do not find this argument persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that these qualifying convictions, when considered alone, are so trivial and remote as to render Mr. Gendraw's case exceptional, Mr. Gendraw's argument faces an insurmountable hurdle because these are not his only convictions. Mr. Gendraw has been convicted of six other crimes, many of which were committed while he was on probation. It is true that many of these convictions would not qualify him as a career offender and that we do not consider them in placing him in this category, but we cannot disregard them when trying to decide whether his designation so overstates his criminal history as to qualify him for a downward departure. He has been given the benefit of the doubt many times, yet he has wholly failed to reform himself. Given that Mr. Gendraw has so many convictions, there is simply no merit to his assertion that his designation as a career offender overstates his criminal history. We observe, in addition, that defendant's remoteness-in-time argument is weak. A considerable amount of time did pass between the defendant's last offense and his commission of the crime for which he is now being prosecuted, but the defendant was imprisoned during much of that time, with no opportunity to commit new crimes against the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this conclusion, remanding this case would be pointless, as any decision by the District Court granting a downward departure would have to be reversed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The District Court's refusal to grant Mr. Gendraw a downward departure is, therefore, <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, the United States asked this Court to address the question of whether any such ruling would be subject to<i>de novo</i> or abuse-of-discretion review in light of the PROTECT Act, Pub. Law No. 108-21 Sec. 401(d), 117 Stat. 650 (2003) (mandating <i>de novo</i> review of all downward departures). Because we feel that any downward departure would require reversal under either standard, we need not address this question.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
