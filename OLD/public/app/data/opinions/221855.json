Francisco A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Siler,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     José R. Olmo-Rodríguez, for appellant.\n     Julia M. Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           July 26, 2011\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.          The appellant in this case\n\nargues that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea, and\n\nthat we should not enforce the waiver of appeal contained in his\n\nplea agreement. Finding his claims unconvincing, we now affirm his\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             On March 30, 2009, an indictment was filed against\n\ndefendant-appellant,      Jesús   L.    Rodríguez-Morales    (\"Rodríguez\"),\n\ncharging him with two counts of unlawful possession with intent to\n\ntransfer five or more identification documents, two counts of\n\naggravated identity theft, and two counts of selling a social\n\nsecurity card.     Specifically, Rodríguez was accused of selling a\n\ntotal   of   eighty-six   genuine      social   security   cards   and   birth\n\ncertificates to undercover agents during two separate incidents in\n\nAugust 2008.\n\n             On July 22, 2009, Rodríguez changed his plea to guilty on\n\none count of aggravated identity theft, based on an agreement\n\nwhereby the prosecution agreed to file a motion to dismiss the\n\nremaining counts of the indictment. The plea agreement stated that\n\nthe guidelines sentence was the two-year term of imprisonment\n\nrequired by the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A.             The plea agreement\n\ncontained a waiver-of-appeal provision which stated that if the\n\ncourt accepted the plea agreement and sentenced him according to\n\nits   \"terms,   conditions,   and      recommendations,\"    then   he    would\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f\"waive[] and surrender[] his right to appeal the judgment and\n\nsentence in this case.\"\n\n            Rodríguez subsequently filed four pro se motions raising\n\nvarious     contentions   regarding,       inter    alia,    his       attorney's\n\nperformance, computation of the applicable guidelines range, and\n\nhis lack of awareness of the consequences of pleading guilty to\n\naggravated identity theft.     The district court construed the first\n\ntwo filings as motions to withdraw his guilty plea, and denied\n\nthem.     The district court responded to the last two filings by\n\nexplaining, via line order, that any issues would be discussed at\n\nthe upcoming sentencing hearing.\n\n            A sentencing hearing was held on December 1, 2009.                  At\n\nsentencing, the prosecutor stated that \"[h]ad this case gone to\n\ntrial . . . [Rodríguez] was looking at a statutory maximum of 44\n\nyears and a guideline sentence minimum of 107 months with a\n\nguideline sentence maximum of 131 months.\"           The court, as well as\n\ndefense     counsel,   immediately    concurred      in     the    prosecutor's\n\nstatement. Rodríguez subsequently addressed the court, and claimed\n\nthat he should not have been charged with aggravated identity\n\ntheft, as he had not sought to steal anyone's identity.                 The court\n\nresponded by clarifying that the statute in question (18 U.S.C. §\n\n1028A) did not require that a defendant seek to assume another's\n\nidentity,    but   required   only   that    \"you    transfer      a    means   of\n\nidentification of another person,\" which, the court pointed out,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fRodríguez had just conceded he did.   No one, the court went on to\n\nnote, was accusing Rodríguez of assuming someone else's identity;\n\nrather, he was accused of, and had pleaded guilty to, \"using the\n\ndocuments that belonged to another person -- or selling them to\n\nanother person for $2,000.\"   The court then sentenced Rodríguez to\n\ntwo years' imprisonment, followed by a one-year term of supervised\n\nrelease.   Rodríguez filed a notice of appeal the same day.1\n\n                                II.\n\n                                 A.\n\n           The parties dispute the applicable standard of review.\n\nThe government argues it should be for abuse of discretion, whereas\n\nRodríguez argues it should be de novo.        As noted above, the\n\ndistrict court construed two of Rodríguez's pro se filings, entered\n\nafter the change-of-plea hearing but prior to sentencing, as\n\nmotions to withdraw the guilty plea, and denied them as such.\n\nGenerally speaking, appeals of a district court's decision to deny\n\n\n\n\n1\n   At oral argument defense counsel indicated that he had been\nunable to reach his client for some time, and was not sure whether\nhe wished to further pursue this appeal.      On March 8, 2011, we\nrequested that the parties locate the defendant and seek\nclarification from him on this matter.      On March 21, the U.S.\nAttorney's office informed us that Rodríguez had been removed by\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement to the Dominican Republic on\nMarch 10, and that his present whereabouts are unknown. Defense\ncounsel was similarly unable to locate Rodríguez. In the absence\nof a contrary indication by Rodríguez, we now resolve the merits of\nthe appeal.\n\n                                -4-\n\fa motion to withdraw is reviewed for abuse                               of discretion.2\n\nSee United States v. Rivera-Gonzalez, 626 F.3d 639, 643 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (reviewing claim that a guilty plea was entered without an\n\nadequate      understanding           of     its        consequences      for      abuse   of\n\ndiscretion); United States v. McMullin, 568 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); United States v. Castro-Gómez, 233 F.3d 684, 686 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); United States v. Santiago, 229 F.3d 313, 316 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(noting, with respect to a claim that a guilty plea was not knowing\n\nand intelligent under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 11,\n\nthat review was for abuse of discretion).\n\n              However, as we have previously noted, other standards\n\napply to certain sub-issues related to denials of motions to\n\nwithdraw.          \"Abstract      questions        of    law     are   reviewed    de novo,\n\nfindings      of    raw    fact      are    tested       for     clear    error,    and    law\n\napplication        and    balancing        judgments       are    usually    reviewed      for\n\nreasonableness.\"          United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594,\n\n597 n.3 (1st Cir. 2003).              Rodríguez argues that whether his plea\n\nwas knowingly, intelligently and/or voluntarily tendered is a\n\nquestion of law subject to de novo review.                         See United States v.\n\nWard,   518    F.3d       75,   80    (1st    Cir.       2008)     (citing      Marshall   v.\n\nLonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 431 (1983)); Wellman v. Maine, 962 F.2d\n\n70, 72 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Sotirion v. United States, 617\n\n\n\n2\n   Rodríguez does not challenge the district court's construal of\ntwo of the pro se motions as motions to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fF.3d 27, 34 n.6 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing United States v. Goodson,\n\n544 F.3d 529, 539 n.9 (3d Cir. 2008)) (noting, in the closely\n\nrelated context of a challenge to a waiver of appeal in a plea\n\nagreement, that a challenge premised on \"the validity of the waiver\n\nitself, not the Rule 11 colloquy,\" would be subject to de novo\n\nreview).\n\n           We need not resolve this issue, as Rodríguez's claim\n\nfails under any of the applicable standards.\n\n                                      B.\n\n           The gist of Rodríguez's argument is that the prosecutor\n\n\"drastically\" overstated what his sentencing exposure would have\n\nbeen had he stood trial and been convicted on all counts.\n\nAppellant claims that had he stood trial and been convicted of all\n\ncounts, he was looking at a guidelines range of twenty-four to\n\nthirty months.   He argues that the prosecutor's inflated estimate\n\nof 107 to 131 months, agreed to by the court and by defense\n\ncounsel, induced him to agree to the government's proffer.              The\n\nproffer recommended a two-year term of imprisonment, which is what\n\nhe ultimately received, once he decided to accept the government's\n\nterms and plead guilty.       Rodríguez now claims that there was a\n\nstrong probability that, had he known the true extent of his\n\nsentencing   exposure,   he   would    have   rejected   the   government's\n\nproffer. As it is, he wound up accepting the government's proffer,\n\nand waiving many of his rights, in return for little or no discount\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffrom what he would have received had he gone to trial and been\n\nconvicted on all counts.\n\n           The government appears to concede that the prosecutor\n\noverstated the defendant's potential exposure during the sentencing\n\nhearing.   However, the government disputes that this overstatement\n\nrendered Rodríguez's plea involuntary or unintelligent, and argues\n\nthat we should enforce the waiver-of-appeal provision of the plea\n\nbargain.   The government also contests Rodríguez's calculation of\n\ntwenty-four to thirty months as the correct guidelines range for\n\nconviction on all counts.   While the government does not provide a\n\nspecific range, it notes that his potential exposure on counts\n\nthree and four alone was forty-eight months. Counts three and four\n\nalleged violations of § 1028A(a)(1), and this statute specifies\n\nthat \"no term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall run\n\nconcurrently with any other term of imprisonment.\"     18 U.S.C. §\n\n1028A(b)(2). Therefore, sentences based on any of the other counts\n\nwould have been imposed on top of any sentence for counts three and\n\nfour.3\n\n\n3\n    Rodríguez points out that a sentencing court may, in its\ndiscretion, impose concurrent terms of imprisonment for multiple\nviolations of § 1028A. He speculates that because he was a first-\ntime offender, and because there are more egregious ways of\nviolating the statute, the sentencing court would have exercised\nits discretion to impose concurrent rather than consecutive\nsentences for counts three and four. For this reason, Rodríguez\nclaims that any sentence based on the other counts would have been\napplied on top of a two-year, rather than (as the government\nsuggests) a four-year baseline, assuming convictions on counts\nthree and four.\n\n                                -7-\n\f              The   Federal   Rules    of    Criminal   Procedure   permit   a\n\ndefendant to withdraw a guilty plea after it has been tendered, but\n\nprior to sentencing, for a \"fair and just reason.\"             Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(d)(2)(b).        The relevant factors in considering whether a\n\ndefendant has presented such a reason are \"whether the plea was\n\nvoluntary, intelligent, knowing and complied with Rule 11; the\n\nforce of the reasons offered by the defendant; whether there is a\n\nserious claim of actual innocence; the timing of the motion; and\n\nany countervailing prejudice to the government if the defendant is\n\nallowed to withdraw his plea.\"         Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d at 597;\n\nsee also Rivera-Gonzalez, 626 F.3d at 643.\n\n              The validity of a waiver-of-appeal provision in a plea\n\nbargain is reviewed under the three-part test set forth in United\n\nStates v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001).               The Teeter\n\ntest   asks     whether   \"(1)   the    written    plea   agreement    clearly\n\ndelineates the scope of the waiver; (2) the district court inquired\n\nspecifically at the plea hearing about any waiver of appellate\n\nrights; and (3) the denial of the right to appeal would not\n\nconstitute a miscarriage of justice.\" United States v. Edelen, 539\n\nF.3d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 2008); see also United States v. Isom, 580\n\nF.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n              Although the standard for reviewing a denial of a motion\n\nto withdraw a guilty plea differs from the standard for reviewing\n\nthe validity of a waiver-of-appeal provision, Rodríguez makes the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fsame argument under these two standards.       He argues that the\n\nprosecutor's misestimation of his probable guidelines range post-\n\ntrial rendered his plea involuntary, unknowing, and unintelligent.\n\nRodríguez argues that this both establishes a \"fair and just\"\n\nreason to allow withdrawal of his guilty plea, and establishes that\n\nthere has been a miscarriage of justice under Teeter such that this\n\nappeal must be allowed.4   In addressing this argument, we need not\n\nassess the relationship between the standards governing waiver of\n\nappeal and withdrawal of a plea.   It is clear that there has been\n\nno miscarriage of justice within the meaning of our case law\n\ngoverning waivers of appeal under Teeter, and that disposes of this\n\nappeal.\n\n          As the appellant rightly notes, the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that a guilty plea must be not just voluntary, but\n\nknowing and intelligent as well, and that a defendant's \"awareness\n\nof the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\" of his plea\n\nbears on whether a guilty plea is \"knowing\" or \"intelligent.\"\n\nBrady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970).      The Supreme\n\nCourt has also explained that \"[t]he standard was and remains\n\nwhether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice\n\namong the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\"\n\nNorth Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970).   More recently,\n\n\n4\n   The appellant does not contest the other elements of the Teeter\ntest, i.e., the scope of the waiver or the Rule 11 colloquy. He\nlimits his contention to Teeter's miscarriage of justice prong.\n\n                                -9-\n\fwe have stated that \"the accused must have understood the charges\n\nagainst him and the spectrum of possible penalties to which an\n\nadmission of guilt will expose him.\" United States v. Jimenez, 512\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            None of this helps the appellant.            The central hurdle\n\nRodríguez faces on appeal is that the prosecutor's statement to\n\nwhich he draws our attention occurred at sentencing, i.e., months\n\nafter he had already decided to plead guilty.                  Rodríguez was\n\nsentenced on December 1, 2009, but the change-of-plea hearing took\n\nplace approximately four months earlier, on July 22 of that year.\n\nTherefore,    even   though   he    is    surely   correct   that   \"erroneous\n\ninformation\" which \"dramatically alter[s] the sentencing stakes for\n\nthe defendant\" may bear on whether someone who has pleaded guilty\n\nwill be allowed to subsequently withdraw his plea, United States v.\n\nRivera-Maldonado, 560 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2009), we do not see\n\nhow the misstatement identified by the appellant -- no matter how\n\negregious it may or may not have been -- could have affected his\n\ndecision to accept the government's proffer.5\n\n            During the plea hearing, the district court ensured that\n\nRodríguez    understood what       he    was   being charged with     and   the\n\nconsequences of a guilty plea, and that he had discussed his\n\noptions with his attorney.         He admitted to committing the charged\n\n\n5\n   Rodríguez has not alleged that his decision to plead guilty was\naffected by any purported misstatement by the prosecution prior to\nsentencing.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcrimes, and stated that he understood the penalties he might\n\nreceive.6     Rodríguez does not claim, and the record does not\n\nindicate, that the prosecutor advised him that the applicable\n\nguidelines range was 107 to 131 months prior to or during the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing.\n\n             The pro se motions filed by Rodríguez after the change-\n\nof-plea hearing        do   not    undermine       this conclusion.      In those\n\nmotions, Rodríguez insisted that aggravated identity theft under\n\n§ 1028A was not meant to apply to someone in his situation, and\n\nthat he should have been charged with a lesser offense, with\n\nreduced sentencing exposure.                Nothing in these motions suggests\n\nthat his decision to plead guilty was obscured by misinformation as\n\nto the sentence he might receive after trial.               In his pro se filing\n\nof October 13, 2009, Rodríguez complains that the government's\n\noffer of twenty-four months was too long, but that he was informed\n\nby   his    attorney    that      if   he    did   not   accept   the   plea,   the\n\nprosecutor's office could increase the sentence.7                  Rodríguez was\n\n\n6\n   This is not to say that there were no misstatements at the\nchange-of-plea hearing. During this hearing, the prosecutor stated\nthat the statutory penalty for Rodríguez's guilty plea under\n§ 1028A was between two and fifteen years. As the government now\nconcedes, § 1028A provides a fixed term of two years for all non-\nterrorism related offenses. However, Rodríguez does not argue that\nhis decision to accept the plea bargain was affected by this\nmisstatement, and we correspondingly deem any argument to that\neffect waived.\n7\n  It is not clear whether Rodríguez, or his attorney, is referring\nto the possibility of a harsher outcome after trial, or to the\npossibility that the proffer might be replaced with a less\n\n                                            -11-\n\fnot misinformed:     even if the parties disagree as to how much more,\n\nit is undisputed that the charges Rodríguez faced did in fact\n\nexpose him to over twenty-four months' imprisonment.                   Rodríguez\n\ncomplained in other pro se filings that his lawyer recommended that\n\nhe sign the plea agreement, despite the fact that the crime charged\n\nwas, in Rodríguez's view, inapposite to his case.               At no point in\n\nthese motions did Rodríguez assert that his decision to accept the\n\ngovernment proffer and plead guilty was influenced by a government-\n\ninduced misunderstanding of the sentence he could receive after\n\ntrial.8\n\n             We conclude that, because the prosecutor's statement was\n\nmade months after the appellant decided to plead guilty, the\n\nprosecutor's overestimate of the applicable guidelines range did\n\nnot   render     Rodríguez's    decision     to   plead    guilty      unknowing,\n\nunintelligent or involuntary.         In light of this conclusion, the\n\ndispute between the parties as to what the precise guidelines range\n\nwould     have   been,   had   appellant    proceeded     to   trial    and   been\n\nconvicted on all counts, is moot.\n\n\n\n\nfavorable one if he balked.\n8\n   The closest Rodríguez comes to making such an assertion is in a\nstatement contained in his notice of appeal, filed shortly after\nsentencing, in which he stated that his lawyer never explained to\nhim the nature of § 1028A, and that \"they could hit me with 0 to 15\nyears.\"\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                               III.\n\n          For the reasons given above, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Rodríguez's motions to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea.   The same reasons lead us to believe that enforcing\n\nthe appellate waiver would not work a miscarriage of justice under\n\nTeeter. We affirm Rodriguez's conviction and sentence, and dismiss\n\nthe appeal.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Siler,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     José R. Olmo-Rodríguez, for appellant.\n     Julia M. Meconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief,\nAppellate Division, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           July 26, 2011\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.          The appellant in this case\n\nargues that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea, and\n\nthat we should not enforce the waiver of appeal contained in his\n\nplea agreement. Finding his claims unconvincing, we now affirm his\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             On March 30, 2009, an indictment was filed against\n\ndefendant-appellant,      Jesús   L.    Rodríguez-Morales    (\"Rodríguez\"),\n\ncharging him with two counts of unlawful possession with intent to\n\ntransfer five or more identification documents, two counts of\n\naggravated identity theft, and two counts of selling a social\n\nsecurity card.     Specifically, Rodríguez was accused of selling a\n\ntotal   of   eighty-six   genuine      social   security   cards   and   birth\n\ncertificates to undercover agents during two separate incidents in\n\nAugust 2008.\n\n             On July 22, 2009, Rodríguez changed his plea to guilty on\n\none count of aggravated identity theft, based on an agreement\n\nwhereby the prosecution agreed to file a motion to dismiss the\n\nremaining counts of the indictment. The plea agreement stated that\n\nthe guidelines sentence was the two-year term of imprisonment\n\nrequired by the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A.             The plea agreement\n\ncontained a waiver-of-appeal provision which stated that if the\n\ncourt accepted the plea agreement and sentenced him according to\n\nits   \"terms,   conditions,   and      recommendations,\"    then   he    would\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f\"waive[] and surrender[] his right to appeal the judgment and\n\nsentence in this case.\"\n\n            Rodríguez subsequently filed four pro se motions raising\n\nvarious     contentions   regarding,       inter    alia,    his       attorney's\n\nperformance, computation of the applicable guidelines range, and\n\nhis lack of awareness of the consequences of pleading guilty to\n\naggravated identity theft.     The district court construed the first\n\ntwo filings as motions to withdraw his guilty plea, and denied\n\nthem.     The district court responded to the last two filings by\n\nexplaining, via line order, that any issues would be discussed at\n\nthe upcoming sentencing hearing.\n\n            A sentencing hearing was held on December 1, 2009.                  At\n\nsentencing, the prosecutor stated that \"[h]ad this case gone to\n\ntrial . . . [Rodríguez] was looking at a statutory maximum of 44\n\nyears and a guideline sentence minimum of 107 months with a\n\nguideline sentence maximum of 131 months.\"           The court, as well as\n\ndefense     counsel,   immediately    concurred      in     the    prosecutor's\n\nstatement. Rodríguez subsequently addressed the court, and claimed\n\nthat he should not have been charged with aggravated identity\n\ntheft, as he had not sought to steal anyone's identity.                 The court\n\nresponded by clarifying that the statute in question (18 U.S.C. §\n\n1028A) did not require that a defendant seek to assume another's\n\nidentity,    but   required   only   that    \"you    transfer      a    means   of\n\nidentification of another person,\" which, the court pointed out,\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fRodríguez had just conceded he did.   No one, the court went on to\n\nnote, was accusing Rodríguez of assuming someone else's identity;\n\nrather, he was accused of, and had pleaded guilty to, \"using the\n\ndocuments that belonged to another person -- or selling them to\n\nanother person for $2,000.\"   The court then sentenced Rodríguez to\n\ntwo years' imprisonment, followed by a one-year term of supervised\n\nrelease.   Rodríguez filed a notice of appeal the same day.1\n\n                                II.\n\n                                 A.\n\n           The parties dispute the applicable standard of review.\n\nThe government argues it should be for abuse of discretion, whereas\n\nRodríguez argues it should be de novo.        As noted above, the\n\ndistrict court construed two of Rodríguez's pro se filings, entered\n\nafter the change-of-plea hearing but prior to sentencing, as\n\nmotions to withdraw the guilty plea, and denied them as such.\n\nGenerally speaking, appeals of a district court's decision to deny\n\n\n\n\n1\n   At oral argument defense counsel indicated that he had been\nunable to reach his client for some time, and was not sure whether\nhe wished to further pursue this appeal.      On March 8, 2011, we\nrequested that the parties locate the defendant and seek\nclarification from him on this matter.      On March 21, the U.S.\nAttorney's office informed us that Rodríguez had been removed by\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement to the Dominican Republic on\nMarch 10, and that his present whereabouts are unknown. Defense\ncounsel was similarly unable to locate Rodríguez. In the absence\nof a contrary indication by Rodríguez, we now resolve the merits of\nthe appeal.\n\n                                -4-\n\fa motion to withdraw is reviewed for abuse                               of discretion.2\n\nSee United States v.

He argues that the prosecutor's inflated estimate\n\nof 107 to 131 months, agreed to by the court and by defense\n\ncounsel, induced him to agree to the government's proffer.              The\n\nproffer recommended a two-year term of imprisonment, which is what\n\nhe ultimately received, once he decided to accept the government's\n\nterms and plead guilty.       Rodríguez now claims that there was a\n\nstrong probability that, had he known the true extent of his\n\nsentencing   exposure,   he   would    have   rejected   the   government's\n\nproffer. As it is, he wound up accepting the government's proffer,\n\nand waiving many of his rights, in return for little or no discount\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffrom what he would have received had he gone to trial and been\n\nconvicted on all counts.\n\n           The government appears to concede that the prosecutor\n\noverstated the defendant's potential exposure during the sentencing\n\nhearing.   However, the government disputes that this overstatement\n\nrendered Rodríguez's plea involuntary or unintelligent, and argues\n\nthat we should enforce the waiver-of-appeal provision of the plea\n\nbargain.   The government also contests Rodríguez's calculation of\n\ntwenty-four to thirty months as the correct guidelines range for\n\nconviction on all counts.   While the government does not provide a\n\nspecific range, it notes that his potential exposure on counts\n\nthree and four alone was forty-eight months. Counts three and four\n\nalleged violations of § 1028A(a)(1), and this statute specifies\n\nthat \"no term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall run\n\nconcurrently with any other term of imprisonment.\"     18 U.S.C. §\n\n1028A(b)(2). Therefore, sentences based on any of the other counts\n\nwould have been imposed on top of any sentence for counts three and\n\nfour.3\n\n\n3\n    Rodríguez points out that a sentencing court may, in its\ndiscretion, impose concurrent terms of imprisonment for multiple\nviolations of § 1028A. He speculates that because he was a first-\ntime offender, and because there are more egregious ways of\nviolating the statute, the sentencing court would have exercised\nits discretion to impose concurrent rather than consecutive\nsentences for counts three and four. For this reason, Rodríguez\nclaims that any sentence based on the other counts would have been\napplied on top of a two-year, rather than (as the government\nsuggests) a four-year baseline, assuming convictions on counts\nthree and four.\n\n                                -7-\n\f              The   Federal   Rules    of    Criminal   Procedure   permit   a\n\ndefendant to withdraw a guilty plea after it has been tendered, but\n\nprior to sentencing, for a \"fair and just reason.\"             Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11(d)(2)(b).        The relevant factors in considering whether a\n\ndefendant has presented such a reason are \"whether the plea was\n\nvoluntary, intelligent, knowing and complied with Rule 11; the\n\nforce of the reasons offered by the defendant; whether there is a\n\nserious claim of actual innocence; the timing of the motion; and\n\nany countervailing prejudice to the government if the defendant is\n\nallowed to withdraw his plea.\"         Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d at 597;\n\nsee also Rivera-Gonzalez, 626 F.3d at 643.\n\n              The validity of a waiver-of-appeal provision in a plea\n\nbargain is reviewed under the three-part test set forth in United\n\nStates v. Teeter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001).               The Teeter\n\ntest   asks     whether   \"(1)   the    written    plea   agreement    clearly\n\ndelineates the scope of the waiver; (2) the district court inquired\n\nspecifically at the plea hearing about any waiver of appellate\n\nrights; and (3) the denial of the right to appeal would not\n\nconstitute a miscarriage of justice.\" United States v. Edelen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427387\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427387/united-states-v-edelen/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (1st Cir. 2008); see also United States v.

He argues that the\n\nprosecutor's misestimation of his probable guidelines range post-\n\ntrial rendered his plea involuntary, unknowing, and unintelligent.\n\nRodríguez argues that this both establishes a \"fair and just\"\n\nreason to allow withdrawal of his guilty plea, and establishes that\n\nthere has been a miscarriage of justice under Teeter such that this\n\nappeal must be allowed.4   In addressing this argument, we need not\n\nassess the relationship between the standards governing waiver of\n\nappeal and withdrawal of a plea.   It is clear that there has been\n\nno miscarriage of justice within the meaning of our case law\n\ngoverning waivers of appeal under Teeter, and that disposes of this\n\nappeal.\n\n          As the appellant rightly notes, the Supreme Court has\n\nrecognized that a guilty plea must be not just voluntary, but\n\nknowing and intelligent as well, and that a defendant's \"awareness\n\nof the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\" of his plea\n\nbears on whether a guilty plea is \"knowing\" or \"intelligent.\"\n\nBrady v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108137\"><a href=\"/opinion/108137/brady-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 748 (1970).      The Supreme\n\nCourt has also explained that \"[t]he standard was and remains\n\nwhether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice\n\namong the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\"\n\nNorth Carolina v. Alford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108215\"><a href=\"/opinion/108215/north-carolina-v-alford/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (1970).   More recently,\n\n\n4\n   The appellant does not contest the other elements of the Teeter\ntest, i.e., the scope of the waiver or the Rule 11 colloquy. He\nlimits his contention to Teeter's miscarriage of justice prong.\n\n                                -9-\n\fwe have stated that \"the accused must have understood the charges\n\nagainst him and the spectrum of possible penalties to which an\n\nadmission of guilt will expose him.\" United States v. Jimenez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203091\"><a href=\"/opinion/203091/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            None of this helps the appellant.            The central hurdle\n\nRodríguez faces on appeal is that the prosecutor's statement to\n\nwhich he draws our attention occurred at sentencing, i.e., months\n\nafter he had already decided to plead guilty.                  Rodríguez was\n\nsentenced on December 1, 2009, but the change-of-plea hearing took\n\nplace approximately four months earlier, on July 22 of that year.\n\nTherefore,    even   though   he    is    surely   correct   that   \"erroneous\n\ninformation\" which \"dramatically alter[s] the sentencing stakes for\n\nthe defendant\" may bear on whether someone who has pleaded guilty\n\nwill be allowed to subsequently withdraw his plea, United States v.\n\nRivera-Maldonado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203718\"><a href=\"/opinion/203718/united-states-v-rivera-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 2009), we do not see\n\nhow the misstatement identified by the appellant -- no matter how\n\negregious it may or may not have been -- could have affected his\n\ndecision to accept the government's proffer.5\n\n            During the plea hearing, the district court ensured that\n\nRodríguez    understood what       he    was   being charged with     and   the\n\nconsequences of a guilty plea, and that he had discussed his\n\noptions with his attorney.         He admitted to committing the charged\n\n\n5\n   Rodríguez has not alleged that his decision to plead guilty was\naffected by any purported misstatement by the prosecution prior to\nsentencing.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcrimes, and stated that he understood the penalties he might\n\nreceive.6     Rodríguez does not claim, and the record does not\n\nindicate, that the prosecutor advised him that the applicable\n\nguidelines range was 107 to 131 months prior to or during the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing.\n\n             The pro se motions filed by Rodríguez after the change-\n\nof-plea hearing        do   not    undermine       this conclusion.      In those\n\nmotions, Rodríguez insisted that aggravated identity theft under\n\n§ 1028A was not meant to apply to someone in his situation, and\n\nthat he should have been charged with a lesser offense, with\n\nreduced sentencing exposure.                Nothing in these motions suggests\n\nthat his decision to plead guilty was obscured by misinformation as\n\nto the sentence he might receive after trial.               In his pro se filing\n\nof October 13, 2009, Rodríguez complains that the government's\n\noffer of twenty-four months was too long, but that he was informed\n\nby   his    attorney    that      if   he    did   not   accept   the   plea,   the\n\nprosecutor's office could increase the sentence.7                  Rodríguez was\n\n\n6\n   This is not to say that there were no misstatements at the\nchange-of-plea hearing. During this hearing, the prosecutor stated\nthat the statutory penalty for Rodríguez's guilty plea under\n§ 1028A was between two and fifteen years. As the government now\nconcedes, § 1028A provides a fixed term of two years for all non-\nterrorism related offenses. However, Rodríguez does not argue that\nhis decision to accept the plea bargain was affected by this\nmisstatement, and we correspondingly deem any argument to that\neffect waived.\n7\n  It is not clear whether Rodríguez, or his attorney, is referring\nto the possibility of a harsher outcome after trial, or to the\npossibility that the proffer might be replaced with a less\n\n                                            -11-\n\fnot misinformed:     even if the parties disagree as to how much more,\n\nit is undisputed that the charges Rodríguez faced did in fact\n\nexpose him to over twenty-four months' imprisonment.                   Rodríguez\n\ncomplained in other pro se filings that his lawyer recommended that\n\nhe sign the plea agreement, despite the fact that the crime charged\n\nwas, in Rodríguez's view, inapposite to his case.               At no point in\n\nthese motions did Rodríguez assert that his decision to accept the\n\ngovernment proffer and plead guilty was influenced by a government-\n\ninduced misunderstanding of the sentence he could receive after\n\ntrial.8\n\n             We conclude that, because the prosecutor's statement was\n\nmade months after the appellant decided to plead guilty, the\n\nprosecutor's overestimate of the applicable guidelines range did\n\nnot   render     Rodríguez's    decision     to   plead    guilty      unknowing,\n\nunintelligent or involuntary.         In light of this conclusion, the\n\ndispute between the parties as to what the precise guidelines range\n\nwould     have   been,   had   appellant    proceeded     to   trial    and   been\n\nconvicted on all counts, is moot.\n\n\n\n\nfavorable one if he balked.\n8\n   The closest Rodríguez comes to making such an assertion is in a\nstatement contained in his notice of appeal, filed shortly after\nsentencing, in which he stated that his lawyer never explained to\nhim the nature of § 1028A, and that \"they could hit me with 0 to 15\nyears.\"\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                               III.\n\n          For the reasons given above, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Rodríguez's motions to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea.   The same reasons lead us to believe that enforcing\n\nthe appellate waiver would not work a miscarriage of justice under\n\nTeeter. We affirm Rodriguez's conviction and sentence, and dismiss\n\nthe appeal.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f</pre>",
