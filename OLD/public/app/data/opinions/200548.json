(CAS) filed a voluntary petition for\n\nreorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101 et seq. (2003), resulting in an automatic stay pursuant to\n\n11 U.S.C. § 362.       CAS appeals from the judgment of the district\n\ncourt affirming the holding of the bankruptcy court that a consent\n\norder between CAS and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Caribbean, Inc.\n\n(MMSC) modifying the automatic stay permitted the termination of\n\nthe dealership relationship between CAS and MMSC.             We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           MMSC is the exclusive distributor of Mitsubishi and\n\nHyundai products in Puerto Rico; CAS is a servicing dealer of\n\nMitsubishi and Hyundai brand motor vehicles.                The relationship\n\nbetween   MMSC   and    CAS   is   governed    by   a   Servicing   Dealership\n\nAgreement (SDA).       Although MMSC and CAS have been embroiled in\n\nlegal disputes since 1994, this particular dispute arises out of\n\nCAS's voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the\n\nBankruptcy Code.       Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), such a petition\n\ngives rise to an automatic stay against \"the commencement or\n\ncontinuation . . . of a judicial, administrative, or other action\n\nor proceeding against the debtor.\"            This stay prevented MMSC from\n\ninvoking the termination provisions of the SDA and terminating the\n\ndealership relationship between MMSC and CAS.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            On January 26, 2001, MMSC filed a motion to dismiss CAS's\n\npetition    for    Chapter    11    reorganization      for   bad   faith1   or,\n\nalternatively, to modify the automatic stay to allow MMSC to\n\narbitrate    the   issue     of    just   cause   for   termination    of    the\n\ndistribution relationship.          A hearing on this motion was scheduled\n\nfor February 15, 2001.            However, a couple of days prior to the\n\nhearing, the parties agreed to negotiate a settlement of the issues\n\nraised by MMSC's motion. The parties understood this settlement to\n\nbe \"a precondition to commencing good-faith negotiations for the\n\nsettlement of all past, present and future claims between the\n\nparties.\" On the afternoon of February 12, 2001, the attorneys met\n\nin the offices of Attorney Charles A. Cuprill Hernandez, counsel\n\nfor CAS,2 and Cuprill drafted a consent order embodying the terms\n\n\n     1\n       The motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition for bad faith\nwas based on the allegation that CAS had filed the petition to\npreempt certain for-cause termination of the dealership agreement.\nIn its motion, MMSC alleges that CAS was caught\n\n            attempting to bribe the expert appointed by\n            the   [arbitration]   panel  into   certifying\n            fraudulent claims it had made against MMSC in\n            an ongoing arbitration between the parties. .\n            . . It is only out of the desperation\n            resulting from the uncontroverted evidence\n            supporting the bribery charge that, a month\n            after a hearing on the matter and three days\n            after briefs on the issue were submitted, the\n            [Chapter 11] petition in the instant case was\n            filed. . . . The purpose of this bankruptcy is\n            clear: to delay the termination of the\n            distribution relationship.\n     2\n        There is conflicting information in the record concerning\nthe length of the February 12 meeting. Attorney Michael J. Rovell,\n\n                                       -3-\n\fof the negotiated agreement, which the parties submitted to the\n\nbankruptcy court for approval.   The order, entered on February 13,\n\n2001, by the bankruptcy court without change, reads as follows:\n\n          This Court hereby modifies the stay provisions\n          of 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) in order to allow\n          Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Caribbean, Inc.\n          (\"MMSC\"), to give notice of termination to\n          Debtor of MMSC's dealership relationship\n          therewith and proceed with arbitration as to\n          the    termination     of    the    dealership\n          relationship.\n\n          On February 15, 2001, MMSC sent CAS a letter notifying\n\nCAS of the termination of the dealership relationship between MMSC\n\nand CAS, effective March 17, 2001.     The following day, MMSC filed\n\nan action with an arbitration panel3 requesting a finding that the\n\ntermination was for just cause and, therefore, that CAS was not\n\nentitled to any damages under Act 75 of Puerto Rico's Dealer's Act,\n\n10 P.R. Laws Ann. § 278 et seq. (2002).      On March 19, 2001, CAS\n\nfiled an urgent motion to stay the termination of the dealership\n\nrelationship on the grounds that the termination violated the\n\nautomatic stay and, in the alternative, that it violated the\n\nconsent order.   The bankruptcy court denied the motion without\n\n\ncounsel for Charlie LaCosta, President of CAS, testified that the\nmeeting lasted between half an hour and an hour. Attorney Charles\nA. Cuprill Hernandez, counsel for CAS, testified that the meeting\nlasted between three and four and a half hours.\n     3\n        The SDA provides for resolution of disputes between the\nparties by arbitration in accordance with the rules and regulations\nof the American Arbitration Association. An arbitration panel had\nbeen appointed in accordance with these provisions to oversee a\nprevious proceeding commenced by CAS against MMSC in 1994.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fprejudice to CAS filing it as an adversary proceeding, which CAS\n\ndid on March 21, 2001.        On May 24, 2001, after holding hearings on\n\nMay 14 and 18, the bankruptcy court ruled in a bench decision that\n\nthe consent order modified the automatic stay and provided for\n\nactual termination of the dealership relationship between MMSC and\n\nCAS.     Finding \"ample evidentiary support in the record\" for the\n\nfindings of the bankruptcy court, the district court subsequently\n\naffirmed the decision.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            \"In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy\n\ncourt    order,   this     court   independently        reviews   the   bankruptcy\n\ncourt's decision,        ordinarily    applying     the    'clearly     erroneous'\n\nstandard to findings of fact and de novo review to conclusions of\n\nlaw.\"     Stoehr v. Mohammed Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud, 244 F.3d 206,\n\n207-08 (1st Cir. 2001).        CAS argues that, contrary to the decision\n\nof the bankruptcy court, the terms of the consent order do not\n\nprovide    for    actual    termination      of   the    dealership     agreement.\n\nRather, they modify the stay to allow MMSC to commence arbitration\n\nproceedings to determine whether there was just cause for the\n\ntermination of the dealership relationship. The relationship would\n\nremain unaltered until the arbitration panel decided the just cause\n\nissue.     MMSC defends the bankruptcy court's determination that,\n\nconsistent with the terms of the SDA, the language \"notice of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ftermination\"   in   the   consent   order       allowed    MMSC    to    actually\n\nterminate the dealership relationship.\n\n          The bankruptcy court determined that the consent order\n\nwas a \"compromise settlement governed by 31 Laws of Puerto Rico\n\nAnnotated 482\" whose scope \"depends upon the meaning of the phrase\n\n'notice of termination.'\"     A court's interpretation of a contract\n\nor consent order is reviewed for clear error \"if the writing is\n\nsubject to more than one reasonable interpretation,\" Gel Systems,\n\nInc. v. Hyundai Eng'g & Constr. Co., 902 F.2d 1024, 1027 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), or if the court relies on extrinsic evidence such as the\n\nparties' intent.    Wainwright Bank & Trust Co. v. Boulos, 89 F.3d\n\n17, 23 (1st Cir. 1996); see also Servicios Comerciales Andinos,\n\nS.A. v. GE Del Caribe, 145 F.3d 463, 469 (1st Cir. 1998).                     The\n\nbankruptcy court interpreted \"notice of termination\" by reference\n\nto the parties' intent \"judged by considering the actions of the\n\nparties at the time of the agreement and [] thereafter.\"                 Thus we\n\nreview the bankruptcy court's determination of the scope of the\n\nconsent order for clear error.\n\n          Except    for   situations      not   relevant    to    this    appeal,\n\nArticle X of the SDA requires MMSC to give CAS written notice\n\nbefore it terminates the dealership relationship.                Notice must be\n\ngiven either thirty or ninety days prior to actual termination,\n\ndepending upon CAS's offending conduct.               This pre-termination\n\nnotice is referred to in Article X of the SDA as \"notice of\n\n                                    -6-\n\ftermination.\" MMSC argues that the term \"notice of termination\" in\n\nthe consent order carries the same meaning as the term in Article\n\nX of the SDA: it contemplates a notice period prior to actual\n\ntermination of the dealership relationship.              CAS argues that the\n\nterm \"notice of termination\" in the consent order does not refer\n\nback to the SDA and merely requires MMSC to give CAS prior notice\n\nof   its   intention   to     arbitrate   the    issue   of   just   cause   for\n\ntermination of the dealership agreement.             According to CAS, only\n\nafter the arbitration panel has determined that there is just cause\n\ncan MMSC actually terminate the dealership relationship.\n\n            Taking     into     consideration      the    entirety     of    the\n\nrelationship between MMSC and CAS, the bankruptcy court concluded\n\nthat \"notice of termination\" was a term of art to be understood in\n\nthe context of Article X of the SDA.            Because the SDA was the most\n\nimportant document governing the relationship between MMSC and CAS,\n\nand because the attorneys for both MMSC and CAS were familiar with\n\nthe terms of the SDA, it was reasonable for the bankruptcy court to\n\nfind that CAS's use of the term \"notice of termination\" in the\n\nconsent order was consistent with the meaning embodied in the SDA,\n\nand hence contemplated an actual termination of the dealership\n\nrelationship after the requisite notice period.\n\n            The bankruptcy court supported this interpretation of the\n\nintent of the parties by reference to CAS's actions subsequent to\n\nthe drafting of the consent order.              On February 15, 2001, three\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdays after the consent order was executed, MMSC gave CAS notice of\n\ntermination, making clear that termination would become effective\n\non March 17, 2001.         On February 16, 2001, as stipulated by the\n\nconsent order, MMSC filed before the arbitration panel a request\n\nfor a declaratory judgment determining that the termination of the\n\nrelationship was for just cause.          In the month leading up to the\n\ntermination date, MMSC sent letters to CAS regarding the procedures\n\nto be followed in preparation for termination, and published\n\nadvertisements in various newspapers advising the public that CAS\n\nwould cease to be an MMSC servicing dealer effective March 17,\n\n2001.   Throughout these preparations for termination CAS remained\n\nsilent.   CAS did not file a motion to stay termination of the\n\ndealership agreement until March 19, when representatives of MMSC\n\nentered the premises of CAS to remove signs, logos and various\n\nequipment.    As an explanation for this passivity, CAS offered the\n\nimplausible argument that it thought MMSC was merely \"posturing.\"\n\nCAS's inaction for over thirty days confirms the bankruptcy court's\n\nconclusion    that   CAS    understood    that   the   phrase   \"notice   of\n\ntermination\" contemplated actual termination at the completion of\n\nthe notice period.\n\n             Although CAS argued that it \"would never have signed a\n\ndocument specially after filing Chapter 11, that [] would have\n\nresulted in the liquidation of appellant's primordial asset from\n\nwhich it expected to fully reorganize,\" the bankruptcy court found\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f\"no evidence of [these assertions] other than the argument of\n\ncounsel.\"      The bankruptcy court's conclusion that CAS agreed to\n\nactual termination of the dealership relationship is not, as CAS\n\nsuggests, illogical.          CAS gained something of value from the\n\nconsent order--MMSC's agreement to abandon its motion for dismissal\n\nof CAS's bankruptcy petition, and to pursue good-faith negotiations\n\nfor the settlement of all outstanding disputes between the parties.\n\nGiven   the    ample    evidentiary    support    in   the   record   for   the\n\ndetermination that the consent order modified the automatic stay\n\nand   provided    for     actual   termination,   the   bankruptcy    court's\n\ninterpretation of the consent order is not clearly erroneous.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Because the SDA was the most important document governing the relationship between MMSC and CAS, and because the attorneys for both MMSC and CAS were familiar with the terms of the SDA, it was reasonable for the bankruptcy court to find that CAS's use of the term \"notice of termination\" in the consent order was consistent with the meaning embodied in the SDA, and hence contemplated an actual termination of the dealership relationship after the requisite notice period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court supported this interpretation of the intent of the parties by reference to CAS's actions subsequent to the drafting of the consent order. On February 15, 2001, three days after the consent order was executed, MMSC gave CAS notice of termination, making clear that termination would become effective on March 17, 2001. On February 16, 2001, as stipulated by the consent order, MMSC filed before the arbitration panel a request for a declaratory judgment determining that the termination of the relationship was for just cause. In the month leading up to the termination date, MMSC sent letters to CAS regarding the procedures to be followed in preparation for termination, and published advertisements in various newspapers advising the public that CAS would cease to be an MMSC servicing dealer effective March 17, 2001. Throughout these preparations for termination CAS remained silent. CAS did not file a motion to stay termination of the dealership agreement until March 19, when representatives of MMSC entered the premises of CAS to remove signs, logos and various equipment. As an explanation for this passivity, CAS offered the implausible argument that it thought MMSC was merely \"posturing.\" CAS's inaction for over thirty days confirms the bankruptcy court's conclusion that CAS understood that the phrase \"notice of termination\" contemplated actual termination at the completion of the notice period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although CAS argued that it \"would never have signed a document specially after filing Chapter 11, that [] would have resulted in the liquidation of appellant's primordial asset from which it expected to fully reorganize,\" the bankruptcy court found \"no evidence of [these assertions] other than the argument of counsel.\" The bankruptcy court's conclusion that CAS agreed to actual termination of the dealership relationship is not, as CAS suggests, illogical. CAS gained something of value from the consent order &#8212; MMSC's agreement to abandon its motion for dismissal of CAS's bankruptcy petition, and to pursue good-faith negotiations for the settlement of all outstanding disputes between the parties. Given the ample evidentiary support in the record for the determination that the consent order modified the automatic stay and provided for actual termination, the bankruptcy court's interpretation of the consent order is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition for bad faith was based on the allegation that CAS had filed the petition to preempt certain for-cause termination of the dealership agreement.

(CAS) filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 <i>et seq.</i> (2003), resulting in an automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362. CAS appeals from the judgment of the district court affirming the holding of the bankruptcy court that a consent order between CAS and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Caribbean, Inc. (MMSC) modifying the automatic stay permitted the termination of the dealership relationship between CAS and MMSC. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MMSC is the exclusive distributor of Mitsubishi and Hyundai products in Puerto Rico; CAS is a servicing dealer of Mitsubishi and Hyundai brand motor vehicles. The relationship between MMSC and CAS is governed by a Servicing Dealership Agreement (SDA). Although MMSC and CAS have been embroiled in legal disputes since 1994, this particular dispute arises out of CAS's voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), such a petition gives rise to an automatic stay against \"the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor.\" This stay prevented MMSC from invoking the termination provisions of the SDA and terminating the dealership relationship between MMSC and CAS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 26, 2001, MMSC filed a motion to dismiss CAS's petition for Chapter 11 reorganization for bad faith<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> or, alternatively, to modify the automatic stay to allow MMSC to arbitrate the issue of just cause for termination of the distribution relationship. A hearing on this motion was scheduled for February 15, 2001. However, a couple of days prior to the hearing, the parties agreed to negotiate a settlement of the issues raised by MMSC's motion. The parties understood this settlement to be \"a precondition to commencing good-faith negotiations for the settlement of all past, present and future claims between the parties.\" On the afternoon of February 12, 2001, the attorneys met in the offices of Attorney Charles A. Cuprill Hernandez, counsel for CAS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and Cuprill drafted a consent order embodying the terms of the negotiated agreement, which the parties submitted to the bankruptcy court for approval. The order, entered on February 13, 2001, by the bankruptcy court without change, reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court hereby modifies the stay provisions of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a) in order to allow Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Caribbean, Inc. (\"MMSC\"), to give notice of termination to Debtor of MMSC's dealership relationship therewith and proceed with arbitration as to the termination of the dealership relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 2001, MMSC sent CAS a letter notifying CAS of the termination of the dealership relationship between MMSC and CAS, effective March 17, 2001. The following day, MMSC filed an action with an arbitration panel<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> requesting a finding that the termination was for just cause and, therefore, that CAS was not entitled to any damages under Act 75 of Puerto Rico's Dealer's Act, 10 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 278 <i>et seq.</i> (2002). On March 19, 2001, CAS filed an urgent motion to stay the termination of the dealership relationship on the grounds that the termination violated the automatic stay and, in the alternative, that it violated the consent order. The bankruptcy court denied the motion without prejudice to CAS filing it as an adversary proceeding, which CAS did on March 21, 2001. On May 24, 2001, after holding hearings on May 14 and 18, the bankruptcy court ruled in a bench decision that the consent order modified the automatic stay and provided for actual termination of the dealership relationship between MMSC and CAS. Finding \"ample evidentiary support in the record\" for the findings of the bankruptcy court, the district court subsequently affirmed the decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In an appeal from district court review of a bankruptcy court order, this court independently reviews the bankruptcy court's decision, ordinarily applying the `clearly erroneous' standard to findings of fact and de novo review to conclusions of law.\" <i>Stoehr v. Mohamed Bin Bander Abdul Rahman Al Saud,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199350\"><a href=\"/opinion/199350/stoehr-v-prince-mohamed-bin/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 207-08 (1st Cir.2001). CAS argues that, contrary to the decision of the bankruptcy court, the terms of the consent order do not provide for actual termination of the dealership agreement. Rather, they modify the stay to allow MMSC to commence arbitration proceedings to determine whether there was just cause for the termination of the dealership relationship. The relationship would remain unaltered until the arbitration panel decided the just cause issue. MMSC defends the bankruptcy court's determination that, consistent with the terms of the SDA, the language \"notice of termination\" in the consent order allowed MMSC to actually terminate the dealership relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court determined that the consent order was a \"compromise settlement governed by 31 Laws of Puerto Rico Annotated 482\" whose scope \"depends upon the meaning of the phrase `notice of termination.'\" A court's interpretation of a contract or consent order is reviewed for clear error \"if the writing is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,\" <i>Gel Systems, Inc. v.

The bankruptcy court interpreted \"notice of termination\" by reference to the parties' intent \"judged by considering the actions of the parties at the time of the agreement and [] thereafter.\" Thus we review the bankruptcy court's determination of the scope of the consent order for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except for situations not relevant to this appeal, Article X of the SDA requires MMSC to give CAS written notice before it terminates the dealership relationship. Notice must be given either thirty or ninety days prior to actual termination, depending upon CAS's offending conduct. This pre-termination notice is referred to in Article X of the SDA as \"notice of termination.\" MMSC argues that the term \"notice of termination\" in the consent order carries the same meaning as the term in Article X of the SDA: it contemplates a notice period prior to actual termination of the dealership relationship. CAS argues that the term \"notice of termination\" in the consent order does not refer back to the SDA and merely requires MMSC to give CAS prior notice of its intention to arbitrate the issue of just cause for termination of the dealership agreement. According to CAS, only after the arbitration panel has determined that there is just cause can MMSC actually terminate the dealership relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into consideration the entirety of the relationship between MMSC and CAS, the bankruptcy court concluded that \"notice of termination\" was a term of art to be understood in the context of Article X of the SDA. Because the SDA was the most important document governing the relationship between MMSC and CAS, and because the attorneys for both MMSC and CAS were familiar with the terms of the SDA, it was reasonable for the bankruptcy court to find that CAS's use of the term \"notice of termination\" in the consent order was consistent with the meaning embodied in the SDA, and hence contemplated an actual termination of the dealership relationship after the requisite notice period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court supported this interpretation of the intent of the parties by reference to CAS's actions subsequent to the drafting of the consent order.
