R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 01-2290\n\n                      RICHARD MAX STRAHAN,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                      PAUL FRAZIER, ET AL.,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n               Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Richard Max Strahan on brief pro se.\n     Joseph L. Tehan, Jr., Katharine Goree Doyle and Kopelman and\nPaige, P.C. on brief for appellees Town of Braintree, Frazier,\nSellgren, Sanderson.\n     Douglas I. Louison, Regina M. Ryan and Merrick, Louison &\nCostello on brief for appellee Karen MacAleese.\n\n\n                         March 21, 2003\n\f          Per Curiam. Richard Max Strahan brought a civil rights\n\naction against Braintree police officers alleging that on October\n\n31, 2000, they improperly prevented him from gathering signatures\n\non a ballot initiative petition and collecting donations at the\n\nSouth Shore Plaza Shopping Mall by arresting him in violation of\n\nthe First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution\n\nas well as rights under the Massachusetts constitution.1                 The\n\ndistrict court granted partial summary judgment for defendants,\n\nfinding, inter alia, that the Plaza is private property and hence\n\nnot subject to the First Amendment.      However, the court found that\n\nArticle 48 of the Articles of Amendment of the Massachusetts\n\nconstitution   protects   the   right   to   gather   signatures   for   an\n\ninitiative petition in a private shopping mall, at least in an\n\nunobtrusive and reasonable manner, and that there were material\n\nissues of fact as to whether Strahan was collecting signatures\n\npeacefully and, relatedly, whether he was arrested without probable\n\ncause. Following a jury trial, the district court entered judgment\n\nfor defendants.   This appeal followed.\n\n          Strahan challenges the district court's summary judgment\n\nruling that there was no First Amendment violation; the district\n\ncourt's failure to resolve his claim that collecting donations is\n\n\n\n     1\n      The complaint also references a 1992 incident. However, the\n     district court ruled that Strahan's claim with respect to this\n     earlier incident is time-barred, and Strahan has not\n     challenged this ruling.\n\n                                  -2-\n\falso protected activity under the state constitution; the district\n\ncourt's denial of his motion for additional time for discovery\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f); the jury instruction on probable\n\ncause for an arrest for state criminal trespass; and the district\n\ncourt's failure to grant his requests for preliminary and permanent\n\ninjunctive relief.        Defendants-appellees have not cross-appealed\n\nfrom   the    district        court's   ruling    that    the   Massachusetts\n\nconstitution protects petitioning in a private shopping mall.\n\n             We uphold the rejection of Strahan's First Amendment\n\nclaim at summary judgment essentially for the reasons stated by the\n\ndistrict court.        The First Amendment does not prevent a property\n\nowner from restricting the exercise of free speech on private\n\nproperty, including a private shopping mall.             See Hudgens v. NLRB,\n\n424 U.S. 507, 513-21 (1976).             At summary judgment, defendants\n\nsubmitted evidence that the Plaza requested Braintree police to\n\ndirect Strahan to leave the premises.            We have previously rejected\n\nattempts, such as Strahan's, to create a First Amendment right of\n\naccess based on allegations of conspiracy or collusion between the\n\nprivate owner and police officers.               See Cape Cod Nursing Home\n\nCouncil v. Rambling Rose Rest Home, 667 F.2d 238, 242 (1st Cir.\n\n1981); see also Kay v. New Hampshire Democratic Party, 821 F.2d 31,\n\n34 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n             The district court's stated reason for not resolving the\n\nquestion     whether    the    state    constitution     protects   soliciting\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdonations in a private shopping mall--namely, that \"it is unclear\n\nwhether the parties dispute whether Strahan was actually collecting\n\ndonations\"--appears to reflect a ripeness determination.               The\n\nrecord is clear that Strahan was not, in fact, collecting donations\n\nat the time of the arrest, though he has collected donations at the\n\nPlaza in the past in violation of Plaza policy.        We think that the\n\ndistrict court properly refrained from reaching the question given\n\nthe uncertainty in the record as to what form his \"disobedience\"\n\nhas taken in the past and might take in the future, see Blanchette\n\nv. Connecticut Gen. Ins. Corps., 419 U.S. 102, 143 n.29 (1974),\n\n(listing as factors for case-by-case ripeness determination, inter\n\nalia, the certainty that \"disobedience\" will take a particular\n\nform), and the fact that the question involves a complex, unsettled\n\nissue of state law, cf. 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(c)(1) (district court may\n\ndecline supplemental jurisdiction if a claim raises a novel or\n\ncomplex issue of state law); 13A Wright, Miller, & Cooper, Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure ยง 3532.5 at 191 (2d Ed. 1984) (suggesting that\n\nit is appropriate to consider deference to state institutions\n\neither as part of a ripeness determination or as an independent\n\nmatter of abstention doctrine).\n\n          Strahan's remaining contentions do not require extended\n\ndiscussion.   He   makes   no   developed   argument   directed   at   the\n\ndistrict court's reasons in rejecting his request for additional\n\ntime for discovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) and, thus, the issue\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fis waived.     See Donovan v. City of Haverhill, 311 F.3d 74, 76 (1st\n\nCir.   2002)    (issues   averted   to    in   a   perfunctory   fashion,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived).   Strahan did not interpose a timely objection to the jury\n\ncharge, and we see no plain error in the instruction that a police\n\nofficer can convey an owner's request to leave the premises.\n\nSee Chestnut v. City of Lowell, 305 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(plain error review).     Finally, the challenge to the denial of a\n\npreliminary injunction is moot, see Chaparro v. Int'l Longshoreman\n\nAss'n, 983 F.2d 325, 331 n.5 (1st Cir. 1992), and, having lost at\n\ntrial, Strahan was not entitled to a permanent injunction.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
