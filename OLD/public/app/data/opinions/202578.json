In a split decision, a jury\n\nacquitted defendant-appellant Anthony Gobbi on three counts of a\n\nfive-count indictment but convicted him of conspiracy and one\n\nsubstantive drug-trafficking charge.                    On appeal, Gobbi mounts a\n\nthree-pronged      attack,    challenging         (i)    the   sufficiency     of   the\n\nevidence underpinning one of the two counts of conviction; (ii) an\n\nevidentiary       ruling;    and     (iii)    two       sentencing      enhancements.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that Gobbi's arguments are devoid of merit,\n\nwe affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            This    case     grows    out    of     a    reverse    sting    operation\n\nconceived    by    the   Federal     Bureau    of       Investigation    (FBI).     We\n\nrehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the\n\njury's verdict on the counts of conviction, consistent with record\n\nsupport. See United States v. Maldonado-García, 446 F.3d 227, 229\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            On June 29, 2000, an FBI agent, Michael McGowan, posing\n\nas a wealthy businessman, met with Robert Nardolillo (a suspected\n\nunderworld    figure).       McGowan    said      that     his     business    partner\n\n(\"Manny\") wanted to enter the New England drug trade and could\n\nsupply Nardolillo with copious amounts of drugs.                            Nardolillo\n\nexpressed interest and acknowledged that he could handle two to\n\nthree kilograms of cocaine per week, and possibly more.                       The men\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fagreed to meet again so that McGowan could introduce his apocryphal\n\npartner to Nardolillo.\n\n            That    fall,   Nardolillo      and    Gobbi    traveled     to     Ft.\n\nLauderdale, Florida.        They met McGowan there on September 28.\n\nAfter McGowan explained that \"Manny\" was unavoidably detained,\n\nGobbi left.        McGowan and Nardolillo nonetheless proceeded to\n\ndiscuss the planned venture.\n\n            Thereafter, McGowan and Nardolillo spoke regularly by\n\ntelephone    about    the   prospects       of    doing    business    together.\n\nNardolillo instructed McGowan to contact him through his associates\n\n(including Gobbi), and Gobbi in fact acted as an intermediary for\n\nsixteen of the seventeen contacts between McGowan and Nardolillo in\n\nJanuary of 2001.\n\n            On January 15, 2001, Nardolillo and Gobbi finally came\n\nface to face with \"Manny\" (in reality, another undercover FBI\n\nagent). This meeting took place at Centerfolds, a Providence strip\n\nclub.   Following     the   initial     introduction,       Nardolillo        spoke\n\nprivately with \"Manny\" for about an hour.\n\n            On January 22, McGowan approached Nardolillo about a\n\npossible drug-protection detail.         The idea was that Nardolillo and\n\nhis crew would guard a cache of cocaine temporarily located in\n\nRhode Island en route to distribution throughout New England.\n\nNardolillo readily agreed.        McGowan and Nardolillo settled on\n\nremuneration at the rate of $500 per kilogram for the protective\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdetail.    On March 15, Nardolillo assured McGowan that \"I'll put my\n\nguys there, don't worry.          There'll be somebody there to watch\n\n[Manny's] stuff all the time.\"           Switching to a different topic,\n\nMcGowan informed Nardolillo that \"Manny\" did not yet have five\n\nkilograms of cocaine that Nardolillo had expressed interest in\n\nbuying for his own distribution network.\n\n            On April 1, McGowan, Nardolillo, and Gobbi met at a\n\nfuneral.     Because law enforcement officers were surveilling the\n\nscene, Gobbi escorted McGowan into an office so that he (McGowan)\n\ncould confer privately with Nardolillo about the particulars of the\n\ndrug-protection detail.      Later that month, Nardolillo told McGowan\n\nthat he would assign \"two guys\" to the drug-protection detail; that\n\nboth would be well-rested; that the man directly guarding the drug\n\ncache   would    be   prepared    to   kill   if   necessary;    and   that   he\n\n(Nardolillo) would divide the agreed payment between the two\n\noperatives.     McGowan informed Nardolillo that \"Manny\" wanted a gun\n\ndisplayed for a show of force, but that it was not to be fired.\n\n            The drug-protection detail was scheduled for April 30.\n\nAccording to Clifford Falla, Gobbi recruited him for this job.                On\n\nthe   assigned    date,   Gobbi    and   Falla     met   with   Nardolillo    at\n\nCenterfolds.      Nardolillo told the pair that he had arranged for a\n\ndrug-protection detail at a local hotel and that Falla was to guard\n\nthe drugs.       In Gobbi's presence, Nardolillo gave Falla a nine-\n\nmillimeter pistol and directed him to display it while on guard.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fNardolillo explained that Gobbi would lead Falla to the hotel and\n\nwait outside.\n\n           During the course of the day, McGowan and Nardolillo met\n\nseveral times.         At 2:00 p.m., McGowan told Nardolillo that a\n\nfifteen-kilogram shipment of cocaine was en route from Boston; that\n\nonce the drugs arrived, two men working for \"Manny\" would measure,\n\nsubdivide, and package the cocaine in the hotel room; and that\n\nanother man working for \"Manny\" would team up with Nardolillo's man\n\nto stand guard inside the room.            Nardolillo replied: \"I trust my\n\ntwo people.\"    He also remarked that he would have preferred to have\n\n\"both my guys\" in the room but that, given the arrangement devised\n\nby \"Manny,\" Falla would be the one to stand guard.\n\n           Around 6:55 p.m., Nardolillo told McGowan that his two\n\nhenchmen   were   on    their   way   to   Centerfolds   for   a   last-minute\n\nbriefing. After Nardolillo received a telephone call (later traced\n\nto Gobbi's cell phone), he informed McGowan that his henchmen were\n\noutside the club.        Nardolillo proceeded to leave the building,\n\npresumably to convey his final instructions.\n\n           When Nardolillo finished, Falla (driving his own car)\n\nfollowed Gobbi (driving his own car) to a nearby Marriott hotel.\n\nIn caravan fashion, Gobbi's nephew (Brian King) and another man\n\n(Christopher Chapman) followed Falla in a third vehicle.              Once in\n\nthe hotel parking lot, Gobbi gave Falla the keycard to the room and\n\nreminded him to display his gun.           Falla, King, and Chapman entered\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe hotel, while Gobbi took up a position at a gas station across\n\nthe street.\n\n            Once inside the room, Falla displayed his gun and then\n\nplaced it in plain view on the bed.           The undercover agents posing\n\nas drug packagers spent the next five hours measuring out seventeen\n\nkilograms   of   what   appeared   to    be    cocaine1   and   transporting\n\ncontainers out of the room.        When one of the agents asked Falla\n\nabout the black Cadillac sedan parked outside (a reference to\n\nGobbi's automobile), Falla explained: \"I basically work for the guy\n\nin the Cadillac and . . . him and I are under [Nardolillo].\"\n\n            At some point during the evening, Nardolillo learned that\n\nFalla wanted to leave his post.          Nardolillo instructed Gobbi to\n\ndeny this request.      He then told McGowan that \"Tony\" — which the\n\njury reasonably could have found was a reference to Gobbi — wanted\n\nto discuss exactly what should be done about Falla.\n\n            Immediately thereafter, Gobbi repaired to Centerfolds and\n\nconferred with Nardolillo and McGowan outside the club. Nardolillo\n\ndirected Gobbi to input a telephone number into his cell phone;\n\nthis number, provided by McGowan, linked to one of the undercover\n\nagents who was toiling in the hotel room.                 Then, still using\n\nGobbi's telephone, Nardolillo called the room and spoke with Falla.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In point of fact, the substance was not cocaine but a mere\nimitation. For ease in exposition, however, we nonetheless refer\nto it as cocaine.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fGobbi thereafter placed four separate calls to the same number over\n\nthe course of the evening.\n\n            The drug-protection detail concluded just after 1:00 a.m.\n\non the morning of May 1.   Falla called Gobbi, who instructed him to\n\nreturn to Centerfolds.     Nardolillo debriefed Falla and Gobbi, and\n\nthen forked over $1,500 (to be divided as they saw fit).    Falla and\n\nGobbi later hid the gun in a barn owned by Gobbi's girlfriend.\n\n            On the same day, McGowan paid Nardolillo $4,500 (somewhat\n\nless than the agreed $500 per kilogram).    Nardolillo talked freely\n\nwith McGowan about his arrangements for the prior evening's drug-\n\nprotection detail. Pertinently, he mentioned that Gobbi's role was\n\nto keep an eye on things from outside the hotel, while Falla's role\n\nwas to stand guard inside the room.     Nardolillo described Gobbi as\n\n\"one of my right-hand\" men and recounted how Gobbi had responded\n\nwhen it appeared that Falla might abandon his post.        Nardolillo\n\nalso said that he would pass along the evening's profits to his\n\ncrew (Gobbi, Falla, King, and Chapman).\n\n            A second, somewhat similar drug-protection detail took\n\nplace on August 22. On this occasion, Gobbi once again recruited\n\nFalla; Nardolillo once again gave Falla a handgun in Gobbi's\n\npresence.    The detail was to take place at the Crowne Plaza hotel\n\nin Warwick, Rhode Island.    On the assigned date, McGowan handed a\n\nkeycard for the designated room to Nardolillo, who gave it to Gobbi\n\nand instructed him to proceed with Falla to the hotel.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f           What followed was substantially similar to what had\n\ntranspired on April 30, except that Gobbi did not remain at the\n\nsite but, rather, called Falla several times during the course of\n\nthe detail.   When the job was completed, Gobbi picked up Falla and\n\ndrove to Centerfolds.     With Gobbi nearby, McGowan paid $3,300 to\n\nNardolillo.   Nardolillo, in turn, paid $750 apiece to Gobbi and\n\nFalla, who then stashed the gun in the same barn.\n\n           In due season, a federal grand jury returned a five-count\n\nindictment charging Nardolillo, Gobbi, and Falla with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and possess cocaine with intent to distribute (count 1),\n\ntwo counts of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to\n\ndistribute (counts 2 and 4), and two counts of possession of a\n\nfirearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime (counts 3 and\n\n5).   See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c).    Both\n\nof Gobbi's codefendants eventually entered guilty pleas to multiple\n\ncounts, but Gobbi stalwartly maintained his innocence.\n\n           During   the   trial,   the   government   called   several\n\nwitnesses, including McGowan and Falla.     Gobbi, testifying to his\n\nown behoof, admitted that he knew of the April 30 drug-protection\n\ndetail but denied that he had participated in it.              In that\n\nconnection, he provided a murky explanation for the multiple calls\n\nmade from his cell phone to Nardolillo and Falla on April 30 and\n\nMay 1.   As to the August 22 detail, he claimed not to have known of\n\nthat undertaking at all.\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f               After both sides rested, the jury found Gobbi guilty on\n\ncount 1 (which charged that Gobbi, Nardolillo, and Falla conspired\n\nto distribute and possess with intent to distribute in excess of\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine) and count 2 (which charged that the same\n\nthreesome,      on   or   about   April   30,    2001,    \"did    knowingly   and\n\nintentionally attempt to possess with intent to distribute in\n\nexcess of five kilograms\" of cocaine).2               The jury acquitted Gobbi\n\non the remaining three counts.\n\n               On April 7, 2006, the district court sentenced Gobbi to\n\na 160-month incarcerative term.           This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n               On appeal, Gobbi advances three assignments of error.\n\nThese relate, respectively, to the sufficiency of the government's\n\nproof,    an    evidentiary   ruling,     and   the    sentence   imposed.    We\n\nconsider each claim in turn.\n\n                     A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n               Gobbi — who does not challenge the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence underlying his conspiracy conviction (count 1) — maintains\n\nthat the proof adduced at trial did not permit his conviction on\n\ncount 2.       He argues, in effect, that while there may have been\n\nevidence of an overall intent to distribute, there was no evidence\n\n\n\n      2\n      The charge was one of attempted possession of cocaine, rather\nthan possession simpliciter, because the agents used sham cocaine\ninstead of real cocaine.     See, e.g., United States v. Medina-\nGarcia, 918 F.2d 4, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                        -9-\n\fto establish that any of the three named defendants ever attempted\n\nto possess the cocaine.   He emphasizes that there was no evidence\n\n(a) that he, personally, had an intent to possess cocaine or that\n\nhe took a substantial step toward that end; (b) that either of his\n\ncodefendants had such an intent; or (c) that the cocaine was\n\ndestined for any of the three men.\n\n           We review preserved objections to evidentiary sufficiency\n\nde novo.   See, e.g., United States v. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58, 64\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).   Under that standard of review, we will affirm a\n\nconviction as long as the \"total evidence, with all reasonable\n\ninferences made in the light most favorable to the government, [is]\n\nsuch that a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"    United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 590 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).    In this undertaking, we consider both direct and\n\ncircumstantial evidence, upholding the jury's verdict when it is\n\n\"supported by a plausible rendition of the record.\"   United States\n\nv. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           Here, however, Gobbi made no timely motion for judgment\n\nof acquittal below.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.   In the absence of\n\nsuch a motion, we can provide relief on a sufficiency challenge\n\nonly if the verdict threatens to work a clear and gross injustice.\n\nSee Maldonado-García, 446 F.3d at 230; United States v. Hadfield,\n\n918 F.2d 987, 996 (1st Cir. 1990).       As we explain below, the\n\nevidence in this case suffices to sustain the conviction under the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fordinary   standard     of   review   and,    a   fortiori,    the   conviction\n\nsurvives review under the latter standard.\n\n           With respect to count 2, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury, without objection, that it could find Gobbi guilty based\n\non any of three theories: a standard attempt formulation, aiding\n\nand abetting, or Pinkerton liability.3            The jury returned a general\n\nverdict on count 2.          The law is crystalline that, when the\n\ngovernment has advanced several alternate theories of guilt and the\n\ntrial court has submitted the case to the jury on that basis, an\n\nensuing conviction may stand as long as the evidence suffices to\n\nsupport any one of the submitted theories. See, e.g., Griffin v.\n\nUnited States, 502 U.S. 46, 49-51, 55-60 (1991); United States v.\n\nMoran, 393 F.3d 1, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2004).               Here, the aiding and\n\nabetting theory appears to be the government's strongest, so we\n\nstart there.\n\n           To   prove    attempt,     the    government   must   show   that   a\n\ndefendant intended to commit the substantive offense and that he\n\ntook a substantial step toward its commission.                United States v.\n\nDoyon, 194 F.3d 207, 210 (1st Cir. 1999).              Here, the substantive\n\noffense — possession of drugs with intent to distribute — is\n\n\n\n     3\n      In Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), the\nSupreme Court ruled that a defendant could be found guilty for a\nsubstantive criminal act of a coconspirator that was reasonably\nforeseeable and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Id. at\n647-48.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fcriminalized by 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).            For purposes of that\n\nstatute, possession may be either actual or constructive.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 518 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nActual possession is \"the state of immediate, hands-on physical\n\npossession.\"    United States v. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d 4, 6 (1st\n\nCir.   1994).    Constructive     possession    occurs   when   \"a    person\n\nknowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise\n\ndominion and control over an object, either directly or through\n\nothers.\"    United States v. Ocampo-Guarin, 968 F.2d 1406, 1409-10\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nConstructive    possession   of   drugs   may    be   \"inferred      from    a\n\ndefendant's dominion and control over an area where narcotics are\n\nfound.\"    United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n           Aided by these abstract principles, we must determine\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could have found that Gobbi aided and\n\nabetted an attempt to possess cocaine on April 30, 2001 (the\n\ndistribution element is obvious, and so it need not be examined).\n\nSince there is no suggestion of actual possession, the question\n\nreduces to one of constructive possession.        This question demands\n\nan affirmative answer: the evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict, supports a conclusion that one of Gobbi's\n\naccomplices, Falla, intended constructively to possess the ersatz\n\ncocaine handled during the April 30 drug-protection detail; that he\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\ftook substantial steps in that direction; and that Gobbi aided and\n\nabetted him in that endeavor.          We elaborate below.\n\n            On this record, the jury reasonably could have found that\n\nFalla understood the purpose of a drug-protection detail; that he\n\ntook a handgun to the hotel room in order to advance that goal;\n\nthat he displayed the weapon to establish his dominion and control\n\nover the cocaine; that no one else in the room made a similar show\n\nof force; and that he remained in the room until the job ended.\n\nAlthough Falla did not have exclusive possession of the cocaine,\n\nthe   government   did   not   need    to     prove   that   he   did;   culpable\n\npossession, whether actual or constructive, may be either exclusive\n\nor joint.   Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d at 6.           Falla could be found to\n\nhave had joint constructive possession of the cocaine, and to have\n\nintended to exclude others, not in the room, from possessing it.\n\nNo more was exigible.\n\n            Of course, there was no cocaine (only a substance that\n\nresembled   cocaine),    so    Falla    could    be   found   guilty     only   of\n\nattempted possession.      See supra note 2.          The question, then, is\n\nwhether the jury reasonably could have found that Gobbi aided and\n\nabetted Falla in this attempted possession. We think that it could\n\nhave done so.\n\n            A defendant may be convicted of aiding and abetting when\n\nthe evidence shows \"(1) that the underlying offense was committed\n\nby a principal; (2) that the defendant consciously shared the\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fprincipal's knowledge; and (3) that he willfully associated himself\n\nin some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he\n\nwould in something he wished to bring about.\"                    United States v.\n\nKeene, 341 F.3d 78, 84 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).          Viewing Falla as the principal, the\n\nfirst prong of this three-part paradigm was satisfied.                    So, too,\n\nwas the second: the jury reasonably could have found that Gobbi\n\nconsciously shared Falla's guilty knowledge.                 After all, there was\n\nevidence that Gobbi recruited Falla for the venture and stood by\n\nwhile Nardolillo armed him and described how the job was to be\n\ndone.\n\n              The third part of the paradigm was also satisfied.                 The\n\nrecord    readily     supports     a     finding        of    Gobbi's     culpable\n\nparticipation.      To mention only a few items, there was evidence\n\nthat Gobbi led Falla to the hotel, provided the keycard to the\n\nroom, kept watch from the street, relayed information to and from\n\nNardolillo during the course of the drug-protection detail, and\n\nspoke    several   times    with   Falla      in   an   effort    to   ensure    the\n\nsuccessful completion of the operation.\n\n              The short of it is that the evidence was ample to ground\n\na finding of guilt on an aiding and abetting theory.                    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Harris, 397 F.3d 404, 415 (6th Cir. 2005).                 Gobbi,\n\nhowever, endeavors to blunt the force of this reasoning, citing a\n\ncovey    of    inapposite   cases.         See,    e.g.,      United    States    v.\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fYossunthorn, 167 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v.\n\nHarris, 733 F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1984). He also seeks to exploit a\n\nperceived discrepancy in the government's proof.                         We briefly\n\ndiscuss that discrepancy.\n\n            A video surveillance record introduced into evidence\n\nindicated that Falla entered the hotel room at 8:19 p.m. (around\n\ntwilight on April 30).            A law enforcement officer testified,\n\nhowever, that Gobbi left the gas station before dark.                         Gobbi\n\nstrives to convince us that this seeming inconsistency is of great\n\nmoment.    We are not persuaded.\n\n            Taking   a   narrow       view   of   this   supposed   discrepancy,\n\nGobbi's argument is undermined by points he himself raises: the\n\nofficer's testimony that he first noticed Gobbi's car at the gas\n\nstation after Falla had entered the hotel, and Falla's testimony\n\nthat he had a conversation with Gobbi in the hotel parking lot just\n\nbefore    entering   the   hotel.        The      testimony   is   not    perfectly\n\nconsistent but, taking a more global view, we are constrained to\n\nnote that trial testimony often is a notoriously imperfect means of\n\nreproducing past events.        Exactitude is desirable, but it is not a\n\nnecessary    condition     to     a     finding     of   credibility.         Minor\n\ninconsistences are common, unavoidable, and virtually always grist\n\nfor the factfinder's mill.            It was ultimately the province of the\n\njury to assess the significance of any contradictions in the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fevidence — particularly a contradiction as petty as this one.      See\n\nUnited States v. Thomas, 467 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          We have said enough on this score.       Having reviewed the\n\nrecord with care, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to\n\nsupport Gobbi's conviction on count 2 of the indictment on an\n\naiding and abetting theory.    That conclusion, in terms, renders it\n\nunnecessary for us to consider either of the government's alternate\n\ntheories of guilt.\n\n                     B.   Admission of Evidence.\n\n          Gobbi's next claim of error is that the district court\n\nimproperly admitted evidence of discussions about a possible drug\n\nsale from \"Manny\" to Nardolillo.    The main thrust of this claim is\n\nthat the conspiracy charge (count 1) centered around a drug-\n\nprotection detail rather than a drug-purchasing scheme and that,\n\ntherefore, the challenged conversations (which spanned a seven-\n\nmonth period from June of 2000 through January of 2001) were\n\nunfairly prejudicial, and unjustifiably injected evidence of other\n\n(uncharged) bad acts into the case.\n\n          We set the stage.      On the first day of trial Gobbi,\n\nrelying on Evidence Rule 404(b) and arguably on Evidence Rule 403\n\n— for purposes of this appeal, we give Gobbi the benefit of the\n\ndoubt — objected to evidence of a January 15 conversation relating\n\nto the drug-purchasing phase of the investigation.       The district\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fcourt overruled the objection. The court later extended its ruling\n\nto cover this entire line of testimony.\n\n           The two rules upon which Gobbi relies are familiar.              The\n\nformer rule prohibits evidence of other uncharged crimes or bad\n\nacts to \"prove the character of a person in order to show action in\n\nconformity therewith.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).          The latter rule\n\nprovides for the exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative\n\nvalue is substantially outweighed\" by, inter alia, a \"danger of\n\nunfair prejudice.\"      Fed. R. Evid. 403.         We examine the force of\n\neach rule separately, mindful that an appellate court customarily\n\nreviews a trial court's rulings admitting or excluding evidence\n\nonly for abuse of discretion.        See Maldonado-García, 446 F.3d at\n\n231.\n\n           1.   Rule 404(b).   The prohibition against \"other acts\"\n\nevidence typically refers to evidence that is extrinsic to the\n\ncrime charged and introduced for the purpose of showing propensity.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 426 F.3d 431, 438-39 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 155 (1st\n\nCir.   1989).   Here,    however,   we     never   reach   the   question    of\n\npropensity; the drug-purchasing evidence in this case is intrinsic\n\nto the conspiracy described in count 1 of the indictment.            That is\n\nto say, the evidence comprises part and parcel of the charged\n\noffense.   Thus, the evidence is not \"other acts\" evidence at all\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fand, accordingly, Rule 404(b) is not implicated. See United States\n\nv. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            To be sure, Gobbi calls attention to the prosecutor's\n\nclosing argument (which focused narrowly on the two drug-protection\n\ndetails)    and   the   fact   that   McGowan   did   not   have   a   single\n\nsubstantive conversation with Gobbi about possible drug-purchasing\n\nactivity.    On this basis, Gobbi suggests that the conversations\n\nabout drug purchases do not relate in any way to the conspiracy\n\nwith which he was charged and of which he was convicted.4              This is\n\nsheer persiflage.\n\n            The short answer to Gobbi's plaint is that the charged\n\nconspiracy was broader than he acknowledges.            While there is no\n\ndoubt that the lion's share of the government's proof on count 1\n\ncentered around the drug-protection phase of the conspiracy, the\n\ngovernment also proffered evidence of an integrated drug-purchasing\n\nphase.   Having knowingly joined the overall conspiracy, Gobbi was\n\ncriminally responsible for both phases of its illicit endeavors.\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 176 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"After\n\nall, a conspiracy is a continuum.            Once a participant knowingly\n\n\n     4\n      In some ways, Gobbi's argument resembles an argument that a\nvariance existed between the single conspiracy charged in the\nindictment and what he views as multiple conspiracies presented at\ntrial.   No such issue was appropriately raised below (say, by\nseeking a jury instruction on single versus multiple conspiracies),\nnor has such an issue been briefed in those terms on appeal.\nConsequently, we treat any \"single versus multiple conspiracy\"\nclaim as waived. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990).\n\n                                      -18-\n\fhelps to initiate the agreement and set it in motion, he assumes\n\nconspirator's responsibility for the foreseeable actions of his\n\nconfederates within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement . .\n\n. .\").\n\n          As described in the indictment, the charged conspiracy\n\nspanned a period of approximately fourteen months, from June 29,\n\n2000 through August 22, 2001. Several of the discussions pertained\n\nto the drug-purchasing phase, and the record supports a finding\n\nthat Gobbi knew of the full sweep of the conspiracy.5   Given this\n\nconfiguration, as a whole, we cannot say that the district court\n\nerred in determining that evidence of Nardolillo's interest in\n\npurchasing a supply of cocaine from \"Manny\" and distributing those\n\ndrugs locally with the help of his crew was part of the warp and\n\nwoof of the conspiracy charged.   See, e.g., Villarman-Oviedo, 325\n\nF.3d at 11; United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 167-70\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          2.   Rule 403.    Gobbi's claim of prejudice fares no\n\nbetter.   Although the conversations spanned a period of many\n\nmonths, the testimony about them was relatively brief and its\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Indeed, there was evidence that Gobbi attended at least two\nmeetings (on September 28, 2000 and January 15, 2001) that related\nto Nardolillo's pursuit of a supply relationship with McGowan's\nprincipal; that he frequently acted as a catalyst for conversations\nbetween Nardolillo and McGowan in early 2001; and that some of\nthose talks touched upon a proposed drug-purchasing scheme.\n\n                               -19-\n\feffect was more likely to cast Nardolillo, rather than Gobbi, in a\n\nvillainous light.\n\n          This does not mean, of course, that there was absolutely\n\nno prejudice. \"By design, all evidence is meant to be prejudicial;\n\nit is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\"      Rodriguez-\n\nEstrada, 877 F.2d at 156.    The trial judge, who saw and heard the\n\nevidence play out, apparently discerned no unfair prejudice here.\n\nThat implicit determination was well within the realm of his\n\nconsiderable discretion.    See id. at 155-56 (\"Only rarely — and in\n\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances — will we, from the vista\n\nof a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot\n\njudgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and\n\nunfair effect.\" (quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d\n\n1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988))).\n\n                            C.   Sentencing.\n\n          In sentencing Gobbi, the district court placed him in\n\ncriminal history category II; set his base offense level at 34;\n\napplied a two-level weapons enhancement, see USSG §2D1.1(b)(1); and\n\nadded two more levels for obstruction of justice, see id. §3C1.1.\n\nThese determinations yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of\n\n262-327 months.     At the disposition hearing Gobbi, among other\n\nthings, unsuccessfully objected to the two enhancements.   Then, on\n\nreasonableness grounds, see United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220,\n\n261 (2005); United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), he requested a sentence between 120 and\n\n180 months.          After taking into account the factors limned in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a), the court determined that a below-the-range\n\nsentence was appropriate and imposed a 160-month incarcerative\n\nterm.\n\n               On appeal, Gobbi challenges only the two enhancements.6\n\nThese       claims   are   properly   before   us;   even   under   an   advisory\n\nguidelines regime, computation of the guideline sentencing range\n\nremains the starting point for sentencing.               See United States v.\n\nDixon, 449 F.3d 194, 203-04 (1st Cir. 2006); Jiménez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d at 518-19. Accordingly, the sentencing court is still obliged\n\nto calculate the GSR — and calculate it correctly.7\n\n               1.    The Weapons Enhancement.        We begin with the weapons\n\nenhancement.         Gobbi argues that the district court violated his\n\nFifth and Sixth Amendment rights by applying this enhancement.\n\nSince the jury acquitted him on counts 3 and 5 — the counts that\n\ncharged Gobbi, under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), with possession of a\n\nhandgun in furtherance of drug-protection details — he asserts that\n\n\n        6\n      Since Gobbi does not challenge either his assigned criminal\nhistory category or his base offense level, we leave unelucidated\nthe facts underpinning those determinations.\n     7\n      The fact that a district court operating under an advisory\nguidelines regime, as here, imposes a sentence below the GSR does\nnot moot a defendant's claim of error with respect to the\ncalculation of the range. Cf. United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d\n341, 342 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1992) (finding appellate jurisdiction\nwhere defendant, despite a downward departure, challenged\ncalculation of GSR).\n\n                                       -21-\n\fa   sentencing   enhancement    for   the   same   alleged   conduct     is\n\nimpermissible.     In Gobbi's view, where conduct constitutes a\n\ndistinct offense, actually charged as a separate crime and rejected\n\nby the jury, that conduct cannot bear the weight of a sentencing\n\nenhancement.\n\n          The    sentencing    guidelines   provide   that   a    two-level\n\nenhancement is proper if \"a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)\n\nwas possessed\" in the course of the offense.          USSG §2D1.1(b)(1).\n\nThis provision is applicable whether the weapon is possessed by the\n\ndefendant himself or by one of his coconspirators.               See United\n\nStates v. Ortiz-Torres, 449 F.3d 61, 77-79 (1st Cir. 2006); see\n\nalso USSG §1B1.3 (specifying that \"all reasonably foreseeable acts\"\n\nby a defendant's confederates that are \"in furtherance of the\n\njointly undertaken criminal activity\" may be attributed to the\n\ndefendant for sentencing purposes as relevant conduct).                 The\n\nenhancement should attach if the weapon was present during the\n\ncommission of the crime \"unless it is clearly improbable that the\n\nweapon was connected with the offense.\"       USSG §2D1.1 cmt. n.3.\n\n          It is true that the jury acquitted Gobbi of possession of\n\na weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).          Nevertheless, the\n\npre-Booker case law made plain that acquitted conduct, proved to\n\nthe sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence, may form\n\nthe basis of a sentencing enhancement. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nWatts, 519 U.S. 148, 157 (1997); United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001).         Post-Booker, the law has not changed in\n\nthis regard; acquitted conduct, if proved by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, still may form the basis for a sentencing enhancement.\n\nSee United States v. Dorcely, 454 F.3d 366, 371 (D.C. Cir. 2006)\n\n(collecting cases); see also United States v. Baskin, 424 F.3d 1,\n\n4 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (adumbrating this result).\n\n            That closes the book on this aspect of Gobbi's appeal.\n\nThe record contains a surfeit of evidence that Falla used a handgun\n\nin performing guard duty during the April 30 drug-protection\n\ndetail; that Gobbi was present when Nardolillo supplied Falla with\n\nthe gun for that use; that Gobbi encouraged Falla to display the\n\ngun as a show of force; that Falla followed these instructions; and\n\nthat Gobbi helped dispose of the gun following the completion of\n\nthe job.        That is more than enough to ground a finding, by a\n\npreponderance      of    the   evidence,     that    a   dangerous    weapon    was\n\npossessed by a coconspirator during and in furtherance of the\n\ncommission of the offense of conviction.                 The sentencing court's\n\nfact-based      determination     that      the   enhancement   pertained      was,\n\ntherefore, not clearly erroneous. See Ortiz-Torres, 449 F.3d at 77\n\n(delineating applicable standard of review).\n\n            2.    Obstruction of Justice.         Gobbi's remaining challenge\n\nis   to   the    sufficiency     of   the    district     court's    findings    in\n\nconnection      with    an   obstruction     of   justice   enhancement.        The\n\ndistrict court invoked this enhancement after it determined that\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fGobbi had committed perjury when he testified in his defense.                         See\n\nUSSG §3C1.1; id. cmt. n.4(b).             We review this finding for clear\n\nerror.    See United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 229 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n            At the disposition hearing, the district court stated\n\nthat,    upon   review    of   the    record,    it   had    discerned      a    stark\n\ncontradiction between Gobbi's trial testimony and the reality of\n\nthe relevant events.           With specific reference to the counts of\n\nconviction (counts 1 and 2), the court commented that Gobbi's\n\nwholesale denial of any involvement in either the conspiracy or the\n\nApril 30 drug-protection detail constituted a web of lies. On that\n\nbasis, the court determined that he had committed perjury and,\n\naccordingly,       deployed     the   two-level       obstruction     of    justice\n\nenhancement.\n\n            Post-Booker, it remains the province of the sentencing\n\ncourt to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether a\n\nfactual    basis    for   a    finding    of    perjury     (and,   thus,       for    an\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement) exists.                    United States v.\n\nO'Brien, 435 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2006).                     It is, of course,\n\nimproper to impose such an enhancement mechanically, merely because\n\nan evidentiary conflict exists or because the jury rejects the\n\ndefendant's explanation of the facts and finds him guilty.                            See\n\nAkitoye, 923 F.2d at 228-29.             The sentencing court must make an\n\nindependent judgment, see United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87,\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\f95 (1993), and in doing so must give the defendant the benefit of\n\nany plausible doubt, see Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 228-29.\n\n            Here, the trial judge carried out that mandate.       He made\n\na careful evaluation of Gobbi's veracity, specified particular\n\nconcerns, and concluded that Gobbi had lied.          Giving due heed to\n\nboth the trial judge's unique coign of vantage and the deferential\n\nstandard    of   review,   we   uphold   his   determination   that   Gobbi\n\ndeliberately prevaricated about material events in an effort to\n\ngain his freedom.    The enhancement here was evidenced by more than\n\na garden-variety conflict in trial testimony or a jury's rejection\n\nof a defendant's protestation of his innocence.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the judgment below in all particulars.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f",

On appeal, Gobbi mounts a three-pronged attack, challenging (i) the sufficiency of the evidence underpinning one of the two counts of conviction; (ii) an evidentiary ruling; and (iii) two sentencing enhancements. Concluding, as we do, that Gobbi's arguments are devoid of merit, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case grows out of a reverse sting operation conceived by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). We rehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the jury's verdict on the counts of conviction, consistent with record support. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d 227, 229 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 29, 2000, an FBI agent, Michael McGowan, posing as a wealthy businessman, met with Robert Nardolillo (a suspected underworld figure). McGowan said that his business partner (\"Manny\") wanted to enter the New England drug trade and could supply Nardolillo with copious amounts of drugs. Nardolillo expressed interest and acknowledged that he could handle two to three kilograms of cocaine per week, and possibly more. The men agreed to meet again so that McGowan could introduce his apocryphal partner to Nardolillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That fall, Nardolillo and Gobbi traveled to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. They met McGowan there on September 28. After McGowan explained that \"Manny\" was unavoidably detained, Gobbi left. McGowan and Nardolillo nonetheless proceeded to discuss the planned venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, McGowan and Nardolillo spoke regularly by telephone about the prospects of doing business together. Nardolillo instructed McGowan to contact him through his associates (including Gobbi), and Gobbi in fact acted as an intermediary for sixteen of the seventeen contacts between McGowan and Nardolillo in January of 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 2001, Nardolillo and Gobbi finally came face to face with \"Manny\" (in reality, another undercover FBI agent). This meeting took place at Centerfolds, a Providence strip club. Following the initial introduction, Nardolillo spoke privately with \"Manny\" for about an hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, McGowan approached Nardolillo about a possible drug-protection detail. The idea was that Nardolillo and his crew would guard a cache of cocaine temporarily located in Rhode Island en route to distribution throughout New England. Nardolillo readily agreed. McGowan and Nardolillo settled on remuneration at the rate of $500 per kilogram for the protective detail. On March 15, Nardolillo assured McGowan that \"I'll put my guys there, don't worry. There'll be somebody there to watch [Manny's] stuff all the time.\" Switching to a different topic, McGowan informed Nardolillo that \"Manny\" did not yet have five kilograms of cocaine that Nardolillo had expressed interest in buying for his own distribution network.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, McGowan, Nardolillo, and Gobbi met at a funeral. Because law enforcement officers were surveilling the scene, Gobbi escorted McGowan into an office so that he (McGowan) could confer privately with Nardolillo about the particulars of the drug-protection detail. Later that month, Nardolillo told McGowan that he would assign \"two guys\" to the drug-protection detail; that both would be well-rested; that the man directly guarding the drug cache would be prepared to kill if necessary; and that he (Nardolillo) would divide the agreed payment between the two operatives. McGowan informed Nardolillo that \"Manny\" wanted a gun displayed for a show of force, but that it was not to be fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug-protection detail was scheduled for April 30. According to Clifford Falla, Gobbi recruited him for this job. On the assigned date, Gobbi and Falla met with Nardolillo at Centerfolds. Nardolillo told the pair that he had arranged for a drug-protection detail at a local hotel and that Falla was to guard the drugs. In Gobbi's presence, Nardolillo gave Falla a nine-millimeter pistol and directed him to display it while on guard. Nardolillo explained that Gobbi would lead Falla to the hotel and wait outside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the day, McGowan and Nardolillo met several times. At 2:00 p.m., McGowan told Nardolillo that a fifteen-kilogram shipment of cocaine was en route from Boston; that once the drugs arrived, two men working for \"Manny\" would measure, subdivide, and package the cocaine in the hotel room; and that another man working for \"Manny\" would team up with Nardolillo's man to stand guard inside the room. Nardolillo replied: \"I trust my two people.\" He also remarked that he would have preferred to have \"both my guys\" in the room but that, given the arrangement devised by \"Manny,\" Falla would be the one to stand guard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 6:55 p.m., Nardolillo told McGowan that his two henchmen were on their way to Centerfolds for a last-minute briefing. After Nardolillo received a telephone call (later traced to Gobbi's cell phone), he informed McGowan that his henchmen were outside the club. Nardolillo proceeded to leave the building, presumably to convey his final instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Nardolillo finished, Falla (driving his own car) followed Gobbi (driving his own car) to a nearby Marriott hotel. In caravan fashion, Gobbi's nephew (Brian King) and another man (Christopher Chapman) followed Falla in a third vehicle. Once in the hotel parking lot, Gobbi gave Falla the keycard to the room and reminded him to display his gun. Falla, King, and Chapman entered the hotel, while Gobbi took up a position at a gas station across the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside the room, Falla displayed his gun and then placed it in plain view on the bed. The undercover agents posing as drug packagers spent the next five hours measuring out seventeen kilograms of what appeared to be cocaine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and transporting containers out of the room. When one of the agents asked Falla about the black Cadillac sedan parked outside (a reference to Gobbi's automobile), Falla explained: \"I basically work for the guy in the Cadillac and . . . him and I are under [Nardolillo].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the evening, Nardolillo learned that Falla wanted to leave his post. Nardolillo instructed Gobbi to deny this request. He then told McGowan that \"Tony\" &#8212; which the jury reasonably could have found was a reference to Gobbi &#8212; wanted to discuss exactly what should be done about Falla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately thereafter, Gobbi repaired to Centerfolds and conferred with Nardolillo and McGowan outside the club. Nardolillo directed Gobbi to input a telephone number into his cell phone; this number, provided by McGowan, linked to one of the undercover agents who was toiling in the hotel room. Then, still using Gobbi's telephone, Nardolillo called the room and spoke with Falla. Gobbi thereafter placed four separate calls to the same number over the course of the evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug-protection detail concluded just after 1:00 a.m. on the morning of May 1. Falla called Gobbi, who instructed him to return to Centerfolds. Nardolillo debriefed Falla and Gobbi, and then forked over $1,500 (to be divided as they saw fit). Falla and Gobbi later hid the gun in a barn owned by Gobbi's girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, McGowan paid Nardolillo $4,500 (somewhat less than the agreed $500 per kilogram). Nardolillo talked freely with McGowan about his arrangements for the prior evening's drug-protection detail. Pertinently, he mentioned that Gobbi's role was to keep an eye on things from outside the hotel, while Falla's role was to stand guard inside the room. Nardolillo described Gobbi as \"one of my right-hand\" men and recounted how Gobbi had responded when it appeared that Falla might abandon his post. Nardolillo also said that he would pass along the evening's profits to his crew (Gobbi, Falla, King, and Chapman).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, somewhat similar drug-protection detail took place on August 22. On this occasion, Gobbi once again recruited Falla; Nardolillo once again gave Falla a handgun in Gobbi's presence. The detail was to take place at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Warwick, Rhode Island. On the assigned date, McGowan handed a keycard for the designated room to Nardolillo, who gave it to Gobbi and instructed him to proceed with Falla to the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What followed was substantially similar to what had transpired on April 30, except that Gobbi did not remain at the site but, rather, called Falla several times during the course of the detail. When the job was completed, Gobbi picked up Falla and drove to Centerfolds. With Gobbi nearby, McGowan paid $3,300 to Nardolillo. Nardolillo, in turn, paid $750 apiece to Gobbi and Falla, who then stashed the gun in the same barn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment charging Nardolillo, Gobbi, and Falla with conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine with intent to distribute (count 1), two counts of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (counts 2 and 4), and two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime (counts 3 and 5). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 924(c). Both of Gobbi's codefendants eventually entered guilty pleas to multiple counts, but Gobbi stalwartly maintained his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the government called several witnesses, including McGowan and Falla. Gobbi, testifying to his own behoof, admitted that he knew of the April 30 drug-protection detail but denied that he had participated in it. In that connection, he provided a murky explanation for the multiple calls made from his cell phone to Nardolillo and Falla on April 30 and May 1. As to the August 22 detail, he claimed not to have known of that undertaking at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After both sides rested, the jury found Gobbi guilty on count 1 (which charged that Gobbi, Nardolillo, and Falla conspired to distribute and possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine) and count 2 (which charged that the same threesome, on or about April 30, 2001, \"did knowingly and intentionally attempt to possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms\" of cocaine).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The jury acquitted Gobbi on the remaining three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 2006, the district court sentenced Gobbi to a 160-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gobbi advances three assignments of error. These relate, respectively, to the sufficiency of the government's proof, an evidentiary ruling, and the sentence imposed. We consider each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gobbi &#8212; who does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conspiracy conviction (count 1) &#8212; maintains that the proof adduced at trial did not permit his conviction on count 2. He argues, in effect, that while there may have been evidence of an overall intent to <i>distribute,</i> there was no evidence to establish that any of the three named defendants ever attempted to <i>possess</i> the cocaine. He emphasizes that there was no evidence (a) that he, personally, had an intent to possess cocaine or that he took a substantial step toward that end; (b) that either of his codefendants had such an intent; or (c) that the cocaine was destined for any of the three men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review preserved objections to evidentiary sufficiency de novo. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 218 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir.2000). Under that standard of review, we will affirm a conviction as long as the \"total evidence, with all reasonable inferences made in the light most favorable to the government, [is] such that a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Loder,</i> 23 F.3d 586, 590 (1st Cir.1994). In this undertaking, we consider both direct and circumstantial evidence, upholding the jury's verdict when it is \"supported by a plausible rendition of the record.\" <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, Gobbi made no timely motion for judgment of acquittal below. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. In the absence of such a motion, we can provide relief on a sufficiency challenge only if the verdict threatens to work a clear and gross injustice. <i>See Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d at 230; <i>United States v. Hadfield,</i> 918 F.2d 987, 996 (1st Cir.1990). As we explain below, the evidence in this case suffices to sustain the conviction under the ordinary standard of review and, a fortiori, the conviction survives review under the latter standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to count 2, the district court instructed the jury, without objection, that it could find Gobbi guilty based on any of three theories: a standard attempt formulation, aiding and abetting, or <i>Pinkerton</i> liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The jury returned a general verdict on count 2. The law is crystalline that, when the government has advanced several alternate theories of guilt and the trial court has submitted the case to the jury on that basis, an ensuing conviction may stand as long as the evidence suffices to support any one of the submitted theories. <i>See, e.g., Griffin v. United States,</i> 502 U.S. 46, 49-51, 55-60, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991); <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 14-15 (1st Cir.2004). Here, the aiding and abetting theory appears to be the government's strongest, so we start there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove attempt, the government must show that a defendant intended to commit the substantive offense and that he took a substantial step toward its commission. <i>United States v. Doyon,</i> 194 F.3d 207, 210 (1st Cir.1999). Here, the substantive offense &#8212; possession of drugs with intent to distribute &#8212; is criminalized by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). For purposes of that statute, possession may be either actual or constructive. <i>See United States v. Bergodere,</i> 40 F.3d 512, 518 (1st Cir.1994). Actual possession is \"the state of immediate, hands-on physical possession.\" <i>United States v. Zavala Maldonado,</i> 23 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1994). Constructive possession occurs when \"a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object, either directly or through others.\" <i>United States v. Ocampo-Guarin,</i> 968 F.2d 1406, 1409-10 (1st Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Constructive possession of drugs may be \"inferred from a defendant's dominion and control over an area where narcotics are found.\" <i>United States v. Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aided by these abstract principles, we must determine whether a reasonable jury could have found that Gobbi aided and abetted an attempt to possess cocaine on April 30, 2001 (the distribution element is obvious, and so it need not be examined). Since there is no suggestion of actual possession, the question reduces to one of constructive possession. This question demands an affirmative answer: the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, supports a conclusion that one of Gobbi's accomplices, Falla, intended constructively to possess the ersatz cocaine handled during the April 30 drug-protection detail; that he took substantial steps in that direction; and that Gobbi aided and abetted him in that endeavor. We elaborate below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, the jury reasonably could have found that Falla understood the purpose of a drug-protection detail; that he took a handgun to the hotel room in order to advance that goal; that he displayed the weapon to establish his dominion and control over the cocaine; that no one else in the room made a similar show of force; and that he remained in the room until the job ended. Although Falla did not have exclusive possession of the cocaine, the government did not need to prove that he did; culpable possession, whether actual or constructive, may be either exclusive or joint. <i>Zavala Maldonado,</i> 23 F.3d at 6. Falla could be found to have had joint constructive possession of the cocaine, and to have intended to exclude others, not in the room, from possessing it. No more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there was no cocaine (only a substance that resembled cocaine), so Falla could be found guilty only of attempted possession. <i>See supra</i> note 2. The question, then, is whether the jury reasonably could have found that Gobbi aided and abetted Falla in this attempted possession. We think that it could have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may be convicted of aiding and abetting when the evidence shows \"(1) that the underlying offense was committed by a principal; (2) that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge; and (3) that he willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to bring about.\" <i>United States v. Keene,</i> 341 F.3d 78, 84 (1st Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing Falla as the principal, the first prong of this three-part paradigm was satisfied. So, too, was the second: the jury reasonably could have found that Gobbi consciously shared Falla's guilty knowledge. After all, there was evidence that Gobbi recruited Falla for the venture and stood by while Nardolillo armed him and described how the job was to be done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third part of the paradigm was also satisfied. The record readily supports a finding of Gobbi's culpable participation. To mention only a few items, there was evidence that Gobbi led Falla to the hotel, provided the keycard to the room, kept watch from the street, relayed information to and from Nardolillo during the course of the drug-protection detail, and spoke several times with Falla in an effort to ensure the successful completion of the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the evidence was ample to ground a finding of guilt on an aiding and abetting theory. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Harris,</i> 397 F.3d 404, 415 (6th Cir.2005). Gobbi, however, endeavors to blunt the force of this reasoning, citing a covey of inapposite cases. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Yossunthorn,</i> 167 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Harris,</i> 733 F.2d 994 (2d Cir.1984). He also seeks to exploit a perceived discrepancy in the government's proof. We briefly discuss that discrepancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A video surveillance record introduced into evidence indicated that Falla entered the hotel room at 8:19 p.m. (around twilight on April 30). A law enforcement officer testified, however, that Gobbi left the gas station before dark. Gobbi strives to convince us that this seeming inconsistency is of great moment. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a narrow view of this supposed discrepancy, Gobbi's argument is undermined by points he himself raises: the officer's testimony that he first noticed Gobbi's car at the gas station <i>after</i> Falla had entered the hotel, and Falla's testimony that he had a conversation with Gobbi in the hotel parking lot just <i>before</i> entering the hotel. The testimony is not perfectly consistent but, taking a more global view, we are constrained to note that trial testimony often is a notoriously imperfect means of reproducing past events. Exactitude is desirable, but it is not a necessary condition to a finding of credibility. Minor inconsistences are common, unavoidable, and virtually always grist for the factfinder's mill. It was ultimately the province of the jury to assess the significance of any contradictions in the evidence &#8212; particularly a contradiction as petty as this one. <i>See United States v. Thomas,</i> 467 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. Having reviewed the record with care, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support Gobbi's conviction on count 2 of the indictment on an aiding and abetting theory. That conclusion, in terms, renders it unnecessary for us to consider either of the government's alternate theories of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Admission of Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gobbi's next claim of error is that the district court improperly admitted evidence of discussions about a possible drug sale from \"Manny\" to Nardolillo. The main thrust of this claim is that the conspiracy charge (count 1) centered around a drug-protection detail rather than a drug-purchasing scheme and that, therefore, the challenged conversations (which spanned a seven-month period from June of 2000 through January of 2001) were unfairly prejudicial, and unjustifiably injected evidence of other (uncharged) bad acts into the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the stage. On the first day of trial Gobbi, relying on Evidence Rule 404(b) and arguably on Evidence Rule 403 &#8212; for purposes of this appeal, we give Gobbi the benefit of the doubt &#8212; objected to evidence of a January 15 conversation relating to the drug-purchasing phase of the investigation. The district court overruled the objection. The court later extended its ruling to cover this entire line of testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two rules upon which Gobbi relies are familiar. The former rule prohibits evidence of other uncharged crimes or bad acts to \"prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). The latter rule provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed\" by, inter alia, a \"danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403. We examine the force of each rule separately, mindful that an appellate court customarily reviews a trial court's rulings admitting or excluding evidence only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d at 231.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Rule 404(b).</i> The prohibition against \"other acts\" evidence typically refers to evidence that is extrinsic to the crime charged and introduced for the purpose of showing propensity. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Epstein,</i> 426 F.3d 431, 438-39 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada,</i> 877 F.2d 153, 155 (1st Cir.1989). Here, however, we never reach the question of propensity; the drug-purchasing evidence in this case is intrinsic to the conspiracy described in count 1 of the indictment. That is to say, the evidence comprises part and parcel of the charged offense. Thus, the evidence is not \"other acts\" evidence at all and, accordingly, Rule 404(b) is not implicated. <i>See United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Gobbi calls attention to the prosecutor's closing argument (which focused narrowly on the two drug-protection details) and the fact that McGowan did not have a single substantive conversation with Gobbi about possible drug-purchasing activity. On this basis, Gobbi suggests that the conversations about drug purchases do not relate in any way to the conspiracy with which he was charged and of which he was convicted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This is sheer persiflage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to Gobbi's plaint is that the charged conspiracy was broader than he acknowledges. While there is no doubt that the lion's share of the government's proof on count 1 centered around the drug-protection phase of the conspiracy, the government also proffered evidence of an integrated drug-purchasing phase. Having knowingly joined the overall conspiracy, Gobbi was criminally responsible for both phases of its illicit endeavors. <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> 244 F.3d 172, 176 (1st Cir.2001) (\"After all, a conspiracy is a continuum. Once a participant knowingly helps to initiate the agreement and set it in motion, he assumes conspirator's responsibility for the foreseeable actions of his confederates within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described in the indictment, the charged conspiracy spanned a period of approximately fourteen months, from June 29, 2000 through August 22, 2001. Several of the discussions pertained to the drug-purchasing phase, and the record supports a finding that Gobbi knew of the full sweep of the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given this configuration, as a whole, we cannot say that the district court erred in determining that evidence of Nardolillo's interest in purchasing a supply of cocaine from \"Manny\" and distributing those drugs locally with the help of his crew was part of the warp and woof of the conspiracy charged. <i>See, e.g., Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 11; <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 167-70 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Rule 403.</i> Gobbi's claim of prejudice fares no better. Although the conversations spanned a period of many months, the testimony about them was relatively brief and its effect was more likely to cast Nardolillo, rather than Gobbi, in a villainous light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean, of course, that there was absolutely no prejudice. \"By design, all evidence is meant to be prejudicial; it is only <i>unfair</i> prejudice which must be avoided.\" <i>Rodriguez-Estrada,</i> 877 F.2d at 156. The trial judge, who saw and heard the evidence play out, apparently discerned no unfair prejudice here. That implicit determination was well within the realm of his considerable discretion. <i>See id.</i> at 155-56 (\"Only rarely &#8212; and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances &#8212; will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" (quoting <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Sentencing.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing Gobbi, the district court placed him in criminal history category II; set his base offense level at 34; applied a two-level weapons enhancement, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1); and added two more levels for obstruction of justice, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3C1.1. These determinations yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 262-327 months. At the disposition hearing Gobbi, among other things, unsuccessfully objected to the two enhancements. Then, on reasonableness grounds, <i>see United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), he requested a sentence between 120 and 180 months. After taking into account the factors limned in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), the court determined that a below-the-range sentence was appropriate and imposed a 160-month incarcerative term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gobbi challenges only the two enhancements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> These claims are properly before us; even under an advisory guidelines regime, computation of the guideline sentencing range remains the starting point for sentencing. <i>See United States v. Dixon,</i> 449 F.3d 194, 203-04 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518-19. Accordingly, the sentencing court is still obliged to calculate the GSR &#8212; and calculate it correctly.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Weapons Enhancement.</i> We begin with the weapons enhancement. Gobbi argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by applying this enhancement. Since the jury acquitted him on counts 3 and 5 &#8212; the counts that charged Gobbi, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), with possession of a handgun in furtherance of drug-protection details &#8212; he asserts that a sentencing enhancement for the same alleged conduct is impermissible. In Gobbi's view, where conduct constitutes a distinct offense, actually charged as a separate crime and rejected by the jury, that conduct cannot bear the weight of a sentencing enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines provide that a two-level enhancement is proper if \"a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\" in the course of the offense. USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). This provision is applicable whether the weapon is possessed by the defendant himself or by one of his coconspirators. <i>See United States v. Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d 61, 77-79 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 1B1.3 (specifying that \"all reasonably foreseeable acts\" by a defendant's confederates that are \"in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\" may be attributed to the defendant for sentencing purposes as relevant conduct). The enhancement should attach if the weapon was present during the commission of the crime \"unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" USSG &#167; 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the jury acquitted Gobbi of possession of a weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c). Nevertheless, the pre-<i>Booker</i> case law made plain that acquitted conduct, proved to the sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence, may form the basis of a sentencing enhancement. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); <i>United States v. Caba,</i> 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir.2001). Post-<i>Booker,</i> the law has not changed in this regard; acquitted conduct, if proved by a preponderance of the evidence, still may form the basis for a sentencing enhancement. <i>See United States v. Dorcely,</i> 454 F.3d 366, 371 (D.C.Cir.2006) (collecting cases); <i>see also United States v. Baskin,</i> 424 F.3d 1, 4 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005) (adumbrating this result).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That closes the book on this aspect of Gobbi's appeal. The record contains a surfeit of evidence that Falla used a handgun in performing guard duty during the April 30 drug-protection detail; that Gobbi was present when Nardolillo supplied Falla with the gun for that use; that Gobbi encouraged Falla to display the gun as a show of force; that Falla followed these instructions; and that Gobbi helped dispose of the gun following the completion of the job. That is more than enough to ground a finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a dangerous weapon was possessed by a coconspirator during and in furtherance of the commission of the offense of conviction. The sentencing court's fact-based determination that the enhancement pertained was, therefore, not clearly erroneous. <i>See Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d at 77 (delineating applicable standard of review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Obstruction of Justice.</i> Gobbi's remaining challenge is to the sufficiency of the district court's findings in connection with an obstruction of justice enhancement. The district court invoked this enhancement after it determined that Gobbi had committed perjury when he testified in his defense. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3C1.1; <i>id.</i> cmt. n. 4(b). We review this finding for clear error. <i>See United States v. Akitoye,</i> 923 F.2d 221, 229 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court stated that, upon review of the record, it had discerned a stark contradiction between Gobbi's trial testimony and the reality of the relevant events. With specific reference to the counts of conviction (counts 1 and 2), the court commented that Gobbi's wholesale denial of any involvement in either the conspiracy or the April 30 drug-protection detail constituted a web of lies. On that basis, the court determined that he had committed perjury and, accordingly, deployed the two-level obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Post-<i>Booker,</i> it remains the province of the sentencing court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether a factual basis for a finding of perjury (and, thus, for an obstruction of justice enhancement) exists. <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 435 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir.2006). It is, of course, improper to impose such an enhancement mechanically, merely because an evidentiary conflict exists or because the jury rejects the defendant's explanation of the facts and finds him guilty. <i>See Akitoye,</i> 923 F.2d at 228-29. The sentencing court must make an independent judgment, <i>see United States v. Dunnigan,</i> 507 U.S. 87, 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), and in doing so must give the defendant the benefit of any plausible doubt, <i>see Akitoye,</i> 923 F.2d at 228-29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the trial judge carried out that mandate. He made a careful evaluation of Gobbi's veracity, specified particular concerns, and concluded that Gobbi had lied. Giving due heed to both the trial judge's unique coign of vantage and the deferential standard of review, we uphold his determination that Gobbi deliberately prevaricated about material events in an effort to gain his freedom. The enhancement here was evidenced by more than a garden-variety conflict in trial testimony or a jury's rejection of a defendant's protestation of his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the judgment below in all particulars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, the substance was not cocaine but a mere imitation.

No such issue was appropriately raised below (say, by seeking a jury instruction on single versus multiple conspiracies), nor has such an issue been briefed in those terms on appeal. Consequently, we treat any \"single versus multiple conspiracy\" claim as waived<i>See United States v.

On appeal, Gobbi mounts a three-pronged attack, challenging (i) the sufficiency of the evidence underpinning one of the two counts of conviction; (ii) an evidentiary ruling; and (iii) two sentencing enhancements. Concluding, as we do, that Gobbi's arguments are devoid of merit, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case grows out of a reverse sting operation conceived by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). We rehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the jury's verdict on the counts of conviction, consistent with record support. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202192\"><a href=\"/opinion/202192/united-states-v-maldonado-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 29, 2000, an FBI agent, Michael McGowan, posing as a wealthy businessman, met with Robert Nardolillo (a suspected underworld figure). McGowan said that his business partner (\"Manny\") wanted to enter the New England drug trade and could supply Nardolillo with copious amounts of drugs. Nardolillo expressed interest and acknowledged that he could handle two to three kilograms of cocaine per week, and possibly more. The men agreed to meet again so that McGowan could introduce his apocryphal partner to Nardolillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That fall, Nardolillo and Gobbi traveled to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. They met McGowan there on September 28. After McGowan explained that \"Manny\" was unavoidably detained, Gobbi left. McGowan and Nardolillo nonetheless proceeded to discuss the planned venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, McGowan and Nardolillo spoke regularly by telephone about the prospects of doing business together. Nardolillo instructed McGowan to contact him through his associates (including Gobbi), and Gobbi in fact acted as an intermediary for sixteen of the seventeen contacts between McGowan and Nardolillo in January of 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 15, 2001, Nardolillo and Gobbi finally came face to face with \"Manny\" (in reality, another undercover FBI agent). This meeting took place at Centerfolds, a Providence strip club. Following the initial introduction, Nardolillo spoke privately with \"Manny\" for about an hour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 22, McGowan approached Nardolillo about a possible drug-protection detail. The idea was that Nardolillo and his crew would guard a cache of cocaine temporarily located in Rhode Island en route to distribution throughout New England. Nardolillo readily agreed. McGowan and Nardolillo settled on remuneration at the rate of $500 per kilogram for the protective detail. On March 15, Nardolillo assured McGowan that \"I'll put my guys there, don't worry. There'll be somebody there to watch [Manny's] stuff all the time.\" Switching to a different topic, McGowan informed Nardolillo that \"Manny\" did not yet have five kilograms of cocaine that Nardolillo had expressed interest in buying for his own distribution network.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 1, McGowan, Nardolillo, and Gobbi met at a funeral. Because law enforcement officers were surveilling the scene, Gobbi escorted McGowan into an office so that he (McGowan) could confer privately with Nardolillo about the particulars of the drug-protection detail. Later that month, Nardolillo told McGowan that he would assign \"two guys\" to the drug-protection detail; that both would be well-rested; that the man directly guarding the drug cache would be prepared to kill if necessary; and that he (Nardolillo) would divide the agreed payment between the two operatives. McGowan informed Nardolillo that \"Manny\" wanted a gun displayed for a show of force, but that it was not to be fired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug-protection detail was scheduled for April 30. According to Clifford Falla, Gobbi recruited him for this job. On the assigned date, Gobbi and Falla met with Nardolillo at Centerfolds. Nardolillo told the pair that he had arranged for a drug-protection detail at a local hotel and that Falla was to guard the drugs. In Gobbi's presence, Nardolillo gave Falla a nine-millimeter pistol and directed him to display it while on guard. Nardolillo explained that Gobbi would lead Falla to the hotel and wait outside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of the day, McGowan and Nardolillo met several times. At 2:00 p.m., McGowan told Nardolillo that a fifteen-kilogram shipment of cocaine was en route from Boston; that once the drugs arrived, two men working for \"Manny\" would measure, subdivide, and package the cocaine in the hotel room; and that another man working for \"Manny\" would team up with Nardolillo's man to stand guard inside the room. Nardolillo replied: \"I trust my two people.\" He also remarked that he would have preferred to have \"both my guys\" in the room but that, given the arrangement devised by \"Manny,\" Falla would be the one to stand guard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around 6:55 p.m., Nardolillo told McGowan that his two henchmen were on their way to Centerfolds for a last-minute briefing. After Nardolillo received a telephone call (later traced to Gobbi's cell phone), he informed McGowan that his henchmen were outside the club. Nardolillo proceeded to leave the building, presumably to convey his final instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Nardolillo finished, Falla (driving his own car) followed Gobbi (driving his own car) to a nearby Marriott hotel. In caravan fashion, Gobbi's nephew (Brian King) and another man (Christopher Chapman) followed Falla in a third vehicle. Once in the hotel parking lot, Gobbi gave Falla the keycard to the room and reminded him to display his gun. Falla, King, and Chapman entered the hotel, while Gobbi took up a position at a gas station across the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once inside the room, Falla displayed his gun and then placed it in plain view on the bed. The undercover agents posing as drug packagers spent the next five hours measuring out seventeen kilograms of what appeared to be cocaine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and transporting containers out of the room. When one of the agents asked Falla about the black Cadillac sedan parked outside (a reference to Gobbi's automobile), Falla explained: \"I basically work for the guy in the Cadillac and . . . him and I are under [Nardolillo].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the evening, Nardolillo learned that Falla wanted to leave his post. Nardolillo instructed Gobbi to deny this request. He then told McGowan that \"Tony\" &#8212; which the jury reasonably could have found was a reference to Gobbi &#8212; wanted to discuss exactly what should be done about Falla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately thereafter, Gobbi repaired to Centerfolds and conferred with Nardolillo and McGowan outside the club. Nardolillo directed Gobbi to input a telephone number into his cell phone; this number, provided by McGowan, linked to one of the undercover agents who was toiling in the hotel room. Then, still using Gobbi's telephone, Nardolillo called the room and spoke with Falla. Gobbi thereafter placed four separate calls to the same number over the course of the evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The drug-protection detail concluded just after 1:00 a.m. on the morning of May 1. Falla called Gobbi, who instructed him to return to Centerfolds. Nardolillo debriefed Falla and Gobbi, and then forked over $1,500 (to be divided as they saw fit). Falla and Gobbi later hid the gun in a barn owned by Gobbi's girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, McGowan paid Nardolillo $4,500 (somewhat less than the agreed $500 per kilogram). Nardolillo talked freely with McGowan about his arrangements for the prior evening's drug-protection detail. Pertinently, he mentioned that Gobbi's role was to keep an eye on things from outside the hotel, while Falla's role was to stand guard inside the room. Nardolillo described Gobbi as \"one of my right-hand\" men and recounted how Gobbi had responded when it appeared that Falla might abandon his post. Nardolillo also said that he would pass along the evening's profits to his crew (Gobbi, Falla, King, and Chapman).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, somewhat similar drug-protection detail took place on August 22. On this occasion, Gobbi once again recruited Falla; Nardolillo once again gave Falla a handgun in Gobbi's presence. The detail was to take place at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Warwick, Rhode Island. On the assigned date, McGowan handed a keycard for the designated room to Nardolillo, who gave it to Gobbi and instructed him to proceed with Falla to the hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What followed was substantially similar to what had transpired on April 30, except that Gobbi did not remain at the site but, rather, called Falla several times during the course of the detail. When the job was completed, Gobbi picked up Falla and drove to Centerfolds. With Gobbi nearby, McGowan paid $3,300 to Nardolillo. Nardolillo, in turn, paid $750 apiece to Gobbi and Falla, who then stashed the gun in the same barn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment charging Nardolillo, Gobbi, and Falla with conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine with intent to distribute (count 1), two counts of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (counts 2 and 4), and two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime (counts 3 and 5). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 924(c).

Gobbi, testifying to his own behoof, admitted that he knew of the April 30 drug-protection detail but denied that he had participated in it. In that connection, he provided a murky explanation for the multiple calls made from his cell phone to Nardolillo and Falla on April 30 and May 1. As to the August 22 detail, he claimed not to have known of that undertaking at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After both sides rested, the jury found Gobbi guilty on count 1 (which charged that Gobbi, Nardolillo, and Falla conspired to distribute and possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine) and count 2 (which charged that the same threesome, on or about April 30, 2001, \"did knowingly and intentionally attempt to possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms\" of cocaine).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The jury acquitted Gobbi on the remaining three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 2006, the district court sentenced Gobbi to a 160-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gobbi advances three assignments of error. These relate, respectively, to the sufficiency of the government's proof, an evidentiary ruling, and the sentence imposed. We consider each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gobbi &#8212; who does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conspiracy conviction (count 1) &#8212; maintains that the proof adduced at trial did not permit his conviction on count 2. He argues, in effect, that while there may have been evidence of an overall intent to <i>distribute,</i> there was no evidence to establish that any of the three named defendants ever attempted to <i>possess</i> the cocaine. He emphasizes that there was no evidence (a) that he, personally, had an intent to possess cocaine or that he took a substantial step toward that end; (b) that either of his codefendants had such an intent; or (c) that the cocaine was destined for any of the three men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review preserved objections to evidentiary sufficiency de novo. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

In the absence of such a motion, we can provide relief on a sufficiency challenge only if the verdict threatens to work a clear and gross injustice. <i>See Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d at 230; <i>United States v.

As we explain below, the evidence in this case suffices to sustain the conviction under the ordinary standard of review and, a fortiori, the conviction survives review under the latter standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to count 2, the district court instructed the jury, without objection, that it could find Gobbi guilty based on any of three theories: a standard attempt formulation, aiding and abetting, or <i>Pinkerton</i> liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The jury returned a general verdict on count 2. The law is crystalline that, when the government has advanced several alternate theories of guilt and the trial court has submitted the case to the jury on that basis, an ensuing conviction may stand as long as the evidence suffices to support any one of the submitted theories. <i>See, e.g., Griffin v.

Here, the substantive offense &#8212; possession of drugs with intent to distribute &#8212; is criminalized by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). For purposes of that statute, possession may be either actual or constructive. <i>See United States v.

Since there is no suggestion of actual possession, the question reduces to one of constructive possession. This question demands an affirmative answer: the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, supports a conclusion that one of Gobbi's accomplices, Falla, intended constructively to possess the ersatz cocaine handled during the April 30 drug-protection detail; that he took substantial steps in that direction; and that Gobbi aided and abetted him in that endeavor. We elaborate below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, the jury reasonably could have found that Falla understood the purpose of a drug-protection detail; that he took a handgun to the hotel room in order to advance that goal; that he displayed the weapon to establish his dominion and control over the cocaine; that no one else in the room made a similar show of force; and that he remained in the room until the job ended. Although Falla did not have exclusive possession of the cocaine, the government did not need to prove that he did; culpable possession, whether actual or constructive, may be either exclusive or joint. <i>Zavala Maldonado,</i> 23 F.3d at 6. Falla could be found to have had joint constructive possession of the cocaine, and to have intended to exclude others, not in the room, from possessing it. No more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, there was no cocaine (only a substance that resembled cocaine), so Falla could be found guilty only of attempted possession. <i>See supra</i> note 2. The question, then, is whether the jury reasonably could have found that Gobbi aided and abetted Falla in this attempted possession. We think that it could have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may be convicted of aiding and abetting when the evidence shows \"(1) that the underlying offense was committed by a principal; (2) that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge; and (3) that he willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to bring about.\" <i>United States v. Keene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200608\"><a href=\"/opinion/200608/united-states-v-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Viewing Falla as the principal, the first prong of this three-part paradigm was satisfied. So, too, was the second: the jury reasonably could have found that Gobbi consciously shared Falla's guilty knowledge. After all, there was evidence that Gobbi recruited Falla for the venture and stood by while Nardolillo armed him and described how the job was to be done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third part of the paradigm was also satisfied. The record readily supports a finding of Gobbi's culpable participation. To mention only a few items, there was evidence that Gobbi led Falla to the hotel, provided the keycard to the room, kept watch from the street, relayed information to and from Nardolillo during the course of the drug-protection detail, and spoke several times with Falla in an effort to ensure the successful completion of the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the evidence was ample to ground a finding of guilt on an aiding and abetting theory. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789157\"><a href=\"/opinion/789157/united-states-v-william-l-harris-03-6207-tarvis-holmes-03-6255/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span>, 415 (6th Cir.2005). Gobbi, however, endeavors to blunt the force of this reasoning, citing a covey of inapposite cases. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Yossunthorn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761767\"><a href=\"/opinion/761767/99-cal-daily-op-serv-1196-99-daily-journal-dar-1529-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435234\"><a href=\"/opinion/435234/united-states-v-george-harris-and-angelo-mamone/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1984). He also seeks to exploit a perceived discrepancy in the government's proof. We briefly discuss that discrepancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A video surveillance record introduced into evidence indicated that Falla entered the hotel room at 8:19 p.m. (around twilight on April 30). A law enforcement officer testified, however, that Gobbi left the gas station before dark. Gobbi strives to convince us that this seeming inconsistency is of great moment. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking a narrow view of this supposed discrepancy, Gobbi's argument is undermined by points he himself raises: the officer's testimony that he first noticed Gobbi's car at the gas station <i>after</i> Falla had entered the hotel, and Falla's testimony that he had a conversation with Gobbi in the hotel parking lot just <i>before</i> entering the hotel. The testimony is not perfectly consistent but, taking a more global view, we are constrained to note that trial testimony often is a notoriously imperfect means of reproducing past events. Exactitude is desirable, but it is not a necessary condition to a finding of credibility. Minor inconsistences are common, unavoidable, and virtually always grist for the factfinder's mill. It was ultimately the province of the jury to assess the significance of any contradictions in the evidence &#8212; particularly a contradiction as petty as this one. <i>See United States v. Thomas,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score. Having reviewed the record with care, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support Gobbi's conviction on count 2 of the indictment on an aiding and abetting theory. That conclusion, in terms, renders it unnecessary for us to consider either of the government's alternate theories of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Admission of Evidence.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gobbi's next claim of error is that the district court improperly admitted evidence of discussions about a possible drug sale from \"Manny\" to Nardolillo. The main thrust of this claim is that the conspiracy charge (count 1) centered around a drug-protection detail rather than a drug-purchasing scheme and that, therefore, the challenged conversations (which spanned a seven-month period from June of 2000 through January of 2001) were unfairly prejudicial, and unjustifiably injected evidence of other (uncharged) bad acts into the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the stage. On the first day of trial Gobbi, relying on Evidence Rule 404(b) and arguably on Evidence Rule 403 &#8212; for purposes of this appeal, we give Gobbi the benefit of the doubt &#8212; objected to evidence of a January 15 conversation relating to the drug-purchasing phase of the investigation. The district court overruled the objection. The court later extended its ruling to cover this entire line of testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two rules upon which Gobbi relies are familiar. The former rule prohibits evidence of other uncharged crimes or bad acts to \"prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). The latter rule provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed\" by, inter alia, a \"danger of unfair prejudice.\" Fed.R.Evid. 403. We examine the force of each rule separately, mindful that an appellate court customarily reviews a trial court's rulings admitting or excluding evidence only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d at 231.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Rule 404(b).</i> The prohibition against \"other acts\" evidence typically refers to evidence that is extrinsic to the crime charged and introduced for the purpose of showing propensity. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Epstein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201859\"><a href=\"/opinion/201859/united-states-v-epstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 438-39 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.1989). Here, however, we never reach the question of propensity; the drug-purchasing evidence in this case is intrinsic to the conspiracy described in count 1 of the indictment. That is to say, the evidence comprises part and parcel of the charged offense. Thus, the evidence is not \"other acts\" evidence at all and, accordingly, Rule 404(b) is not implicated. <i>See United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200391\"><a href=\"/opinion/200391/united-states-v-oviedo-villarman/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Gobbi calls attention to the prosecutor's closing argument (which focused narrowly on the two drug-protection details) and the fact that McGowan did not have a single substantive conversation with Gobbi about possible drug-purchasing activity. On this basis, Gobbi suggests that the conversations about drug purchases do not relate in any way to the conspiracy with which he was charged and of which he was convicted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This is sheer persiflage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to Gobbi's plaint is that the charged conspiracy was broader than he acknowledges. While there is no doubt that the lion's share of the government's proof on count 1 centered around the drug-protection phase of the conspiracy, the government also proffered evidence of an integrated drug-purchasing phase. Having knowingly joined the overall conspiracy, Gobbi was criminally responsible for both phases of its illicit endeavors. <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199335\"><a href=\"/opinion/199335/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 176 (1st Cir.2001) (\"After all, a conspiracy is a continuum. Once a participant knowingly helps to initiate the agreement and set it in motion, he assumes conspirator's responsibility for the foreseeable actions of his confederates within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As described in the indictment, the charged conspiracy spanned a period of approximately fourteen months, from June 29, 2000 through August 22, 2001. Several of the discussions pertained to the drug-purchasing phase, and the record supports a finding that Gobbi knew of the full sweep of the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given this configuration, as a whole, we cannot say that the district court erred in determining that evidence of Nardolillo's interest in purchasing a supply of cocaine from \"Manny\" and distributing those drugs locally with the help of his crew was part of the warp and woof of the conspiracy charged. <i>See, e.g., Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 11; <i>United States v.

Gobbi argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by applying this enhancement. Since the jury acquitted him on counts 3 and 5 &#8212; the counts that charged Gobbi, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), with possession of a handgun in furtherance of drug-protection details &#8212; he asserts that a sentencing enhancement for the same alleged conduct is impermissible. In Gobbi's view, where conduct constitutes a distinct offense, actually charged as a separate crime and rejected by the jury, that conduct cannot bear the weight of a sentencing enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing guidelines provide that a two-level enhancement is proper if \"a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\" in the course of the offense. USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). This provision is applicable whether the weapon is possessed by the defendant himself or by one of his coconspirators. <i>See United States v. Ortiz-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794461\"><a href=\"/opinion/794461/united-states-v-orlando-ortiz-torres-aka-landy-aka-orlando/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 77-79 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 1B1.3 (specifying that \"all reasonably foreseeable acts\" by a defendant's confederates that are \"in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\" may be attributed to the defendant for sentencing purposes as relevant conduct). The enhancement should attach if the weapon was present during the commission of the crime \"unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" USSG &#167; 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the jury acquitted Gobbi of possession of a weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c). Nevertheless, the pre-<i>Booker</i> case law made plain that acquitted conduct, proved to the sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence, may form the basis of a sentencing enhancement. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Watts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 157, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Post-<i>Booker,</i> the law has not changed in this regard; acquitted conduct, if proved by a preponderance of the evidence, still may form the basis for a sentencing enhancement. <i>See United States v. Dorcely,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186719\"><a href=\"/opinion/186719/united-states-v-dorcely-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, 371 (D.C.Cir.2006) (collecting cases); <i>see also United States v.

The record contains a surfeit of evidence that Falla used a handgun in performing guard duty during the April 30 drug-protection detail; that Gobbi was present when Nardolillo supplied Falla with the gun for that use; that Gobbi encouraged Falla to display the gun as a show of force; that Falla followed these instructions; and that Gobbi helped dispose of the gun following the completion of the job. That is more than enough to ground a finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a dangerous weapon was possessed by a coconspirator during and in furtherance of the commission of the offense of conviction. The sentencing court's fact-based determination that the enhancement pertained was, therefore, not clearly erroneous. <i>See Ortiz-Torres,</i> 449 F.3d at 77 (delineating applicable standard of review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Obstruction of Justice.</i> Gobbi's remaining challenge is to the sufficiency of the district court's findings in connection with an obstruction of justice enhancement. The district court invoked this enhancement after it determined that Gobbi had committed perjury when he testified in his defense. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3C1.1; <i>id.</i> cmt. n. 4(b). We review this finding for clear error. <i>See United States v. Akitoye,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court stated that, upon review of the record, it had discerned a stark contradiction between Gobbi's trial testimony and the reality of the relevant events. With specific reference to the counts of conviction (counts 1 and 2), the court commented that Gobbi's wholesale denial of any involvement in either the conspiracy or the April 30 drug-protection detail constituted a web of lies. On that basis, the court determined that he had committed perjury and, accordingly, deployed the two-level obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Post-<i>Booker,</i> it remains the province of the sentencing court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether a factual basis for a finding of perjury (and, thus, for an obstruction of justice enhancement) exists. <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202020\"><a href=\"/opinion/202020/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2006). It is, of course, improper to impose such an enhancement mechanically, merely because an evidentiary conflict exists or because the jury rejects the defendant's explanation of the facts and finds him guilty. <i>See Akitoye,</i> 923 F.2d at 228-29. The sentencing court must make an independent judgment, <i>see United States v. Dunnigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He made a careful evaluation of Gobbi's veracity, specified particular concerns, and concluded that Gobbi had lied. Giving due heed to both the trial judge's unique coign of vantage and the deferential standard of review, we uphold his determination that Gobbi deliberately prevaricated about material events in an effort to gain his freedom. The enhancement here was evidenced by more than a garden-variety conflict in trial testimony or a jury's rejection of a defendant's protestation of his innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.
