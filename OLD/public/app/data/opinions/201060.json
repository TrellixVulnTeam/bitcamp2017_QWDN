Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                  Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n              and Oberdorfer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Juan Matos-de-Juan, with whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal\nPublic Defender, and Maria T. Arsuaga, Assistant Federal Public\nDefender, were on brief, for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom H.S.\nGarcia, U.S. Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-Pabón, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 9, 2004\n\n\n\n    *\n      Of the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ,   Circuit   Judge.     Elvin    Tomás     Morales-De   Jesús\n\n(\"Morales\") was convicted by a jury of violating 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2251(a) for using materials mailed, shipped, and transported in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce to produce a video recording of his\n\nsexually explicit encounters with a minor.              On appeal, he argues\n\nthat   18   U.S.C.   §   2251(a),   facially      and   as    applied,    is   an\n\nunconstitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause power, and\n\nthat the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a\n\nconviction.    Finding appellant's arguments unavailing, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            For purposes of our analysis, we can avoid recounting\n\nmost of the lurid details of this case.           In short, Morales induced\n\na thirteen-year-old girl, who was his god-daughter and a member of\n\nhis church, to have sex with him in a motel on at least five\n\nseparate occasions.      During the final two encounters, Morales used\n\nmaterials and equipment that had moved in interstate commerce to\n\nvideotape the pair's sex acts.      After his wife discovered the tape\n\nin the backseat of his car and played it, she informed the girl's\n\nparents, who then contacted police.          Morales was duly arrested,\n\ncharged, and indicted for two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2251(a), which provides in pertinent part that\n\n            [a]ny person who employs, uses, persuades,\n            induces, entices, or coerces any minor to\n            engage in . . . sexually explicit conduct for\n            the purpose of producing any visual depiction\n            of such conduct[] shall be punished as\n            provided under subsection (d), . . . if that\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           visual depiction was produced using materials\n           that have been mailed, shipped, or transported\n           in interstate or foreign commerce by any means\n           . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2251(a).\n\n             Morales's three-day jury trial produced a guilty verdict\n\non both counts.       After the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a\n\njudgment   of      acquittal,   he    was    sentenced    to   135    months    of\n\nimprisonment and three years of supervised release on each count,\n\nto be served concurrently, and fined $1,000 with a special monetary\n\nassessment    of    $100.     The    district   court    ordered     the   federal\n\nsentence to be served concurrently with a 25-year state sentence\n\nbased on charges filed for the same conduct at issue here.                     This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n                            A. Constitutional Claim\n\n             Morales appears to bring both facial and as-applied\n\nchallenges to the constitutionality of § 2251(a).                     Relying on\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995) and United States v.\n\nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), Morales urges that § 2251(a) is\n\nunconstitutional because it attempts to regulate intrastate child\n\npornography created exclusively for personal use which, Morales\n\nargues, does not affect interstate commerce.                   Morales further\n\nargues that even if the statute is facially constitutional, it is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to him because his activities were not\n\ncommercial in nature and did not implicate interstate commerce. We\n\n                                       -3-\n\freview   constitutional      challenges     de       novo.      United    States    v.\n\nRobinson, 137 F.3d 652, 653 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Section 2251(a) is part of a broad regulatory scheme that\n\nprohibits the production, receipt, transmission, and possession of\n\nchild pornography.    See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2251, 2252, 2252A.                  When this\n\nstatute was     originally    enacted     as     part    of    the     Protection   of\n\nChildren Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-\n\n225, § 2(a), 92 Stat. 7, 8 (1978)(codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2251 et\n\nseq.)(\"the Act\"), it targeted production of child pornography only\n\nif the pornographic depiction itself was transported in interstate\n\ncommerce, or if the defendant knew, or should have known, that the\n\ndepiction would be transported in interstate commerce.                      In 1998,\n\nCongress amended the Act by adding the jurisdictional element we\n\nhave before us today: only the materials used to produce the\n\npornographic    depictions     must   \"have       been       mailed,    shipped,    or\n\ntransported in interstate or foreign             commerce by any means . . .\n\n.\" to subject a potential defendant to liability.                        18 U.S.C. §\n\n2251(a).\n\n           1.     Lopez and Morrison\n\n           Morales    argues      that         the      \"materials-in-commerce\"\n\njurisdictional element in § 2251(a) is an unconstitutional exercise\n\nof Congress's Commerce Clause power1 in light of United States v.\n\n\n     1\n      Article I, § 8 of the United States Constitution provides\nthat \"[t]he Congress shall have Power To . . . regulate Commerce\nwith foreign Nations, and among the several States . . . .\"\n\n                                      -4-\n\fLopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995) and United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S.\n\n598 (2000).     In Lopez, the Supreme Court struck down the Gun-Free\n\nSchool Zones Act of 1990 (GFSZA), 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(1)(A), which\n\nprohibited knowingly possessing a firearm within 1000 feet of a\n\nschool.        The    Supreme   Court    enumerated     three    categories   of\n\nactivities that Congress may properly regulate pursuant to the\n\nCommerce Clause:\n\n           First, Congress may regulate the use of the\n           channels of interstate commerce.       Second,\n           Congress is empowered to regulate and protect\n           the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,\n           or persons or things in interstate commerce,\n           even though the threat may come only from\n           intrastate activities.     Finally, Congress'\n           commerce authority includes the power to\n           regulate those activities having a substantial\n           relation to interstate commerce, . . . i.e.,\n           those activities that substantially affect\n           interstate commerce.\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 558-59 (citations omitted).                  Since the GFSZA\n\nregulated neither channels nor instrumentalities of interstate\n\ncommerce, the Lopez Court analyzed the statute under the third\n\ncategory: activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\n\nId. at 559.\n\n           In finding the GFSZA constitutionally infirm, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that because the statute \"by its terms has nothing to do\n\nwith 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise,\" it could not\n\nbe upheld under precedents that approved \"regulations of activities\n\nthat . . . are connected with a commercial transaction that, when\n\nviewed    in    the    aggregate,       substantially    affects     interstate\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcommerce.\"     Id. at 561.   Second, the Court observed that the GFSZA\n\nlacked a jurisdictional element that would \"ensure, through case-\n\nby-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects\n\ninterstate commerce.\" Id. Finally, the Court stated that although\n\ncongressional findings about the \"legislative judgment that the\n\nactivity in question substantially affected interstate commerce\"\n\nwere not required, such findings would have helped the Court\n\nevaluate the impact of the activity on interstate commerce \"even\n\nthough no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.\"\n\nId. at 563.     Based on these considerations, the Court found the\n\nGFSZA to be unconstitutional.        Id. at   567-68.\n\n           The Supreme Court amplified Lopez's holding five years\n\nlater in Morrison, when the court evaluated a federal civil remedy\n\nfor victims of gender-based violence, as set forth in the Violence\n\nAgainst Women Act of 1994 (\"VAWA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 13981 (\"A person .\n\n. . who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender . . . shall\n\nbe liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages . . . .\").            There, as in Lopez,\n\nthe    court   was   faced   with   another   so-called    category    three\n\nregulation,     pertaining    to    activities   that    allegedly    have   a\n\nsubstantial relation to interstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U.S. at\n\n600.     Drawing on its reasoning in Lopez, the Morrison Court\n\nidentified four factors to consider in determining whether a\n\nstatute regulates an activity that has a substantial effect on\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\finterstate commerce: (1) whether the statute regulates economic or\n\ncommercial activity; (2) whether the statute contains an \"express\n\njurisdictional element\" that limits the reach of its provisions;\n\n(3)   whether    Congress   made    findings    regarding     the   regulated\n\nactivity's impact on interstate commerce; and (4) whether \"the link\n\nbetween [the regulated activity] and a substantial effect on\n\ninterstate commerce was attenuated.\"           Id. at 610-12.\n\n           In striking down the VAWA, the Court found that \"gender-\n\nmotivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase,\n\neconomic activity,\" and that the statute lacked a jurisdictional\n\nelement \"establishing that the federal cause of action is in\n\npursuance of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\"\n\nId. at 613.     Further, the Court held that while Congress had made\n\nexplicit   findings    \"regarding    the   serious   impact     that   gender-\n\nmotivated violence has on victims and their families, . . . the\n\nexistence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself,\n\nto sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation.\"\n\nId. at 614.     Finally, the Court found that a \"causal chain from the\n\ninitial occurrence of violent crime . . . to every attenuated\n\neffect upon interstate commerce . . . would allow Congress to\n\nregulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of\n\nthat crime has substantial effects on employment, production,\n\ntransit, or consumption.\"      Id. at 615.\n\n           2.    The Constitutionality of § 2251(a) on Its Face\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f                Because          §       2251(a)         regulates       neither        channels      nor\n\ninstrumentalities                of       interstate             commerce,       we     analyze       the\n\nconstitutionality of the statute as a category three regulation\n\nunder Lopez.             Accordingly, we must apply the four Morrison factors\n\nto   determine           whether         the       statute       regulates      an     activity     that\n\n\"substantially affects\" interstate commerce. To aid the clarity of\n\nour analysis, we take the four factors in a different order than\n\nthe one presented in Morrison.\n\n                a.            Congressional findings\n\n                When          Congress        originally          passed       the     Protection     of\n\nChildren        Against          Sexual            Exploitation          Act     of     1977,       which\n\ncriminalized             the     sale         and    distribution          for        sale   of     child\n\npornography,             it    supported           the    legislation          with    findings      that\n\n\"child        pornography            .    .    .    has        become    [a]    highly       organized,\n\nmultimillion dollar industr[y] that operate[s] on a nationwide\n\nscale     .    .     .    [and       that]         the    sale     and    distribution         of    such\n\npornographic materials are carried on to a substantial extent\n\nthrough the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate and\n\nforeign commerce.\"               S. Rep. 95-438, at 5 (1977), reprinted in 1978\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 40, 42-43, available at 1977 WL 9660.2\n\n\n      2\n      Although we are reviewing the statute as amended in 1998, we\ntreat congressional findings and the legislative history of the Act\npassed in 1978 as relevant to the inquiry. See Maryland v. Wirtz,\n392 U.S. 183, 190 n.13 (1968)(holding that when Congress previously\npassed related legislation accompanied by applicable findings,\nsubsequent legislation was \"presumably based on similar findings\nand purposes with respect to the areas newly covered.\").\n\n                                                         -8-\n\f            In    1984,    Congress   amended      the   Act   to,   inter   alia,\n\neliminate      the    requirement     that      the      production,    receipt,\n\ntransportation, or distribution of child pornography be for a\n\n\"pecuniary profit.\"         Congress did so because it found that this\n\ncommercial purpose requirement created an enforcement gap: \"Many of\n\nthe individuals who distribute materials covered [by the statute]\n\ndo so by gift or exchange without any commercial motive and thus\n\nremain   outside     the   coverage   of    this    provision.\"        See   Child\n\nProtection Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-292, 98 Stat. 204; H.R. Rep.\n\n98-536, at 10 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 492, 501,\n\navailable at 1983 WL 25391. Noting that \"[g]enerally, the domestic\n\nmaterial is of the 'homemade' variety, while the imported material\n\nis produced by commercial dealers,\" id. at 17, Congress determined\n\nthat the statutory regime must be updated to ensure effective\n\nprosecution of producers and distributors.\n\n            Congress amended the Act again two years later when it\n\npassed the Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act of 1986, supporting the\n\nnew civil remedies for victims by finding that \"child exploitation\n\nhas   become     a   multi-million    dollar    industry,      infiltrated     and\n\noperated by elements of organized crime, and by a nationwide\n\nnetwork of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit\n\nchildren.\"       Pub. L. No. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341-74 (1986).\n\n            In 1996, Congress amended the Act to redefine child\n\npornography as \"any visual depiction, including any photograph,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffilm, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or\n\npicture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or\n\nother means, of sexually explicit conduct, where . . . such visual\n\ndepiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an\n\nidentifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(8)(C).    In passing those amendments, Congress found\n\nthat \"the existence of a traffic in child pornographic images . .\n\n. inflames the desires of child molesters, pedophiles, and child\n\npornographers who prey on children, thereby increasing the creation\n\nand distribution of child pornography . . . .\"          Child Pornography\n\nProtection Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 1(4), 110 Stat.\n\n3009-26,(1996), available at 1996 WL 506646.            The Senate Report\n\nalso explained that \"prohibiting the possession and viewing of\n\nchild pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to\n\nrid themselves of or destroy the material, thereby helping . . . to\n\neliminate the market for the sexual exploitative use of children.\"\n\nId. at § 1(12).\n\n          Finally,     Congress   amended   the   Act    again   in   1998,\n\nestablishing jurisdiction for the production of child pornography\n\nif the \"visual depiction was produced using materials that have\n\nbeen mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce by any means,\" 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a), which is the provision\n\nnow before us.    Congress offered two reasons for this amendment.\n\nFirst, it wanted the new jurisdictional element of the production\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fstatute to mirror the existing jurisdictional element of the\n\npossession statutes.3    See H.R. Rep. 105-557, at 26-27 (1998),\n\nreprinted in 1998 U.S.C.C.A.N. 678, 695, available at 1998 WL\n\n285821.    Second,    Congress   was    concerned   about   federal   law\n\nenforcement's current inability to prosecute \"a number of cases\n\nwhere the defendant produced the child pornography but did not\n\nintend to transport the images in interstate commerce.\" Id. at 27.\n\n          Given this comprehensive backdrop, there is no question\n\nthat Congress has made explicit findings about the extensive\n\nnational market in child pornography and the need to diminish that\n\nnational market by prohibiting the production of child pornography\n\nat the local level.\n\n          b.   The commercial or economic nature of the regulated\n               activity\n\n          The congressional finding over 25 years ago that child\n\npornography is a \"multimillion dollar industry that operates on a\n\nnationwide scale\" emphasizes that the underlying activity regulated\n\nby the child pornography statutes--the production, distribution,\n\nand possession of child pornography--is commercial activity, unlike\n\nthe activity addressed by the federal legislation struck down in\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B)(reaching \"[a]ny person\nwho . . . knowingly possesses . . . matter which contains any\nvisual depiction [of child pornography] that has been mailed, or\nhas been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce,\nor which was produced using materials which have been mailed or so\nshipped or transported).    We could find no legislative history\nrevealing Congress's reason for amending § 2252(a)(4)(B) in 1990 to\ninclude this jurisdictional element.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fLopez and Morrison.     As the Lopez Court stated, the GFSZA \"by its\n\nterms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic\n\nenterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\"      Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. at 561.     The Morrison Court made a similar observation:\n\n\"Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the\n\nphrase, economic activity.\" Morrison, 529 U.S. at 613. Possessing\n\nfirearms in a school zone and committing gender-based violence do\n\nnot involve goods or services that can be bought and sold.       There\n\nare no markets for these activities.      In contrast, there are large\n\nmarkets for child pornography. \"[W]hen a person produces for [his]\n\nown consumption a product that is traded in an interstate market,\n\nhis conduct is economic in character.\" United States v. Kallestad,\n\n236 F.3d 225, 228 (5th Cir. 2000)(upholding the constitutionality\n\nof § 2252(a)(4)(B)). In contrast, then, to Lopez and Morrison, the\n\nregulated    activity   here--producing    child   pornography--is   an\n\neconomic activity.      See also United States v. Buculei, 262 F.3d\n\n322, 329 (4th Cir. 2001)(\"There can be no doubt that the production\n\nof visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit\n\nconduct, i.e., child pornography, is economic in nature.\").4\n\n            c.   The express jurisdictional element\n\n            As previously discussed, the statute only reaches child\n\npornography \"if that visual depiction was produced using materials\n\n\n     4\n      Whether Morales's individual activity was economic in nature\nis a different question, and we address it infra in Part I.A.3,\nwhere we discuss his as-applied challenge.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthat have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or\n\nforeign commerce by any means . . . .\"       § 2251(a).   Importantly,\n\nthe jurisdictional element discussed here, and the requirement of\n\na substantial impact on interstate commerce, discussed in the next\n\nsection, are distinct inquiries.     At a minimum, the presence of a\n\njurisdictional element \"may establish that the enactment is in\n\npursuance    of   Congress's   regulation   of   interstate   commerce.\"\n\nMorrison, 529 U.S. at 612.     In addition to this express invocation\n\nof Commerce Clause power, the jurisdictional element may also serve\n\nto ensure that the defendant's conduct has at least some \"explicit\n\nconnection with or effect on interstate commerce\" and limit the\n\nstatute's reach to such cases.     Id. at 611-12.\n\n            Morales complains that because Puerto Rico is an island\n\nheavily dependent on imports, the jurisdictional element of §\n\n2251(a), which requires only that the materials of production have\n\nmoved in interstate commerce, does not limit the statute's reach at\n\nall.   He makes a fair point about this jurisdictional element that\n\napplies to any locale in the United States.       As the Third Circuit\n\nobserved in ruling on the same statute: \"as a practical matter, the\n\nlimiting jurisdictional factor is almost useless here, since all\n\nbut the most self-sufficient child pornographers will rely on film,\n\ncameras, or chemicals that traveled in interstate commerce . . . .\"\n\nUnited States v. Rodia, 194 F.3d 465, 473 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f             There are instances, however, where the jurisdictional\n\nelement of a statute will more effectively limit the number of\n\ncases that fall under the purview of the statute, as envisioned by\n\nthe Supreme Court.             For example, in passing a federal arson\n\nstatute, Congress criminalized damaging or destroying, \"by means of\n\nfire or an explosive, any . . . property used in interstate or\n\nforeign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce.\"      18 U.S.C. § 844(i)(Supp. IV 1994)(emphasis added).               In\n\nJones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 859 (2000), the Supreme Court\n\nreversed a conviction under this statute for the arson of a purely\n\nprivate residence. The Court found that by criminalizing the arson\n\nof   property     only    if   it   was   \"'used     in'    commerce   or   commerce\n\naffecting activities,\" id. at 850-51, Congress did not intend to\n\nexercise    its    full    power       under   the   Commerce    Clause,     leaving\n\nresidential arson cases \"to the law enforcement authorities of the\n\nstates.\"   Id. at 859.         As the Supreme Court noted: \"The key word is\n\n'used.'    'Congress did not define the crime described in § 844(i)\n\nas the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction might\n\naffect interstate commerce. . . .'\"                  Id. at 854 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Mennuti, 639 F.2d 107, 110 (2d Cir. 1981)).                  The Supreme\n\nCourt read the jurisdictional element of § 844(i) as evidence of\n\nCongress's recognition of the \"distinction between legislation\n\nlimited    to   activities       'in    commerce'     and   legislation     invoking\n\nCongress's full power over activity substantially 'affecting . . .\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fcommerce.'\"   Jones, 529 U.S. at 856 (quoting Russell v. United\n\nStates, 471 U.S. 858, 859-60 (1985))(alteration in original).   The\n\njurisdictional element of the federal arson statute, then, required\n\na somewhat heightened nexus between the defendant's conduct and an\n\neffect on interstate commerce.     See United States v. Fenton, [__\n\nF.3d __], 2004 WL 943624, at *7 (1st Cir. May 4, 2004)(explaining\n\nthat \"the Jones Court concluded that an owner-occupied private\n\ndwelling did not have a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to\n\nsatisfy the jurisdictional element because the owner was not\n\nactively using the property in a way that affected interstate\n\ncommerce.\")   As Fenton and Jones itself make clear, Congress\n\nlimited the reach of the arson statute to property that was used\n\ndirectly in interstate commerce or that was used in activities that\n\naffected interstate commerce.\n\n          In passing § 2251(a), however, Congress formulated a\n\nbroader jurisdictional element that both invokes its Commerce\n\nClause power and purports to exercise that power by reaching any\n\nchild pornography that was produced using materials that moved in\n\ninterstate commerce.   Although this jurisdictional element ensures\n\nthat any prosecuted conduct has a minimal nexus with interstate\n\ncommerce, that minimal nexus may not meet the substantial effect\n\nrequirement of Morrison.   In Rodia, the Third Circuit found it \"at\n\nleast doubtful . . . that the jurisdictional element adequately\n\nperforms the function of guaranteeing that the final product\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fregulated substantially affects interstate commerce.\"             Rodia, 194\n\nF.3d at 473.      We agree with this observation.\n\n           If the jurisdictional element bore sole responsibility\n\nfor establishing that the impact of the regulated activity on\n\ninterstate commerce is substantial or direct, the language of §\n\n2251(a) likely would not be up to the task.              The jurisdictional\n\nelement focuses on things such as film, cameras, videotapes, and\n\nrecorders moving in interstate commerce, which are then used to\n\nproduce child pornography.        As a matter of logic, this Commerce\n\nClause premise has the kind of flaw so worrisome to the Supreme\n\nCourt in Lopez and Morrison--it could justify federalizing a vast\n\narray of crimes now prosecuted by the states, solely because the\n\ncriminal   used     \"materials   that    have   been   mailed,   shipped,   or\n\ntransported in interstate of foreign commerce by any means.\"                See\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 564 (explaining that if Congress could regulate\n\ncriminal acts simply because they have external costs or affect\n\nnational productivity, \"it [would be] difficult to perceive any\n\nlimitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law\n\nenforcement    or   education    where   States   have   historically   been\n\nsovereign.\")      Moreover, the congressional findings about the link\n\nbetween the regulated activity (production of child pornography)\n\nand interstate commerce did not claim that the market for child\n\npornography was increasing the demand for film and cameras.                 The\n\nfocus, instead, was on a different link--the relationship between\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\flocal production of child pornography and the national market for\n\nthe child pornography itself.           This is the link that is the focus\n\nof   the   separate    inquiry    in    the    following    section    about   the\n\nsubstantial     effect   of    the      regulated   activity    on    interstate\n\ncommerce.\n\n            However, the disconnect between the interstate commerce\n\nactivity described in the jurisdictional element of § 2251(a) and\n\nthe interstate commerce activity (the national market for child\n\npornography) that prompted Congress to criminalize the production\n\nof child pornography is not fatal to the constitutionality of the\n\nstatute.       Indeed, even a complete absence of a jurisdictional\n\nelement in the text of a statute is not fatal to a statute\n\nchallenged on Commerce Clause grounds.               \"[I]n Lopez, the Court\n\nsimply did not state or imply that all criminal statutes must have\n\nsuch an element, . . . or that any statute without such an element\n\nis per se unconstitutional.\" United States v. Wilson, 73 F.3d 675,\n\n685 (7th Cir. 1995).       See also Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton, 323\n\nF.3d   1062,    1068   (D.C.     Cir.    2003)(\"[T]he      absence    of   such   a\n\njurisdictional element simply means that courts must determine\n\nindependently whether the statute regulates activities that arise\n\nout of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed\n\nin the aggregate, substantially affect[] interstate commerce.\")\n\n(quoting United States v. Moghadam, 175 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.\n\n1999)).     On the other hand, any statute enacted pursuant to the\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fCongress's Commerce Clause power that does not regulate channels or\n\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in\n\ninterstate commerce, must regulate activity that has a substantial\n\neffect on interstate commerce.             Otherwise, courts will strike it\n\ndown as unconstitutional.        We now turn to that substantial effect\n\ninquiry.\n\n             d.     The link between the regulated activity               and   a\n                    substantial effect on interstate commerce\n\n             The final Morrison factor asks whether \"the link between\n\n[the regulated activity] and a substantial effect on interstate\n\ncommerce was attenuated.\"         Morrison, 529 U.S. at 612.          Given the\n\nmanifest nature of the national child pornography market, and\n\nCongress's related findings, there is no question that Congress can\n\nregulate the national child pornography market.                 The issue, then,\n\nis whether Congress may reach \"local, intrastate conduct in order\n\nto effectively regulate a national, interstate market.\" Kallestad,\n\n236 F.3d at 229.\n\n             The seminal case in this area remains Wickard v. Filburn,\n\n317   U.S.   111    (1942).     There,      the   Supreme   Court    upheld   the\n\nAgricultural Adjustment Act, which levied penalties on crops that\n\nexceeded the act's quota.             Filburn, a farmer who grew wheat\n\nexclusively       for   consumption   on    his   own   farm,    challenged   the\n\nconstitutionality of the act, arguing that the breadth of the\n\nregulation exceeded Congress's Commerce Clause authority because it\n\nreached purely local production and consumption.                In upholding the\n\n                                      -18-\n\fstatute, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could regulate\n\nintrastate activity when such activity, taken in the aggregate,\n\nmight ultimately have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nWickard, 317 U.S. at 125 (\"Even if appellee's activity be local and\n\nthough it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever\n\nits nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial\n\neconomic effect on interstate commerce . . . .\").\n\n             Defendant     argues   that    Lopez   and    Morrison    prohibit\n\napplying the aggregation principle to the child pornography laws.\n\nWe have encountered this argument before in relation to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252(a)(4)(B), which uses language analogous to § 2251(a) to\n\ncriminalize possession of child pornography.5             See United States v.\n\nRobinson,     137   F.3d   652   (1st   Cir.   1998).        Because   of   the\n\nsimilarities in the statutory language, we find the analysis of §\n\n\n\n     5\n         Section 2252(a)(4)(B) provides that\n\n             [a]ny person who . . . knowingly possesses 1\n             or more books, magazines, periodicals, films,\n             video tapes, or other matter which contain any\n             visual depiction that has been mailed, or has\n             been shipped or transported in interstate or\n             foreign commerce, or which was produced using\n             materials which have been mailed or so shipped\n             or transported, by any means including by\n             computer, if (i) the producing of such visual\n             depiction involves the use of a minor engaging\n             in sexually explicit conduct; and (ii) such\n             visual depiction is of such conduct; shall be\n             punished as provided in subsection (b) of this\n             section.\n\n18 U.S.C.A. § 2252(a)(4)(B).\n\n                                     -19-\n\f2252(a)(4)(B) persuasive in assessing the constitutionality of §\n\n2251(a).       See United States v. Holston, 343 F.3d 83, 89 n.2 (2d\n\nCir.       2003)(finding    §   2252(a)(4)(B)       precedent    applicable   when\n\nconsidering         a   challenge      to   §   2251(a)   because   \"the   relevant\n\njurisdictional language is equivalent\"); United States v. Galo, 239\n\nF.3d 572, 575 (3d Cir. 2001)(same).\n\n               In   Robinson,    we     upheld     the    constitutionality   of   §\n\n2252(a)(4)(B) because the local possession of child pornography\n\n\"'through repetition elsewhere' helps to create and sustain a\n\nmarket       for    sexually     explicit       materials     depicting    minors.\"\n\nRobinson, 137 F.3d at 656 (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567).\n\nEchoing the 1996 congressional findings that child pornography\n\n\"inflames the desires of child molesters, pedophiles, and child\n\npornographers who prey on children, thereby increasing the creation\n\nand distribution of child pornography,\" Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n\nRobinson held that \"[b]y outlawing purely intrastate possession of\n\nchild pornography . . ., Congress can curb the nationwide demand\n\nfor these materials.\"           Id.6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      While Robinson predates Morrison, our decision essentially\nanticipated all four of the Morrison factors, which, of course,\nwere drawn from Lopez. See Robinson, 137 F.3d at 656 (discussing\nthe economic nature of child pornography, noting § 2252(a)(4)(B)'s\nexplicit jurisdictional element, citing relevant congressional\nfindings, and concluding that aggregated possession substantially\naffects interstate commerce by \"creat[ing] and sustain[ing] a\nmarket for\" child pornography).\n\n                                            -20-\n\f            As the Third Circuit observed, \"[t]here is a subtle\n\ntransformation     at   work\"   in   applying   the   Wickard   aggregation\n\nrationale to situations where the \"home-grown\" production and\n\nconsumption of a commodity does not necessarily substitute for a\n\ncommercially produced version that the defendant would otherwise\n\nhave purchased in the marketplace.          Rodia, 194 F.3d at 476.     The\n\nRodia court noted that Wickard has not been limited strictly to\n\nscenarios   of    commodity     substitution,   however,   and    Wickard's\n\n\"generic principle--that intrastate activity, if repeated, may\n\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce,\" id., is still sound. In\n\nboth Lopez and Morrison, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the vitality\n\nof Wickard while emphasizing that its aggregation principle should\n\nbe applied only to statutes that regulate economic or commercial\n\nactivities.      Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561; Morrison, 529 U.S. at 610.\n\n            In addition to our own precedent applying Wickard's\n\nprinciples to a child pornography statute in Robinson, the Supreme\n\nCourt long ago recognized that child pornography is a commodity\n\ninfluenced by and subject to economic market forces.             See Osborne\n\nv. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 109-10 (1990)(finding that it is \"surely\n\nreasonable for the State to conclude that it will decrease the\n\nproduction of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess\n\nand view the product, thereby decreasing demand\" while upholding an\n\nOhio pornography statute against a First Amendment challenge).           As\n\nthe Seventh Circuit succinctly said: \"A market has two sides,\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fsupply and demand; without both, the market collapses.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Richardson, 238 F.3d 837, 842 (7th Cir. 2001)(discussing\n\n§§ 2252(a)(2) and (a)(4)(B) in a sentencing context).                   See also\n\nKallestad,    236   F.3d   at    231     (\"A    true   market   is   inevitably\n\ncommercial, and is pushed by supply and demand, whether manifested\n\nin swaps or purchase and sale.\").                In Robinson, we addressed\n\npossession, the demand side of the child pornography market. Here,\n\nwe address production, the supply side of that market.                       While\n\npossessing child pornography fuels the demand side of the market,\n\nproducing child pornography fuels the supply side of the market.\n\nThe same logic we used in Robinson applies here: by outlawing the\n\npurely local production of child pornography, Congress can curb the\n\nnationwide supply for these materials.             See Robinson, 137 F.3d at\n\n656.   The prohibition on intrastate production \"curb[s] the supply\n\nof child pornography at its source, before it [is] released into\n\nthe interstate market.\"         Rodia, 194 F.3d at 477 n.5.\n\n            Defendant's reading of Lopez and Morrison ignores our\n\nanalysis in Robinson.      Producing child pornography is an economic\n\nactivity because it creates a product for which there is an\n\nextensive    national   market,    and    \"in    every   case   where   we   have\n\nsustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in\n\nWickard, the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial\n\ncharacter.\"    Morrison, 529 U.S. at 610 n.4.(citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\f              Here, Congress wishes to regulate the availability of\n\nchild pornography in the national market.                Because a significant\n\nportion of the child pornography about which Congress was concerned\n\n\"is    homegrown,       untraceable,    and    enters    the    national    market\n\nsurreptitiously, [the Second Circuit] conclude[d] that Congress, in\n\nan attempt to halt interstate trafficking, can prohibit local\n\nproduction that feeds the national market and stimulates demand, as\n\nthis       production    substantially     affects      interstate    commerce.\"\n\nHolston, 343 F.3d at 90.        We agree.      Often, as is the case here, it\n\nis necessary to control local behavior to ensure the effectiveness\n\nof interstate regulation.          See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel\n\nCorp., 301 U.S. 1, 37-38 (1937); see also Kallestad, 236 F.3d at\n\n231 (\"[W]e have little hesitation in concluding that where the\n\nproduct is fungible, such that it is difficult if not impossible to\n\ntrace, Congress can prohibit local possession in an effort to\n\nregulate product supply and demand and thereby halt interstate\n\ntrade.\"). We conclude, therefore, that §2251(a) reaches intrastate\n\nactivity       that     substantially     affects       the    interstate    child\n\npornography market.        It is a facially valid exercise of Congress's\n\nCommerce Clause power.7\n\n\n       7\n      This holding is in line with that of seven other appellate\ncircuits that, since Morrison, have upheld convictions against\nconstitutional challenges on Commerce Clause grounds to either §\n2251(a) or the analogous possession statute, § 2252(a)(4)(B). See\nUnited States v. Holston, 343 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2003)(§ 2251(a));\nUnited States v. Galo, 239 F.3d 572 (3d Cir. 2001)(§§ 2251(a) and\n2252(a)(4)(B)); United States v. Buculei, 262 F.3d 322 (4th Cir.\n\n                                        -23-\n\f           3.     The Constitutionality of § 2251(a) As Applied to\n                  Morales\n\n           We    turn    now   to    Morales's    claim   that   §   2251(a)   is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to him.             In support of that position,\n\nthe defendant argues that his individual conduct falls outside the\n\nclass of activity properly regulated by Congress because \"although\n\n[he] may have engaged in sexually explicit conduct with a minor for\n\nthe   purpose     of    producing      visual     depictions     for    his    own\n\ngratification, the evidence has shown that defendant did not\n\npurchase, trade, sell or barter the self-generated pornography, nor\n\n[did] he   [have] any intention to do so.\"                  This argument is\n\nunpersuasive.     When Congress regulates a class of activities that\n\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce, a defendant's claim that\n\nhis personal activities did not affect interstate commerce fails if\n\nhis activity is within that class.               When \"'a general regulatory\n\nstatute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis\n\ncharacter of individual instances arising under that statute is of\n\nno consequence.'\"        Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558 (quoting Maryland v.\n\nWirtz,   392    U.S.    184,   197   n.27).

For a\ncontrary view in the as-applied context, see United States v. Corp,\n236 F.3d 325 (6th Cir. 2001)(upholding an as-applied challenge to\n§ 2252(a)(4)(B)); and United States v. McCoy, 323 F.3d 1114 (9th\nCir. 2003)(same), both of which we discuss infra.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fpunishment for any person who \"employs, uses, persuades, induces,\n\nentices, or coerces any minor to engage in . . . sexually explicit\n\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such\n\nconduct[],\" including intrastate production of child pornography\n\nfor personal use.           18 U.S.C. § 2251(a).          Contrary to Morales's\n\narguments,    the    government       is    not   required    to   prove   that   the\n\ndefendant's actions, standing alone, had an effect on interstate\n\ncommerce, and the fact that Morales did not sell or distribute the\n\npornographic tapes of himself and the minor is irrelevant.8\n\n             In    reaching    this    conclusion,       we   do   not   reject   all\n\npossible as-applied Commerce Clause challenges to § 2251(a) and the\n\nrelated child pornography statutes.9                To amplify this point, we\n\ndistinguish       between    different      types   of   as-applied      challenges.\n\nThere is the kind of challenge we have in this case–-a claim that\n\nconduct clearly within the language of the statute (inducing a\n\nminor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of\n\n\n\n     8\n      The government still must prove, as it did here, that the\nmaterials used to produce the pornographic depiction were \"mailed,\nshipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any\nmeans . . . \" because it is an element of the charged offense. §\n2251(a). Whatever the limited value of the jurisdictional element\nin assuring that the statute meets the constitutional requirement\nof the Commerce Clause, it is an element of the offense that the\ngovernment must address in all prosecutions under the statute.\n     9\n      Also, we do not intend to express any view regarding as-\napplied challenges to statutes relating to the regulation of adult\npornography. The State has \"greater leeway in the regulation of\npornographic depictions of children.\" New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.\n747, 756.\n\n                                           -25-\n\fproducing a visual depiction) is nevertheless beyond the power of\n\nCongress to criminalize because the perpetrator does not intend to\n\nsell or distribute the visual depiction.   This claim fails because\n\nCongress's power to criminalize this conduct pursuant to the\n\nCommerce Clause turns on the economic nature of the class of\n\nconduct defined in the statute rather than the economic facts (such\n\nas sale or distribution) of a single case.      As we have already\n\nindicated, Lopez and Morrison proscribe this kind of as-applied\n\nchallenge.\n\n          However, there are as-applied challenges that might focus\n\non facts other than the economic facts of the particular case.\n\nThese facts could include the age of the minor, the relationship\n\nbetween the defendant and the minor, the nature of the allegedly\n\nsexually explicit conduct, and the nature of the visual depiction\n\nof that conduct.   In a given prosecution, some of these facts could\n\nraise constitutional privacy concerns10 or concerns that the conduct\n\nat issue, although covered by the language of the statute, was not\n\nwithin the sphere of activity identified by Congress as the basis\n\nfor its exercise of power under the Commerce Clause.   In Lopez and\n\nMorrison, the Supreme Court consulted legislative history for\n\n\n\n     10\n      For example, the Supreme Court has held that states cannot\nregulate the private possession of adult obscenity, Stanley v.\nGeorgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969), the private sexual activity of\nmarried couples, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), or\nthe private sexual activity of other adults, Lawrence v. Texas, 539\nU.S. 558 (2003).\n\n                                -26-\n\fCongress's judgment about the conduct it wished to regulate and the\n\nrelationship between that conduct and interstate commerce.                       See\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 557; Morrison, 529 U.S. at 614.                     Here, the\n\nlegislative history of the child pornography statutes reveals that\n\nCongress exercised its Commerce Clause power because of its concern\n\nabout     the     extensive     child      exploitation       industry:     \"child\n\nexploitation       has    become    a     multi-million       dollar    industry,\n\ninfiltrated and operated by elements of organized crime, and by a\n\nnationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire\n\nto exploit children.\"           Pub. L. No. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341-74\n\n(1986).     See also Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 1(4), 110 Stat. 3009-\n\n26,(1996), available at 1996 WL 506646.              Accordingly, the absence\n\nof such exploitation in a given case might be relevant to the as-\n\napplied inquiry.\n\n            Two     of   our    sister     courts    have    upheld    as-applied\n\nchallenges to the analogous possession statute, § 2252(a)(4)(B),\n\nand Morales relies heavily on their reasoning.                 See United States\n\nv. Corp, 236 F.3d 325 (6th Cir. 2001); United States v. McCoy, 323\n\nF.3d 1114 (9th Cir. 2003).         In Corp, the defendant plead guilty to\n\na single count of possession based on a picture of a seventeen-\n\nyear-old    girl,    taken     shortly    before    her   eighteenth    birthday,\n\nengaging in consensual sexual activity with Corp's twenty-six-year-\n\nold wife.       Noting that \"Corp was not involved, nor intended to be\n\ninvolved,    in    the   distribution      or   sharing     with   others   of   the\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fpictures in question,\" and that the minor was \"not an 'exploited\n\nchild' nor a victim in any real and practical sense in this case,\"\n\nthe Sixth Circuit stated that \"we do not determine the aggregate\n\neffect on interstate commerce of the purely intrastate dealing in\n\nchild pornography.      Instead, we conclude that Corp's activity was\n\nnot of a type demonstrated             substantially to be connected or\n\nrelated to interstate commerce on the facts of this case.\"                   Corp,\n\n236 F.3d at 332.\n\n           The Ninth Circuit, relying on Corp, reached a similar\n\nconclusion in McCoy.         There, a mother was prosecuted under the\n\npossession statute for a single picture of her and her daughter\n\nwith their genital areas exposed.             Faced with a defendant who was\n\nintoxicated when her husband took the picture, and who clearly was\n\nnot a pedophile or sexual predator, the Ninth Circuit stated that\n\n\"no one claims that [the mother] is or is likely to become a child\n\npornographer.\"     McCoy, 323 F.3d at 1132.             Furthermore, \"McCoy's\n\n'home-grown' photograph never entered in and was never intended for\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce.\"               Id. (emphasis in original).\n\nStating   that    \"McCoy's     possession       was    non-economic    and     non-\n\ncommercial,\"     the   McCoy   court    concluded      that   \"nothing    in   the\n\ncircumstances     of    McCoy's    case       establishes     any     substantial\n\nconnection   between    her    conduct    and    any    interstate    commercial\n\nactivity.\"     Id. (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\f            We     must   acknowledge     some   reservations    about   certain\n\naspects of the analysis in the Corp and McCoy decisions.                    Both\n\ncourts noted that the sexually explicit visual depictions in those\n\ncases were not intended for distribution.             Corp, 236 F.3d at 332;\n\nMcCoy, 323 F.3d at 1132.           Based in part on this observation, the\n\ncourts concluded--explicitly in McCoy, and impliedly in Corp--that\n\nthe conduct at issue was non-economic and non-commercial in nature.\n\nHaving thus labeled the conduct at issue as non-economic and non-\n\ncommercial, the courts could then avoid applying the Wickard\n\naggregation principle to the as-applied challenge.\n\n            As we have already noted in our discussion of the facial\n\nchallenge to § 2251(a), \"in every case where [the Supreme Court\n\nhas] sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle\n\nin Wickard, the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial\n\ncharacter.\"        Morrison, 529 U.S. at 610 n.4.(citation omitted).\n\nHowever, that \"apparent commercial character\" does not depend on\n\nany intent by an individual defendant involved in the illegal\n\nconduct     to    introduce    the   proscribed      visual   depictions    into\n\ncommerce.     In Lopez and Morrison, the Supreme Court discussed the\n\ntype   of    activity       broadly--as    defined    in   the   statute--when\n\ndetermining       whether    the   regulated     conduct   was   commercial   or\n\neconomic, and when discussing the attenuation of the link between\n\nthe regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate\n\ncommerce.        For example, Lopez focused on the fact that the GFSZA\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\f\"is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with\n\n'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly\n\nthose terms are defined.\" Lopez, 514 U.S. at 549 (emphasis added).\n\nAlso, the Lopez Court discussed \"firearm possession in a local\n\nschool zone,\" not a 12th-grade student bringing a concealed handgun\n\nto school.    Id. at 563.    Likewise, in Morrison, the Court spoke of\n\n\"gender-motived violence\" generally, not the defendants' alleged\n\nrape of their college classmate.         Morrison, 529 U.S. at 615.    Lopez\n\nand Morrison demand that the general subject of the statute, not\n\nthe defendant's individual activity, be economic in nature to\n\njustify aggregation under Wickard.\n\n             We   think   that   Judge    Trott's   dissent   in   McCoy   is\n\npersuasive on this important point.\n\n             My compassionate friends are not incorrect in\n             describing the underlying microcosmic facts of\n             this case as (1) wholly personal, (2) not\n             commercial, (3) strictly intrastate, and (4)\n             the product of an isolated alcohol-fueled\n             episode--all suggesting that Rhonda McCoy and\n             her family need help, not federal prison.\n             However, I conclude, based on Supreme Court\n             precedent, that the majority's legal approach\n             is   not   correctly    grounded.   The   real\n             determinative question is whether the activity\n             generically described in the statute has a\n             substantial effect on interstate commerce such\n             that it is subject to criminalization by\n             Congress.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fMcCoy,    323   F.3d   at   1134    (Trott,   J.   dissenting)(emphasis        in\n\noriginal).11    The Second Circuit engaged in similar reasoning to\n\nreach the same conclusion in upholding § 2251(a) against an as-\n\napplied Commerce Clause challenge in United States v. Holston, 343\n\nF.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2003).            Quoting its own precedent involving a\n\nCommerce Clause challenge to a federal statute that prohibited\n\ngrowing marijuana      even   when    the    defendant   did   not    intend   to\n\ndistribute the drug, the Holston court held that\n\n            when Congress regulates a class of activities\n            that substantially affect interstate commerce,\n            \"[t]he fact that certain intrastate activities\n            within this class, such as growing marijuana\n            solely for personal consumption, may not\n            actually have significant effect on interstate\n            commerce is . . . irrelevant.\"       Moreover,\n            \"[t]he nexus to interstate commerce . . . is\n            determined   by   the  class   of   activities\n            regulated by the statute as a whole, not by\n            the simple act for which an individual\n            defendant is convicted.\"\n\nHolston, 343 F.3d at 90 (quoting Proyect v. United States, 101 F.3d\n\n11 (2d Cir. 1996)(per curiam)(alterations in original)).                In both\n\nCorp and McCoy, a minor was induced to engage in sexually explicit\n\nconduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction that could\n\nfind its way into the national market for pornography.               It does not\n\nmatter that the defendant had no intention of placing that visual\n\ndepiction in the national market.\n\n\n     11\n      To the extent that Judge Trott in his dissent in McCoy took\nthe position that there can be no as-applied challenges in Commerce\nClause cases when the conduct falls within the language of the\nstatute, we disagree for the reasons already stated. See infra.\n\n                                      -31-\n\f              However, to the extent that the Sixth and Ninth Circuits\n\nconsidered the defendants' non-predatory, non-exploitative conduct\n\nin deciding that their conduct fell outside the purview of the\n\nstatute and the Congressional concerns that prompted its passage\n\npursuant to the Commerce Clause, we agree with the relevance of\n\nthis consideration.        The Corp court emphasized that the minor was\n\nalmost eighteen years old and willingly participated in the sexual\n\nconduct.      Similarly, the McCoy court emphasized that the single\n\npornographic     picture    represented    questionable   judgment     by   an\n\nintoxicated parent, not the predatory act of a pedophile.              Unlike\n\nthe inappropriate reliance in Corp and McCoy on the absence of an\n\nintent to distribute the depictions in commerce, their reliance on\n\nthe age of the minor, the relationship between the defendants and\n\nthe minor, and the absence of predatory exploitation all seem\n\nimportant and appropriate questions to ask in considering whether\n\nthe conduct at issue in an as-applied challenge falls within the\n\nclass of activity which bears the substantial relationship to\n\ninterstate activity that justifies action by Congress under the\n\nCommerce Clause.\n\n              On the facts of the case before us, we are comfortable\n\nthat \"the acts charged against [Morales] were well within the\n\nlimits   of    legitimate    congressional   concern,\"    Sabri   v.   United\n\nStates, 2004 WL 1085233, (May 17, 2004).           Specifically, Morales\n\nsexually exploited a thirteen-year-old girl, coercing her into\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\fperforming sex acts with him on multiple occasions, for the purpose\n\nof videotaping their encounters. As this conduct seems well within\n\nthe bounds of what Congress intended--and had the authority--to\n\nproscribe under its Commerce Clause power, we reject Morales's as-\n\napplied challenge.12\n\n                  B. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          In addition to his constitutional challenges, Morales\n\nalso raises a sufficiency of the evidence claim.   Appellate courts\n\nreview claims regarding the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Hernández, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).    The\n\nevidence presented at trial must be evaluated in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government, and all reasonable inferences will be\n\ndrawn in its favor.    United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).   When a plausible read of the record supports the\n\nverdict, we will not overturn the jury’s determination on appeal.\n\nUnited States v. Ortíz, 996 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      Our colleague limits her concurrence to the sufficiency of\nthe evidence analysis and the affirmance of the conviction,\nsuggesting that our decision in United States v. Robinson, 137 F.3d\n652 (1st Cir. 1998) obviates the need for any further analysis.\nRespectfully, we disagree for two reasons. First, we read Robinson\nas only a facial analysis of a Commerce Clause challenge to the\nanalogous possession statute, not an as-applied ruling on the\nstatute at issue here. Second, United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S.\n598 (2000), post-dates Robinson by two years.             Defendant\nspecifically argued that Morrison, in combination with United\nStates v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), precluded the applicability\nof the Wickard aggregation principle endorsed by Robinson. That is\nnot an insubstantial argument. It had to be addressed.\n\n                                 -33-\n\f            Morales argues that the government failed to prove one of\n\nthe elements of an 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) violation--namely, that the\n\ndefendant induced the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct\n\nfor the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct.\n\nThe defendant argues that the video was the result of, not the\n\nmotive behind, his sex acts with the minor.                      At trial, Morales\n\ntestified that he and the girl had \"romantic feelings\" for each\n\nother and that the video \"came about by chance.\"                    Noting that he\n\nhad created videos of himself and his wife having sex, and that\n\nthey used the tape solely for their own use, he says that this\n\nhistory bolsters his claim that he did not engage in sex with the\n\nminor for the purpose of recording the encounters.\n\n            As succinctly explained by the district court, \"the\n\ntestimony of the minor, the testimony of the defendant, and the\n\nvideotape itself constitute an evidentiary basis sufficient to\n\nallow a jury to find that the defendant induced the minor to have\n\nsexual relations     with    him     for   the    purpose     of    recording      that\n\nconduct.\" The evidence shows that the defendant actively concealed\n\nfrom the minor the fact that he was videotaping her.                     He told her\n\nthat the video camera was connected to the television so that she\n\n\"could   see     herself\"    while       the    two     had   sexual      relations.\n\nAdditionally,     while    taping    his    sex   acts    with     the    minor,    the\n\ndefendant    gave   her     specific       instructions       regarding        certain\n\npositions   he    wanted    her     to   assume       relative     to    the   camera,\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\finstructed her on what to say while the camera recorded their\n\nactivities, and used a remote control to zoom the camera in and out\n\nwhile they were having sex.\n\n             Furthermore, the defendant's claim that the videotaping\n\nwas not planned is implausible.      After the defendant had taken the\n\nminor to a motel room to have sex for the fourth time, he returned\n\nto his car and retrieved the recording equipment that he kept\n\nthere.   The defendant kept sexual aids in the same bag with the\n\ncamera, a fact which standing alone could lead the jury to infer\n\nthat   the   defendant   had   planned    to   videotape   the   encounters.\n\nSimilarly, the defendant's taping of his sexual activity            with his\n\nwife could lead a reasonable jury to believe that he also engaged\n\nin sex acts with the minor for the purpose of videotaping them.\n\nFinally, a reasonable jury also could infer that since Morales\n\ntaped sexual encounters with the minor more than once, he induced\n\nthe girl to engage in sex         acts for the purpose of creating\n\nvideotapes of their encounters.          On this background, we readily\n\nfind that the government's evidence was sufficient to support the\n\njury's guilty verdict.\n\n             AFFIRMED.\n\n                    - Concurring Opinions Follow -\n\n\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge, Concurring.         I join the judgment\n\naffirming the conviction and that portion of Judge Lipez's opinion\n\nin   Section   II.B.   which   rejects     Morales's   sufficiency   of    the\n\nevidence challenge.     I do not join the remainder of the opinion.\n\n             The defendant's as-applied Commerce Clause challenge to\n\nhis conviction is foreclosed by this court's previous opinion in\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 137 F.3d 652 (1st Cir. 1998), which I\n\nread as resolving that case on the basis of the \"as applied\"\n\nchallenge.     There is no need to address a facial challenge.            Even\n\nin the aftermath of United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000),\n\ndefendant    has   offered   no   principled   basis   for   distinguishing\n\nRobinson's acceptance, in this context, of the theory of a nexus to\n\ninterstate commerce contained in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111\n\n(1942).   See Robinson, 137 F.3d at 656.         That being so, the panel\n\nis bound by Robinson.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\f          OBERDORFER, Senior District Judge, Concurring.           I join\n\nthe majority opinion.    I am satisfied that it does not foreclose\n\n'as   applied'      challenges        in     limited,   yet-to-be-defined\n\ncircumstances. An overbroad definition of conduct constitutionally\n\nproscribed by the statute here at issue could impermissibly tilt\n\nthe balance between the federal interest in suppressing commerce in\n\npornography   and   violation    of    the    constitutional   protections\n\nafforded to the intimate relations of individuals and to the\n\ntraditional law enforcement prerogatives of the states. Because we\n\nrecognize that, in circumstances not present here, application of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) could be inconsistent with such limitations on\n\nfederal Commerce Clause power, I am satisfied that Section II.A.3\n\nof our opinion adequately honors those limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\f",

On appeal, he argues that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a), facially and as applied, is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause power, and that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction. Finding appellant's arguments unavailing, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of our analysis, we can avoid recounting most of the lurid details of this case. In short, Morales induced a thirteen-year-old girl, who was his god-daughter and a member of his church, to have sex with him in a motel on at least five separate occasions. During the final two encounters, Morales used materials and equipment that had moved in interstate commerce to videotape the pair's sex acts. After his wife discovered the tape in the backseat of his car and played it, she informed the girl's parents, who then contacted police. Morales was duly arrested, charged, and indicted for two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a), which provides in pertinent part that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]ny person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in ... sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct[] shall be punished as provided under subsection (d), ... if that visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales's three-day jury trial produced a guilty verdict on both counts. After the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a judgment of acquittal, he was sentenced to 135 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently, and fined $1,000 with a special monetary assessment of $100. The district court ordered the federal sentence to be served concurrently with a 25-year state sentence based on charges filed for the same conduct at issue here. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A. Constitutional Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales appears to bring both facial and as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of &#167; 2251(a). Relying on <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), Morales urges that &#167; 2251(a) is unconstitutional because it attempts to regulate intrastate child pornography created exclusively for personal use which, Morales argues, does not affect interstate commerce. Morales further argues that even if the statute is facially constitutional, it is unconstitutional as applied to him because his activities were not commercial in nature and did not implicate interstate commerce. We review constitutional challenges de novo. <i>United States v.

When this statute was originally enacted as part of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-225, &#167; 2(a), 92 Stat. 7, 8 (1978)(codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2251 et seq.)(\"the Act\"), it targeted production of child pornography only if the pornographic depiction itself was transported in interstate commerce, or if the defendant knew, or should have known, that the depiction would be transported in interstate commerce. In 1998, Congress amended the Act by adding the jurisdictional element we have before us today: only the materials used to produce the pornographic depictions must \"have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means....\" to subject a potential defendant to liability. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Lopez and Morrison</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales argues that the \"materials-in-commerce\" Morales argues that the \"materials-in-commerce\" jurisdictional element in &#167; 2251(a) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause power<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in light of <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). In <i>Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (GFSZA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q)(1)(A), which prohibited knowingly possessing a firearm within 1000 feet of a school. The Supreme Court enumerated three categories of activities that Congress may properly regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, ... i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (citations omitted). Since the GFSZA regulated neither channels nor instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the <i>Lopez</i> Court analyzed the statute under the third category: activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. <i>Id.</i> at 559.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding the GFSZA constitutionally infirm, the Supreme Court held that because the statute \"by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise,\" it could not be upheld under precedents that approved \"regulations of activities that ... are connected with a commercial transaction that, when viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624. Second, the Court observed that the GFSZA lacked a jurisdictional element that would \"ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, the Court stated that although congressional findings about the \"legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce\" were not required, such findings would have helped the Court evaluate the impact of the activity on interstate commerce \"even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.\" <i>Id.</i> at 563, 115 S.Ct. 1624. Based on these considerations, the Court found the GFSZA to be unconstitutional. <i>Id.</i> at 567-68, 115 S.Ct. 1624.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court amplified <i>Lopez's</i> holding five years later in <i>Morrison,</i> when the court evaluated a federal civil remedy for victims of gender-based violence, as set forth in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (\"VAWA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 13981 (\"A person ... who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender ... shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages....\"). There, as in <i>Lopez,</i> the court was faced with another so-called category three regulation, pertaining to activities that allegedly have a substantial relation to interstate commerce. <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 600, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Drawing on its reasoning in <i>Lopez,</i> the <i>Morrison</i> Court identified four factors to consider in determining whether a statute regulates an activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce: (1) whether the statute regulates economic or commercial activity; (2) whether the statute contains an \"express jurisdictional element\" that limits the reach of its provisions; (3) whether Congress made findings regarding the regulated activity's impact on interstate commerce; and (4) whether \"the link between [the regulated activity] and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated.\" <i>Id.</i> at 610-12, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In striking down the VAWA, the Court found that \"gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity,\" and that the statute lacked a jurisdictional element \"establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Further, the Court held that while Congress had made explicit findings \"regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families, ... the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 614, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Finally, the Court found that a \"causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime ... to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce ... would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption.\" <i>Id.</i> at 615, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Constitutionality of &#167; 2251(a) on Its Face</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because &#167; 2251(a) regulates neither channels nor instrumentalities of interstate commerce, we analyze the constitutionality of the statute as a category three regulation under <i>Lopez.</i> Accordingly, we must apply the four <i>Morrison</i> factors to determine whether the statute regulates an activity that \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.

In passing those amendments, Congress found that \"the existence of a traffic in child pornographic images ... inflames the desires of child molesters, pedophiles, and child pornographers who prey on children, thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography....\" Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 1(4), 110 Stat. 3009-26, (1996), <i>available at</i> 1996 WL 506646.

Congress offered two reasons for this amendment. First, it wanted the new jurisdictional element of the production statute to mirror the existing jurisdictional element of the possession statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See</i> H.R.

Second, Congress was concerned about federal law enforcement's current inability to prosecute \"a number of cases where the defendant produced the child pornography but did not intend to transport the images in interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this comprehensive backdrop, there is no question that Congress has made explicit findings about the extensive national market in child pornography and the need to diminish that national market by prohibiting the production of child pornography at the local level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The commercial or economic nature of the regulated activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The congressional finding over 25 years ago that child pornography is a \"multimillion dollar industry that operates on a nationwide scale\" emphasizes that the underlying activity regulated by the child pornography statutes &#8212; the production, distribution, and possession of child pornography &#8212; is commercial activity, unlike the activity addressed by the federal legislation struck down in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison.</i> As the <i>Lopez</i> Court stated, the GFSZA \"by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624. The <i>Morrison</i> Court made a similar observation: \"Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity.\" <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Possessing firearms in a school zone and committing gender-based violence do not involve goods or services that can be bought and sold. There are no markets for these activities. In contrast, there are large markets for child pornography. \"[W]hen a person produces for [his] own consumption a product that is traded in an interstate market, his conduct is economic in character.\" <i>United States v. Kallestad,</i> 236 F.3d 225, 228 (5th Cir.2000)(upholding the constitutionality of &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B)). In contrast, then, to <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the regulated activity here &#8212; producing child pornography &#8212; is an economic activity. <i>See also United States v. Buculei,</i> 262 F.3d 322, 329 (4th Cir.2001)(\"There can be no doubt that the production of visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, i.e., child pornography, is economic in nature.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

Importantly, the jurisdictional element discussed here, and the requirement of a substantial impact on interstate commerce, discussed in the next section, are distinct inquiries. At a minimum, the presence of a jurisdictional element \"may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress's regulation of interstate commerce.\" <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 612, 120 S.Ct. 1740. In addition to this express invocation of Commerce Clause power, the jurisdictional element may also serve to ensure that the defendant's conduct has at least some \"explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce\" and limit the statute's reach to such cases. <i>Id.</i> at 611-12, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales complains that because Puerto Rico is an island heavily dependent on imports, the jurisdictional element of &#167; 2251(a), which requires only that the materials of production have moved in interstate commerce, does not limit the statute's reach at all. He makes a fair point about this jurisdictional element that applies to any locale in the United States. As the Third Circuit observed in ruling on the same statute: \"as a practical matter, the limiting jurisdictional factor is almost useless here, since all but the most self-sufficient child pornographers will rely on film, cameras, or chemicals that traveled in interstate commerce....\" <i>United States v. Rodia,</i> 194 F.3d 465, 473 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are instances, however, where the jurisdictional element of a statute will more effectively limit the number of cases that fall under the purview of the statute, as envisioned by the Supreme Court. For example, in passing a federal arson statute, Congress criminalized damaging or destroying, \"by means of fire or an explosive, any ... property <i>used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.</i>\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)(Supp. IV 1994)(emphasis added). In <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 848, 859, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), the Supreme Court reversed a conviction under this statute for the arson of a purely private residence. The Court found that by criminalizing the arson of property only if it was\" `used in' commerce or commerce affecting activities,\" <i>id.</i> at 850-51, 120 S.Ct. 1904, Congress did not intend to exercise its full power under the Commerce Clause, leaving residential arson cases \"to the law enforcement authorities of the states.\" <i>Id.</i> at 859, 120 S.Ct. 1904. As the Supreme Court noted: \"The key word is `used.' `Congress did not define the crime described in &#167; 844(i) as the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction might affect interstate commerce....'\" <i>Id.</i> at 854, 120 S.Ct. 1904 (quoting <i>United States v. Mennuti,</i> 639 F.2d 107, 110 (2d Cir.1981)). The Supreme Court read the jurisdictional element of &#167; 844(i) as evidence of Congress's recognition of the \"distinction between legislation limited to activities `in commerce' and legislation invoking Congress's full power over activity substantially `affecting ... commerce.'\" <i>Jones,</i> 529 U.S. at 856, 120 S.Ct. 1904 (quoting <i>Russell v. United States,</i> 471 U.S. 858, 859-60, 105 S.Ct. 2455, 85 L.Ed.2d 829 (1985))(alteration in original). The jurisdictional element of the federal arson statute, then, required a somewhat heightened nexus between the defendant's conduct and an effect on interstate commerce. <i>See United States v. Fenton,</i> [367 F.3d 14], 2004 WL 943624, at *7 (1st Cir. May 4, 2004)(explaining that \"the <i>Jones</i> Court concluded that an owner-occupied private dwelling did not have a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to satisfy the jurisdictional element because the owner was not actively using the property in a way that affected interstate commerce.\") As <i>Fenton</i> and <i>Jones</i> itself make clear, Congress limited the reach of the arson statute to property that was used directly in interstate commerce or that was used in activities that affected interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In passing &#167; 2251(a), however, Congress formulated a broader jurisdictional element that both invokes its Commerce Clause power and purports to exercise that power by reaching any child pornography that was produced using materials that moved in interstate commerce. Although this jurisdictional element ensures that any prosecuted conduct has a minimal nexus with interstate commerce, that minimal nexus may not meet the substantial effect requirement of <i>Morrison.</i> In <i>Rodia,</i> the Third Circuit found it \"at least doubtful... that the jurisdictional element adequately performs the function of guaranteeing that the final product regulated substantially affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Rodia,</i> 194 F.3d at 473. We agree with this observation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the jurisdictional element bore sole responsibility for establishing that the impact of the regulated activity on interstate commerce is substantial or direct, the language of &#167; 2251(a) likely would not be up to the task. The jurisdictional element focuses on things such as film, cameras, videotapes, and recorders moving in interstate commerce, which are then used to produce child pornography. As a matter of logic, this Commerce Clause premise has the kind of flaw so worrisome to the Supreme Court in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> &#8212; it could justify federalizing a vast array of crimes now prosecuted by the states, solely because the criminal used \"materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate of foreign commerce by any means.\" <i>See Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 564, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (explaining that if Congress could regulate criminal acts simply because they have external costs or affect national productivity, \"it [would be] difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States have historically been sovereign.\") Moreover, the congressional findings about the link between the regulated activity (production of child pornography) and interstate commerce did not claim that the market for child pornography was increasing the demand for film and cameras. The focus, instead, was on a different link &#8212; the relationship between local production of child pornography and the national market for the child pornography itself. This is the link that is the focus of the separate inquiry in the following section about the substantial effect of the regulated activity on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the disconnect between the interstate commerce activity described in the jurisdictional element of &#167; 2251(a) and the interstate commerce activity (the national market for child pornography) that prompted Congress to criminalize the production of child pornography is not fatal to the constitutionality of the statute. Indeed, even a complete absence of a jurisdictional element in the text of a statute is not fatal to a statute challenged on Commerce Clause grounds. \"[I]n <i>Lopez,</i> the Court simply did not state or imply that all criminal statutes must have such an element, ... or that any statute without such an element is per se unconstitutional.\" <i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 73 F.3d 675, 685 (7th Cir.1995). <i>See also Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton,</i> 323 F.3d 1062, 1068 (D.C.Cir.2003)(\"[T]he absence of such a jurisdictional element simply means that courts must determine independently whether the statute regulates activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affect[] interstate commerce.\") (quoting <i>United States v. Moghadam,</i> 175 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.1999)). On the other hand, any statute enacted pursuant to the Congress's Commerce Clause power that does not regulate channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, must regulate activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Otherwise, courts will strike it down as unconstitutional.

Filburn, a farmer who grew wheat exclusively for consumption on his own farm, challenged the constitutionality of the act, arguing that the breadth of the regulation exceeded Congress's Commerce Clause authority because it reached purely local production and consumption. In upholding the statute, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could regulate intrastate activity when such activity, taken in the aggregate, might ultimately have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. <i>Wickard,</i> 317 U.S. at 125, 63 S.Ct. 82 (\"Even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> prohibit applying the aggregation principle to the child pornography laws.

In both <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the Supreme Court reaffirmed the vitality of <i>Wickard</i> while emphasizing that its aggregation principle should be applied only to statutes that regulate economic or commercial activities. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624; <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 610, 120 S.Ct. 1740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to our own precedent applying <i>Wickard's</i> principles to a child pornography statute in <i>Robinson,</i> the Supreme Court long ago recognized that child pornography is a commodity influenced by and subject to economic market forces. <i>See Osborne v.

As the Seventh Circuit succinctly said: \"A market has two sides, supply and demand; without both, the market collapses.\" <i>United States v.

In <i>Robinson,</i> we addressed possession, the demand side of the child pornography market. Here, we address production, the supply side of that market. While possessing child pornography fuels the demand side of the market, producing child pornography fuels the supply side of the market. The same logic we used in <i>Robinson</i> applies here: by outlawing the purely local production of child pornography, Congress can curb the nationwide supply for these materials. <i>See Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d at 656. The prohibition on intrastate production \"curb[s] the supply of child pornography at its source, before it [is] released into the interstate market.\" <i>Rodia,</i> 194 F.3d at 477 n. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's reading of <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> ignores our analysis in <i>Robinson.</i> Producing child pornography is an economic activity because it creates a product for which there is an extensive national market, and \"in every case where we have sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in <i>Wickard,</i> the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial character.\" <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 610 n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 1740.(citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Congress wishes to regulate the availability of child pornography in the national market. Because a significant portion of the child pornography about which Congress was concerned \"is homegrown, untraceable, and enters the national market surreptitiously, [the Second Circuit] conclude[d] that Congress, in an attempt to halt interstate trafficking, can prohibit local production that feeds the national market and stimulates demand, as this production substantially affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Holston,</i> 343 F.3d at 90. We agree. Often, as is the case here, it is necessary to control local behavior to ensure the effectiveness of interstate regulation. <i>See NLRB v.

We conclude, therefore, that &#167; 2251(a) reaches intrastate activity that substantially affects the interstate child pornography market.

In support of that position, the defendant argues that his individual conduct falls outside the class of activity properly regulated by Congress because \"although [he] may have engaged in sexually explicit conduct with a minor for the purpose of producing visual depictions for his own gratification, the evidence has shown that defendant did not purchase, trade, sell or barter the self-generated pornography, nor [did] he [have] any intention to do so.\" This argument is unpersuasive. When Congress regulates a class of activities that substantially affects interstate commerce, a defendant's claim that his personal activities did not affect interstate commerce fails if his activity is within that class. When\" `a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.'\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (quoting <i>Maryland v. Wirtz,</i> 392 U.S. 183, 197 n. 27, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020). Here, Congress authorized punishment for any person who \"employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in ... sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct[],\" including intrastate production of child pornography for personal use. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a). Contrary to Morales's arguments, the government is not required to prove that the defendant's actions, standing alone, had an effect on interstate commerce, and the fact that Morales did not sell or distribute the pornographic tapes of himself and the minor is irrelevant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching this conclusion, we do not reject all possible as-applied Commerce Clause challenges to &#167; 2251(a) and the related child pornography statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> To amplify this point, we distinguish between different types of as-applied challenges. There is the kind of challenge we have in this case &#8212; a claim that conduct clearly within the language of the statute (inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction) is nevertheless beyond the power of Congress to criminalize because the perpetrator does not intend to sell or distribute the visual depiction. This claim fails because Congress's power to criminalize this conduct pursuant to the Commerce Clause turns on the economic nature of the class of conduct defined in the statute rather than the economic facts (such as sale or distribution) of a single case. As we have already indicated, <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> proscribe this kind of as-applied challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, there are as-applied challenges that might focus on facts other than the economic facts of the particular case. These facts could include the age of the minor, the relationship between the defendant and the minor, the nature of the allegedly sexually explicit conduct, and the nature of the visual depiction of that conduct. In a given prosecution, some of these facts could raise constitutional privacy concerns<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> or concerns that the conduct at issue, although covered by the language of the statute, was not within the sphere of activity identified by Congress as the basis for its exercise of power under the Commerce Clause. In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the Supreme Court consulted legislative history for Congress's judgment about the conduct it wished to regulate and the relationship between that conduct and interstate commerce. <i>See Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 557, 115 S.Ct. 1624; <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 614, 120 S.Ct. 1740. Here, the legislative history of the child pornography statutes reveals that Congress exercised its Commerce Clause power because of its concern about the extensive child exploitation industry: \"child exploitation has become a multi-million dollar industry, infiltrated and operated by elements of organized crime, and by a nationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children.\" Pub.L. No. 99-591, 100 Stat. 3341-74 (1986). <i>See also</i> Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 1(4), 110 Stat. 3009-26,(1996), <i>available at</i> 1996 WL 506646.

In <i>Corp,</i> the defendant plead guilty to a single count of possession based on a picture of a seventeen-year-old girl, taken shortly before her eighteenth birthday, engaging in consensual sexual activity with Corp's twenty-six-year-old wife. Noting that \"Corp was not involved, nor intended to be involved, in the distribution or sharing with others of the pictures in question,\" and that the minor was \"not an `exploited child' nor a victim in any real and practical sense in this case,\" the Sixth Circuit stated that \"we do not determine the aggregate effect on interstate commerce of the purely intrastate dealing in child pornography. Instead, we conclude that Corp's activity was not of a type demonstrated substantially to be connected or related to interstate commerce on the facts of this case.\" <i>Corp,</i> 236 F.3d at 332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit, relying on <i>Corp,</i> reached a similar conclusion in <i>McCoy.</i> There, a mother was prosecuted under the possession statute for a single picture of her and her daughter with their genital areas exposed. Faced with a defendant who was intoxicated when her husband took the picture, and who clearly was not a pedophile or sexual predator, the Ninth Circuit stated that \"no one claims that [the mother] is or is likely to become a child pornographer.\" <i>McCoy,</i> 323 F.3d at 1132. Furthermore, \"McCoy's `home-grown' photograph <i>never entered in and was never intended for interstate or foreign commerce.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). Stating that \"McCoy's possession was non-economic and non-commercial,\" the <i>McCoy</i> court concluded that \"nothing in the circumstances of McCoy's case establishes any substantial connection between her conduct and <i>any</i> interstate commercial activity.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must acknowledge some reservations about certain aspects of the analysis in the <i>Corp</i> and <i>McCoy</i> decisions. Both courts noted that the sexually explicit visual depictions in those cases were not intended for distribution. <i>Corp,</i> 236 F.3d at 332; <i>McCoy,</i> 323 F.3d at 1132. Based in part on this observation, the courts concluded &#8212; explicitly in <i>McCoy,</i> and impliedly in <i>Corp</i> &#8212; that the conduct at issue was non-economic and non-commercial in nature. Having thus labeled the conduct at issue as non-economic and non-commercial, the courts could then avoid applying the <i>Wickard</i> aggregation principle to the as-applied challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already noted in our discussion of the facial challenge to &#167; 2251(a), \"in every case where [the Supreme Court has] sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in <i>Wickard,</i> the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial character.\" <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 610 n. 4, 120 S.Ct. 1740.(citation omitted). However, that \"apparent commercial character\" does not depend on any intent by an individual defendant involved in the illegal conduct to introduce the proscribed visual depictions into commerce. In <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison,</i> the Supreme Court discussed the type of activity broadly &#8212; as defined in the statute &#8212; when determining whether the regulated conduct was commercial or economic, and when discussing the attenuation of the link between the regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate commerce. For example, <i>Lopez</i> focused on the fact that the GFSZA \"is a criminal statute that <i>by its terms</i> has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly those terms are defined.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (emphasis added). Also, the <i>Lopez</i> Court discussed \"firearm possession in a local school zone,\" not a 12th-grade student bringing a concealed handgun to school. <i>Id.</i> at 563.

The <i>Corp</i> court emphasized that the minor was almost eighteen years old and willingly participated in the sexual conduct. Similarly, the <i>McCoy</i> court emphasized that the single pornographic picture represented questionable judgment by an intoxicated parent, not the predatory act of a pedophile. Unlike the inappropriate reliance in <i>Corp</i> and <i>McCoy</i> on the absence of an intent to distribute the depictions in commerce, their reliance on the age of the minor, the relationship between the defendants and the minor, and the absence of predatory exploitation all seem important and appropriate questions to ask in considering whether the conduct at issue in an as-applied challenge falls within the class of activity which bears the substantial relationship to interstate activity that justifies action by Congress under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the facts of the case before us, we are comfortable that \"the acts charged against [Morales] were well within the limits of legitimate congressional concern,\" <i>Sabri v.

Specifically, Morales sexually exploited a thirteen-year-old girl, coercing her into performing sex acts with him on multiple occasions, for the purpose of videotaping their encounters.

At trial, Morales testified that he and the girl had \"romantic feelings\" for each other and that the video \"came about by chance.\" Noting that he had created videos of himself and his wife having sex, and that they used the tape solely for their own use, he says that this history bolsters his claim that he did not engage in sex with the minor for the purpose of recording the encounters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As succinctly explained by the district court, \"the testimony of the minor, the testimony of the defendant, and the videotape itself constitute an evidentiary basis sufficient to allow a jury to find that the defendant induced the minor to have sexual relations with him for the purpose of recording that conduct.\" The evidence shows that the defendant actively concealed from the minor the fact that he was videotaping her. He told her that the video camera was connected to the television so that she \"could see herself\" while the two had sexual relations. Additionally, while taping his sex acts with the minor, the defendant gave her specific instructions regarding certain positions he wanted her to assume relative to the camera, instructed her on what to say while the camera recorded their activities, and used a remote control to zoom the camera in and out while they were having sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the defendant's claim that the videotaping was not planned is implausible. After the defendant had taken the minor to a motel room to have sex for the fourth time, he returned to his car and retrieved the recording equipment that he kept there. The defendant kept sexual aids in the same bag with the camera, a fact which standing alone could lead the jury to infer that the defendant had planned to videotape the encounters. Similarly, the defendant's taping of his sexual activity with his wife could lead a reasonable jury to believe that he also engaged in sex acts with the minor for the purpose of videotaping them. Finally, a reasonable jury also could infer that since Morales taped sexual encounters with the minor more than once, he induced the girl to engage in sex acts for the purpose of creating videotapes of their encounters. On this background, we readily find that the government's evidence was sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Article I, &#167; 8 of the United States Constitution provides that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power To ... regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although we are reviewing the statute as amended in 1998, we treat congressional findings and the legislative history of the Act passed in 1978 as relevant to the inquiry<i>See Maryland v.

First, we read <i>Robinson</i> as only a facial analysis of a Commerce Clause challenge to the analogous possession statute, not an as-applied ruling on the statute at issue here. Second, <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), post-dates <i>Robinson</i> by two years.

Even in the aftermath of <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), defendant has offered no principled basis for distinguishing <i>Robinson's</i> acceptance, in this context, of the theory of a nexus to interstate commerce contained in <i>Wickard v. Filburn,</i> 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942). <i>See Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d at 656.

I am satisfied that it does not foreclose `as applied' challenges in limited, yet-to-be-defined circumstances. An overbroad definition of conduct constitutionally proscribed by the statute here at issue could impermissibly tilt the balance between the federal interest in suppressing commerce in pornography and violation of the constitutional protections afforded to the intimate relations of individuals and to the traditional law enforcement prerogatives of the states. Because we recognize that, in circumstances not present here, application of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a) could be inconsistent with such limitations on federal Commerce Clause power, I am satisfied that Section II.A.3 of our opinion adequately honors those limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

On appeal, he argues that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a), facially and as applied, is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause power, and that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction.

In short, Morales induced a thirteen-year-old girl, who was his god-daughter and a member of his church, to have sex with him in a motel on at least five separate occasions. During the final two encounters, Morales used materials and equipment that had moved in interstate commerce to videotape the pair's sex acts. After his wife discovered the tape in the backseat of his car and played it, she informed the girl's parents, who then contacted police.

Although this jurisdictional element ensures that any prosecuted conduct has a minimal nexus with interstate commerce, that minimal nexus may not meet the substantial effect requirement of <i>Morrison.</i> In <i>Rodia,</i> the Third Circuit found it \"at least doubtful... that the jurisdictional element adequately performs the function of guaranteeing that the final product regulated substantially affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Rodia,</i> 194 F.3d at 473.

The jurisdictional element focuses on things such as film, cameras, videotapes, and recorders moving in interstate commerce, which are then used to produce child pornography. As a matter of logic, this Commerce Clause premise has the kind of flaw so worrisome to the Supreme Court in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> &#8212; it could justify federalizing a vast array of crimes now prosecuted by the states, solely because the criminal used \"materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate of foreign commerce by any means.\" <i>See Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 564, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The focus, instead, was on a different link &#8212; the relationship between local production of child pornography and the national market for the child pornography itself.

Indeed, even a complete absence of a jurisdictional element in the text of a statute is not fatal to a statute challenged on Commerce Clause grounds. \"[I]n <i>Lopez,</i> the Court simply did not state or imply that all criminal statutes must have such an element, ... or that any statute without such an element is per se unconstitutional.\" <i>United States v.

This claim fails because Congress's power to criminalize this conduct pursuant to the Commerce Clause turns on the economic nature of the class of conduct defined in the statute rather than the economic facts (such as sale or distribution) of a single case.

The <i>Corp</i> court emphasized that the minor was almost eighteen years old and willingly participated in the sexual conduct. Similarly, the <i>McCoy</i> court emphasized that the single pornographic picture represented questionable judgment by an intoxicated parent, not the predatory act of a pedophile. Unlike the inappropriate reliance in <i>Corp</i> and <i>McCoy</i> on the absence of an intent to distribute the depictions in commerce, their reliance on the age of the minor, the relationship between the defendants and the minor, and the absence of predatory exploitation all seem important and appropriate questions to ask in considering whether the conduct at issue in an as-applied challenge falls within the class of activity which bears the substantial relationship to interstate activity that justifies action by Congress under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the facts of the case before us, we are comfortable that \"the acts charged against [Morales] were well within the limits of legitimate congressional concern,\" <i>Sabri v.

The defendant argues that the video was the result of, not the motive behind, his sex acts with the minor. At trial, Morales testified that he and the girl had \"romantic feelings\" for each other and that the video \"came about by chance.\" Noting that he had created videos of himself and his wife having sex, and that they used the tape solely for their own use, he says that this history bolsters his claim that he did not engage in sex with the minor for the purpose of recording the encounters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As succinctly explained by the district court, \"the testimony of the minor, the testimony of the defendant, and the videotape itself constitute an evidentiary basis sufficient to allow a jury to find that the defendant induced the minor to have sexual relations with him for the purpose of recording that conduct.\" The evidence shows that the defendant actively concealed from the minor the fact that he was videotaping her. He told her that the video camera was connected to the television so that she \"could see herself\" while the two had sexual relations. Additionally, while taping his sex acts with the minor, the defendant gave her specific instructions regarding certain positions he wanted her to assume relative to the camera, instructed her on what to say while the camera recorded their activities, and used a remote control to zoom the camera in and out while they were having sex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the defendant's claim that the videotaping was not planned is implausible. After the defendant had taken the minor to a motel room to have sex for the fourth time, he returned to his car and retrieved the recording equipment that he kept there. The defendant kept sexual aids in the same bag with the camera, a fact which standing alone could lead the jury to infer that the defendant had planned to videotape the encounters. Similarly, the defendant's taping of his sexual activity with his wife could lead a reasonable jury to believe that he also engaged in sex acts with the minor for the purpose of videotaping them. Finally, a reasonable jury also could infer that since Morales taped sexual encounters with the minor more than once, he induced the girl to engage in sex acts for the purpose of creating videotapes of their encounters. On this background, we readily find that the government's evidence was sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Article I, &#167; 8 of the United States Constitution provides that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power To ... regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although we are reviewing the statute as amended in 1998, we treat congressional findings and the legislative history of the Act passed in 1978 as relevant to the inquiry<i>See Maryland v.

Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197816\"><a href=\"/opinion/197816/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1998), which I read as resolving that case on the basis of the \"as applied\" challenge. There is no need to address a facial challenge. Even in the aftermath of <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1740</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span> (2000), defendant has offered no principled basis for distinguishing <i>Robinson's</i> acceptance, in this context, of the theory of a nexus to interstate commerce contained in <i>Wickard v. Filburn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103716\"><a href=\"/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span> (1942). <i>See Robinson,</i> 137 F.3d at 656. That being so, the panel is bound by <i>Robinson.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OBERDORFER, Senior District Judge, Concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I join the majority opinion. I am satisfied that it does not foreclose `as applied' challenges in limited, yet-to-be-defined circumstances. An overbroad definition of conduct constitutionally proscribed by the statute here at issue could impermissibly tilt the balance between the federal interest in suppressing commerce in pornography and violation of the constitutional protections afforded to the intimate relations of individuals and to the traditional law enforcement prerogatives of the states. Because we recognize that, in circumstances not present here, application of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a) could be inconsistent with such limitations on federal Commerce Clause power, I am satisfied that Section II.A.3 of our opinion adequately honors those limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
