Mukasey is substituted for former Attorney General Alberto R.\nGonzáles as respondent.\n**\n     Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.       Mom Phal and her husband,\n\nSoeun Nou, are citizens of Cambodia.            The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\") affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge\n\n(\"IJ\")   denying   their   applications   for    asylum,    withholding   of\n\nremoval, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").\n\nAfter careful consideration, we conclude that substantial evidence\n\nsupports the BIA's determination that Phal lacked credibility and\n\nthat she had failed to demonstrate a reasonable fear of future\n\npersecution.1   We therefore deny the petition for review.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n           On April 24, 2000, Phal entered the United States on a\n\nnonimmigrant visa; Nou arrived several months later. Within a year\n\nof Phal's entry, the couple filed an application for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal and also sought protection under the CAT,\n\nalleging persecution based on political opinion.           On June 3, 2003,\n\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a Notice to\n\nAppear, charging that Phal and Nou had remained in the United\n\nStates longer than permitted. They admitted to the allegations and\n\nconceded removability.      Phal and Nou, with counsel, appeared and\n\ntestified before the IJ on March 2, 2005, seeking relief for\n\n\n1\n   Phal was the lead applicant for relief and the majority of the\nIJ's decision is based on her testimony. Although both Phal and\nNou filed separate asylum applications, the contents of the\napplication were identical. Given that the majority of the IJ's\ndecision was based on Phal's testimony, we will treat the\ncollective claims by focusing on Phal. See Settenda v. Ashcroft,\n377 F.3d 89, 92 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpolitical persecution based on their activism as members of the Sam\n\nRainsy Party (\"SRP\").\n\n            On September 19, 2004, the IJ denied the petitioners'\n\napplications for asylum.     The IJ found that Phal was not credible,\n\nciting to a number of discrepancies between her oral testimony and\n\nwritten application, inconsistencies within her testimony, and\n\ndiscrepancies regarding her documentary evidence.         Given the lack\n\nof credibility, the IJ concluded that Phal had not established\n\neligibility for asylum.     The IJ also concluded that even if she had\n\ntestified credibly, she had failed to demonstrate a well-founded\n\nfear   of   future   persecution   because   she   remained   in   Cambodia\n\ncampaigning for the SRP until April 2000, nearly two years after\n\nher alleged arrest and detention in 1998, without any problems or\n\nincidents.     Moreover, the IJ noted that she was able to leave\n\nCambodia with her own passport in her own name and had no apparent\n\ndifficulties with the Cambodian authorities.        The IJ also rejected\n\nthe petitioners' claims for withholding of removal and found them\n\nineligible for CAT protection because Phal failed to present\n\ncredible evidence that she was tortured in the past or would face\n\ntorture in the future if she were to return to Cambodia.\n\n            The petitioners appealed the IJ's decision.            In a per\n\ncuriam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision that\n\nPhal had failed to present a credible claim of persecution.             The\n\nBIA found that the IJ's conclusions were not erroneous and that the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fvarious discrepancies and inconsistencies identified by the IJ were\n\ncentral to their claims of persecution. The BIA was unpersuaded by\n\nthe contentions that the inconsistences were minor: \"Many of the\n\ninconsistencies cited by the Immigration Judge are significant and\n\n. . . [the] documentation submitted to establish the respondents'\n\npolitical activities does not accurately identify them.\"                   The BIA\n\nalso agreed with the IJ's determination that Phal had failed to\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of future persecution, given the\n\nevidence that she had remained living in Cambodia without incident\n\nfor nearly two years after their alleged arrests.               The BIA, thus,\n\ndismissed the appeal.\n\n                                II.    Discussion\n\n            The petitioners make two claims in their petition for\n\nreview.   First, they argue that the IJ erred in making her adverse\n\ncredibility finding.          Second, they assert that relief should be\n\ngranted because the record demonstrates that Phal sustained past\n\npersecution      and   that   she     has   a   well-founded   fear   of    future\n\npersecution.      The BIA rejected both of these arguments; we agree.\n\n            A.    Adverse Credibility\n\n            In its per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's adverse credibility finding and took the opportunity to\n\ndiscuss some of the grounds identified by the IJ.               We review both\n\nopinions.     See Lin v. Gonzáles, 503 F.3d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(\"Where, as here, 'the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling,\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fbut also discussed some of the other bases for the IJ's opinion, we\n\nreview both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.'\" (quoting Zheng v.\n\nGonzáles, 475 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2007))).\n\n           We    review     credibility       determinations      under     the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard; we overturn the agency's findings\n\nonly if \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude\n\nto the contrary.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); Stroni v. Gonzáles,\n\n454 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir. 2006).           We give \"great deference to an\n\nIJ's [credibility] determinations so long as the IJ provide[d]\n\nspecific reasons for those determinations.\" Dhima v. Gonzáles, 416\n\nF.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005).        Such deference is demanded where:\n\n           (1) the discrepancies and omissions described\n           by the IJ are actually present in the record;\n           (2) those discrepancies and omissions provide\n           specific and cogent reasons to conclude that\n           the petitioners provided incredible testimony\n           regarding facts central to the merits of the\n           asylum claim; and (3) petitioners do not\n           provide a convincing explanation for the\n           discrepancies and omissions.\n\nZeru v. Gonzáles, 503 F.3d 59, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           The BIA and IJ identified several concerns regarding\n\nPhal's testimony, namely: (1) inconsistencies regarding the attacks\n\nagainst   her   in   May   1993,   July    1997,   and   April   1998;    (2)   a\n\ndiscrepancy between her testimony and her written application\n\nregarding the date on which she joined the SRP; and (3) questions\n\nof authenticity surrounding certain letters from party leader Sam\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fRainsy.2    After reviewing those grounds, we conclude that the BIA's\n\naffirmance is sustained under our deferential standard of review.\n\nWe briefly address the inconsistencies and discrepancies discussed\n\nby the IJ and BIA.\n\n            The    IJ   discussed   Phal's         testimony      regarding     three\n\ndifferent alleged attacks against her as a result of her political\n\nopinions, noting inconsistencies within her testimony.                    First, she\n\ntestified that three Hun Sen soldiers hit her in May 1993, but on\n\ncross-examination       stated   that    the       attack   involved      only    two\n\nsoldiers.    Second, with respect to the July 1997 attack during the\n\npost-election demonstration, she first denied being attacked, but\n\nthen said that Hun Sen soldiers had shot at the group, although not\n\nat her directly.        Third, regarding the April 1998 attack, Phal\n\ntestified that two men on a motorcycle fired bullets into her home\n\nand yelled, \"[T]his is a gift for your new year,\" but she had\n\nattested in her affidavit that only one individual had fired at her\n\nhome.\n\n            Phal   asserts   that   the       IJ   makes    too    much    of    minor\n\ninconsistencies and urges us to treat them as honest mistakes. She\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ also makes much of the fact that Phal was unable to\nidentify the names of leaders within the Women's Movement in the\nSRP.   Phal argues that the IJ erred in considering her lack of\nknowledge. The BIA did not rely on the fact that Phal did not know\nthose leaders because she did not testify that she was ever\ninvolved in the Women's Movement. We agree and in reviewing this\npetition, we do not consider it among the various inconsistencies\nidentified by the IJ.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fexplains that the inconsistencies regarding the number of attackers\n\nand whether she herself was attacked when soldiers fired into a\n\ngroup of people are reasonable mistakes that the IJ should not have\n\nweighed so heavily. While these inconsistencies are \"perhaps minor\n\nin   isolation,\"    when   taken     together    with     the   other    concerns\n\ndiscussed by the IJ, they raise questions regarding Phal's claims\n\nof political persecution and \"add to a reasonable inference of lack\n\nof candor.\"    Lumaj v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 194, 199 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Furthermore,        there     are     other,     more     concerning\n\ninconsistencies      between      Phal's      testimony     and    her        asylum\n\napplication.     The IJ and the BIA both noted that in her written\n\napplication, she stated that she had begun working actively with\n\nthe SRP in December 1997 and suffered persecution by the Hun Sen as\n\na result of her activism.         Specifically, Phal wrote that she had\n\nreceived a threatening letter in March 1998 which told her to \"stop\n\nhelping the Sam Rainsy or you will disappear.\"                  Yet, during her\n\nremoval hearing, she testified that she did not join the SRP until\n\nMarch 1998 and made no mention of the threatening letter.                           The\n\ndiscrepancy between the date on which she became active within the\n\nSRP and when she allegedly received threats is central to her claim\n\nof   political     persecution;      Phal's    vague    response    was       not    a\n\npersuasive     explanation     for     the     inconsistency.3           We    have\n\n\n3\n   Phal testified that in March 1998 she changed political parties\nfrom the FUNCIPEC Party to the SRP. Thus, her explanation that Sam\nRainsy was the head of the Khmer National Party in 1997 and the\n\n                                       -7-\n\fspecifically noted that inconsistencies between statements in an\n\nasylum application and testimony during the asylum proceedings\n\nprovide substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.     See Melhem v. Gonzáles, 500 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            The IJ and the BIA also determined that the documentary\n\nevidence produced by Phal raised questions about her candor and\n\ncredibility. One letter, purporting to be from Sam Rainsy and sent\n\nfrom Lowell, Massachusetts, was submitted as evidence that Phal and\n\nher husband were members of the SRP.         The letter, however, had the\n\nincorrect   date   of   birth   for   both   Phal    and   her   husband   and\n\nincorrectly identified Phal as a male.              The letter is the only\n\nevidence provided to corroborate the testimony that Phal was a\n\nmember of the SRP in Cambodia during the time period at issue.\n\nFurthermore, the letter is one of two letters purportedly signed by\n\nSam Rainsy on the same day despite the fact that they originated\n\nfrom two vastly different locations: Lowell, Massachusetts and\n\nPhnom Phen, Cambodia.\n\n            Upon questioning by the IJ about these letters, Phal\n\nprovided confusing and inconsistent answers which the IJ deemed\n\nsuspicious given that the hearing was less than three weeks after\n\nthe issuance of the letters.            The IJ also expressed concern\n\n\nname switched to the SRP in 1998 is insufficient to explain this\ninconsistency within Phal's testimony. At no time did she testify\nthat she had been involved with the Khmer National Party.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fregarding the authenticity of one of the letters because Phal's\n\nname was written in a different style and color than the other\n\nnames on the list.4   Additionally, the donor letter also mentioned\n\nthe name of a woman (Meas Ponnary) who allegedly collected the\n\ndonations and sent them to the SRP.     At the hearing, Phal testified\n\nthat she did not recognize the woman's name.       She then identified\n\n(incorrectly) the woman as the president of the SRP in Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts, but then later testified that the president of the\n\nSRP in Lowell was a man whose name she could not recall.\n\n           The IJ and the BIA concluded that these inconsistencies\n\nwere central to Phal's asylum claim which is predicated on her\n\ninvolvement and membership in the SRP.       Upon review, we conclude\n\nthat those inconsistencies are clearly present in the record, lack\n\npersuasive explanation, and support the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.     While   the   evidence   of   inconsistency   is   not\n\ntremendous, we conclude that the IJ's identified grounds for\n\ndisbelieving Phal's testimony are supported by substantial evidence\n\nand the record does not compel a contrary finding.         Stroni, 454\n\nF.3d at 87.\n\n           B.   Persecution\n\n           An asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that\n\nshe suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership\n\n\n4\n    The letter listed several names as donors to the SRP.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fin a particular social group, or political opinion.       8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A); Journal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2007). In this case, the petitioners allege persecution on account\n\nof political opinion.   To constitute past persecution, the conduct\n\nmust extend beyond \"unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic\n\nsuffering.\" Topalli v. Gonzáles, 417 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting Nelson v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).    A sufficient showing of past\n\npersecution entitles an applicant to a rebuttable presumption of a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.     8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).\n\nAbsent that presumption, a petitioner must demonstrate that her\n\nfear is both genuine and reasonably objective.   Toloza-Jiménez v.\n\nGonzáles, 457 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          The BIA agreed with the IJ's conclusion that regardless\n\nof whether Phal had testified credibly, she failed to establish a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.   We agree.   Both the BIA\n\nand the IJ noted that Phal remained living in Cambodia without\n\nincident for two years after their alleged arrests and attacks in\n\n1998.   Phal testified that during that two-year time span, she\n\ncontinued to work on behalf of the SRP without incident.       The\n\nability to live and remain politically active in the country for\n\ntwo years without incident weakens her alleged fear of future\n\npersecution.   See Ravindran v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d 754, 760 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (finding evidence that petitioner remained in the country for\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fa year following alleged persecution undercut claim of future\n\npersecution); see also López v. Gonzáles, 192 Fed. Appx. 19, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).    Furthermore, Phal and her husband were able to\n\nleave the country in 2000 with government-issued passports, which\n\nis another fact weighing against the reasonableness of her fear.\n\nSee Kheireddine v. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(petitioners' ability to obtain passports in their own names\n\n\"undercuts their claim of persecution\").           Thus, we conclude that\n\nsubstantial   evidence   supports    the   BIA's   conclusion   that   Phal\n\nfailed to demonstrate a reasonable fear of future persecution.\n\n          Unable to satisfy the burden of proof for asylum, Phal\n\nnecessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of\n\nremoval because \"such a grant requires a stronger showing than the\n\nshowing requisite to a grant of asylum.\"           Simo v. Gonzáles, 445\n\nF.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2006).5\n\n                           III.     Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n          Denied.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Phal does not meaningfully address her CAT claim in her brief\nand, therefore, we consider the issue to be waived. See United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"issues adverted\nto in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived\").\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

The IJ found that Phal was not credible,\n\nciting to a number of discrepancies between her oral testimony and\n\nwritten application, inconsistencies within her testimony, and\n\ndiscrepancies regarding her documentary evidence.         Given the lack\n\nof credibility, the IJ concluded that Phal had not established\n\neligibility for asylum.     The IJ also concluded that even if she had\n\ntestified credibly, she had failed to demonstrate a well-founded\n\nfear   of   future   persecution   because   she   remained   in   Cambodia\n\ncampaigning for the SRP until April 2000, nearly two years after\n\nher alleged arrest and detention in 1998, without any problems or\n\nincidents.     Moreover, the IJ noted that she was able to leave\n\nCambodia with her own passport in her own name and had no apparent\n\ndifficulties with the Cambodian authorities.        The IJ also rejected\n\nthe petitioners' claims for withholding of removal and found them\n\nineligible for CAT protection because Phal failed to present\n\ncredible evidence that she was tortured in the past or would face\n\ntorture in the future if she were to return to Cambodia.\n\n            The petitioners appealed the IJ's decision.            In a per\n\ncuriam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision that\n\nPhal had failed to present a credible claim of persecution.             The\n\nBIA found that the IJ's conclusions were not erroneous and that the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fvarious discrepancies and inconsistencies identified by the IJ were\n\ncentral to their claims of persecution. The BIA was unpersuaded by\n\nthe contentions that the inconsistences were minor: \"Many of the\n\ninconsistencies cited by the Immigration Judge are significant and\n\n. . . [the] documentation submitted to establish the respondents'\n\npolitical activities does not accurately identify them.\"                   The BIA\n\nalso agreed with the IJ's determination that Phal had failed to\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of future persecution, given the\n\nevidence that she had remained living in Cambodia without incident\n\nfor nearly two years after their alleged arrests.               The BIA, thus,\n\ndismissed the appeal.\n\n                                II.    Discussion\n\n            The petitioners make two claims in their petition for\n\nreview.   First, they argue that the IJ erred in making her adverse\n\ncredibility finding.          Second, they assert that relief should be\n\ngranted because the record demonstrates that Phal sustained past\n\npersecution      and   that   she     has   a   well-founded   fear   of    future\n\npersecution.      The BIA rejected both of these arguments; we agree.\n\n            A.    Adverse Credibility\n\n            In its per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\nIJ's adverse credibility finding and took the opportunity to\n\ndiscuss some of the grounds identified by the IJ.

First, she\n\ntestified that three Hun Sen soldiers hit her in May 1993, but on\n\ncross-examination       stated   that    the       attack   involved      only    two\n\nsoldiers.    Second, with respect to the July 1997 attack during the\n\npost-election demonstration, she first denied being attacked, but\n\nthen said that Hun Sen soldiers had shot at the group, although not\n\nat her directly.        Third, regarding the April 1998 attack, Phal\n\ntestified that two men on a motorcycle fired bullets into her home\n\nand yelled, \"[T]his is a gift for your new year,\" but she had\n\nattested in her affidavit that only one individual had fired at her\n\nhome.\n\n            Phal   asserts   that   the       IJ   makes    too    much    of    minor\n\ninconsistencies and urges us to treat them as honest mistakes. She\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ also makes much of the fact that Phal was unable to\nidentify the names of leaders within the Women's Movement in the\nSRP.   Phal argues that the IJ erred in considering her lack of\nknowledge. The BIA did not rely on the fact that Phal did not know\nthose leaders because she did not testify that she was ever\ninvolved in the Women's Movement. We agree and in reviewing this\npetition, we do not consider it among the various inconsistencies\nidentified by the IJ.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fexplains that the inconsistencies regarding the number of attackers\n\nand whether she herself was attacked when soldiers fired into a\n\ngroup of people are reasonable mistakes that the IJ should not have\n\nweighed so heavily. While these inconsistencies are \"perhaps minor\n\nin   isolation,\"    when   taken     together    with     the   other    concerns\n\ndiscussed by the IJ, they raise questions regarding Phal's claims\n\nof political persecution and \"add to a reasonable inference of lack\n\nof candor.\"    Lumaj v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202180\"><a href=\"/opinion/202180/lumaj-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Furthermore,        there     are     other,     more     concerning\n\ninconsistencies      between      Phal's      testimony     and    her        asylum\n\napplication.     The IJ and the BIA both noted that in her written\n\napplication, she stated that she had begun working actively with\n\nthe SRP in December 1997 and suffered persecution by the Hun Sen as\n\na result of her activism.         Specifically, Phal wrote that she had\n\nreceived a threatening letter in March 1998 which told her to \"stop\n\nhelping the Sam Rainsy or you will disappear.\"                  Yet, during her\n\nremoval hearing, she testified that she did not join the SRP until\n\nMarch 1998 and made no mention of the threatening letter.                           The\n\ndiscrepancy between the date on which she became active within the\n\nSRP and when she allegedly received threats is central to her claim\n\nof   political     persecution;      Phal's    vague    response    was       not    a\n\npersuasive     explanation     for     the     inconsistency.3           We    have\n\n\n3\n   Phal testified that in March 1998 she changed political parties\nfrom the FUNCIPEC Party to the SRP. Thus, her explanation that Sam\nRainsy was the head of the Khmer National Party in 1997 and the\n\n                                       -7-\n\fspecifically noted that inconsistencies between statements in an\n\nasylum application and testimony during the asylum proceedings\n\nprovide substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.     See Melhem v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202909\"><a href=\"/opinion/202909/melhem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            The IJ and the BIA also determined that the documentary\n\nevidence produced by Phal raised questions about her candor and\n\ncredibility. One letter, purporting to be from Sam Rainsy and sent\n\nfrom Lowell, Massachusetts, was submitted as evidence that Phal and\n\nher husband were members of the SRP.         The letter, however, had the\n\nincorrect   date   of   birth   for   both   Phal    and   her   husband   and\n\nincorrectly identified Phal as a male.              The letter is the only\n\nevidence provided to corroborate the testimony that Phal was a\n\nmember of the SRP in Cambodia during the time period at issue.\n\nFurthermore, the letter is one of two letters purportedly signed by\n\nSam Rainsy on the same day despite the fact that they originated\n\nfrom two vastly different locations: Lowell, Massachusetts and\n\nPhnom Phen, Cambodia.\n\n            Upon questioning by the IJ about these letters, Phal\n\nprovided confusing and inconsistent answers which the IJ deemed\n\nsuspicious given that the hearing was less than three weeks after\n\nthe issuance of the letters.            The IJ also expressed concern\n\n\nname switched to the SRP in 1998 is insufficient to explain this\ninconsistency within Phal's testimony. At no time did she testify\nthat she had been involved with the Khmer National Party.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fregarding the authenticity of one of the letters because Phal's\n\nname was written in a different style and color than the other\n\nnames on the list.4   Additionally, the donor letter also mentioned\n\nthe name of a woman (Meas Ponnary) who allegedly collected the\n\ndonations and sent them to the SRP.     At the hearing, Phal testified\n\nthat she did not recognize the woman's name.       She then identified\n\n(incorrectly) the woman as the president of the SRP in Lowell,\n\nMassachusetts, but then later testified that the president of the\n\nSRP in Lowell was a man whose name she could not recall.\n\n           The IJ and the BIA concluded that these inconsistencies\n\nwere central to Phal's asylum claim which is predicated on her\n\ninvolvement and membership in the SRP.       Upon review, we conclude\n\nthat those inconsistencies are clearly present in the record, lack\n\npersuasive explanation, and support the IJ's adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.     While   the   evidence   of   inconsistency   is   not\n\ntremendous, we conclude that the IJ's identified grounds for\n\ndisbelieving Phal's testimony are supported by substantial evidence\n\nand the record does not compel a contrary finding.

We agree.   Both the BIA\n\nand the IJ noted that Phal remained living in Cambodia without\n\nincident for two years after their alleged arrests and attacks in\n\n1998.   Phal testified that during that two-year time span, she\n\ncontinued to work on behalf of the SRP without incident.       The\n\nability to live and remain politically active in the country for\n\ntwo years without incident weakens her alleged fear of future\n\npersecution.   See Ravindran v.
