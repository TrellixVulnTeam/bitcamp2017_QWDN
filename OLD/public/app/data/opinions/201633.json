Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch, and Howard,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Eduardo Masferrer, with whom Masferrer & Hurowitz, P.C. was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Timothy Q. Feeley, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Theodore B.\nHeinrich, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 9, 2005\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge. Defendant Andrew Kornegay appeals\n\nfrom his conviction and sentence on one count of distributing five\n\nor more grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1) & 841(b)(1)(D).      We affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, see United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 328 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), and provide additional facts in our discussion of the legal\n\nissues. In the spring of 2001, an individual named Richard Chaney,\n\na convicted narcotics user, agreed to cooperate with the Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in identifying narcotics and\n\nfirearms distributors.    In the summer of 2001, Chaney notified an\n\nATF agent that he had been in contact with Kornegay and could\n\npurchase a half-ounce of crack cocaine from him.               Chaney knew\n\nKornegay from their time as cellmates in a Massachusetts jail\n\nduring early 2001.\n\n            The ATF authorized Chaney to make a controlled purchase\n\nof crack cocaine from Kornegay.        On August 20, 2001, Kornegay met\n\nChaney on Geneva Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts, entered Chaney's\n\ncar, and received a $470 payment from him.        Several minutes later,\n\nKornegay returned to the car and gave Chaney over 13 grams of crack\n\ncocaine.      The   purchase   was    monitored   by   audio    and   video\n\nsurveillance equipment and was observed by several law enforcement\n\nofficers.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            Kornegay was not indicted for this sale until April 2003.\n\nThe ATF delayed apprehending Kornegay because the agency wanted to\n\npreserve Chaney as an informant.         Meanwhile, Kornegay served a 14-\n\nmonth state sentence for another drug conviction.                At trial on the\n\nfederal   charge,     Kornegay   defended     on    the   ground      of   mistaken\n\nidentity.       He claimed that his identical twin brother, Andre\n\nKornegay, had sold the drugs to Chaney.\n\n            The government met this defense through the introduction\n\nof   pictures    of   the   Kornegay    brothers    taken   in     2001    and   the\n\nvideotape of the drug deal.       Chaney also identified Kornegay based\n\non their time together in prison.             Additionally, Boston Police\n\nDetective Earl Perkins testified that, in the summer of 2001, he\n\nencountered Andrew and Andre Kornegay on several occasions and that\n\nhe could distinguish them because Andrew had shorter hair and a\n\nfuller face than his brother and had fashioned his left eyebrow in\n\na distinctive \"three-slash\" style.            Perkins also identified the\n\nindividual in the videotape of the drug deal as Andrew Kornegay.\n\n            After a five-day trial, the jury convicted Kornegay on\n\none count of distributing five or more grams of crack cocaine.                   The\n\ncourt calculated Kornegay's sentence range at between 78 and 97\n\nmonths    and   sentenced    Kornegay    to   the   minimum      of   78   months'\n\nimprisonment.     This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f                                        II.\n\n          Kornegay presses five arguments on appeal.                   First, he\n\nclaims that Detective Perkins' identification testimony should have\n\nbeen suppressed because he learned of Kornegay's distinguishing\n\ncharacteristics       through     unconstitutional       investigatory      stops\n\nconducted by the Boston police during the summer of                2001.   Second,\n\nhe contends that the admission of Detective Perkins' identification\n\ntestimony violated Federal Rules of Evidence 701 and 403.                  Third,\n\nhe argues that the prosecutor prejudicially vouched for Detective\n\nPerkins' credibility and appealed to the jury's emotions during the\n\nclosing argument. Fourth, he posits that the district court erred\n\nin denying him certain downward departures under the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.         Finally,     he   asserts     that   he   is    entitled    to\n\nresentencing because the district court erroneously considered the\n\nGuidelines mandatory in determining his sentence.\n\n             A.       Motion to Suppress\n\n             Kornegay contends that the district court should have\n\nsuppressed Detective Perkins' identification testimony as the fruit\n\nof several illegal Terry stops conducted by the Boston police\n\nduring the summer of 2001.            See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)\n\n(permitting       police   to    conduct      investigatory   stops    based   on\n\nreasonable    suspicion     of    criminal      activity).     The    government\n\ncounters that Kornegay's suppression motion was correctly denied\n\nbecause Kornegay failed to establish a connection between the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fallegedly      unconstitutional        conduct        and     Detective       Perkins'\n\ntestimony.\n\n             In   a   voir   dire    before     the   district      court,1    Perkins\n\ntestified that, during the summer of 2001, he learned that Kornegay\n\nwas possibly a drug dealer and that he might be called upon to\n\ndistinguish       Kornegay   from     his     identical      twin    brother     in   a\n\nsubsequent prosecution. Therefore, throughout the summer, Perkins\n\nsought     opportunities     to     encounter    Kornegay      so   that   he    could\n\npositively identify him. Perkins testified that, on six occasions,\n\nhe encountered Kornegay while Kornegay was talking to other police\n\nofficers.2     Each time Perkins saw Kornegay, Kornegay was already\n\ntalking with the police, and therefore Perkins did not know the\n\ncircumstances which led to the encounter.                   In particular, Perkins\n\ntestified that he did not know whether the police had pat-frisked\n\nKornegay and could not remember how many officers were present.\n\nPerkins identified the locations where several of these encounters\n\noccurred.\n\n             Aside    from    Detective       Perkins'       testimony,    the    only\n\nevidence     before    the   district       court     was    Kornegay's    affidavit\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Kornegay did not file the motion to suppress Perkins'\ntestimony until after the trial had begun. The court therefore\nheld a hearing on the motion immediately prior to permitting\nPerkins to testify.\n     2\n         On two occasions, Kornegay was with his twin brother.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsubmitted in conjunction with the suppression motion.         In his\n\naffidavit, Kornegay stated:\n\n            During the summer of 2001, I was stopped on\n            multiple occasions by members of the Boston\n            Police Department . . . . I do not recall the\n            names of the officers who stopped me. As many\n            as 4 to 5 officers would approach me without\n            warning and surround me. They would ask which\n            Kornegay brother I was.     I would identify\n            myself and the officers would then pat-frisk\n            me . . . . I never felt as if I was free to\n            leave the police officers when they approached\n            me.\n\nKornegay did not testify concerning the stops or introduce other\n\nevidence or witnesses in support of his motion.        After Perkins'\n\ntestimony and argument, the district court orally denied the motion.\n\nAppellate review of a suppression motion is bifurcated.            The\n\nultimate conclusion as to suppression as well as the determination\n\nthat a given set of facts meets the legal standard for reasonable\n\nsuspicion are reviewed de novo.    But the trial court's findings of\n\nfacts are reviewed for clear error.      See United States v. Charles,\n\n213 F.3d 10, 17 (1st Cir. 2000).        \"We will uphold a denial of a\n\nmotion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports\n\nit.\"     United States v. Mendes-de Jesus, 85 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            To succeed on a motion to suppress, a defendant must\n\nestablish a nexus between the Fourth Amendment violation and the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fevidence that he seeks to suppress.3 See Alderman v. United States,\n\n394 U.S. 165, 183 (1969); United States v. Finucan, 708 F.2d 838,\n\n844 (1st Cir. 1983); see also United States v. King, 222 F.3d 1280,\n\n1285-86 (10th Cir. 2000); Kandik, 633 F.2d at 1335; 6 W.R. LaFave,\n\nSearch and Seizure, § 11.2(b) at 50 n.75 (4th ed. 2004) (citing\n\ncases).    Kornegay failed to meet this burden.\n\n            In his affidavit, Kornegay claimed that he was unlawfully\n\nstopped by Boston police officers on several occasions in the summer\n\nof 2001.    He did not claim that Detective Perkins was present at\n\nthese stops.    Nor did he claim that Perkins was a participant in an\n\nillegal stop.    If Perkins was merely an uninvolved observer, even\n\nto an illegal stop, Kornegay would have no plausible argument.\n\nPerkins testified that he saw Kornegay at certain locations after\n\nKornegay was already talking to the police, but that he did not know\n\nthe circumstances that led to these encounters.   Even after Perkins\n\nidentified the locations of the encounters, Kornegay failed to\n\nproduce evidence that any of the stops alluded to in his affidavit\n\nwere the ones identified by Perkins.   As the district court stated,\n\nbased on the record before it, it could not conclude that the stops\n\n\"in the affidavit [were] the same stops that Perkins [was] talking\n\n\n     3\n      If the defendant meets this initial burden, the evidence will\nbe suppressed unless the government proves that the evidence would\nhave been inevitably discovered, was discovered through independent\nmeans, or was so attenuated from the illegality as to dissipate the\ntaint of the unlawful conduct. See United States v. Nava-Ramirez,\n210 F.3d 1128, 1131 (10th Cir. 2000); United States v. Kandick, 633\nF.2d 1334, 1335 (9th Cir. 1980).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fabout.\"    In the absence of proof that Perkins' testimony was based\n\non information gleaned from the allegedly unlawful stops, Kornegay\n\nfailed to establish the nexus between the claimed Fourth Amendment\n\nviolation and the evidence he sought to suppress. See Nava-Ramirez,\n\n210 F.3d at       1131-32 (affirming the denial of a motion to suppress\n\nbecause the defendant failed to show a connection between the\n\nallegedly unconstitutional seizure and the evidence he sought to\n\nsuppress).\n\n             B.       Lay Testimony\n\n             Kornegay next contends that the district court erred by\n\nadmitting Detective Perkins' identification testimony as a lay\n\nopinion under Fed. R. Evid. 701.            We review the district court's\n\nruling for a manifest abuse of discretion.           See United States v.\n\nJackman, 48 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            Rule 701 allows for the admission of lay opinion testimony\n\nthat is \"(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and\n\n(b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or\n\nthe determination of a fact in issue.\" Kornegay challenges Perkins'\n\ntestimony under both prongs.       He claims that Perkins' observations\n\nduring the summer of 2001 were so limited in duration that the in-\n\ncourt     identification    was   not   rationally    based   on   Perkins'\n\nperception.       He also contends that the testimony was unnecessary\n\nbecause Perkins' observations were brief and the jury had sufficient\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fother evidence of identity (i.e., photographs and the videotape of\n\nthe crime) to make the identification.\n\n            Based     on   Perkins'   testimony,      it   is   clear   that   the\n\nidentification was based upon Perkins' personal observation and the\n\nrecollection of concrete facts.             Perkins described the encounters\n\nwith Kornegay in detail and provided specific recollections about\n\nKornegay's distinguishing features.            This testimony is adequate to\n\nestablish that the identification was rationally based on Perkins'\n\nperception.\n\n            The next question is whether Perkins' testimony                    was\n\nhelpful to the jury.         Here the extent of Perkins' observation is\n\nrelevant.      As we explained in Jackman, identification testimony is\n\nhelpful   to    the   jury   \"when    the   witness   possesses    sufficiently\n\nrelevant familiarity with the defendant that the jury cannot also\n\npossess, and when the photographs [of the defendant] are not either\n\nso unmistakably clear or so hopelessly obscure that the witness is\n\nno better suited than the jury to make the identification.\" 48 F.3d\n\nat 4-5.\n\n            Perkins' contact with Kornegay on six occasions within a\n\nfew months is within the zone that courts have found acceptable to\n\nshow that the witness was sufficiently familiar with the defendant\n\nto provide a useful identification. See, e.g., Beck, 393 F.3d 1088,\n\n1091 (9th Cir. 2005) (affirming identification testimony of a parole\n\nofficer who met with the defendant four times over two months),\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fvacated on other grounds, --U.S.--, 125 S.Ct. 2000 (2005); United\n\nStates v. Pierce, 136 F.3d 770, 775 (11th Cir. 1998) (affirming\n\nidentification testimony of an officer who met the defendant ten\n\ntimes over seven months); United States v. Wright, 904 F.2d 403,\n\n404-05 (8th Cir. 1990) (affirming identification testimony of a\n\npolice officer who had seen the defendant eight times over two\n\nyears); United States v. Allen, 787 F.2d 933, 935 (4th Cir. 1986)\n\n(affirming identification testimony of a parole officer who briefly\n\nmet the defendant on six or seven occasions), vacated on other\n\ngrounds, 479 U.S. 1077 (1987).   Moreover, Perkins' encounters with\n\nKornegay were for the sole purpose of distinguishing him from his\n\ntwin brother.     Thus, Perkins was no doubt acutely aware of the\n\nsubtle features    of Kornegay's appearance during their several\n\nencounters, and, at two of the encounters, he was able to directly\n\ncompare Kornegay to his twin brother. In light of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding Perkins' encounters with Kornegay, we have little doubt\n\nthat Perkins developed a sufficient familiarity with Kornegay to\n\nprovide a competent identification.\n\n          We also conclude that Perkins' testimony was helpful to\n\nthe jury in making the ultimate identification of the suspect.   The\n\nvisual evidence before the jury was not particularly clear.      The\n\nvideotape of the drug deal was blurry and showed the seller's face\n\nfor only a few seconds.   Thus, it would have been difficult for the\n\njury to attempt to match the photograph of Kornegay with the person\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fin   the   videotape.    See     Jackman,     48   F.3d    at     5    (permitting\n\nidentification testimony because the pictures of the robbery suspect\n\nwere blurred).\n\n            The difficulty in making the identification was compounded\n\nhere because the jury was asked to draw a distinction between\n\nidentical twin brothers.       Perkins was the only government witness\n\nwho could testify that he had seen the brothers together near in\n\ntime to the drug deal.       Given that Kornegay defended by claiming\n\nthat Andre had sold the drugs to Chaney, a witness who could\n\ndistinguish the brothers based on personal observations made in the\n\nsummer of 2001 was, at the very least, helpful.              See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n701(b).     The   district   court's   ruling      that    Perkins'        testimony\n\nsatisfied   the   requirements    of   Rule    701   was    not       an   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            Kornegay also argues that Perkins' testimony should have\n\nbeen excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403 as overly prejudicial.\n\nEssentially, Kornegay contends that Perkins' familiarity with him\n\nderived from a criminal investigation, and therefore the jury likely\n\ndrew a prejudicial inference from the fact that he was under\n\ninvestigation.\n\n            Evidence should be excluded under Rule 403 only where its\n\nprobative value \"is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial\n\neffect, that is, by its tendency to encourage the jury to decide the\n\ncase on improper grounds.\"        See United States v. Adams, 375 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f108, 111     (1st Cir. 2004).           Trial judges enjoy wide latitude in\n\nmaking Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing of\n\nan egregious error.       See id.\n\n           Kornegay argues that Perkins' testimony was of little\n\nprobative value because the photographs of the Kornegay brothers\n\nwere sufficient for the jury to make the identification and there\n\nwere other, less prejudicial forms of evidence that the government\n\ncould   have   introduced    to    bolster       its   case   (e.g.,    fingerprint\n\nevidence).      Whether     the    government       has    alternative      means   of\n\neffectively proving its case without introducing the prejudicial\n\nevidence is pertinent to the Rule 403 analysis.                 See United States\n\nv. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir. 2000).                           But, as\n\ndiscussed, because Kornegay accused his identical twin brother of\n\nthe crime, and because the videotape was of poor quality, the\n\nphotographic    evidence    was        not   sufficiently     clear    to   make    the\n\nidentity testimony unnecessary.                 Moreover, there is no record\n\nsupport for Kornegay's contention that the government had other\n\nidentification    evidence        at    its     disposal   that   it    could      have\n\nintroduced in lieu of Perkins' testimony.\n\n             There was also no prejudice because Perkins did not go\n\nbeyond identification and did not describe Kornegay's criminal\n\nbackground.     Appellate courts have found no substantial prejudice\n\nwhere the trial court has restricted the witness' testimony to limit\n\nreferences to the defendant's criminal background.                       See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fUnited States v. Stormer, 938 F.2d 759, 763-764 (7th Cir. 1991);\n\nAllen, 787 F.2d at 937-38; United States v. Farnsworth, 729 F.2d\n\n1158, 1161 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\n            Here, the district court took the necessary precautions.\n\nThrough the use of leading questions, Perkins testified that he was\n\na police officer but did not specify his duties or responsibilities.\n\nHe told the jury that he encountered the Kornegays as part of the\n\nBoston    Police       Department's   community       policing     program,   which\n\nencourages officers to become familiar with the individuals who live\n\nin their assigned neighborhood beats.             He also told the jury that\n\nthe encounters in the summer of 2001 were not arrests and did not\n\ninvolve allegations of criminal activity.                These precautions were\n\nsufficient        to   limit    the   potential       prejudice    from   Perkins'\n\ntestimony.4\n\n             C.         Closing Argument\n\n             Kornegay challenges certain portions of the government's\n\nclosing   argument       as    improper    vouching    for   the   credibility   of\n\nDetective Perkins. Kornegay cites two statements (which are set out\n\nbelow) in which the government asked the jury to believe Detective\n\nPerkins' identification testimony because he was an experienced\n\n\n\n     4\n      Kornegay also contends that he was prejudiced because he\ncould not vigorously cross-examine Perkins because he feared that\nPerkins would offer prejudicial testimony. But Kornegay has not\nidentified specific questions that he would have asked, and our\nreview of the record indicates that Kornegay did aggressively\ncross-examine Perkins.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fpolice officer who could lose his job or go to jail if he lied on\n\nthe witness stand.5\n\n             We have recognized that statements such as these, which\n\narguably ask the jury to believe the testimony of a police officer\n\nbecause of the esteem in which the public holds law enforcement and\n\nthe risk that a police officer would take by lying in court, are\n\n\"inappropriate.\" United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 142\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).      On appeal, the government essentially concedes\n\nthat the challenged statements run afoul of this admonition.      It\n\nnevertheless contends that the error was harmless.\n\n             In Torres-Galindo, we ruled that similar statements were\n\nharmless because the statements were not a severe infraction, the\n\ncourt instructed the jury that the statements and arguments of\n\ncounsel are not evidence, and the evidence against the defendant was\n\n\n\n\n     5\n         The first statement was:\n\n             The defense want you to believe that\n             Detective Earl Perkins made this up. . .\n             Commit perjury , a detective with 15 years\n             on the Boston Police Department . . . I\n             submit to you that you can tell from\n             examining and watching Earl Perkins that\n             he has better things to do.\n\n     The second statement was:\n\n             What's [Kornegay's] claim at base? He's\n             saying, well Earl Perkins came in here and\n             committed perjury and put his job at risk\n             and risked prison and risked all of these\n             things because -- why?\n\n                                    -14-\n\fsubstantial.    See id. at 142-43.    Each of these factors is present\n\nhere.\n\n          Most importantly, the district court judge provided a\n\ncurative instruction that was far more explicit than the one which\n\nwe found sufficient in Torres-Galindo.        In response to Kornegay's\n\nobjection, the district court told the jury:\n\n          In discussing the testimony of Detective\n          Perkins, [the prosecutor] referred to evidence\n          concerning Mr. Perkins's tenure on the police\n          force in Boston, and he observed that his\n          testimony, if not truthful . . . would put the\n          officer at risk of loss of his job, the risk\n          of committing perjury and going to prison . .\n          . .\n          Now, in his favor, [the prosecutor] pointed\n          out . . . that Detective Perkins' testimony as\n          a police officer stood in the same light as\n          any witness . . . in as far as his credibility\n          is concerned, and I want to emphasize that.\n\n          The argument that [the prosecutor] made about\n          risking loss of job and risking perjury might\n          be understood by you to be an appeal to some\n          notion that the officer is entitled to more\n          credibility because he's a police officer. . .\n          . If you are inclined to believe that, that is\n          wrong; you're to judge all the witnesses the\n          same.\n\n          [Detective] Perkins gets no special credit\n          because he's a police officer. . . . In so far\n          as there's a risk of going to prison for\n          perjury, everyone who testifies in this\n          courtroom faces the same risk.      I want to\n          point this out to you, just in case there is\n          any   [misunderstanding]    that   [Detective]\n          Perkins is somehow elevated in his credibility\n          because he is a police officer.\n\nGiven the strong case presented by the government, the limited\n\nnature   of    the   infraction,    the   court's   detailed   curative\n\n                                   -15-\n\finstruction, and our presumption that juries follow the court's\n\ninstructions, see United States v. De Jesus Mateo, 373 F.3d 70, 73\n\n(1st       Cir.    2004),   we   are   convinced   that   the   government's\n\ninappropriate statements concerning Perkins' testimony were not\n\nprejudicial in these circumstances.6\n\n              D.       Downward Departures\n\n              Kornegay claims that the district court erroneously\n\ndenied him a downward departure on either of two bases.                 Both\n\ndeparture arguments relate to the 14-month state drug conviction\n\nsentence which Kornegay served after the drug deal at issue in\n\nthis case but before he was indicted.\n\n              The first ground for departure was premised on the\n\ngovernment's delay in prosecuting Kornegay in order to protect\n\nChaney from being detected as an informant.           Kornegay argued that\n\nthis delay foreclosed the possibility of his federal sentence\n\nrunning concurrently with his state sentence and that a departure\n\nshould be granted so that he would not be prejudiced. See United\n\nStates v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir. 1997) (holding that\n\n\n\n       6\n      Kornegay also challenges the prosecutors suggestion that, in\nevaluating the likelihood that Perkins lied, the jury should use\ncommon sense and place themselves in the witness' shoes to evaluate\nhis testimony.    We discern no error.      Kornegay has cited no\nauthority for the proposition that a prosecutor cannot ask a jury\nto use common sense in evaluating a witness' possible bias.\nInherent in such a common sense evaluation is that each juror will\nplace him or herself in the witness' position to judge the witness'\nmotivations based on the juror's notion of typical human behavior.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fprosecutorial delay that was \"extreme\" or \"sinister\" could support\n\na departure if the defendant was required to serve a state\n\nsentence   which    could    have   been    concurrent   with    the   federal\n\nsentence had the federal prosecution proceeded sooner).                    The\n\ndistrict court declined to grant the departure but did not provide\n\na clear reason for its decision.\n\n           This court has jurisdiction to review the denial of a\n\nrequest for a downward departure if the court denied the departure\n\nas precluded by law.       See United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).     If, however, the defendant's claim is only that\n\nthe   district     court    unreasonably     declined    to     exercise   its\n\ndiscretion to grant a departure, we may not review it.                 See id.\n\nOn the record before us, it is not clear whether the court\n\ndeclined the Saldana departure as a matter of law or discretion.\n\nIn such circumstances, absent information in the record suggesting\n\notherwise, we assume that the court understood that it could\n\ndepart but decided not to do so as a matter of discretion.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Lujan, 324 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2003); see also\n\nUnited States v. Scott, 387 F.3d 139, 143 (2d Cir. 2004); United\n\nStates v. Williams, 355 F.3d 893, 901 (6th Cir. 2003); United\n\nStates v. Heredia-Cruz, 328 F.3d 1283, 1289-90 (10th Cir. 2003);\n\nUnited States v. Chase, 174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\n           Kornegay asserts that the district court believed that\n\nit did not have the authority to grant the departure based on its\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fstatement that \"if I look at all the relevant material, I cannot\n\nfind that this departure is authorized.\"           But this statement was\n\nclearly related to Kornegay's other departure request (which we\n\ndiscuss infra) and not the Saldana request.          As there is no basis\n\non which to conclude that the district court believed it was\n\nlegally precluded from granting a Saldana departure, we may not\n\nreview its decision to deny the departure.         See Scott, 387 F.3d at\n\n143.\n\n            Kornegay's second ground for departure was premised on\n\nhis    belief   that   the   district   court   should   have   reduced   his\n\nsentence to account for the time that he served for the state drug\n\nconviction because it was conduct related to the present offense.\n\nKornegay premises his argument on § 5G1.3(c) in the 2000 version\n\nof the Sentencing Guidelines.7          The government responds that the\n\n2003 Guidelines apply to this case and, under the relevant section\n\nof those Guidelines, § 5K2.23, Kornegay was legally precluded from\n\nthe departure because the state sentence did not result in an\n\nincreased offense level for the federal conviction.                For this\n\nrequest, the district court ruled that it could not grant the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      Section 5G1.3(c) provides that a defendant's sentence may run\nconcurrently with an undischarged term of imprisonment for conduct\nthat is related to the instant offense. Kornegay contends that\nthis provision should be read broadly to authorize a downward\ndeparture where the defendant has completed a term of imprisonment\nfor conduct related to the instant offense.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fdeparture as a matter of law.       Our review is therefore de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560-61 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           To evaluate Kornegay's claim, we must first determine\n\nwhich version of the Guidelines apply.          The general rule is that\n\nthe version of the Guidelines in force at the time of sentencing\n\napplies -- here, the 2003 Guidelines.     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11.        If,\n\nhowever, applying the most recent Guidelines version creates an ex\n\npost facto problem, the court applies the Guidelines in force at\n\nthe time of the offense -- here, the 2000 Guidelines.          See    id. §\n\n1B1.11(b)(2).   Kornegay has not made an ex post facto argument to\n\njustify his assertion that the 2000 Guidelines apply.                He has\n\ntherefore forfeited any claim for applying the earlier Guidelines\n\nversion.   See In re Gosselin, 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir. 2002); see\n\nalso Prewitt v. United States, 83 F.3d 812, 820-21 (7th Cir. 1996)\n\n(stating that defendant forfeited ex post facto claim for applying\n\nearlier version of the Guidelines by not raising the argument\n\nbefore the district court).\n\n           Under the 2003 Guidelines, § 5K2.23 provides that a\n\ndownward   departure   may   be   appropriate    if   the   defendant   has\n\ncompleted a term of imprisonment and the completed sentence was\n\nfor a crime that was relevant conduct for the instant offense and\n\nwas the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant\n\noffense.   Kornegay meets the first two conditions for eligibility\n\nfor this departure, but the offense level was not increased as a\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fresult of considering the earlier conviction.          The district court\n\ntherefore correctly denied the § 5K2.23 departure request.           See\n\nUnited States v. Ramanauskas, No. 04-04PAM, 2005 WL 189708 at *1\n\n(D. Minn. Jan. 21, 2005) (denying § 5K2.23 departure on this\n\nbasis).\n\n          E.       Booker Issue\n\n          Finally, we address Kornegay's claim that he is entitled\n\nto resentencing because the district court erroneously considered\n\nthe Guidelines as mandatory in assigning his sentence.         See United\n\nStates v. Booker,     525 U.S --, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005) (declaring\n\nthe Guidelines advisory to preserve their constitutionality).\n\nKornegay conceded at oral argument that he did not preserve this\n\nargument for appeal, and therefore we review it under the plain\n\nerror test.    See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76-\n\n77 (1st Cir. 2005).      This test is met only where the defendant can\n\ndemonstrate a plain error that affects substantial rights, and\n\nseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings. See id. at 77.\n\n          Kornegay has met the \"plain error\" portion of the test\n\nby showing that the district court treated the Guidelines as\n\nmandatory.     See id.     To meet the \"affects substantial rights\"\n\nprong of the test, Kornegay must show \"a reasonable probability\"\n\nthat the district court would impose a more favorable sentence\n\nunder the now advisory Guidelines.        Id. at 75.   We are not \"overly\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fdemanding as to proof of [such] probability where, either in the\n\nexisting record or by plausible proffer, there is a reasonable\n\nindication that the district court judge might well have reached\n\na different result under advisory guidelines.\"                 United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Even applying this relaxed standard, Kornegay has not\n\nestablished a reasonable probability that the district court might\n\nhave given   him    a    lesser     sentence    under   advisory     Guidelines.\n\nNothing   about    the       district    court's    comments    at   sentencing\n\nindicates that it thought that Kornegay's sentence was too harsh.\n\nThat the court sentenced Kornegay at the low end of the applicable\n\nGuideline range is not, by itself, sufficient to show a reasonable\n\nprobability of a lesser sentence under the advisory system.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Figuereo, 404 F.3d 537, 541-42 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Cacho-Bonilla, 404 F.3d 84, 95 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Kornegay has suggested that he should be resentenced\n\nbecause, after Booker, there is a broader range of factors that a\n\ncourt may consider in fashioning a reasonable sentence.                Although\n\nthat is true, Kornegay has not proffered to this court any\n\n\"specific facts\" concerning his case that he would present on\n\nremand.   See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 80.            Without identifying\n\nsuch facts, Kornegay has not met his burden of demonstrating that\n\nthe   application       of    the   mandatory      Guidelines    affected   his\n\nsubstantial rights.\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f                              III.\n\n          For the reasons stated, we affirm Andrew Kornegay's\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                              -22-\n\f",

Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 328 (1st Cir. 2003), and provide additional facts in our discussion of the legal issues. In the spring of 2001, an individual named Richard Chaney, a convicted narcotics user, agreed to cooperate with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in identifying narcotics and firearms distributors. In the summer of 2001, Chaney notified an ATF agent that he had been in contact with Kornegay and could purchase a half-ounce of crack cocaine from him. Chaney knew Kornegay from their time as cellmates in a Massachusetts jail during early 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ATF authorized Chaney to make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Kornegay. On August 20, 2001, Kornegay met Chaney on Geneva Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts, entered Chaney's car, and received a $470 payment from him. Several minutes later, Kornegay returned to the car and gave Chaney over 13 grams of crack cocaine. The purchase was monitored by audio and video surveillance equipment and was observed by several law enforcement officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay was not indicted for this sale until April 2003. The ATF delayed apprehending Kornegay because the agency wanted to preserve Chaney as an informant. Meanwhile, Kornegay served a 14-month state sentence for another drug conviction. At trial on the federal charge, Kornegay defended on the ground of mistaken identity. He claimed that his identical twin brother, Andre Kornegay, had sold the drugs to Chaney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government met this defense through the introduction of pictures of the Kornegay brothers taken in 2001 and the videotape of the drug deal. Chaney also identified Kornegay based on their time together in prison. Additionally, Boston Police Detective Earl Perkins testified that, in the summer of 2001, he encountered Andrew and Andre Kornegay on several occasions and that he could distinguish them because Andrew had shorter hair and a fuller face than his brother and had fashioned his left eyebrow in a distinctive \"three-slash\" style. Perkins also identified the individual in the videotape of the drug deal as Andrew Kornegay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a five-day trial, the jury convicted Kornegay on one count of distributing five or more grams of crack cocaine. The court calculated Kornegay's sentence range at between 78 and 97 months and sentenced Kornegay to the minimum of 78 months' imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay presses five arguments on appeal. First, he claims that Detective Perkins' identification testimony should have been suppressed because he learned of Kornegay's distinguishing characteristics through unconstitutional investigatory stops conducted by the Boston police during the summer of 2001. Second, he contends that the admission of Detective Perkins' identification testimony violated Federal Rules of Evidence 701 and 403. Third, he argues that the prosecutor prejudicially vouched for Detective Perkins' credibility and appealed to the jury's emotions during the closing argument. Fourth, he posits that the district court erred in denying him certain downward departures under the Sentencing Guidelines. Finally, he asserts that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court erroneously considered the Guidelines mandatory in determining his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay contends that the district court should have suppressed Detective Perkins' identification testimony as the fruit of several illegal <i>Terry</i> stops conducted by the Boston police during the summer of 2001. <i>See Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (permitting police to conduct investigatory stops based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity). The government counters that Kornegay's suppression motion was correctly denied because Kornegay failed to establish a connection between the allegedly unconstitutional conduct and Detective Perkins' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a voir dire before the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Perkins testified that, during the summer of 2001, he learned that Kornegay was possibly a drug dealer and that he might be called upon to distinguish Kornegay from his identical twin brother in a subsequent prosecution. Therefore, throughout the summer, Perkins sought opportunities to encounter Kornegay so that he could positively identify him. Perkins testified that, on six occasions, he encountered Kornegay while Kornegay was talking to other police officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Each time Perkins saw Kornegay, Kornegay was already talking with the police, and therefore Perkins did not know the circumstances which led to the encounter. In particular, Perkins testified that he did not know whether the police had pat-frisked Kornegay and could not remember how many officers were present. Perkins identified the locations where several of these encounters occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Detective Perkins' testimony, the only evidence before the district court was Kornegay's affidavit submitted in conjunction with the suppression motion. In his affidavit, Kornegay stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 2001, I was stopped on multiple occasions by members of the Boston Police Department.... I do not recall the names of the officers who stopped me. As many as 4 to 5 officers would approach me without warning and surround me. They would ask which Kornegay brother I was. I would identify myself and the officers would then pat-frisk me.... I never felt as if I was free to leave the police officers when they approached me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay did not testify concerning the stops or introduce other evidence or witnesses in support of his motion. After Perkins' testimony and argument, the district court orally denied the motion. Appellate review of a suppression motion is bifurcated. The ultimate conclusion as to suppression as well as the determination that a given set of facts meets the legal standard for reasonable suspicion are reviewed <i>de novo.</i> But the trial court's findings of facts are reviewed for clear error. <i>See United States v. Charles,</i> 213 F.3d 10, 17 (1st Cir.2000). \"We will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.\" <i>United States v. Mendez-de Jesus,</i> 85 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed on a motion to suppress, a defendant must establish a nexus between the Fourth Amendment violation and the evidence that he seeks to suppress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Alderman v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 165, 183, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969); <i>United States v. Finucan,</i> 708 F.2d 838, 844 (1st Cir.1983); <i>see also United States v. King,</i> 222 F.3d 1280, 1285-86 (10th Cir.2000); <i>Kandik,</i> 633 F.2d at 1335; 6 W.R. LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure,</i> &#167; 11.2(b) at 50 n. 75 (4th ed.2004) (citing cases). Kornegay failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his affidavit, Kornegay claimed that he was unlawfully stopped by Boston police officers on several occasions in the summer of 2001. He did not claim that Detective Perkins was present at these stops. Nor did he claim that Perkins was a participant in an illegal stop. If Perkins was merely an uninvolved observer, even to an illegal stop, Kornegay would have no plausible argument. Perkins testified that he saw Kornegay at certain locations after Kornegay was already talking to the police, but that he did not know the circumstances that led to these encounters. Even after Perkins identified the locations of the encounters, Kornegay failed to produce evidence that any of the stops alluded to in his affidavit were the ones identified by Perkins. As the district court stated, based on the record before it, it could not conclude that the stops \"in the affidavit [were] the same stops that Perkins [was] talking about.\" In the absence of proof that Perkins' testimony was based on information gleaned from the allegedly unlawful stops, Kornegay failed to establish the nexus between the claimed Fourth Amendment violation and the evidence he sought to suppress. <i>See Nava-Ramirez,</i> 210 F.3d at 1131-32 (affirming the denial of a motion to suppress because the defendant failed to show a connection between the allegedly unconstitutional seizure and the evidence he sought to suppress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Lay Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay next contends that the district court erred by admitting Detective Perkins' identification testimony as a lay opinion under Fed.R.Evid. 701. We review the district court's ruling for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Jackman,</i> 48 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 701 allows for the admission of lay opinion testimony that is \"(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\" Kornegay challenges Perkins' testimony under both prongs. He claims that Perkins' observations during the summer of 2001 were so limited in duration that the in-court identification was not rationally based on Perkins' perception. He also contends that the testimony was unnecessary because Perkins' observations were brief and the jury had sufficient other evidence of identity (<i>i.e.,</i> photographs and the videotape of the crime) to make the identification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Perkins' testimony, it is clear that the identification was based upon Perkins' personal observation and the recollection of concrete facts. Perkins described the encounters with Kornegay in detail and provided specific recollections about Kornegay's distinguishing features. This testimony is adequate to establish that the identification was rationally based on Perkins' perception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether Perkins' testimony was helpful to the jury. Here the extent of Perkins' observation is relevant. As we explained in <i>Jackman,</i> identification testimony is helpful to the jury \"when the witness possesses sufficiently relevant familiarity with the defendant that the jury cannot also possess, and when the photographs [of the defendant] are not either so unmistakably clear or so hopelessly obscure that the witness is no better suited than the jury to make the identification.\" 48 F.3d at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perkins' contact with Kornegay on six occasions within a few months is within the zone that courts have found acceptable to show that the witness was sufficiently familiar with the defendant to provide a useful identification. <i>See, e.g., Beck,</i> 393 F.3d 1088, 1091 (9th Cir.2005) (affirming identification testimony of a parole officer who met with the defendant four times over two months), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 2000, 161 L.Ed.2d 853 (2005); <i>United States v. Pierce,</i> 136 F.3d 770, 775 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming identification testimony of an officer who met the defendant ten times over seven months); <i>United States v. Wright,</i> 904 F.2d 403, 404-05 (8th Cir. 1990) (affirming identification testimony of a police officer who had seen the defendant eight times over two years); <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 787 F.2d 933, 935 (4th Cir.1986) (affirming identification testimony of a parole officer who briefly met the defendant on six or seven occasions), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 479 U.S. 1077, 107 S.Ct. 1271, 94 L.Ed.2d 132 (1987). Moreover, Perkins' encounters with Kornegay were for the sole purpose of distinguishing him from his twin brother. Thus, Perkins was no doubt acutely aware of the subtle features of Kornegay's appearance during their several encounters, and, at two of the encounters, he was able to directly compare Kornegay to his twin brother. In light of the circumstances surrounding Perkins' encounters with Kornegay, we have little doubt that Perkins developed a sufficient familiarity with Kornegay to provide a competent identification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that Perkins' testimony was helpful to the jury in making the ultimate identification of the suspect. The visual evidence before the jury was not particularly clear. The videotape of the drug deal was blurry and showed the seller's face for only a few seconds. Thus, it would have been difficult for the jury to attempt to match the photograph of Kornegay with the person in the videotape. <i>See Jackman,</i> 48 F.3d at 5 (permitting identification testimony because the pictures of the robbery suspect were blurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty in making the identification was compounded here because the jury was asked to draw a distinction between identical twin brothers. Perkins was the only government witness who could testify that he had seen the brothers together near in time to the drug deal. Given that Kornegay defended by claiming that Andre had sold the drugs to Chaney, a witness who could distinguish the brothers based on personal observations made in the summer of 2001 was, at the very least, helpful. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 701(b). The district court's ruling that Perkins' testimony satisfied the requirements of Rule 701 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay also argues that Perkins' testimony should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 as overly prejudicial. Essentially, Kornegay contends that Perkins' familiarity with him derived from a criminal investigation, and therefore the jury likely drew a prejudicial inference from the fact that he was under investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence should be excluded under Rule 403 only where its probative value \"is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, that is, by its tendency to encourage the jury to decide the case on improper grounds.\" <i>See United States v. Adams,</i> 375 F.3d 108, 111 (1st Cir.2004). Trial judges enjoy wide latitude in making Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing of an egregious error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay argues that Perkins' testimony was of little probative value because the photographs of the Kornegay brothers were sufficient for the jury to make the identification and there were other, less prejudicial forms of evidence that the government could have introduced to bolster its case (<i>e.g.,</i> fingerprint evidence). Whether the government has alternative means of effectively proving its case without introducing the prejudicial evidence is pertinent to the Rule 403 analysis. <i>See United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir.2000). But, as discussed, because Kornegay accused his identical twin brother of the crime, and because the videotape was of poor quality, the photographic evidence was not sufficiently clear to make the identity testimony unnecessary. Moreover, there is no record support for Kornegay's contention that the government had other identification evidence at its disposal that it could have introduced in lieu of Perkins' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also no prejudice because Perkins did not go beyond identification and did not describe Kornegay's criminal background. Appellate courts have found no substantial prejudice where the trial court has restricted the witness' testimony to limit references to the defendant's criminal background. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Stormer,</i> 938 F.2d 759, 763-764 (7th Cir.1991); <i>Allen,</i> 787 F.2d at 937-38; <i>United States v. Farnsworth,</i> 729 F.2d 1158, 1161 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court took the necessary precautions. Through the use of leading questions, Perkins testified that he was a police officer but did not specify his duties or responsibilities. He told the jury that he encountered the Kornegays as part of the Boston Police Department's community policing program, which encourages officers to become familiar with the individuals who live in their assigned neighborhood beats. He also told the jury that the encounters in the summer of 2001 were not arrests and did not involve allegations of criminal activity. These precautions were sufficient to limit the potential prejudice from Perkins' testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay challenges certain portions of the government's closing argument as improper vouching for the credibility of Detective Perkins. Kornegay cites two statements (which are set out below) in which the government asked the jury to believe Detective Perkins' identification testimony because he was an experienced police officer who could lose his job or go to jail if he lied on the witness stand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that statements such as these, which arguably ask the jury to believe the testimony of a police officer because of the esteem in which the public holds law enforcement and the risk that a police officer would take by lying in court, are \"inappropriate.\" <i>United States v. Torres-Galindo,</i> 206 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2000). On appeal, the government essentially concedes that the challenged statements run afoul of this admonition. It nevertheless contends that the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Torres-Galindo,</i> we ruled that similar statements were harmless because the statements were not a severe infraction, the court instructed the jury that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, and the evidence against the defendant was substantial. <i>See id.</i> at 142-43. Each of these factors is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the district court judge provided a curative instruction that was far more explicit than the one which we found sufficient in <i>Torres-Galindo.</i> In response to Kornegay's objection, the district court told the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the testimony of Detective Perkins, [the prosecutor] referred to evidence concerning Mr. Perkins's tenure on the police force in Boston, and he observed that his testimony, if not truthful ... would put the officer at risk of loss of his job, the risk of committing perjury and going to prison....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, in his favor, [the prosecutor] pointed out ... that Detective Perkins' testimony as a police officer stood in the same light as any witness ... in as far as his credibility is concerned, and I want to emphasize that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that [the prosecutor] made about risking loss of job and risking perjury might be understood by you to be an appeal to some notion that the officer is entitled to more credibility because he's a police officer.... If you are inclined to believe that, that is wrong; you're to judge all the witnesses the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Detective] Perkins gets no special credit because he's a police officer.... In so far as there's a risk of going to prison for perjury, everyone who testifies in this courtroom faces the same risk. I want to point this out to you, just in case there is any [misunderstanding] that [Detective] Perkins is somehow elevated in his credibility because he is a police officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the strong case presented by the government, the limited nature of the infraction, the court's detailed curative instruction, and our presumption that juries follow the court's instructions, <i>see United States v. De Jesus Mateo,</i> 373 F.3d 70, 73 (1st Cir.2004), we are convinced that the government's inappropriate statements concerning Perkins' testimony were not prejudicial in these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Downward Departures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay claims that the district court erroneously denied him a downward departure on either of two bases. Both departure arguments relate to the 14-month state drug conviction sentence which Kornegay served after the drug deal at issue in this case but before he was indicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first ground for departure was premised on the government's delay in prosecuting Kornegay in order to protect Chaney from being detected as an informant. Kornegay argued that this delay foreclosed the possibility of his federal sentence running concurrently with his state sentence and that a departure should be granted so that he would not be prejudiced. <i>See United States v. Saldana,</i> 109 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that prosecutorial delay that was \"extreme\" or \"sinister\" could support a departure if the defendant was required to serve a state sentence which could have been concurrent with the federal sentence had the federal prosecution proceeded sooner). The district court declined to grant the departure but did not provide a clear reason for its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has jurisdiction to review the denial of a request for a downward departure if the court denied the departure as precluded by law. <i>See United States v. Romolo,</i> 937 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1991). If, however, the defendant's claim is only that the district court unreasonably declined to exercise its discretion to grant a departure, we may not review it. <i>See id.</i> On the record before us, it is not clear whether the court declined the <i>Saldana</i> departure as a matter of law or discretion. In such circumstances, absent information in the record suggesting otherwise, we assume that the court understood that it could depart but decided not to do so as a matter of discretion. <i>See United States v. Lujan,</i> 324 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v. Scott,</i> 387 F.3d 139, 143 (2d Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 355 F.3d 893, 901 (6th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Heredia-Cruz,</i> 328 F.3d 1283, 1289-90 (10th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Chase,</i> 174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay asserts that the district court believed that it did not have the authority to grant the departure based on its statement that \"if I look at all the relevant material, I cannot find that this departure is authorized.\" But this statement was clearly related to Kornegay's other departure request (which we discuss <i>infra</i>) and not the <i>Saldana</i> request. As there is no basis on which to conclude that the district court believed it was legally precluded from granting a <i>Saldana</i> departure, we may not review its decision to deny the departure. <i>See Scott,</i> 387 F.3d at 143.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay's second ground for departure was premised on his belief that the district court should have reduced his sentence to account for the time that he served for the state drug conviction because it was conduct related to the present offense. Kornegay premises his argument on &#167; 5G1.3(c) in the 2000 version of the Sentencing Guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The government responds that the 2003 Guidelines apply to this case and, under the relevant section of those Guidelines, &#167; 5K2.23, Kornegay was legally precluded from the departure because the state sentence did not result in an increased offense level for the federal conviction. For this request, the district court ruled that it could not grant the departure as a matter of law. Our review is therefore <i>de novo. United States v. Grandmaison,</i> 77 F.3d 555, 560-61 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To evaluate Kornegay's claim, we must first determine which version of the Guidelines apply. The general rule is that the version of the Guidelines in force at the time of sentencing applies&#8212;here, the 2003 Guidelines. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.11. If, however, applying the most recent Guidelines version creates an <i>ex post facto</i> problem, the court applies the Guidelines in force at the time of the offense&#8212;here, the 2000 Guidelines. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1B1.11(b)(2). Kornegay has not made an <i>ex post facto</i> argument to justify his assertion that the 2000 Guidelines apply. He has therefore forfeited any claim for applying the earlier Guidelines version. <i>See In re Gosselin,</i> 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also Prewitt v. United States,</i> 83 F.3d 812, 820-21 (7th Cir.1996) (stating that defendant forfeited <i>ex post facto</i> claim for applying earlier version of the Guidelines by not raising the argument before the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the 2003 Guidelines, &#167; 5K2.23 provides that a downward departure may be appropriate if the defendant has completed a term of imprisonment and the completed sentence was for a crime that was relevant conduct for the instant offense <i>and was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense.</i> Kornegay meets the first two conditions for eligibility for this departure, but the offense level was not increased as a result of considering the earlier conviction. The district court therefore correctly denied the &#167; 5K2.23 departure request. <i>See United States v. Ramanauskas,</i> No. 04-04PAM, 2005 WL 189708 at *1 (D.Minn. Jan.21, 2005) (denying &#167; 5K2.23 departure on this basis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Booker Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address Kornegay's claim that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court erroneously considered the Guidelines as mandatory in assigning his sentence. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 525 U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (declaring the Guidelines advisory to preserve their constitutionality). Kornegay conceded at oral argument that he did not preserve this argument for appeal, and therefore we review it under the plain error test. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005). This test is met only where the defendant can demonstrate a plain error that affects substantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See id.</i> at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay has met the \"plain error\" portion of the test by showing that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory. <i>See id.</i> To meet the \"affects substantial rights\" prong of the test, Kornegay must show \"a reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence under the now advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75. We are not \"overly demanding as to proof of [such] probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is a reasonable indication that the district court judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even applying this relaxed standard, Kornegay has not established a reasonable probability that the district court might have given him a lesser sentence under advisory Guidelines. Nothing about the district court's comments at sentencing indicates that it thought that Kornegay's sentence was too harsh. That the court sentenced Kornegay at the low end of the applicable Guideline range is not, by itself, sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a lesser sentence under the advisory system. <i>See United States v. Figuereo,</i> 404 F.3d 537, 541-42 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cacho-Bonilla,</i> 404 F.3d 84, 95 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay has suggested that he should be resentenced because, after <i>Booker,</i> there is a broader range of factors that a court may consider in fashioning a reasonable sentence. Although that is true, Kornegay has not proffered to this court any \"specific facts\" concerning his case that he would present on remand. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 80. Without identifying such facts, Kornegay has not met his burden of demonstrating that the application of the mandatory Guidelines affected his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we <i>affirm</i> Andrew Kornegay's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Kornegay did not file the motion to suppress Perkins' testimony until after the trial had begun.

In the spring of 2001, an individual named Richard Chaney, a convicted narcotics user, agreed to cooperate with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) in identifying narcotics and firearms distributors. In the summer of 2001, Chaney notified an ATF agent that he had been in contact with Kornegay and could purchase a half-ounce of crack cocaine from him. Chaney knew Kornegay from their time as cellmates in a Massachusetts jail during early 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ATF authorized Chaney to make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from Kornegay. On August 20, 2001, Kornegay met Chaney on Geneva Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts, entered Chaney's car, and received a $470 payment from him. Several minutes later, Kornegay returned to the car and gave Chaney over 13 grams of crack cocaine. The purchase was monitored by audio and video surveillance equipment and was observed by several law enforcement officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay was not indicted for this sale until April 2003. The ATF delayed apprehending Kornegay because the agency wanted to preserve Chaney as an informant. Meanwhile, Kornegay served a 14-month state sentence for another drug conviction. At trial on the federal charge, Kornegay defended on the ground of mistaken identity. He claimed that his identical twin brother, Andre Kornegay, had sold the drugs to Chaney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government met this defense through the introduction of pictures of the Kornegay brothers taken in 2001 and the videotape of the drug deal. Chaney also identified Kornegay based on their time together in prison. Additionally, Boston Police Detective Earl Perkins testified that, in the summer of 2001, he encountered Andrew and Andre Kornegay on several occasions and that he could distinguish them because Andrew had shorter hair and a fuller face than his brother and had fashioned his left eyebrow in a distinctive \"three-slash\" style. Perkins also identified the individual in the videotape of the drug deal as Andrew Kornegay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a five-day trial, the jury convicted Kornegay on one count of distributing five or more grams of crack cocaine. The court calculated Kornegay's sentence range at between 78 and 97 months and sentenced Kornegay to the minimum of 78 months' imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay presses five arguments on appeal. First, he claims that Detective Perkins' identification testimony should have been suppressed because he learned of Kornegay's distinguishing characteristics through unconstitutional investigatory stops conducted by the Boston police during the summer of 2001. Second, he contends that the admission of Detective Perkins' identification testimony violated Federal Rules of Evidence 701 and 403. Third, he argues that the prosecutor prejudicially vouched for Detective Perkins' credibility and appealed to the jury's emotions during the closing argument. Fourth, he posits that the district court erred in denying him certain downward departures under the Sentencing Guidelines. Finally, he asserts that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court erroneously considered the Guidelines mandatory in determining his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay contends that the district court should have suppressed Detective Perkins' identification testimony as the fruit of several illegal <i>Terry</i> stops conducted by the Boston police during the summer of 2001. <i>See Terry v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government counters that Kornegay's suppression motion was correctly denied because Kornegay failed to establish a connection between the allegedly unconstitutional conduct and Detective Perkins' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a voir dire before the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Perkins testified that, during the summer of 2001, he learned that Kornegay was possibly a drug dealer and that he might be called upon to distinguish Kornegay from his identical twin brother in a subsequent prosecution. Therefore, throughout the summer, Perkins sought opportunities to encounter Kornegay so that he could positively identify him. Perkins testified that, on six occasions, he encountered Kornegay while Kornegay was talking to other police officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Each time Perkins saw Kornegay, Kornegay was already talking with the police, and therefore Perkins did not know the circumstances which led to the encounter. In particular, Perkins testified that he did not know whether the police had pat-frisked Kornegay and could not remember how many officers were present. Perkins identified the locations where several of these encounters occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Detective Perkins' testimony, the only evidence before the district court was Kornegay's affidavit submitted in conjunction with the suppression motion. In his affidavit, Kornegay stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 2001, I was stopped on multiple occasions by members of the Boston Police Department.... I do not recall the names of the officers who stopped me. As many as 4 to 5 officers would approach me without warning and surround me. They would ask which Kornegay brother I was. I would identify myself and the officers would then pat-frisk me.... I never felt as if I was free to leave the police officers when they approached me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay did not testify concerning the stops or introduce other evidence or witnesses in support of his motion. After Perkins' testimony and argument, the district court orally denied the motion. Appellate review of a suppression motion is bifurcated. The ultimate conclusion as to suppression as well as the determination that a given set of facts meets the legal standard for reasonable suspicion are reviewed <i>de novo.</i> But the trial court's findings of facts are reviewed for clear error. <i>See United States v.

LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure,</i> &#167; 11.2(b) at 50 n. 75 (4th ed.2004) (citing cases). Kornegay failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his affidavit, Kornegay claimed that he was unlawfully stopped by Boston police officers on several occasions in the summer of 2001. He did not claim that Detective Perkins was present at these stops. Nor did he claim that Perkins was a participant in an illegal stop. If Perkins was merely an uninvolved observer, even to an illegal stop, Kornegay would have no plausible argument. Perkins testified that he saw Kornegay at certain locations after Kornegay was already talking to the police, but that he did not know the circumstances that led to these encounters. Even after Perkins identified the locations of the encounters, Kornegay failed to produce evidence that any of the stops alluded to in his affidavit were the ones identified by Perkins. As the district court stated, based on the record before it, it could not conclude that the stops \"in the affidavit [were] the same stops that Perkins [was] talking about.\" In the absence of proof that Perkins' testimony was based on information gleaned from the allegedly unlawful stops, Kornegay failed to establish the nexus between the claimed Fourth Amendment violation and the evidence he sought to suppress. <i>See Nava-Ramirez,</i> 210 F.3d at 1131-32 (affirming the denial of a motion to suppress because the defendant failed to show a connection between the allegedly unconstitutional seizure and the evidence he sought to suppress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Lay Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay next contends that the district court erred by admitting Detective Perkins' identification testimony as a lay opinion under Fed.R.Evid. 701. We review the district court's ruling for a manifest abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Jackman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195901\"><a href=\"/opinion/195901/united-states-v-jackman/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 701 allows for the admission of lay opinion testimony that is \"(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\" Kornegay challenges Perkins' testimony under both prongs. He claims that Perkins' observations during the summer of 2001 were so limited in duration that the in-court identification was not rationally based on Perkins' perception. He also contends that the testimony was unnecessary because Perkins' observations were brief and the jury had sufficient other evidence of identity (<i>i.e.,</i> photographs and the videotape of the crime) to make the identification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Perkins' testimony, it is clear that the identification was based upon Perkins' personal observation and the recollection of concrete facts. Perkins described the encounters with Kornegay in detail and provided specific recollections about Kornegay's distinguishing features. This testimony is adequate to establish that the identification was rationally based on Perkins' perception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next question is whether Perkins' testimony was helpful to the jury. Here the extent of Perkins' observation is relevant. As we explained in <i>Jackman,</i> identification testimony is helpful to the jury \"when the witness possesses sufficiently relevant familiarity with the defendant that the jury cannot also possess, and when the photographs [of the defendant] are not either so unmistakably clear or so hopelessly obscure that the witness is no better suited than the jury to make the identification.\" 48 F.3d at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perkins' contact with Kornegay on six occasions within a few months is within the zone that courts have found acceptable to show that the witness was sufficiently familiar with the defendant to provide a useful identification. <i>See, e.g., Beck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788805\"><a href=\"/opinion/788805/united-states-v-michael-emmett-beck/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1088</span></a></span>, 1091 (9th Cir.2005) (affirming identification testimony of a parole officer who met with the defendant four times over two months), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></span> (1987). Moreover, Perkins' encounters with Kornegay were for the sole purpose of distinguishing him from his twin brother. Thus, Perkins was no doubt acutely aware of the subtle features of Kornegay's appearance during their several encounters, and, at two of the encounters, he was able to directly compare Kornegay to his twin brother. In light of the circumstances surrounding Perkins' encounters with Kornegay, we have little doubt that Perkins developed a sufficient familiarity with Kornegay to provide a competent identification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that Perkins' testimony was helpful to the jury in making the ultimate identification of the suspect. The visual evidence before the jury was not particularly clear. The videotape of the drug deal was blurry and showed the seller's face for only a few seconds. Thus, it would have been difficult for the jury to attempt to match the photograph of Kornegay with the person in the videotape. <i>See Jackman,</i> 48 F.3d at 5 (permitting identification testimony because the pictures of the robbery suspect were blurred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty in making the identification was compounded here because the jury was asked to draw a distinction between identical twin brothers. Perkins was the only government witness who could testify that he had seen the brothers together near in time to the drug deal. Given that Kornegay defended by claiming that Andre had sold the drugs to Chaney, a witness who could distinguish the brothers based on personal observations made in the summer of 2001 was, at the very least, helpful. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 701(b). The district court's ruling that Perkins' testimony satisfied the requirements of Rule 701 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay also argues that Perkins' testimony should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 as overly prejudicial. Essentially, Kornegay contends that Perkins' familiarity with him derived from a criminal investigation, and therefore the jury likely drew a prejudicial inference from the fact that he was under investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence should be excluded under Rule 403 only where its probative value \"is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, that is, by its tendency to encourage the jury to decide the case on improper grounds.\" <i>See United States v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201128\"><a href=\"/opinion/201128/united-states-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.2004). Trial judges enjoy wide latitude in making Rule 403 rulings and are only overturned after a showing of an egregious error. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay argues that Perkins' testimony was of little probative value because the photographs of the Kornegay brothers were sufficient for the jury to make the identification and there were other, less prejudicial forms of evidence that the government could have introduced to bolster its case (<i>e.g.,</i> fingerprint evidence). Whether the government has alternative means of effectively proving its case without introducing the prejudicial evidence is pertinent to the Rule 403 analysis. <i>See United States v. Varoudakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199172\"><a href=\"/opinion/199172/united-states-v-varoudakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2000). But, as discussed, because Kornegay accused his identical twin brother of the crime, and because the videotape was of poor quality, the photographic evidence was not sufficiently clear to make the identity testimony unnecessary. Moreover, there is no record support for Kornegay's contention that the government had other identification evidence at its disposal that it could have introduced in lieu of Perkins' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also no prejudice because Perkins did not go beyond identification and did not describe Kornegay's criminal background. Appellate courts have found no substantial prejudice where the trial court has restricted the witness' testimony to limit references to the defendant's criminal background. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Stormer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564844\"><a href=\"/opinion/564844/united-states-v-brett-stormer/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span>, 763-764 (7th Cir.1991); <i>Allen,</i> 787 F.2d at 937-38; <i>United States v.

Through the use of leading questions, Perkins testified that he was a police officer but did not specify his duties or responsibilities. He told the jury that he encountered the Kornegays as part of the Boston Police Department's community policing program, which encourages officers to become familiar with the individuals who live in their assigned neighborhood beats. He also told the jury that the encounters in the summer of 2001 were not arrests and did not involve allegations of criminal activity. These precautions were sufficient to limit the potential prejudice from Perkins' testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay challenges certain portions of the government's closing argument as improper vouching for the credibility of Detective Perkins. Kornegay cites two statements (which are set out below) in which the government asked the jury to believe Detective Perkins' identification testimony because he was an experienced police officer who could lose his job or go to jail if he lied on the witness stand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have recognized that statements such as these, which arguably ask the jury to believe the testimony of a police officer because of the esteem in which the public holds law enforcement and the risk that a police officer would take by lying in court, are \"inappropriate.\" <i>United States v. Torres-Galindo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767957\"><a href=\"/opinion/767957/united-states-v-ricardo-torres-galindo-aka-ricky-silva-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir. 2000). On appeal, the government essentially concedes that the challenged statements run afoul of this admonition. It nevertheless contends that the error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Torres-Galindo,</i> we ruled that similar statements were harmless because the statements were not a severe infraction, the court instructed the jury that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, and the evidence against the defendant was substantial. <i>See id.</i> at 142-43. Each of these factors is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the district court judge provided a curative instruction that was far more explicit than the one which we found sufficient in <i>Torres-Galindo.</i> In response to Kornegay's objection, the district court told the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discussing the testimony of Detective Perkins, [the prosecutor] referred to evidence concerning Mr. Perkins's tenure on the police force in Boston, and he observed that his testimony, if not truthful ... would put the officer at risk of loss of his job, the risk of committing perjury and going to prison....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, in his favor, [the prosecutor] pointed out ... that Detective Perkins' testimony as a police officer stood in the same light as any witness ... in as far as his credibility is concerned, and I want to emphasize that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that [the prosecutor] made about risking loss of job and risking perjury might be understood by you to be an appeal to some notion that the officer is entitled to more credibility because he's a police officer.... If you are inclined to believe that, that is wrong; you're to judge all the witnesses the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Detective] Perkins gets no special credit because he's a police officer.... In so far as there's a risk of going to prison for perjury, everyone who testifies in this courtroom faces the same risk. I want to point this out to you, just in case there is any [misunderstanding] that [Detective] Perkins is somehow elevated in his credibility because he is a police officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the strong case presented by the government, the limited nature of the infraction, the court's detailed curative instruction, and our presumption that juries follow the court's instructions, <i>see United States v. De Jesus Mateo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201077\"><a href=\"/opinion/201077/united-states-v-de-jesus-mateo/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2004), we are convinced that the government's inappropriate statements concerning Perkins' testimony were not prejudicial in these circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Downward Departures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay claims that the district court erroneously denied him a downward departure on either of two bases. Both departure arguments relate to the 14-month state drug conviction sentence which Kornegay served after the drug deal at issue in this case but before he was indicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first ground for departure was premised on the government's delay in prosecuting Kornegay in order to protect Chaney from being detected as an informant. Kornegay argued that this delay foreclosed the possibility of his federal sentence running concurrently with his state sentence and that a departure should be granted so that he would not be prejudiced. <i>See United States v. Saldana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197274\"><a href=\"/opinion/197274/united-states-v-saldana/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that prosecutorial delay that was \"extreme\" or \"sinister\" could support a departure if the defendant was required to serve a state sentence which could have been concurrent with the federal sentence had the federal prosecution proceeded sooner). The district court declined to grant the departure but did not provide a clear reason for its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has jurisdiction to review the denial of a request for a downward departure if the court denied the departure as precluded by law. <i>See United States v. Romolo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563790\"><a href=\"/opinion/563790/united-states-v-christopher-j-romolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1991). If, however, the defendant's claim is only that the district court unreasonably declined to exercise its discretion to grant a departure, we may not review it. <i>See id.</i> On the record before us, it is not clear whether the court declined the <i>Saldana</i> departure as a matter of law or discretion. In such circumstances, absent information in the record suggesting otherwise, we assume that the court understood that it could depart but decided not to do so as a matter of discretion. <i>See United States v. Lujan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200430\"><a href=\"/opinion/200430/united-states-v-lujan/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v.

As there is no basis on which to conclude that the district court believed it was legally precluded from granting a <i>Saldana</i> departure, we may not review its decision to deny the departure. <i>See Scott,</i> 387 F.3d at 143.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay's second ground for departure was premised on his belief that the district court should have reduced his sentence to account for the time that he served for the state drug conviction because it was conduct related to the present offense. Kornegay premises his argument on &#167; 5G1.3(c) in the 2000 version of the Sentencing Guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The government responds that the 2003 Guidelines apply to this case and, under the relevant section of those Guidelines, &#167; 5K2.23, Kornegay was legally precluded from the departure because the state sentence did not result in an increased offense level for the federal conviction. For this request, the district court ruled that it could not grant the departure as a matter of law. Our review is therefore <i>de novo. United States v. Grandmaison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196611\"><a href=\"/opinion/196611/united-states-v-grandmaison/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560-61 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To evaluate Kornegay's claim, we must first determine which version of the Guidelines apply. The general rule is that the version of the Guidelines in force at the time of sentencing applies&#8212;here, the 2003 Guidelines. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.11. If, however, applying the most recent Guidelines version creates an <i>ex post facto</i> problem, the court applies the Guidelines in force at the time of the offense&#8212;here, the 2000 Guidelines. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1B1.11(b)(2). Kornegay has not made an <i>ex post facto</i> argument to justify his assertion that the 2000 Guidelines apply. He has therefore forfeited any claim for applying the earlier Guidelines version. <i>See In re Gosselin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199766\"><a href=\"/opinion/199766/gosselin-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also Prewitt v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718224\"><a href=\"/opinion/718224/jack-r-prewitt-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 820-21 (7th Cir.1996) (stating that defendant forfeited <i>ex post facto</i> claim for applying earlier version of the Guidelines by not raising the argument before the district court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the 2003 Guidelines, &#167; 5K2.23 provides that a downward departure may be appropriate if the defendant has completed a term of imprisonment and the completed sentence was for a crime that was relevant conduct for the instant offense <i>and was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense.</i> Kornegay meets the first two conditions for eligibility for this departure, but the offense level was not increased as a result of considering the earlier conviction. The district court therefore correctly denied the &#167; 5K2.23 departure request. <i>See United States v. Ramanauskas,</i> No. 04-04PAM, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">189708</span></span> at *1 (D.Minn.

Booker Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address Kornegay's claim that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court erroneously considered the Guidelines as mandatory in assigning his sentence. <i>See United States v. Booker,</i> 525 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005) (declaring the Guidelines advisory to preserve their constitutionality). Kornegay conceded at oral argument that he did not preserve this argument for appeal, and therefore we review it under the plain error test. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005). This test is met only where the defendant can demonstrate a plain error that affects substantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See id.</i> at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kornegay has met the \"plain error\" portion of the test by showing that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory. <i>See id.</i> To meet the \"affects substantial rights\" prong of the test, Kornegay must show \"a reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a more favorable sentence under the now advisory Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> at 75. We are not \"overly demanding as to proof of [such] probability where, either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is a reasonable indication that the district court judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even applying this relaxed standard, Kornegay has not established a reasonable probability that the district court might have given him a lesser sentence under advisory Guidelines. Nothing about the district court's comments at sentencing indicates that it thought that Kornegay's sentence was too harsh. That the court sentenced Kornegay at the low end of the applicable Guideline range is not, by itself, sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a lesser sentence under the advisory system. <i>See United States v. Figuereo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201542\"><a href=\"/opinion/201542/united-states-v-figuereo/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 541-42 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v.

Although that is true, Kornegay has not proffered to this court any \"specific facts\" concerning his case that he would present on remand. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 80. Without identifying such facts, Kornegay has not met his burden of demonstrating that the application of the mandatory Guidelines affected his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we <i>affirm</i> Andrew Kornegay's conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Kornegay did not file the motion to suppress Perkins' testimony until after the trial had begun.

We discern no error. Kornegay has cited no authority for the proposition that a prosecutor cannot ask a jury to use common sense in evaluating a witness' possible bias. Inherent in such a common sense evaluation is that each juror will place him or herself in the witness' position to judge the witness' motivations based on the juror's notion of typical human behavior</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Section 5G1.3(c) provides that a defendant's sentence may run concurrently with an undischarged term of imprisonment for conduct that is related to the instant offense.
