Plaintiff-appellant George Lopes\n\nappeals from an adverse summary judgment ruling holding that\n\ndefendant-appellee Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\")\n\ndid not violate the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974\n\n(\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461, in terminating his long-term\n\ndisability benefits.           We affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n          Lopes began working at Fischbach Corporation in 1969. He\n\neventually    became      a    Signal   Project      engineer,   supervising    the\n\ninstallation of signal and electrical equipment. While employed at\n\nFischbach, Lopes was enrolled as a participant in the MetLife-\n\nsponsored Fischbach Group Insurance Plan (\"the Plan\").                  The Plan\n\nprovides for long-term disability benefits for the first twenty-\n\nfour months of disability if a physical impairment prevents the\n\nemployee from working in his regular occupation.                  To qualify for\n\nbenefits after that period, the plan participant must either be\n\n\"completely and continuously unable to perform the duties of any\n\ngainful work or service for which [he is] reasonably qualified\n\ntaking into consideration [his] training, education, and experience\n\nand past earnings,\" or have suffered a 50% (or more) loss of\n\nearnings capacity.\n\n             In   early       1996,   Lopes    was   diagnosed   with   stage    IV\n\npulmonary sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammation of the lungs.                Lopes\n\nstopped working at Fischbach on February 20, 1996, and shortly\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthereafter filed for long-term disability benefits under the Plan.\n\nOn   May   28,    1996,   Lopes    underwent      a   right   lung    transplant.\n\nSubsequently, Lopes' attending physician, Dr. Lynda Cristiano,\n\nfiled a statement with MetLife characterizing Lopes' impairment as\n\n\"Class 5\"     (on    a   scale   from   1   to   5)   and   totally    disabling.1\n\nNonetheless, Dr. Cristiano also opined that Lopes was a \"suitable\n\ncandidate for future rehabilitation.\"             MetLife began paying Lopes\n\nbenefits on August 18, 1996.\n\n            During the next two years, Lopes received disability\n\npayments from the Plan and followed a rehabilitation program.                 But\n\nLopes' health was precarious: he underwent several bronchoscopies,\n\nlung tissue biopsies, and was twice hospitalized for possible\n\npneumonia or infection.          Lopes also suffered from \"post right lung\n\ntransplant,\" sarcoidosis, hypertension, hypercholesterol, diabetes\n\nmellitus,        right    bronchial      stenosis,      and    renal     failure.\n\nConsequently, he required ongoing medical supervision and several\n\nmedications.\n\n            Between 1997 and 1999, Drs. Edward P. Ingenito and Aaron\n\nDeykin (who were then treating Lopes) submitted to MetLife two\n\nphysician's       statements      in    which    they   characterized      Lopes'\n\nimpairment as \"Class 5\" and totally disabling.                 During this same\n\nperiod, they also completed several physical capacities evaluations\n\n\n\n      1\n      A person with a Class 5 impairment has \"a [s]evere limitation of\nphysical capacity\" and is \"incapable of minimum ([]sedentary) activity.\"\n\n                                        -3-\n\fin   which      they    indicated    that    Lopes'    physical   abilities    were\n\nlimited.         Over     time,     however,      these   evaluations    did   note\n\nimprovement in his ability to lift and carry objects and to perform\n\nother everyday physical activities such as grasping, bending, and\n\nreaching above shoulder level.\n\n             Under the Plan, MetLife reevaluated Lopes' eligibility\n\nfor continued benefits after twenty-four months.                  At that point,\n\nMetLife's definition of disability became more spartan:\n\n     However, after the first 24 months of benefit payments,\n     you must also be completely and continuously unable to\n     perform the duties of any gainful work or service for\n     which   you  are   reasonably  qualified   taking  into\n     consideration your training, education, and experience\n     and past earnings.\n\nIn short, Lopes would only continue receiving benefits if his\n\nillness prevented him from performing any job that matched his\n\nskill set.\n\n             On October 3, 2000, Dr. Ingenito submitted the final\n\nphysician's statement MetLife received before terminating Lopes'\n\nbenefits.        For the first time, Dr. Ingenito characterized his\n\nphysical impairment as \"Class 4,\" which signifies a \"moderate\n\nlimitation of functional capacity,\" and implies a capability to\n\nengage     in     \"clerical/administrative            ([]sedentary)     activity.\"2\n\n\n      2\n      The Dictionary of Occupational Titles contains the following\ndefinition of sedentary work:\n\n             S-Sedentary Work--Exerting up to 10 pounds of\n             force occasionally (Occasionally: activity or\n             condition exists up to 1/3 of the time) and/or a\n\n                                            -4-\n\fNevertheless, despite describing the impairment as \"Class 4,\" Dr.\n\nIngenito   opined   that   Lopes   remained   \"totally   disabled\"   from\n\nperforming his former occupation and any other work, and that he\n\nlacked prospects for significant improvement.\n\n           On February 7, 2001, MetLife wrote Lopes and advised him\n\nthat it had terminated his disability benefits on January 31, 2001.\n\nThe letter explained that Lopes was no longer totally disabled\n\nunder the Plan based on Lopes' most recent medical information, a\n\nvocational assessment, and all of the medical evidence contained in\n\nLopes' file.    MetLife relied heavily on Dr. Ingenito's report in\n\nexplaining its decision:\n\n   You can lift and carry up to twenty pounds frequently, you\n   can bend and reach above shoulder level frequently, you can\n   squat, crawl, climb, occasionally, operate a motor vehicle,\n   and use both your hands to perform repetitive fine finger\n   movements, eye/hand movements and pushing and pulling.\n   [Dr. Ingenito] states that in regards to physical\n   impairment you have moderate limitation of functional\n   capacity, you are capable of clerical/administrative work,\n   sedentary activity.\n\n\n\n\n           negligible amount of force frequently (Frequently:\n           activity or condition exists from 1/3 to 2/3 of\n           the time) to lift, carry, push, pull or otherwise\n           move objects, including the human body. Sedentary\n           work involves sitting most of the time, but may\n           involve walking or standing for brief periods of\n           time. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing\n           are required only occasionally and all other\n           sedentary criteria are met.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fCiting a \"transferable skills analysis\" completed by a vocational\n\nskills consultant, the letter identified several occupations for\n\nwhich Lopes qualified.3\n\n              Although    not   mentioned     in    the    letter,    MetLife     also\n\nconsidered an analysis of Lopes' vocational prospects conducted by\n\nDr. R. Kevin Smith, a board-certified Doctor of Osteopathy in\n\nPreventative     and     Occupational      Medicine.        Dr.     Smith   did   not\n\npersonally examine Lopes, but rather based his evaluation on the\n\ninformation in MetLife's file, including the physicians' reports\n\nand   the    vocational    assessment.         Smith      concluded    that   Lopes'\n\nphysical condition had stabilized and that Lopes was capable of\n\nperforming a full-time sedentary job.\n\n              Lopes   appealed    MetLife's        decision    to    terminate     his\n\nbenefits by letter dated August 10, 2001.                  Lopes attached to his\n\nletter a list of eleven medications and supplements that he was\n\ntaking      regularly,    and   promised      to   submit     additional      medical\n\ninformation. On October 3, 2001, MetLife denied Lopes' appeal. In\n\nits denial, MetLife reiterated its rationale for terminating Lopes'\n\nbenefits, placing particular emphasis on Lopes' apparent ability to\n\n\n\n      3\n      The analysis considered whether there were any jobs within a 60-\nmile radius of Lopes' residence that he could perform given his physical\nimpairment and qualifications (i.e., his completion of high school, a\ncertificate from Coyne Electrical School, and experience with electrical\npower generators while in the United States Army Reserve). Based on\nLopes' skills, the occupations identified included, but were not limited\nto, \"Controls Designer,\" \"Logistics Engineer,\" \"Specification Writer,\"\nand \"Dispatcher.\"\n\n                                        -6-\n\fengage     in   sedentary    activity.        MetLife    also    noted   that,\n\nnotwithstanding Lopes' promise to submit additional materials,\n\n\"there were no current medical records in file.\"\n\n             Subsequently,    Lopes    sued    MetLife    in    Massachusetts\n\nsuperior court, claiming that MetLife's decision to terminate his\n\nbenefits violated state statutory and common law.              On February 22,\n\n2000, MetLife removed this matter to the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of ERISA\n\npreemption. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58,\n\n66-67(1987).       Lopes    then   amended    his   complaint    to   allege   a\n\nviolation of ERISA § 1132(a)(1)(b).4           In due course, the parties\n\ncross-moved for summary judgment.\n\n             Because the Plan vests discretionary authority in MetLife\n\nto determine eligibility for benefits or to construe its terms,5\n\n\n     4\n         Section 502 states, in pertinent part:\n\n             (a) A civil action may be brought-\n             (1) by a participant or beneficiary-\n             ...\n             (B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his\n             plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,\n             or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the\n             terms of the plan;\n             ...\n     5\n         The relevant provision of the Plan states:\n\n                 In carrying out their respective responsibilities\n            under the Plan, the Plan administrator and other Plan\n            fiduciaries shall have discretionary authority to\n            interpret the terms of the Plan and to determine\n            eligibility for and entitlement to Plan benefits in\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthe district       court     first     determined     that     it    would    not    upset\n\nMetLife's termination of Lopes' benefits unless it found the\n\ntermination to be arbitrary and capricious.                    See Firestone Tire &\n\nRubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 111 (1989)(directing courts to\n\naccord deference to benefit determinations made under plans that\n\nvest     discretionary            decision-making           authority        in     their\n\nadministrators). In so ruling, the court rejected Lopes' arguments\n\nin favor of de novo review, that MetLife (1) acted under a conflict\n\nof interest as both the insurer and plan administrator, and (2)\n\nacted with improper motivation in terminating his benefits.                           See\n\nPari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415,\n\n419-20 (1st Cir. 2000)(rejecting an argument in favor of a less\n\ndeferential       standard       of   review    in   similar    circumstances,        but\n\nemphasizing       that    dual    role   evidence      or    evidence    of       improper\n\nmotivation would factor into the functionally equivalent inquiries\n\ninto    whether    the    administrator's        decision      was    \"arbitrary       and\n\ncapricious,\" an \"abuse of discretion,\" or \"unreasonable\").                             The\n\ncourt then determined that, based on the evidence that was before\n\nit,    MetLife    acted    reasonably      in    terminating        Lopes'    benefits.\n\n\n\n\n           accordance with the terms of the Plan.\n                Any interpretation or determination made pursuant\n           to such discretionary authority shall be given full\n           force and effect, unless it can be shown that the\n           interpretation or determination was arbitrary and\n           capricious.\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fAccordingly, the court granted MetLife's cross-motion for summary\n\njudgment and denied Lopes' cross-motion.            This appeal followed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            On appeal, Lopes renews his arguments in favor of de novo\n\nreview and urges us to consider evidence outside the administrative\n\nrecord.   Alternatively, Lopes contends that MetLife's decision was\n\nerroneous even under a more deferential standard of review.                  We\n\nreject    Lopes'   arguments    for    de    novo   review   without    further\n\nelaboration    because   they    are        precluded   by   settled    circuit\n\nprecedent. See Pari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 419-20; see also supra at\n\n7   (summarizing      Pari-Fasano's           explanation     how      benefits\n\ndeterminations are to be reviewed in circumstances such as this).6\n\nWe also reject Lopes' argument in favor of supplementing the\n\nadministrative record with additional medical evidence.                Finally,\n\nwe reject Lopes' attack on the merits of MetLife's decision. While\n\nthe evidence before MetLife did not compel a conclusion that Lopes\n\ncould return to work, it was of such a nature as to render the\n\nconclusion a permissible exercise of MetLife's discretion.\n\n            Before addressing the merits of MetLife's decision, we\n\nfirst address Lopes' argument that, given MetLife's potential bias,\n\n\n\n     6\n      In so ruling, we further note that Lopes' \"improper motivation\"\nevidence -- a MetLife document observing that the termination of Lopes'\nbenefits would save $174,000 -- is not particularly convincing.\nObviously, the termination \"saved\" MetLife the money it had allocated\nto paying Lopes' benefits after January 31, 2001, and we see nothing\nuntoward in a MetLife employee documenting that fact.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwe should consider evidence not before the plan administrator at\n\nthe time of the challenged decision:            an affidavit from another\n\nphysician and a medical note written several weeks after MetLife's\n\nfinal determination.      In    reviewing an ERISA determination for\n\narbitrariness, we and the overwhelming majority of other circuits\n\nhave held that there is a strong presumption that the required\n\ndeferential review of a plan administrator's benefits decision\n\nshould be limited to the evidentiary record presented to the\n\nadministrator.     See Liston v. UNUM Corp. Officer Severance Plan,\n\nNo. 02-1956, -- F.3d --, sl. op. at 7-8 (1st Cir., May 27, 2003)(in\n\nreviewing a denial of severance benefits, stating that \"at least\n\nsome very good reason is needed to overcome the strong presumption\n\nthat the record on review is limited to the record before the\n\nadministrator.\").        Review      of   the   administrative   record     for\n\nreasonableness logically implies review of the record available to\n\nthe   plan   administrator;    it    is   anomalous   to   suggest   that    an\n\nadministrator acted unreasonably \"by ignoring information never\n\npresented to it.\" See id.           We thus affirm the district court's\n\ndecision not to include evidence outside of the claim file.\n\n             Mindful that our review for reasonableness is just that\n\n-- \"a review and not a rubber stamp,\" Donato v. Metropolitan Life\n\nIns. Co., 19 F.3d 375, 380 (7th Cir. 1994); see also Terry v. Bayer\n\nCorp., 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir. 1998) -- we turn to the merits.\n\nWe begin with the evidence that is at the center of this dispute:\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe   attending     physician's       reports.        In    all   but    the   final\n\nsubmission, Lopes' doctors opined that \"he was incapable of minimum\n\n([]sedentary) activity,\" and that he was totally disabled from\n\nworking.     In the final report, however, while still opining that\n\nLopes     could   not   work,   Dr.    Ingenito   gave       Lopes   a   \"Class   4\"\n\nimpairment classification, which implies that Lopes was capable of\n\nsedentary activity.       Moreover, at the time Dr. Ingenito submitted\n\nthe report, he also completed a physical capacities evaluation in\n\nwhich he noted that Lopes could \"frequently\" lift and carry up to\n\n20 pounds; \"occasionally\" lift and carry up to 50 pounds; and\n\nperform    simple   repetitive    motions      such    as    grasping,     pushing,\n\npulling, and fine manipulation.               An endoscopy and examination\n\ncompleted at that same time indicated that Lopes did not suffer\n\nfrom fever or chest pain, and that Lopes' tolerance for exercise\n\nhad improved since the previous year.7                     All of this evidence\n\nsupports Dr. Smith's independent conclusion that Lopes was capable\n\nof sedentary work.8\n\n\n      7\n      Lopes had submitted a form describing his \"Activities of Daily\nLiving\" in which he claimed that he drove for short periods, took daily\nwalks, and played golf with a cart.\n      8\n      Lopes challenges MetLife's reliance on the opinion of an osteopath\nrather than a medical doctor qualified to treat Lopes' maladies. Lopes\npoints out that, in Massachusetts, an osteopath may not prescribe or\nadminister drugs for internal use or perform operations. Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 112, § 11. Lopes' emphasis on whether an osteopath can treat him\ndoes not address whether a plan administrator can rely on an osteopath's\nreview of the record when it determines whether a plan participant is\nable to perform an occupation.        Surely, it may so long as the\nosteopath's expertise is germane to the area of inquiry. Here, Dr.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           To be sure, the record contains evidence that Lopes still\n\nsuffers from serious health issues. Since his operation, Lopes has\n\nbeen hospitalized twice.     Lopes' spouse receives almost all of his\n\nworker's compensation benefits based on the stark discrepancy\n\nbetween their life expectancies.          Lopes has also been receiving\n\nSocial Security disability benefits since 1996.9             Moreover, Lopes\n\nencounters a number of daily challenges in performing routine\n\nchores, has a suppressed immune system,10 and has trouble sleeping\n\nthrough the night.    But the issue in this appeal is \"not which side\n\nwe believe is right, but whether the insurer has substantial\n\nevidentiary grounds for a reasonable decision in its favor.\"\n\nBrigham   v.   Sun   Life   of   Can.,    317   F.3d   72,    85   (1st   Cir.\n\n2003)(quoting Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Insur. Co., 144 F.3d 181,\n\n\nSmith was board certified in occupational medicine and thus competent\nto assess Lopes' ability to work.\n      At oral argument, Lopes also suggested (for the first time) that\nthis court must give special weight to his treating physician's opinion\nor that of a physician qualified to treat Lopes.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopes began working at Fischbach Corporation in 1969. He eventually became a Signal Project engineer, supervising the installation of signal and electrical equipment. While employed at Fischbach, Lopes was enrolled as a participant in the MetLife-sponsored Fischbach Group Insurance Plan (\"the Plan\"). The Plan provides for long-term disability benefits for the first twenty-four months of disability if a physical impairment prevents the employee from working in his regular occupation. To qualify for benefits after that period, the plan participant must either be \"completely and continuously unable to perform the duties of any gainful work or service for which [he is] reasonably qualified taking into consideration [his] training, education, and experience and past earnings,\" or have suffered a 50% (or more) loss of earnings capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1996, Lopes was diagnosed with stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammation of the lungs. Lopes stopped working at Fischbach on February 20, 1996, and shortly thereafter filed for long-term disability benefits under the Plan. On May 28, 1996, Lopes underwent a right lung transplant. Subsequently, Lopes' attending physician, Dr. Lynda Cristiano, filed a statement with MetLife characterizing Lopes' impairment as \"Class 5\" (on a scale from 1 to 5) and totally disabling.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Nonetheless, Dr. Cristiano also opined that Lopes was a \"suitable candidate for future rehabilitation.\" MetLife began paying Lopes benefits on August 18, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next two years, Lopes received disability payments from the Plan and followed a rehabilitation program. But Lopes' health was precarious: he underwent several bronchoscopies, lung tissue biopsies, and was twice hospitalized for possible pneumonia or infection. Lopes also suffered from \"post right lung transplant,\" sarcoidosis, hypertension, hypercholesterol, diabetes mellitus, right bronchial stenosis, and renal failure. Consequently, he required ongoing medical supervision and several medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1997 and 1999, Drs. Edward P. Ingenito and Aaron Deykin (who were then treating Lopes) submitted to MetLife two physician's statements in which they characterized Lopes' impairment as \"Class 5\" and totally disabling. During this same period, they also completed several physical capacities evaluations in which they indicated that Lopes' physical abilities were limited. Over time, however, these evaluations did note improvement in his ability to lift and carry objects and to perform other everyday physical activities such as grasping, bending, and reaching above shoulder level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Plan, MetLife reevaluated Lopes' eligibility for continued benefits after twenty-four months. At that point, MetLife's definition of disability became more spartan:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, after the first 24 months of benefit payments, you must also be completely and continuously unable to perform the duties of any gainful work or service for which you are reasonably qualified taking into consideration your training, education, and experience and past earnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Lopes would only continue receiving benefits if his illness prevented him from performing any job that matched his skill set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 3, 2000, Dr. Ingenito submitted the final physician's statement MetLife received before terminating Lopes' benefits. For the first time, Dr. Ingenito characterized his physical impairment as \"Class 4,\" which signifies a \"moderate limitation of functional capacity,\" and implies a capability to engage in \"clerical/administrative ([]sedentary) activity.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nevertheless, despite describing the impairment as \"Class 4,\" Dr. Ingenito opined that Lopes remained \"totally disabled\" from performing his former occupation and any other work, and that he lacked prospects for significant improvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 2001, MetLife wrote Lopes and advised him that it had terminated his disability benefits on January 31, 2001. The letter explained that Lopes was no longer totally disabled under the Plan based on Lopes' most recent medical information, a vocational assessment, and all of the medical evidence contained in Lopes' file. MetLife relied heavily on Dr. Ingenito's report in explaining its decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You can lift and carry up to twenty pounds frequently, you can bend and reach above shoulder level frequently, you can squat, crawl, climb, occasionally, operate a motor vehicle, and use both your hands to perform repetitive fine finger movements, eye/hand movements and pushing and pulling. [Dr. Ingenito] states that in regards to physical impairment you have moderate limitation of functional capacity, you are capable of clerical/administrative work, sedentary activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing a \"transferable skills analysis\" completed by a vocational skills consultant, the letter identified several occupations for which Lopes qualified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not mentioned in the letter, MetLife also considered an analysis of Lopes' vocational prospects conducted by Dr. R. Kevin Smith, a board-certified Doctor of Osteopathy in Preventative and Occupational Medicine. Dr. Smith did not personally examine Lopes, but rather based his evaluation on the information in MetLife's file, including the physicians' reports and the vocational assessment. Smith concluded that Lopes' physical condition had stabilized and that Lopes was capable of performing a full-time sedentary job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopes appealed MetLife's decision to terminate his benefits by letter dated August 10, 2001. Lopes attached to his letter a list of eleven medications and supplements that he was taking regularly, and promised to submit additional medical information. On October 3, 2001, MetLife denied Lopes' appeal. In its denial, MetLife reiterated its rationale for terminating Lopes' benefits, placing particular emphasis on Lopes' apparent ability to engage in sedentary activity. MetLife also noted that, notwithstanding Lopes' promise to submit additional materials, \"there were no current medical records in file.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Lopes sued MetLife in Massachusetts superior court, claiming that MetLife's decision to terminate his benefits violated state statutory and common law. On February 22, 2000, MetLife removed this matter to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of ERISA preemption. <i>See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor,</i> 481 U.S. 58, 66-67, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55(1987). Lopes then amended his complaint to allege a violation of ERISA &#167; 1132(a)(1)(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Plan vests discretionary authority in MetLife to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe its terms,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the district court first determined that it would not upset MetLife's termination of Lopes' benefits unless it found the termination to be arbitrary and capricious. <i>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,</i> 489 U.S. 101, 111, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)(directing courts to accord deference to benefit determinations made under plans that vest discretionary decision-making authority in their administrators). In so ruling, the court rejected Lopes' arguments in favor of de novo review, that MetLife (1) acted under a conflict of interest as both the insurer and plan administrator, and (2) acted with improper motivation in terminating his benefits. <i>See Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 415, 419-20 (1st Cir.2000)(rejecting an argument in favor of a less deferential standard of review in similar circumstances, but emphasizing that dual role evidence or evidence of improper motivation would factor into the functionally equivalent inquiries into whether the administrator's decision was \"arbitrary and capricious,\" an \"abuse of discretion,\" or \"unreasonable\"). The court then determined that, based on the evidence that was before it, MetLife acted reasonably in terminating Lopes' benefits. Accordingly, the court granted MetLife's cross-motion for summary judgment and denied Lopes' cross-motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopes renews his arguments in favor of de novo review and urges us to consider evidence outside the administrative record. Alternatively, Lopes contends that MetLife's decision was erroneous even under a more deferential standard of review. We reject Lopes' arguments for de novo review without further elaboration because they are precluded by settled circuit precedent. <i>See Pari-Fasano,</i> 230 F.3d at 419-20; <i>see also supra</i> at 4 (summarizing <i>Pari-Fasano's</i> explanation how benefits determinations are to be reviewed in circumstances such as this).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We also reject Lopes' argument in favor of supplementing the administrative record with additional medical evidence. Finally, we reject Lopes' attack on the merits of MetLife's decision. While the evidence before MetLife did not compel a conclusion that Lopes could return to work, it was of such a nature as to render the conclusion a permissible exercise of MetLife's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits of MetLife's decision, we first address Lopes' argument that, given MetLife's potential bias, we should consider evidence not before the plan administrator at the time of the challenged decision: an affidavit from another physician and a medical note written several weeks after MetLife's final determination. In reviewing an ERISA determination for arbitrariness, we and the overwhelming majority of other circuits have held that there is a strong presumption that the required deferential review of a plan administrator's benefits decision should be limited to the evidentiary record presented to the administrator. <i>See Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> 330 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2003)(in reviewing a denial of severance benefits, stating that \"at least some very good reason is needed to overcome the strong presumption that the record on review is limited to the record before the administrator.\"). Review of the administrative record for reasonableness logically implies review of the record available to the plan administrator; it is anomalous to suggest that an administrator acted unreasonably \"by ignoring information never presented to it.\" <i>See id.</i> We thus affirm the district court's decision not to include evidence outside of the claim file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful that our review for reasonableness is just that &#8212; \"a review and not a rubber stamp,\" <i>Donato v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,</i> 19 F.3d 375, 380 (7th Cir. 1994); <i>see also Terry v. Bayer Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 28, 40 (1st Cir.1998) &#8212; we turn to the merits. We begin with the evidence that is at the center of this dispute: the attending physician's reports. In all but the final submission, Lopes' doctors opined that \"he was incapable of minimum ([]sedentary) activity,\" and that he was totally disabled from working. In the final report, however, while still opining that Lopes could not work, Dr. Ingenito gave Lopes a \"Class 4\" impairment classification, which implies that Lopes was capable of sedentary activity. Moreover, at the time Dr. Ingenito submitted the report, he also completed a physical capacities evaluation in which he noted that Lopes could \"frequently\" lift and carry up to 20 pounds; \"occasionally\" lift and carry up to 50 pounds; and perform simple repetitive motions such as grasping, pushing, pulling, and fine manipulation. An endoscopy and examination completed at that same time indicated that Lopes did not suffer from fever or chest pain, and that Lopes' tolerance for exercise had improved since the previous year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> All of this evidence supports Dr. Smith's independent conclusion that Lopes was capable of sedentary work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the record contains evidence that Lopes still suffers from serious health issues. Since his operation, Lopes has been hospitalized twice. Lopes' spouse receives almost all of his worker's compensation benefits based on the stark discrepancy between their life expectancies. Lopes has also been receiving Social Security disability benefits since 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, Lopes encounters a number of daily challenges in performing routine chores, has a suppressed immune system,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and has trouble sleeping through the night. But the issue in this appeal is \"not which side we believe is right, but whether the insurer has substantial evidentiary grounds for a reasonable decision in its favor.\" <i>Brigham v. Sun Life of Can.,</i> 317 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir.2003)(quoting <i>Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Insur. Co.,</i> 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir.1998)). Here, MetLife had grounds for concluding that Lopes can engage in sedentary work. Accordingly, its decision must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A person with a Class 5 impairment has \"a [s]evere limitation of physical capacity\" and is \"incapable of minimum ([]sedentary) activity.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Dictionary of Occupational Titles contains the following definition of sedentary work:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">S-Sedentary Work &#8212; Exerting up to 10 pounds of force occasionally (Occasionally: activity or condition exists up to 1/3 of the time) and/or a negligible amount of force frequently (Frequently: activity or condition exists from 1/3 to 2/3 of the time) to lift, carry, push, pull or otherwise move objects, including the human body.

Obviously, the termination \"saved\" MetLife the money it had allocated to paying Lopes' benefits after January 31, 2001, and we see nothing untoward in a MetLife employee documenting that fact</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Lopes had submitted a form describing his \"Activities of Daily Living\" in which he claimed that he drove for short periods, took daily walks, and played golf with a cart</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Lopes challenges MetLife's reliance on the opinion of an osteopath rather than a medical doctor qualified to treat Lopes' maladies. Lopes points out that, in Massachusetts, an osteopath may not prescribe or administer drugs for internal use or perform operations. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &#167; 11. Lopes' emphasis on whether an osteopath can treat him does not address whether a plan administrator can rely on an osteopath's review of the record when it determines whether a plan participant is able to perform an occupation. Surely, it may so long as the osteopath's expertise is germane to the area of inquiry. Here, Dr. Smith was board certified in occupational medicine and thus competent to assess Lopes' ability to work</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Lopes also suggested (for the first time) that this court must give special weight to his treating physician's opinion or that of a physician qualified to treat Lopes. <i>See Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 11, 20 (1st Cir.2002) (describing the so-called \"treating physician's rule\"). But we do not address arguments first raised at oral argument. <i>Albion v.

But Lopes' health was precarious: he underwent several bronchoscopies, lung tissue biopsies, and was twice hospitalized for possible pneumonia or infection. Lopes also suffered from \"post right lung transplant,\" sarcoidosis, hypertension, hypercholesterol, diabetes mellitus, right bronchial stenosis, and renal failure. Consequently, he required ongoing medical supervision and several medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1997 and 1999, Drs. Edward P. Ingenito and Aaron Deykin (who were then treating Lopes) submitted to MetLife two physician's statements in which they characterized Lopes' impairment as \"Class 5\" and totally disabling. During this same period, they also completed several physical capacities evaluations in which they indicated that Lopes' physical abilities were limited. Over time, however, these evaluations did note improvement in his ability to lift and carry objects and to perform other everyday physical activities such as grasping, bending, and reaching above shoulder level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Plan, MetLife reevaluated Lopes' eligibility for continued benefits after twenty-four months. At that point, MetLife's definition of disability became more spartan:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, after the first 24 months of benefit payments, you must also be completely and continuously unable to perform the duties of any gainful work or service for which you are reasonably qualified taking into consideration your training, education, and experience and past earnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Lopes would only continue receiving benefits if his illness prevented him from performing any job that matched his skill set.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 3, 2000, Dr. Ingenito submitted the final physician's statement MetLife received before terminating Lopes' benefits. For the first time, Dr. Ingenito characterized his physical impairment as \"Class 4,\" which signifies a \"moderate limitation of functional capacity,\" and implies a capability to engage in \"clerical/administrative ([]sedentary) activity.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nevertheless, despite describing the impairment as \"Class 4,\" Dr. Ingenito opined that Lopes remained \"totally disabled\" from performing his former occupation and any other work, and that he lacked prospects for significant improvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 2001, MetLife wrote Lopes and advised him that it had terminated his disability benefits on January 31, 2001. The letter explained that Lopes was no longer totally disabled under the Plan based on Lopes' most recent medical information, a vocational assessment, and all of the medical evidence contained in Lopes' file. MetLife relied heavily on Dr. Ingenito's report in explaining its decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You can lift and carry up to twenty pounds frequently, you can bend and reach above shoulder level frequently, you can squat, crawl, climb, occasionally, operate a motor vehicle, and use both your hands to perform repetitive fine finger movements, eye/hand movements and pushing and pulling. [Dr. Ingenito] states that in regards to physical impairment you have moderate limitation of functional capacity, you are capable of clerical/administrative work, sedentary activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing a \"transferable skills analysis\" completed by a vocational skills consultant, the letter identified several occupations for which Lopes qualified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not mentioned in the letter, MetLife also considered an analysis of Lopes' vocational prospects conducted by Dr. R. Kevin Smith, a board-certified Doctor of Osteopathy in Preventative and Occupational Medicine. Dr. Smith did not personally examine Lopes, but rather based his evaluation on the information in MetLife's file, including the physicians' reports and the vocational assessment. Smith concluded that Lopes' physical condition had stabilized and that Lopes was capable of performing a full-time sedentary job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopes appealed MetLife's decision to terminate his benefits by letter dated August 10, 2001. Lopes attached to his letter a list of eleven medications and supplements that he was taking regularly, and promised to submit additional medical information. On October 3, 2001, MetLife denied Lopes' appeal. In its denial, MetLife reiterated its rationale for terminating Lopes' benefits, placing particular emphasis on Lopes' apparent ability to engage in sedentary activity. MetLife also noted that, notwithstanding Lopes' promise to submit additional materials, \"there were no current medical records in file.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Lopes sued MetLife in Massachusetts superior court, claiming that MetLife's decision to terminate his benefits violated state statutory and common law. On February 22, 2000, MetLife removed this matter to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of ERISA preemption. <i>See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111859\"><a href=\"/opinion/111859/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 66-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111859\"><a href=\"/opinion/111859/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1542</span></a></span>, 95 L.Ed.2d 55(1987). Lopes then amended his complaint to allege a violation of ERISA &#167; 1132(a)(1)(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Plan vests discretionary authority in MetLife to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe its terms,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the district court first determined that it would not upset MetLife's termination of Lopes' benefits unless it found the termination to be arbitrary and capricious. <i>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1989)(directing courts to accord deference to benefit determinations made under plans that vest discretionary decision-making authority in their administrators). In so ruling, the court rejected Lopes' arguments in favor of de novo review, that MetLife (1) acted under a conflict of interest as both the insurer and plan administrator, and (2) acted with improper motivation in terminating his benefits. <i>See Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770872\"><a href=\"/opinion/770872/carolyn-pari-fasano-v-itt-hartford-life-and-accident-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 419-20 (1st Cir.2000)(rejecting an argument in favor of a less deferential standard of review in similar circumstances, but emphasizing that dual role evidence or evidence of improper motivation would factor into the functionally equivalent inquiries into whether the administrator's decision was \"arbitrary and capricious,\" an \"abuse of discretion,\" or \"unreasonable\"). The court then determined that, based on the evidence that was before it, MetLife acted reasonably in terminating Lopes' benefits. Accordingly, the court granted MetLife's cross-motion for summary judgment and denied Lopes' cross-motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Lopes renews his arguments in favor of de novo review and urges us to consider evidence outside the administrative record. Alternatively, Lopes contends that MetLife's decision was erroneous even under a more deferential standard of review. We reject Lopes' arguments for de novo review without further elaboration because they are precluded by settled circuit precedent. <i>See Pari-Fasano,</i> 230 F.3d at 419-20; <i>see also supra</i> at 4 (summarizing <i>Pari-Fasano's</i> explanation how benefits determinations are to be reviewed in circumstances such as this).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We also reject Lopes' argument in favor of supplementing the administrative record with additional medical evidence. Finally, we reject Lopes' attack on the merits of MetLife's decision. While the evidence before MetLife did not compel a conclusion that Lopes could return to work, it was of such a nature as to render the conclusion a permissible exercise of MetLife's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits of MetLife's decision, we first address Lopes' argument that, given MetLife's potential bias, we should consider evidence not before the plan administrator at the time of the challenged decision: an affidavit from another physician and a medical note written several weeks after MetLife's final determination. In reviewing an ERISA determination for arbitrariness, we and the overwhelming majority of other circuits have held that there is a strong presumption that the required deferential review of a plan administrator's benefits decision should be limited to the evidentiary record presented to the administrator. <i>See Liston v. Unum Corp. Officer Severance Plan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200479\"><a href=\"/opinion/200479/liston-v-unum-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 2003)(in reviewing a denial of severance benefits, stating that \"at least some very good reason is needed to overcome the strong presumption that the record on review is limited to the record before the administrator.\"). Review of the administrative record for reasonableness logically implies review of the record available to the plan administrator; it is anomalous to suggest that an administrator acted unreasonably \"by ignoring information never presented to it.\" <i>See id.</i> We thus affirm the district court's decision not to include evidence outside of the claim file.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful that our review for reasonableness is just that &#8212; \"a review and not a rubber stamp,\" <i>Donato v.

We begin with the evidence that is at the center of this dispute: the attending physician's reports. In all but the final submission, Lopes' doctors opined that \"he was incapable of minimum ([]sedentary) activity,\" and that he was totally disabled from working. In the final report, however, while still opining that Lopes could not work, Dr. Ingenito gave Lopes a \"Class 4\" impairment classification, which implies that Lopes was capable of sedentary activity. Moreover, at the time Dr. Ingenito submitted the report, he also completed a physical capacities evaluation in which he noted that Lopes could \"frequently\" lift and carry up to 20 pounds; \"occasionally\" lift and carry up to 50 pounds; and perform simple repetitive motions such as grasping, pushing, pulling, and fine manipulation. An endoscopy and examination completed at that same time indicated that Lopes did not suffer from fever or chest pain, and that Lopes' tolerance for exercise had improved since the previous year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> All of this evidence supports Dr. Smith's independent conclusion that Lopes was capable of sedentary work.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the record contains evidence that Lopes still suffers from serious health issues. Since his operation, Lopes has been hospitalized twice. Lopes' spouse receives almost all of his worker's compensation benefits based on the stark discrepancy between their life expectancies. Lopes has also been receiving Social Security disability benefits since 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Moreover, Lopes encounters a number of daily challenges in performing routine chores, has a suppressed immune system,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and has trouble sleeping through the night. But the issue in this appeal is \"not which side we believe is right, but whether the insurer has substantial evidentiary grounds for a reasonable decision in its favor.\" <i>Brigham v. Sun Life of Can.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200306\"><a href=\"/opinion/200306/brigham-v-sun-life-of-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir.2003)(quoting <i>Doyle v.

Here, MetLife had grounds for concluding that Lopes can engage in sedentary work.

Obviously, the termination \"saved\" MetLife the money it had allocated to paying Lopes' benefits after January 31, 2001, and we see nothing untoward in a MetLife employee documenting that fact</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Lopes had submitted a form describing his \"Activities of Daily Living\" in which he claimed that he drove for short periods, took daily walks, and played golf with a cart</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Lopes challenges MetLife's reliance on the opinion of an osteopath rather than a medical doctor qualified to treat Lopes' maladies. Lopes points out that, in Massachusetts, an osteopath may not prescribe or administer drugs for internal use or perform operations. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 112, &#167; 11. Lopes' emphasis on whether an osteopath can treat him does not address whether a plan administrator can rely on an osteopath's review of the record when it determines whether a plan participant is able to perform an occupation. Surely, it may so long as the osteopath's expertise is germane to the area of inquiry. Here, Dr. Smith was board certified in occupational medicine and thus competent to assess Lopes' ability to work</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Lopes also suggested (for the first time) that this court must give special weight to his treating physician's opinion or that of a physician qualified to treat Lopes. <i>See Leahy v.
