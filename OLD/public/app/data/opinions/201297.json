Williams, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\non memorandum for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         October 20, 2004\n\f      SELYA,   Circuit     Judge.      The   petitioner,       Ponta-Garca,    a\n\nPortugese national, seeks review of an order reinstating an earlier\n\norder of deportation because of his allegedly illegal reentry into\n\nthis country.      The respondent, the Attorney General, has moved to\n\ndismiss,   contending      that   jurisdiction    is   lacking    because     the\n\npetition for review was not timely filed.            We agree.    Thus, we are\n\nconstrained to grant the motion to dismiss.\n\n      The petitioner was ordered deported in 1987 after overstaying\n\nhis   authorized    period   of     visitation.      For     reasons   that   are\n\nunexplained    in    the   record,    that   order     was    never    executed.\n\nSeventeen years later, on May 24, 2004, he was apprehended by\n\nagents of the respondent and served with a one-page document (Form\n\nI-871) entitled \"Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior\n\nOrder.\" This document relied on a revised statutory provision that\n\ntook effect in 1997.       The statute provides in part as follows:\n\n           If the Attorney General finds that an alien has\n      reentered the United States illegally after having been\n      removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of\n      removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from\n      its original date ... and the alien shall be removed\n      under the prior order at any time after the reentry.\n\nINA § 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).           The first part of Form I-\n\n871 consisted of the \"notice of intent\" to reinstate and was signed\n\nby an immigration officer (Agent Nelligan).                It charged that the\n\npetitioner had departed voluntarily on April 23, 1992, pursuant to\n\nthe deportation order; that he had illegally reentered the country\n\nfour days later; and that he was thus subject to removal by\n\n                                      -2-\n\freinstatement of the prior order.    The notice informed petitioner\n\nthat he could \"contest this determination by making a written or\n\noral statement to an immigration officer.\"     It also stated that\n\n\"[t]he facts that formed the basi[s] of this determination, and the\n\nexistence of a right to make a written or oral statement contesting\n\nthis determination, were communicated to the alien.\"       In a box\n\nmeant to indicate whether the petitioner wished to make such a\n\nstatement, the handwritten notation \"refuse to answer\" appears.   A\n\nspace for his signature is also empty.\n\n     The following day, on May 25, 2004, another immigration\n\nofficer (Agent Riccio) signed a box at the bottom of Form I-871\n\nendorsing   a   pre-printed   \"Decision,   Order,   and    Officer's\n\nCertification\" that the petitioner was subject to removal through\n\nreinstatement of the earlier deportation order.     The petitioner\n\nsought reconsideration of this decision in a letter from counsel\n\ndated June 28, 2004, addressed to the field office director.    That\n\nrequest remains pending.   On July 19, 2004, fifty-five days after\n\nAgent Riccio's May 25 decision, the petitioner filed the instant\n\npetition for review.\n\n     An order reinstating an earlier order of deportation is\n\nsubject to review under 8 U.S.C. § 1252.      See, e.g., Lattab v.\n\nAshcroft, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [2004 WL 2059762, at\n\n*2]; Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003).    Section\n\n1252(b)(1) provides that \"[t]he petition for review must be filed\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fnot later than 30 days after the date of the final order of\n\nremoval.\"    This deadline is a \"strict jurisdictional requirement.\"\n\nZhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003); see also Pimental-\n\nRomero v. INS, 952 F.2d 564, 564 (1st Cir. 1991) (applying former\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(1)).    The respondent, noting that the instant\n\npetition was filed more than thirty days after Agent Riccio's May\n\n25 decision, asserts that jurisdiction is lacking.\n\n     The petitioner's principal response requires an examination of\n\n8 C.F.R. § 241.8, the regulation governing reinstatement of removal\n\norders.     The paragraph entitled \"Notice\" reads as follows:\n\n     If an officer determines that an alien is subject to\n     removal under this section, he or she shall provide the\n     alien with written notice of his or her determination.\n     The officer shall advise the alien that he or she may\n     make a written or oral statement contesting the\n     determination.    If the alien wishes to make such a\n     statement, the officer shall allow the alien to do so and\n     shall consider whether the alien's statement warrants\n     reconsideration of the determination.\n\nId. § 241.8(b). The petitioner's argument runs along the following\n\nlines: (i) this provision affords the alien a right to make a\n\nstatement and thereby seek reconsideration of the determination to\n\nreinstate; (ii) by definition, reconsideration may occur only after\n\nthat determination has been made (here, after Agent Riccio's May 25\n\ndecision); (iii) the thirty-day appeal period does not begin to run\n\nuntil the reconsideration request has been resolved; and (iv) far\n\nfrom being tardy, the instant petition is, if anything, premature.\n\n     The second step in this analysis fails.     It is apparent that\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthe \"determination\" subject to \"reconsideration\" is not the one\n\nmade by Agent Riccio in the May 25 decision and order, but, rather,\n\nthe one made by Agent Nelligan in the May 24 notice of intent.\n\nThis is confirmed by the language in the notice (which uses the\n\nword \"determination\" five times), as well as by the first two\n\nsentences of 8 C.F.R. § 241.8(b).       It is also apparent that Agent\n\nRiccio's ruling accomplished whatever reconsideration was deemed\n\nwarranted here (which may have been none, given the petitioner's\n\nrefusal to provide a statement).        Accordingly, counsel's June 28\n\nletter cannot be viewed as invoking the reconsideration mechanism\n\nset forth in section 241.8(b); it can only be seen as a separate\n\nmotion to reconsider or to reopen, and, thus, unconnected to the\n\ncited regulation.     The filing of such a motion does not toll the\n\nthirty-day period for seeking judicial review.1      See Stone v. INS,\n\n514 U.S. 386 (1995). Consequently, we are compelled to dismiss the\n\ninstant petition for lack of jurisdiction.2\n\n     We   add   a   coda.   If   the    representations   made   by   the\n\npetitioner's counsel are accurate, he would appear to have a strong\n\n\n\n     1\n        Should the eventual disposition of that motion not be in\nthe petitioner's favor, he may, of course, file a separate petition\nfor review with respect thereto.\n     2\n       We summarily reject the petitioner's other arguments. For\nthe reasons discussed above, his exhaustion-of-administrative-\nremedies rationale is unpersuasive. See Castro-Cortez v. INS, 239\nF.3d 1037, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 2001). So too is his reliance on 8\nC.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(2); that regulation applies only to decisions\nthat are appealable to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fcase on the merits.      He contends that he did not voluntarily depart\n\nunder the prior deportation order but, rather, left the country\n\ntemporarily to attend a wedding.         He also contends that he did not\n\nreenter the country illegally but, rather, was inspected and\n\nallowed entry.        If either of these assertions is correct, the\n\nreinstatement provision would appear to be inapplicable by its\n\nexpress terms.        Moreover, the petitioner contends that the 1987\n\ndeportation order was invalidated by the federal district court in\n\nConnecticut at some point after his reentry.               If that is so, the\n\nadministrative        reinstatement     of    that    order       would    appear\n\nproblematic.     See Chacon-Corral v. Weber, 259 F. Supp. 2d 1151,\n\n1164 (D. Col. 2003) (\"Because deportation for unauthorized reentry\n\nunder INA § 241(a)(5) is under the original order of deportation,\n\na determination that the original order was invalid renders §\n\n241(a)(5) inapplicable in a given case.\").            Particularly in light\n\nof the due process concerns that can arise in this context, see,\n\ne.g., Lattab, ___ F.3d at ___ n.6 [2004 WL 2059762, at *9 n.6];\n\nArreola-Arreola v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 956, ___ n.5 (9th Cir. 2004)\n\n[2004 WL 1977663, at *2 n.5]; Castro-Cortez v. INS, 239 F.3d 1037,\n\n1047-50 (9th Cir. 2001), we encourage the respondent to reexamine\n\nthe case with care.\n\n       We need go no further.         The petition for review is untimely\n\nand, hence, is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.                The temporary\n\nstay   of   removal    imposed   by    this   court   on   July    30,    2004   is\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\frescinded.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                         -7-\n\f",

Seventeen years later, on May 24, 2004, he was apprehended by agents of the respondent and served with a one-page document (Form I-871) entitled \"Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order.\" This document relied on a revised statutory provision that took effect in 1997. The statute provides in part as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date ... and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(5). The first part of Form I-871 consisted of the \"notice of intent\" to reinstate and was signed by an immigration officer (Agent Nelligan). It charged that the petitioner had departed voluntarily on April 23, 1992, pursuant to the deportation order; that he had illegally reentered the country four days later; and that he was thus subject to removal by reinstatement of the prior order. The notice informed petitioner that he could \"contest this determination by making a written or oral statement to an immigration officer.\" It also stated that \"[t]he facts that formed the basi[s] of this determination, and the existence of a right to make a written or oral statement contesting this determination, were communicated to the alien.\" In a box meant to indicate whether the petitioner wished to make such a statement, the handwritten notation \"refuse to answer\" appears. A space for his signature is also empty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, on May 25, 2004, another immigration officer (Agent Riccio) signed a box at the bottom of Form I-871 endorsing a pre-printed \"Decision, Order, and Officer's Certification\" that the petitioner was subject to removal through reinstatement of the earlier deportation order. The petitioner sought reconsideration of this decision in a letter from counsel dated June 28, 2004, addressed to the field office director. That request remains pending. On July 19, 2004, fifty-five days after Agent Riccio's May 25 decision, the petitioner filed the instant petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An order reinstating an earlier order of deportation is subject to review under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252. <i>See, e.g., Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201243\"><a href=\"/opinion/201243/lattab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 13-14 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Arevalo v.

Section 1252(b)(1) provides that \"[t]he petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\" This deadline is a \"strict jurisdictional requirement.\" <i>Zhang v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200720\"><a href=\"/opinion/200720/zhang-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also Pimental-Romero v.

The respondent, noting that the instant petition was filed more than thirty days after Agent Riccio's May 25 decision, asserts that jurisdiction is lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's principal response requires an examination of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8, the regulation governing reinstatement of removal orders. The paragraph entitled \"Notice\" reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If an officer determines that an alien is subject to removal under this section, he or she shall provide the alien with written notice of his or her determination. The officer shall advise the alien that he or she may make a written or oral statement contesting the determination. If the alien wishes to make such a statement, the officer shall allow the alien to do so and shall consider whether the alien's statement warrants reconsideration of the determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 241.8(b). The petitioner's argument runs along the following lines: (i) this provision affords the alien a right to make a statement and thereby seek reconsideration of the determination to reinstate; (ii) by definition, reconsideration may occur only after that determination has been made (here, after Agent Riccio's May 25 decision); (iii) the thirty-day appeal period does not begin to run until the reconsideration request has been resolved; and (iv) far from being tardy, the instant petition is, if anything, premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step in this analysis fails. It is apparent that the \"determination\" subject to \"reconsideration\" is not the one made by Agent Riccio in the May 25 decision and order, but, rather, the one made by Agent Nelligan in the May 24 notice of intent. This is confirmed by the language in the notice (which uses the word \"determination\" five times), as well as by the first two sentences of 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8(b). It is also apparent that Agent Riccio's ruling accomplished whatever reconsideration was deemed warranted here (which may have been none, given the petitioner's refusal to provide a statement). Accordingly, counsel's June 28 letter cannot be viewed as invoking the reconsideration mechanism set forth in section 241.8(b); it can only be seen as a separate motion to reconsider or to reopen, and, thus, unconnected to the cited regulation. The filing of such a motion does not toll the thirty-day period for seeking judicial review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See Stone v.

If the representations made by the petitioner's counsel are accurate, he would appear to have a strong case on the merits. He contends that he did not voluntarily depart under the prior deportation order but, rather, left the country temporarily to attend a wedding. He also contends that he did not reenter the country illegally but, rather, was inspected and allowed entry. If either of these assertions is correct, the reinstatement provision would appear to be inapplicable by its express terms. Moreover, the petitioner contends that the 1987 deportation order was invalidated by the federal district court in Connecticut at some point after his reentry. If that is so, the administrative reinstatement of that order would appear problematic. <i>See Chacon-Corral v. Weber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2363485\"><a href=\"/opinion/2363485/chacon-corral-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
