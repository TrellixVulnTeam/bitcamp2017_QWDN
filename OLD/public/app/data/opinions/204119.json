Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico, 432 F.3d\n\n379, 383 n.2 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n       Plaintiff began working for Defendant on May 6, 1999.\n\nFrom February 6, 2001 until she was terminated on March 29,\n\n2004, Plaintiff received several reprimands and complaints\n\nabout her performance and interaction with other employees.\n\nShe also filed complaints of her own concerning the behavior\n\nof other employees.             Plaintiff’s supervisors met with her\n\nnumerous times to discuss both Plaintiff’s complaints and\n\nthose    filed       against   her,   as   well   as     her   infractions      of\n\ncompany       rules.       Additionally,       Plaintiff        was     suspended\n\nwithout pay from August 14 to 20, 2003.                  On August 22, 2003,\n\nshe filed a lawsuit against Defendant in Puerto Rico local\n\ncourt to recover unpaid bonuses and commissions.                       Defendant\n\nreceived       the    summons    on   August      27,    2003.         Additional\n\ndisciplinary problems arose, and Plaintiff’s supervisors met\n\nwith    her    again.     Several     written     communications         informed\n\nPlaintiff that she would be terminated if her behavior did\n\nnot improve.         Plaintiff began giving deposition testimony in\n\nthe    Puerto    Rico    lawsuit      on   January      26,    2004.     Further\n\nproblems arose with Plaintiff’s behavior at work.                          Though\n\nher supervisors attempted to meet with her to discuss these\n\nproblems, Plaintiff refused to discuss anything.                        On March\n\n29,    2004,    Plaintiff’s      supervisors      notified      her    that   they\n\n\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\fwere terminating her employment with Defendant because of\n\nher history of violating company regulations and her refusal\n\nto cooperate in an internal investigation.\n\n       We    agree       with     the       district       court       that      Defendant\n\npresented ample evidence to show Plaintiff’s termination was\n\nthe    culmination        of    an     unsuccessful        disciplinary           process.\n\nPlaintiff’s only evidence of pretext is an October 20, 2003\n\nemail from Human Resources to one of Plaintiff’s supervisors\n\nadvising him to “remember that the actions with [Plaintiff]\n\nmust    be       reviewed      since    there       is    an    ongoing       complaint.”\n\nTaken       in    the    light       most    favorable         to    Plaintiff,         this\n\nstatement         is,    at    best,    ambiguous         in    many    ways:         It    is\n\nunclear whether “complaint” refers to Plaintiff’s lawsuit or\n\nher    internal         complaints;         it    is     unclear     what      “reviewed”\n\nmeans;       and    it    is     unclear         whether       the   writer       had      any\n\nretaliatory intent or was merely reminding the recipient to\n\ndocument interactions with Plaintiff.                          Therefore, this email\n\nis insufficient to show that the Defendant’s reasons are a\n\nmere pretext.             See Velez v. Thermo King de Puerto Rico,\n\nInc., 585 F.3d 441, 452 (1st Cir. 2009) (explaining in an\n\nADEA case that a plaintiff must “elucidate specific facts”\n\ndemonstrating            the    employer’s          justification           is    a     sham\n\nintended to hide an actual unlawful motive).\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 4 -\n\f      Plaintiff’s       second         contention         seems     to    be     that    the\n\ndistrict court erred by concluding her retaliation claim was\n\nbased on an internal complaint rather than her deposition\n\ntestimony beginning January 26, 2004.                            We do not read the\n\ndistrict    court’s      decision        in    this       manner.         Instead,       the\n\ndistrict    court      first     explained          that       Plaintiff       engaged    in\n\nprotected       activity       by      filing       a     lawsuit        and     Defendant\n\ndischarged      her,    then        concluded           Defendant        satisfied       its\n\nburden    to    provide      a      legitimate           reason     for        Plaintiff’s\n\ntermination.         Plaintiff, however, did not demonstrate that\n\nDefendant’s reason was a mere pretext, so the district court\n\nconcluded her retaliation claim failed.                          Next, the district\n\ncourt reasoned that even if Defendant’s actions amounted to\n\nretaliation against Plaintiff for her November 2002 internal\n\ncomplaint       about    unpaid         bonuses          and    commissions,         those\n\nactions began before Plaintiff filed her lawsuit or gave her\n\ndeposition.      Moreover, Law No. 115 protects only \"testimony,\n\nexpression      or    information         .     .    .    before     a     legislative,\n\nadministrative, or judicial forum,\" not internal complaints.\n\n29   L.P.R.A    §    194a.       Because       the       district    court        properly\n\nfound    that    Plaintiff        failed      to     demonstrate          pretext       and,\n\nadditionally,        could       not    base        her    retaliation           claim    on\n\ninternal complaints, the court did not err when it granted\n\nsummary judgment for Defendant.\n\n\n\n                                         - 5 -\n\f    Upon careful consideration of the briefs, the record,\n\nand the applicable law, in light of the applicable standard\n\nof review, we discern no reversible error presented in this\n\ncase.   AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                           - 6 -\n\f",

We do not read the\n\ndistrict    court’s      decision        in    this       manner.         Instead,       the\n\ndistrict    court      first     explained          that       Plaintiff       engaged    in\n\nprotected       activity       by      filing       a     lawsuit        and     Defendant\n\ndischarged      her,    then        concluded           Defendant        satisfied       its\n\nburden    to    provide      a      legitimate           reason     for        Plaintiff’s\n\ntermination.         Plaintiff, however, did not demonstrate that\n\nDefendant’s reason was a mere pretext, so the district court\n\nconcluded her retaliation claim failed.                          Next, the district\n\ncourt reasoned that even if Defendant’s actions amounted to\n\nretaliation against Plaintiff for her November 2002 internal\n\ncomplaint       about    unpaid         bonuses          and    commissions,         those\n\nactions began before Plaintiff filed her lawsuit or gave her\n\ndeposition.      Moreover, Law No. 115 protects only \"testimony,\n\nexpression      or    information         .     .    .    before     a     legislative,\n\nadministrative, or judicial forum,\" not internal complaints.\n\n29   L.P.R.A    §    194a.       Because       the       district    court        properly\n\nfound    that    Plaintiff        failed      to     demonstrate          pretext       and,\n\nadditionally,        could       not    base        her    retaliation           claim    on\n\ninternal complaints, the court did not err when it granted\n\nsummary judgment for Defendant.\n\n\n\n                                         - 5 -\n\f    Upon careful consideration of the briefs, the record,\n\nand the applicable law, in light of the applicable standard\n\nof review, we discern no reversible error presented in this\n\ncase.   AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                           - 6 -\n\f</pre>",
