Norwood, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, and Peter D.

Petitioner Rodney Bustillo seeks review of\n\nan order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his\n\nmotion to reopen an October 2004 order of deportation.           Such a\n\nruling will be upheld unless petitioner can show an abuse of\n\ndiscretion--i.e., \"that the BIA committed an error of law or\n\nexercised its judgment in an arbitrary, capricious, or irrational\n\nway.\"   Raza v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007).       As no\n\nsuch showing has been made here, the petition for review will be\n\ndenied.\n\n            Motions to reopen before the BIA \"are limited both\n\nnumerically (one to a customer) and temporally (a ninety-day\n\nwindow).\"     Id.   (citing   8   C.F.R.   §   1003.2(c)(2)).   The   BIA\n\njustifiably denied relief on both such grounds.           Petitioner had\n\nearlier filed at least two other motions to reopen; the instant\n\nrequest was filed some fifteen months after the deadline; equitable\n\ntolling, even if available in this context, would be barred by\n\npetitioner's lack of due diligence; and no other exceptional\n\ncircumstances are present.        The BIA also cited a third ground:\n\npetitioner's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim did not comply\n\nwith the threshold procedural requirements prescribed by Matter of\n\nLozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA), review denied, 857 F.2d 10 (1st\n\nCir. 1988). This rationale, too, was supportable. See, e.g., Zeng\n\nv. Gonzales, 436 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          In   this   court,   petitioner   does   not   address   these\n\nprocedural matters directly but rather attacks the substance of the\n\noriginal BIA decision.   That challenge is not only misdirected (as\n\nit ignores the BIA's reasons for denying reopening) but also\n\nmisplaced.   Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, counsel's failure\n\nto file a brief with the BIA does not amount to prejudice per se.\n\nSee Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2001).        Instead,\n\npetitioner must establish \"a reasonable probability that the result\n\nof the proceedings would have been different\" had a brief been\n\nsubmitted.   Id. at 56-57 (internal quotation marks omitted).       Such\n\na showing has not been made here.       And such a probability is not\n\notherwise discernible--particularly since the Immigration Judge had\n\nspelled out the principal arguments in petitioner's favor, and a\n\nfamily member had filed a brief on his behalf.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
