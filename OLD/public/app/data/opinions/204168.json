Defendant-appellant   Rolando\n\nSantiago-Rivera challenges as unreasonable the sentence imposed upon\n\nhim in connection with the revocation of a term of supervised\n\nrelease.    The circumstances of this case are unusual and the\n\nquestion presented -- which involves the extent to which a federal\n\njudge may shape a sentence for a violation of supervised release to\n\naffect an unrelated state sentence -- is one of first impression.\n\nAfter careful consideration of this conundrum, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court committed a procedural error by relying upon an\n\nimpermissible factor in fashioning its sentence.     Accordingly, we\n\nvacate the appellant's sentence and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n           In the United States District Court for the District of\n\nPuerto Rico, the appellant entered a plea of guilty, on February 21,\n\n2006, to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The court\n\nsentenced him to serve a 30-month incarcerative term, to be followed\n\nby a three-year period of supervised release.\n\n           While the firearms case was pending in federal court, the\n\nappellant was tried and convicted for a double murder in the Puerto\n\nRico trial court.   That court sentenced him to serve a 99-year term\n\nof imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year consecutive term of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          The appellant was released from federal prison on June\n\n11, 2007. On October 3 of that year, a federal probation officer\n\nrequested a warrant for the appellant's arrest, stating that the\n\nappellant had violated the general condition that he report to the\n\nprobation officer within 72 hours of his release from the custody\n\nof the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).\n\nII. REVOCATION HEARING\n\n          At the revocation hearing, the appellant admitted the\n\nviolation and the government requested a 12-month prison sentence.\n\nThis recommendation came within the applicable advisory guideline\n\nrange, which called for 6-12 months of imprisonment.      The district\n\ncourt   accepted   the   government's    recommendation   as   to   the\n\nsuitability of a 12-month period of immurement but tacked on a two-\n\nyear term of supervised release.        It explained its rationale in\n\nclear terms:\n\n               The Court recommends to the Bureau of\n          Prisons that Mr. Santiago be turned over to\n          the state authorities so that he may continue\n          serving the time that he has to do in state\n          court and that a detainer be lodged in the\n          state court so that, subsequently, this\n          federal sentence is served.\n\n\n              Basically, the reason I do this is because\n          I am skeptical on the state system, the way\n          that they calculate the sentences.     And who\n          knows, he may be out of prison in a very\n          reasonable future date and, therefore, this\n          federal sentence would start to apply.\n\nDefense counsel argued against the sentence on the ground that:\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          [W]ith supervised release term pending, he\n          will not get any credit or benefits, because\n          he will have the detainer for the supervised\n          release term. So no benefits will be given to\n          him.   And that means that he might have to\n          serve the whole 30, 40, 50 years, maybe the\n          whole 99 years, under the new penal code of\n          Puerto Rico, without any benefits because of\n          the detainer pending.\n\n\nThe court repeated its reasoning and made pellucid its intention to\n\naffect the state sentence:\n\n          COURT: Well, he has a 99-year sentence, plus a\n          consecutive five-year sentence. And but for\n          the detainer, he could be out in eight years.\n          That's what you're saying.\n\n                             * * *\n               That's why I am sentencing the way I'm\n          sentencing him.\n\n\n          It appears from BOP records that the appellant already\n\nhas served the 12-month sentence of imprisonment.     The record on\n\nappeal and the parties' briefs provide no information as to whether\n\nthe BOP followed the recommendation to lodge a detainer in the\n\ncommonwealth court to ensure that the supervised release portion of\n\nthe revocation sentence would be served after the appellant's\n\nrelease (if one occurred) from the Puerto Rico prison system.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\n          Two well-established principles of law cabin our inquiry.\n\nTo begin, a non-binding recommendation by a district court to the\n\nBOP is not a reviewable order.   United States v. Meléndez, 279 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f16, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).         Therefore, we do not focus on the district\n\ncourt's recommendation to the BOP anent the lodging of a detainer.\n\n            The next principle is that a revocation sentence is\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).\n\nUnited States v. McInnis, 429 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).                          A\n\nmaterial mistake of law is, perforce, an abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Caraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The appellant does not challenge the length of the prison\n\nsentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release; instead, he\n\nchallenges only the imposition of yet another term of supervised\n\nrelease.    Under the advisory sentencing guidelines, a reviewing\n\ncourt    must    look    at   both    the    procedural   and   the   substantive\n\npropriety of a challenged sentence. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nCarrasco-De-Jesus, 589 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 2009). If a concern\n\nthat a state will fail adequately to punish a defendant on an\n\nunrelated       charge   is   an     impermissible   sentencing       factor,   the\n\nsentence must be vacated as a matter of law.1\n\n            The relevant statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3), permits\n\nimposition of a term of imprisonment upon revocation of a term of\n\nsupervised release; a different subsection of the statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(h), permits a term of supervised release to be\n\nimposed in addition to the term of imprisonment. As subsection (h)\n\n\n     1\n       In this context, Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of\na state. Cf. United States v. Acosta-Martinez, 252 F.3d 13, 19 n.5\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                            -5-\n\fdoes not list the factors to be considered in imposing a term of\n\nsupervised release as part of a revocation sentence, it is a\n\nreasonable inference that the factors are the same as those to be\n\nconsidered in imposing an initial term of supervised release.                 See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3583(c), cross-referencing to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)\n\n(listing factors to be considered in imposing a sentence).\n\n             The factors to be considered under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c)\n\ninclude the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history\n\nand characteristics of the offender; the need to afford adequate\n\ndeterrence; the need to protect the public from further crimes; the\n\nneed to provide the offender with training, care, or treatment; the\n\nguidelines and any pertinent policy statement(s); the need to avoid\n\nunwarranted     sentencing     disparity;        and   the    need   to   effect\n\nrestitution.       These statutes provide guidance -- but not absolute\n\ncertitude -- as to what factors should be considered.\n\n             It is clear from the transcript of the sentencing hearing\n\nin the case at hand that most of the enumerated factors were not\n\nconsidered. The district court did consider the advisory guideline\n\nrange   to   the    extent   that    the    sentence    did    not   exceed   it.\n\nNonetheless,       Chapter   Seven   of    the    guidelines    expresses     the\n\nSentencing Commission's view that sentences upon revocation of\n\nsupervised release are intended to punish the breach of trust that\n\nthe violation represents.       Here, the nature of the violation -- a\n\nbreach of trust signified by failure to report -- was not even\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fmentioned by the sentencing court.          Instead, the focus of the\n\nhearing was strictly and solely on condign punishment for the\n\nappellant's murder case. Had the murders been committed during the\n\noriginal   period   of   supervised     release,   these   crimes   would\n\nappropriately have factored into the revocation sentence. But, the\n\nmurders were committed before the appellant was imprisoned on the\n\nfederal firearms charge and, a fortiori, before the imposition of\n\nthe first supervised release term occurred.        Thus, the revocation\n\nof supervised release bore no conceivable relationship to the\n\nmurders, and vice-versa.\n\n           As we noted above, this case presents a question of first\n\nimpression.   Most likely, the paucity of cases on point stands as\n\na testament to the fact that the federal district courts, when\n\nfaced with the need to sentence a defendant upon revocation of\n\nsupervised release, seldom rely upon impermissible factors in\n\nreaching sentencing decisions.    We have, however, found a handful\n\nof cases addressing impermissible sentencing factors.\n\n           The most notable is United States v. Velasquez Velaquez,\n\n524 F.3d 1248 (11th Cir. 2008).       There, the court of appeals noted\n\nthat it was appropriate to \"review de novo, as a question of law,\n\nwhether a factor considered by the district court in sentencing a\n\ndefendant is impermissible.\" Id. at 1252. A sentence imposed upon\n\nrevocation of supervised release was vacated on the ground that the\n\ndistrict court was motivated to lengthen the sentence by its\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fdisapproval of the fact that an immigration judge had released\n\nVelasquez on bond pending his appeal of the denial of his request\n\nfor asylum.    Id.\n\n            By way of analogy, sentences also have been vacated when\n\na district court stumbles over the concept of \"disparity.\"                      The\n\ndecisions in United States v. Williams, 524 F.3d 209 (2d Cir.\n\n2008), United States v. Jeremiah, 446 F.3d 805 (8th Cir. 2006), and\n\nUnited States v. Clark, 434 F.3d 684 (4th Cir. 2006), all involved\n\nsentences for substantive offenses rather than sentences imposed\n\nupon revocation of supervised release.            In each case, the court of\n\nappeals held that it was procedural error for a district court to\n\nconsider    the   disparity      between    federal      sentences     and    local\n\nsentences   for    similar      offenses.   Williams,      524   F.3d    at    215,\n\nJeremiah, 446 F.3d at 808, and Clark, 434 F.3d at 686.                 Cf. United\n\nStates v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir. 1998)(under then\n\nmandatory     guidelines,        federal/state        sentencing        disparity\n\nimpermissible     basis   for    downward    departure).         The   courts    in\n\nWilliams, Jeremiah, and Clark agree that the advisory guidelines\n\nare there to aid district courts in achieving a level of nationwide\n\nconsistency in federal sentencing, a goal to which consistency\n\nbetween federal and state sentencing has to be subordinated.\n\n            The   district    court   in    the   case    at   bar   went    beyond\n\nconsidering the disparity between federal and state sentences.\n\nRather, the district court explicitly fashioned a federal sentence\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin order to influence the manner in which a sentence imposed by a\n\nlocal court was implemented.          The murders for which the appellant\n\nwas convicted and sentenced in the Puerto Rico trial court were\n\nunrelated to either the federal firearms offense (the offense of\n\nconviction) or the appellant's violation of the conditions of his\n\nterm of supervised release.2\n\n               There   are   two   loose   ends.    First,    we   reject   the\n\ngovernment's assertion that the appellant's claim of sentencing\n\nerror    was    either   forfeited    or   waived   because   he   argued   too\n\ngenerally in the district court.               It is sufficient that the\n\nappellant objected to the sentence on the precise contention that\n\nthe court's proposed course of action would impermissibly affect\n\nhis state sentence.           Second, the government for its part has\n\nforfeited any argument that the district court's bevue did not\n\nprejudice the appellant.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the district court committed procedural error by\n\n\n     2\n       Although it does not affect the outcome of this appeal, we\nnote that the court, the assistant United States attorney, and\ndefense counsel all lacked reliable information regarding the\nquestion of how the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico would implement the\nsentence imposed by its court. They variously estimated that the\nappellant might serve eight years, 40 years, or 99 years; among\nother things, it was not clear whether the appellant had been\nsentenced as a minor, or whether, under the Commonwealth's new\npenal code, the lodging of a detainer would affect the credits and\nbenefits afforded him during his state incarceration.          Many\nambiguities pervade other aspects of the record.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fselecting a sentence for the sole purpose of controlling the\n\nrunning of an unrelated local sentence.\n\n          This leaves the question of a remedy.      In the unusual\n\ncircumstances of this case, we think that the appropriate remedy is\n\nto vacate the sentence (which, after all, was based at least in\n\npart on an impermissible sentencing factor) and to remand the case\n\nfor further proceedings, including resentencing, consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   We take no view as to the appropriate sentence to be\n\nimposed on remand; our concern here is with procedural error.\n\n         So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, the appellant entered a plea of guilty, on February 21, 2006, to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The court sentenced him to serve a 30-month incarcerative term, to be followed by a three-year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p>While the firearms case was pending in federal court, the appellant was tried and convicted for a double murder in the Puerto Rico trial court. That court sentenced him to serve a 99-year term of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year consecutive term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The appellant was released from federal prison on June 11, 2007. On October 3 of that year, a federal probation officer requested a warrant for the appellant's arrest, stating that the appellant had violated the general condition that he report to the probation officer within 72 hours of his release from the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. REVOCATION HEARING</h2>\n<p>At the revocation hearing, the appellant admitted the violation and the government requested a 12-month prison sentence. This recommendation came within the applicable advisory guideline range, which called for 6-12 months of imprisonment. The district court accepted the government's recommendation as to the suitability of a 12-month period of immurement but tacked on a two-year term of supervised release. It explained its rationale in clear terms:</p>\n<blockquote>The Court recommends to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr. Santiago be turned over to the state authorities so that he may continue serving the time that he has to do in state court and that a detainer be lodged in the state court so that, subsequently, this federal sentence is served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Basically, the reason I do this is because I am skeptical on the state system, the way that they calculate the sentences. And who knows, he may be out of prison in a very reasonable future date and, therefore, this federal sentence would start to apply.</blockquote>\n<p>Defense counsel argued against the sentence on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> [W]ith supervised release term pending, he will not get any credit or benefits, because he will have the detainer for the supervised release term. So no benefits will be given to him. And that means that he might have to serve the whole 30, 40, 50 years, maybe the whole 99 years, under the new penal code of Puerto Rico, without any benefits because of the detainer pending.</blockquote>\n<p>The court repeated its reasoning and made pellucid its intention to affect the state sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>COURT: Well, he has a 99-year sentence, plus a consecutive five-year sentence. And but for the detainer, he could be out in eight years. That's what you're saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That's why I am sentencing the way I'm sentencing him.</blockquote>\n<p>It appears from BOP records that the appellant already has served the 12-month sentence of imprisonment. The record on appeal and the parties' briefs provide no information as to whether the BOP followed the recommendation to lodge a detainer in the commonwealth court to ensure that the supervised release portion of the revocation sentence would be served after the appellant's release (if one occurred) from the Puerto Rico prison system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

The circumstances of this case are unusual and the question presented  which involves the extent to which a federal judge may shape a sentence for a violation of supervised release to affect an unrelated state sentence  is one of first impression. After careful consideration of this conundrum, we conclude that the district court committed a procedural error by relying upon an impermissible factor in fashioning its sentence. Accordingly, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, the appellant entered a plea of guilty, on February 21, 2006, to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The court sentenced him to serve a 30-month incarcerative term, to be followed by a three-year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p>While the firearms case was pending in federal court, the appellant was tried and convicted for a double murder in the Puerto Rico trial court. That court sentenced him to serve a 99-year term of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year consecutive term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>The appellant was released from federal prison on June 11, 2007. On October 3 of that year, a federal probation officer requested a warrant for the appellant's arrest, stating that the appellant had violated the general condition that he report to the probation officer within 72 hours of his release from the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. REVOCATION HEARING</h2>\n<p>At the revocation hearing, the appellant admitted the violation and the government requested a 12-month prison sentence. This recommendation came within the applicable advisory guideline range, which called for 6-12 months of imprisonment. The district court accepted the government's recommendation as to the suitability of a 12-month period of immurement but tacked on a two-year term of supervised release. It explained its rationale in clear terms:</p>\n<blockquote>The Court recommends to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr. Santiago be turned over to the state authorities so that he may continue serving the time that he has to do in state court and that a detainer be lodged in the state court so that, subsequently, this federal sentence is served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Basically, the reason I do this is because I am skeptical on the state system, the way that they calculate the sentences. And who knows, he may be out of prison in a very reasonable future date and, therefore, this federal sentence would start to apply.</blockquote>\n<p>Defense counsel argued against the sentence on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> [W]ith supervised release term pending, he will not get any credit or benefits, because he will have the detainer for the supervised release term. So no benefits will be given to him. And that means that he might have to serve the whole 30, 40, 50 years, maybe the whole 99 years, under the new penal code of Puerto Rico, without any benefits because of the detainer pending.</blockquote>\n<p>The court repeated its reasoning and made pellucid its intention to affect the state sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>COURT: Well, he has a 99-year sentence, plus a consecutive five-year sentence. And but for the detainer, he could be out in eight years. That's what you're saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That's why I am sentencing the way I'm sentencing him.</blockquote>\n<p>It appears from BOP records that the appellant already has served the 12-month sentence of imprisonment. The record on appeal and the parties' briefs provide no information as to whether the BOP followed the recommendation to lodge a detainer in the commonwealth court to ensure that the supervised release portion of the revocation sentence would be served after the appellant's release (if one occurred) from the Puerto Rico prison system.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Two well-established principles of law cabin our inquiry. To begin, a non-binding recommendation by a district court to the BOP is not a reviewable order. <i>United States v. Meléndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199806\"><a href=\"/opinion/199806/united-states-v-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2002). Therefore, we do not focus on the district court's recommendation to the BOP anent the lodging of a detainer.</p>\n<p>The next principle is that a revocation sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3). <i>United States v. McInnis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201912\"><a href=\"/opinion/201912/united-states-v-mcinnis/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 2005). A material mistake of law is, perforce, an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Caraballo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203673\"><a href=\"/opinion/203673/united-states-v-caraballo/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The appellant does not challenge the length of the prison sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release; instead, he challenges only the imposition of yet another term of supervised release. Under the advisory sentencing guidelines, a reviewing court must look at both the procedural and the substantive propriety of a challenged sentence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Carrasco-De-Jesus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204099\"><a href=\"/opinion/204099/united-states-v-carrasco-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2009). If a concern that a state will fail adequately to punish a defendant on an unrelated charge is an impermissible sentencing factor, the sentence must be vacated as a matter of law.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The relevant statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3), permits imposition of a term of imprisonment upon revocation of a term of supervised release; a different subsection of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(h), permits a term of supervised release to be imposed in addition to the term of imprisonment. As subsection (h) does not list the factors to be considered in imposing a term of supervised release as part of a revocation sentence, it is a reasonable inference that the factors are the same as those to be considered in imposing an initial term of supervised release. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c), cross-referencing to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (listing factors to be considered in imposing a sentence).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> The factors to be considered under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c) include the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the offender; the need to afford adequate deterrence; the need to protect the public from further crimes; the need to provide the offender with training, care, or treatment; the guidelines and any pertinent policy statement(s); the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity; and the need to effect restitution. These statutes provide guidance  but not absolute certitude  as to what factors should be considered.</p>\n<p>It is clear from the transcript of the sentencing hearing in the case at hand that most of the enumerated factors were not considered. The district court did consider the advisory guideline range to the extent that the sentence did not exceed it. Nonetheless, Chapter Seven of the guidelines expresses the Sentencing Commission's view that sentences upon revocation of supervised release are intended to punish the breach of trust that the violation represents. Here, the nature of the violation  a breach of trust signified by failure to report  was not even mentioned by the sentencing court. Instead, the focus of the hearing was strictly and solely on condign punishment for the appellant's murder case. Had the murders been committed during the original period of supervised release, these crimes would appropriately have factored into the revocation sentence. But, the murders were committed before the appellant was imprisoned on the federal firearms charge and, a fortiori, before the imposition of the first supervised release term occurred. Thus, the revocation of supervised release bore no conceivable relationship to the murders, and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>As we noted above, this case presents a question of first impression. Most likely, the paucity of cases on point stands as a testament to the fact that the federal district courts, when faced with the need to sentence a defendant upon revocation of supervised release, seldom rely upon impermissible factors in reaching sentencing decisions. We have, however, found a handful of cases addressing impermissible sentencing factors.</p>\n<p>The most notable is <i>United States v.
