Andrews for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                           November 4, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           Schwarzer, Senior District Judge.              James D. McInnis\n\nappeals from a judgment revoking supervised release and imposing a\n\nsentence of twenty-four months’ imprisonment. He contends that the\n\nsentence, imposed after the court found violations of numerous\n\nrelease conditions, was unreasonable and that the district court\n\nerred in rejecting his claim of immunity based on an alleged\n\npromise from a Deputy United States Marshal who arrested him.               For\n\nthe reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment and sentence.\n\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n           On January 29, 2002, McInnis pled guilty to offenses\n\nrelated       to       the      distribution        of    cocaine         base.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841 (2000).            Based on his plea, McInnis faced a\n\npossible sentence of up to twenty years. § 841(b)(1)(C). However,\n\nin   response    to    the   government’s    departure   motion,   the    court\n\nsentenced McInnis to twelve months in prison to be followed by\n\nthree years of supervised release.\n\n           McInnis initially complied with the conditions of his\n\nrelease.     In early 2004, however, McInnis committed a string of\n\nviolations      that   resulted   in   revocation   of   his   release.      In\n\nMarch 2004, McInnis changed residences without providing ten days’\n\nadvance notice to his probation officer. On July 26, 2004, McInnis\n\nfailed to report to the Probation Office as instructed.              When he\n\nreported one day late, McInnis tested positive for cocaine.               After\n\ninitially denying cocaine use, McInnis admitted to using cocaine on\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthree   occasions     in    the    preceding      two    weeks.      On    August   19,\n\nMcInnis’s probation officer instructed him to report for six months\n\nof community confinement.              McInnis reported as instructed but left\n\nlater that day and failed to return; he had not commenced his\n\nprogram at the time of his arrest.\n\n            On September 16, deputy marshals arrested McInnis.                      The\n\ndeputies had reason to believe McInnis possessed a significant\n\nquantity of marijuana and questioned him and others at the site of\n\nhis   arrest    as   to    its    location.       McInnis      eventually     directed\n\nofficials to the location of over one pound of marijuana hidden in\n\nhis residence.       Upon questioning by an agent, McInnis confirmed\n\nthat the marijuana was his and stated that it was for personal use.\n\nThe agent found the approximate weight of the drugs and packaging\n\nto be one pound four ounces.\n\n            On September 17, McInnis’s probation officer filed an\n\namended   revocation        petition       alleging     five     violations    of   his\n\nsupervised     release:          (1)    failure   to    answer    inquiries    by   his\n\nprobation officer truthfully and follow the instructions of the\n\nprobation      officer     to     submit     to   drug     tests     and    community\n\nconfinement; (2) failure to report a new address prior to changing\n\nresidences; (3) possession of cocaine and marijuana; (4) commission\n\nof a federal crime by possessing cocaine and a state crime by\n\npossessing and presumptively trafficking more than one pound of\n\nmarijuana; and (5) failure to fulfill his community confinement\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fterm.\n\n           McInnis admitted all of these violations except the\n\nfourth.    Specifically, he contested the state drug trafficking\n\ncharge on two grounds.          First, McInnis argued that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence that he engaged in drug trafficking, which\n\nwould make his a Grade A violation of his supervised release.\n\nU.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINE MANUAL § 7B1.1(a)(1)(2004). Maine law permits\n\na presumption of drug trafficking when the defendant possesses over\n\none pound of marijuana.     ME . REV . STAT . ANN . tit. 17-A, § 1103(3)(A)\n\n(2004).   McInnis claimed that law enforcement officials’ lack of\n\nprecision in measuring drug quantity made it impossible to find\n\npossession of a pound of drugs beyond a reasonable doubt, the\n\nevidentiary   standard    for    a   conviction   under   Maine   Rule   of\n\nEvidence 303 (2004). Second, McInnis claimed that a deputy marshal\n\nmade a promise, which the deputy denied, that he would not be\n\nprosecuted if he disclosed the location of any drugs in his\n\npossession and that this promise barred the finding of trafficking.\n\nIf the drug trafficking violation failed on either ground, McInnis\n\ncontends, the court could not find his violation to have been\n\ngreater than Grade C, carrying a lower advisory guideline range.\n\nU.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL § 7B1.4.\n\n           Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\nrejected the immunity claim, both because the court found the\n\ndeputy’s denial credible and because, in any event, the deputy\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\flacked authority to make such a promise.        The court further found\n\nby a preponderance of evidence that McInnis possessed over one\n\npound of marijuana with intent to distribute and that this conduct\n\nviolated the conditions of supervised release as a Class C felony\n\nunder Maine State Law punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.\n\nME. REV. STAT . ANN . tit. 17-A, § 1103(3)(A).      Because of the five\n\nyear possible punishment under Maine law, under federal law the\n\nMaine crime would amount to a Grade A violation of the terms of\n\nsupervised release.    U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINE MANUAL § 7B1.1   The court\n\ntherefore correctly concluded that the violation was a Grade A\n\nviolation and revoked supervised release.\n\n          At a subsequent sentencing hearing the court advised that\n\nit had carefully considered the history and background of the case,\n\nthe papers on file, and what it had heard in the proceedings, as\n\nwell as the advisory Guideline range and the statutory maximum of\n\ntwenty-four months. The court concluded that an additional term of\n\nsupervised   release   was   not   appropriate     and   that     McInnis’s\n\nviolations warranted a more severe sentence, and it imposed a\n\nsentence of twenty-four months.\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nI.   VALIDITY OF THE SENTENCE\n\n          Because McInnis does not challenge the revocation of his\n\nsupervised release, the only issue before us is the challenge to\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fhis    sentence.         We   review   revocation        sentences    for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Ramirez-Rivera, 241 F.3d 37, 40-41\n\n(1st       Cir.    2001).1    United     States    v.    Booker,     promulgating     a\n\nreasonableness         standard    for    review        of   Guideline      sentencing\n\ndecisions, is not relevant to the present case.                  See ___ U.S. ___,\n\n____, 125 S. Ct. 738, 756-57 (2005).              The procedure for revocation\n\nof supervised release and imposition of a prison term is governed,\n\nnot by the sentencing guidelines, but by 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e).\n\nUnited States v. Work, 409 F.3d 484, 490 (1st Cir. 2005).                        That\n\nsection cabins the term of incarceration permitted in consequence\n\nof a supervised release violation with reference to the offense of\n\nconviction. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3); Work, 409 F.3d at 490.\n\n                  McInnis makes no attempt to challenge his twenty-four\n\nmonth sentence as an abuse of discretion.                    He contends that the\n\nsentence was unreasonable, in essence making two points: (1) that\n\nhis case lacks the aggravating factors found in other cases and (2)\n\nthat “the sentence was meant to punish his Sixth Amendment right to\n\nhearing.” The arguments are not persuasive.                   The district court,\n\nafter hearing argument from counsel and considering the history of\n\nthis case and the record of violations in this case, concluded that\n\nMcInnis would not benefit from an additional period of supervised\n\n\n\n       1\n      As   this    court   pointed    out   in    Ramirez-Rivera,\n241 F.3d at 40 n.4, the courts of appeals have not characterized\nthe scope of review in an entirely consistent fashion, though all\nagree upon a deferential standard of appellate review.\n\n                                          -6-\n\frelease.    Rather, McInnis’s recent drug-related activity suggested\n\nthat his continued freedom posed a threat to the community.             And\n\nnothing in the record supports the contention, raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal, that the sentence was punitive.          In sum, applying\n\nthe appropriate standard of review, we find no abuse of discretion.\n\n            McInnis advances a series of arguments in an effort to\n\nshow that the district court’s finding of a Grade A violation was\n\nin error.     While the nature of the crime upon which one count of\n\nrevocation is based may have some relevance to whether a revocation\n\nsentence is an abuse of discretion, the validity of the sentence\n\ndoes not turn on it, particularly on the facts here.           See United\n\nStates v. Tapia-Escalera, 356 F.3d 181, 185 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(distinguishing grades of supervised-release violations from the\n\nfelony     classification   scheme    for   sentencing    purposes   under\n\n§   3559(a)).     Section   3583(e)    authorizes   the    revocation   of\n\nsupervised release and imposition of sentence upon consideration of\n\nthe relevant factors in § 3553.       Pursuant to § 3553(a)(4)(B), the\n\ncourt need only consider, not implement, the advisory sentence\n\nrange provided in the guidelines’ policy statements.2           See Work,\n\n409 F.3d at 489; United States v. O’Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 301 n.11\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).      The statutory maximum, based on the original\n\noffense rather than the grade of release violation, ultimately\n\n\n\n      2\n      McInnis concedes on brief that the court considered the\npolicy statements.\n\n                                     -7-\n\flimits        the        court’s          sentencing           discretion.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3). McInnis pled guilty to distribution of\n\ncocaine base and aiding and abetting that crime, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. § 2, a Class C\n\nfelony.     18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(3) (explaining Grade C sentence\n\nclassification).       Section 3583(e)(3) authorizes a sentence of two\n\nyears when the offense was a Class C felony, and that was the\n\nsentence the court imposed.\n\nII.   CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENTIONS\n\n            McInnis raises (for the first time on appeal) three\n\nconstitutional arguments challenging his sentence.               Plain error\n\nreview applies.       United States v. D’Amario, III, 412 F.3d 253, 256\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).       These arguments are readily disposed of.\n\n            McInnis argues that the district court imposed a more\n\nsevere revocation sentence as punishment for the exercise of his\n\nSixth     Amendment    right   to   a    hearing   regarding    his   release\n\nviolations.    While the district court questioned McInnis’s motives\n\nin challenging his fourth, and most severe, violation, there is, as\n\nnoted above, no evidence to suggest that the hearing was a factor\n\nin the court’s sentencing.          The court gave a number of reasons\n\nsufficient to justify McInnis’s revocation sentence.            There was no\n\nSixth Amendment error.\n\n            McInnis further contends that the court’s revocation of\n\nhis release is a sentence enhancement based upon an unproven\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fcriminal record, raising Sixth Amendment concerns.                   He argues that\n\nthis    circuit        should      abandon     its    treatment      of   recidivist\n\nenhancements based upon what he labels the “doomed” status of\n\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998).                        This\n\ncourt, however, continues to be bound by Almendarez-Torres.                      See\n\nWork,    409    F.3d    at   491    n.1;     United   States    v.   Gomez-Estrada,\n\n273 F.3d 400, 401 (1st Cir. 2001) (“we deem ourselves bound to\n\nfollow the holding in Almendarez-Torres unless and until the\n\nSupreme Court abrogates that decision”); United States v. Terry,\n\n240 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2001) (“until Almendarez-Torres is\n\noverruled, we are bound by it”).              As McInnis concedes in his brief,\n\nhis argument fails as long as Almendarez-Torres remains a viable\n\nprecedent.\n\n               Finally, McInnis claims that his post-revocation sentence\n\nraises double jeopardy concerns under the Fifth Amendment either\n\nfor    the   original     offense     or     the   subsequent     violation.     His\n\narguments are without merit.                 First, § 3583(e) directs courts\n\nconsidering revocation sanctions to consider the class of offense\n\nresponsible for the original sentence.                  See Tapia-Escalera, 356\n\nF.3d at 185.       Although the punishment imposed in response to the\n\nrelease violations is in addition to prior punishment, it is\n\ntreated as part of the penalty for the initial offense, thus\n\nobviating double jeopardy concerns.                   Johnson v. United States,\n\n529 U.S. 694, 699-700 (2000). In addition, McInnis argues that his\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\frevocation sentence punishes him twice for his cocaine use for\n\nwhich he was referred to community confinement.                    His revocation\n\nsentence, however, was based, among other things, on his later\n\npossession of marijuana.\n\nIII. IMMUNITY PROMISE\n\n          Finally, McInnis challenges his revocation sentence on\n\nthe strength of his claim that a deputy marshal promised him that,\n\nfor disclosing the location of the marijuana, he would not be\n\nprosecuted.         The   district    court       was   entitled   to   disbelieve\n\ntestimony given by McInnis’s girlfriend and other friends of\n\nMcInnis which was squarely contradicted by the deputy’s testimony.\n\nSee United States v. Whalen, 82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(stressing    the    difficulty      of    upsetting     on   appeal    credibility\n\ndeterminations by a fact-finder).                But even if the deputy had made\n\nsuch a promise, it would lack legal significance for lack of\n\nauthority to offer such immunity.                 See United States v. Flemmi,\n\n225 F.3d 78, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2000) (requiring a specific source of\n\nauthority for granting immunity).                   The Marshal Service is an\n\ninvestigatory arm of the Department of Justice, not a prosecutorial\n\nagency.   It lacks authority deriving from its investigatory role,\n\neven when operating in conjunction with probation officers, to make\n\npromises to suspects binding on the United States Attorney.                     As\n\nthis court explained in Flemmi, “the power to investigate does not\n\nnecessarily encompass (or even reasonably imply) the power to grant\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fuse immunity.”   225 F.3d at 87.   McInnis has failed to identify a\n\nsource of authority for the deputy to make a promise of immunity.\n\n\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment and\n\nsentence of the district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

McInnis eventually directed officials to the location of over one pound of marijuana hidden in his residence. Upon questioning by an agent, McInnis confirmed that the marijuana was his and stated that it was for personal use. The agent found the approximate weight of the drugs and packaging to be one pound four ounces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, McInnis's probation officer filed an amended revocation petition alleging five violations of his supervised release: (1) failure to answer inquiries by his probation officer truthfully and follow the instructions of the probation officer to submit to drug tests and community confinement; (2) failure to report a new address prior to changing residences; (3) possession of cocaine and marijuana; (4) commission of a federal crime by possessing cocaine and a state crime by possessing and presumptively trafficking more than one pound of marijuana; and (5) failure to fulfill his community confinement term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis admitted all of these violations except the fourth. Specifically, he contested the state drug trafficking charge on two grounds. First, McInnis argued that there was insufficient evidence that he engaged in drug trafficking, which would make his a Grade A violation of his supervised release. U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINE MANUAL &#167; 7B1.1(a)(1)(2004). Maine law permits a presumption of drug trafficking when the defendant possesses over one pound of marijuana. ME.REV.STAT. ANN. tit. 17-A, &#167; 1103(3)(A) (2004). McInnis claimed that law enforcement officials' lack of precision in measuring drug quantity made it impossible to find possession of a pound of drugs beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidentiary standard for a conviction under Maine Rule of Evidence 303 (2004). Second, McInnis claimed that a deputy marshal made a promise, which the deputy denied, that he would not be prosecuted if he disclosed the location of any drugs in his possession and that this promise barred the finding of trafficking. If the drug trafficking violation failed on either ground, McInnis contends, the court could not find his violation to have been greater than Grade C, carrying a lower advisory guideline range. U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL &#167; 7B1.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court rejected the immunity claim, both because the court found the deputy's denial credible and because, in any event, the deputy lacked authority to make such a promise. The court further found by a preponderance of evidence that McInnis possessed over one pound of marijuana with intent to distribute and that this conduct violated the conditions of supervised release as a Class C felony under Maine State Law punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. ME.REV.STAT. ANN. tit. 17-A, &#167; 1103(3)(A). Because of the five year possible punishment under Maine law, under federal law the Maine crime would amount to a Grade A violation of the terms of supervised release. U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINE MANUAL &#167; 7B1.1 The court therefore correctly concluded that the violation was a Grade A violation and revoked supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a subsequent sentencing hearing the court advised that it had carefully considered the history and background of the case, the papers on file, and what it had heard in the proceedings, as well as the advisory Guideline range and the statutory maximum of twenty-four months. The court concluded that an additional term of supervised release was not appropriate and that McInnis's violations warranted a more severe sentence, and it imposed a sentence of twenty-four months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. VALIDITY OF THE SENTENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because McInnis does not challenge the revocation of his supervised release, the only issue before us is the challenge to his sentence. We review revocation sentences for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Ramirez-Rivera,</i> 241 F.3d 37, 40-41 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>United States v. Booker,</i> promulgating a reasonableness standard for review of Guideline sentencing decisions, is not relevant to the present case. <i>See</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The procedure for revocation of supervised release and imposition of a prison term is governed, not by the sentencing guidelines, but by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e). <i>United States v. Work,</i> 409 F.3d 484, 490 (1st Cir.2005). That section cabins the term of incarceration permitted in consequence of a supervised release violation with reference to the offense of conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3); <i>Work,</i> 409 F.3d at 490.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis makes no attempt to challenge his twenty-four month sentence as an abuse of discretion. He contends that the sentence was unreasonable, in essence making two points: (1) that his case lacks the aggravating factors found in other cases and (2) that \"the sentence was meant to punish his Sixth Amendment right to hearing.\" The arguments are not persuasive. The district court, after hearing argument from counsel and considering the history of this case and the record of violations in this case, concluded that McInnis would not benefit from an additional period of supervised release. Rather, McInnis's recent drug-related activity suggested that his continued freedom posed a threat to the community. And nothing in the record supports the contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that the sentence was punitive. In sum, applying the appropriate standard of review, we find no abuse of discretion. McInnis advances a series of arguments in an effort to show that the district court's finding of a Grade A violation was in error. While the nature of the crime upon which one count of revocation is based may have some relevance to whether a revocation sentence is an abuse of discretion, the validity of the sentence does not turn on it, particularly on the facts here. <i>See United States v. Tapia-Escalera,</i> 356 F.3d 181, 185 n. 3 (1st Cir.2004) (distinguishing grades of supervised-release violations from the felony classification scheme for sentencing purposes under &#167; 3559(a)). Section 3583(e) authorizes the revocation of supervised release and imposition of sentence upon consideration of the relevant factors in &#167; 3553. Pursuant to &#167; 3553(a)(4)(B), the court need only consider, not implement, the advisory sentence range provided in the guidelines' policy statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Work,</i> 409 F.3d at 489; <i>United States v. O'Neil,</i> 11 F.3d 292, 301 n. 11 (1st Cir.1993). The statutory maximum, based on the original offense rather than the grade of release violation, ultimately limits the court's sentencing discretion. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). McInnis pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base and aiding and abetting that crime, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(3) (explaining Grade C sentence classification). Section 3583(e)(3) authorizes a sentence of two years when the offense was a Class C felony, and that was the sentence the court imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENTIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis raises (for the first time on appeal) three constitutional arguments challenging his sentence. Plain error review applies. <i>United States v. D'Amario, III,</i> 412 F.3d 253, 256 (1st Cir.2005). These arguments are readily disposed of.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis argues that the district court imposed a more severe revocation sentence as punishment for the exercise of his Sixth Amendment right to a hearing regarding his release violations. While the district court questioned McInnis's motives in challenging his fourth, and most severe, violation, there is, as noted above, no evidence to suggest that the hearing was a factor in the court's sentencing. The court gave a number of reasons sufficient to justify McInnis's revocation sentence. There was no Sixth Amendment error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis further contends that the court's revocation of his release is a sentence enhancement based upon an unproven criminal record, raising Sixth Amendment concerns. He argues that this circuit should abandon its treatment of recidivist enhancements based upon what he labels the \"doomed\" status of <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This court, however, continues to be bound by <i>Almendarez-Torres. See Work,</i> 409 F.3d at 491 n. 1; <i>United States v. Gomez-Estrada,</i> 273 F.3d 400, 401 (1st Cir.2001) (\"we deem ourselves bound to follow the holding in <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> unless and until the Supreme Court abrogates that decision\"); <i>United States v. Terry,</i> 240 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir.2001) (\"until <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> is overruled, we are bound by it\"). As McInnis concedes in his brief, his argument fails as long as <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> remains a viable precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McInnis claims that his post-revocation sentence raises double jeopardy concerns under the Fifth Amendment either for the original offense or the subsequent violation. His arguments are without merit. First, &#167; 3583(e) directs courts considering revocation sanctions to consider the class of offense responsible for the original sentence. <i>See Tapia-Escalera,</i> 356 F.3d at 185. Although the punishment imposed in response to the release violations is in addition to prior punishment, it is treated as part of the penalty for the initial offense, thus obviating double jeopardy concerns. <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 694, 699-700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). In addition, McInnis argues that his revocation sentence punishes him twice for his cocaine use for which he was referred to community confinement. His revocation sentence, however, was based, among other things, on his later possession of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. IMMUNITY PROMISE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McInnis challenges his revocation sentence on the strength of his claim that a deputy marshal promised him that, for disclosing the location of the marijuana, he would not be prosecuted. The district court was entitled to disbelieve testimony given by McInnis's girlfriend and other friends of McInnis which was squarely contradicted by the deputy's testimony. <i>See United States v. Whalen,</i> 82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir.1996) (stressing the difficulty of upsetting on appeal credibility determinations by a fact-finder). But even if the deputy had made such a promise, it would lack legal significance for lack of authority to offer such immunity. <i>See United States v. Flemmi,</i> 225 F.3d 78, 86-87 (1st Cir.2000) (requiring a specific source of authority for granting immunity). The Marshal Service is an investigatory arm of the Department of Justice, not a prosecutorial agency. It lacks authority deriving from its investigatory role, even when operating in conjunction with probation officers, to make promises to suspects binding on the United States Attorney. As this court explained in <i>Flemmi,</i> \"the power to investigate does not necessarily encompass (or even reasonably imply) the power to grant use immunity.\" 225 F.3d at 87. McInnis has failed to identify a source of authority for the deputy to make a promise of immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment and sentence of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As this court pointed out in<i>Ramirez-Rivera,</i> 241 F.3d at 40 n. 4, the courts of appeals have not characterized the scope of review in an entirely consistent fashion, though all agree upon a deferential standard of appellate review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> McInnis concedes on brief that the court considered the policy statements</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

McInnis appeals from a judgment revoking supervised release and imposing a sentence of twenty-four months' imprisonment. He contends that the sentence, imposed after the court found violations of numerous release conditions, was unreasonable and that the district court erred in rejecting his claim of immunity based on an alleged promise from a Deputy United States Marshal who arrested him. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 29, 2002, McInnis pled guilty to offenses related to the distribution of cocaine base. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 (2000). Based on his plea, McInnis faced a possible sentence of up to twenty years. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). However, in response to the government's departure motion, the court sentenced McInnis to twelve months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis initially complied with the conditions of his release. In early 2004, however, McInnis committed a string of violations that resulted in revocation of his release. In March 2004, McInnis changed residences without providing ten days' advance notice to his probation officer. On July 26, 2004, McInnis failed to report to the Probation Office as instructed. When he reported one day late, McInnis tested positive for cocaine. After initially denying cocaine use, McInnis admitted to using cocaine on three occasions in the preceding two weeks. On August 19, McInnis's probation officer instructed him to report for six months of community confinement. McInnis reported as instructed but left later that day and failed to return; he had not commenced his program at the time of his arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 16, deputy marshals arrested McInnis.

CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENTIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis raises (for the first time on appeal) three constitutional arguments challenging his sentence. Plain error review applies. <i>United States v. D'Amario, III,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201651\"><a href=\"/opinion/201651/united-states-v-damario/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 256 (1st Cir.2005). These arguments are readily disposed of.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis argues that the district court imposed a more severe revocation sentence as punishment for the exercise of his Sixth Amendment right to a hearing regarding his release violations. While the district court questioned McInnis's motives in challenging his fourth, and most severe, violation, there is, as noted above, no evidence to suggest that the hearing was a factor in the court's sentencing. The court gave a number of reasons sufficient to justify McInnis's revocation sentence. There was no Sixth Amendment error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McInnis further contends that the court's revocation of his release is a sentence enhancement based upon an unproven criminal record, raising Sixth Amendment concerns. He argues that this circuit should abandon its treatment of recidivist enhancements based upon what he labels the \"doomed\" status of <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (1998). This court, however, continues to be bound by <i>Almendarez-Torres. See Work,</i> 409 F.3d at 491 n. 1; <i>United States v. Gomez-Estrada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199694\"><a href=\"/opinion/199694/united-states-v-gomez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 401 (1st Cir.2001) (\"we deem ourselves bound to follow the holding in <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> unless and until the Supreme Court abrogates that decision\"); <i>United States v. Terry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772069\"><a href=\"/opinion/772069/united-states-v-kenneth-b-terry-aka-kenny-polo/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 73-74 (1st Cir.2001) (\"until <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> is overruled, we are bound by it\"). As McInnis concedes in his brief, his argument fails as long as <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> remains a viable precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McInnis claims that his post-revocation sentence raises double jeopardy concerns under the Fifth Amendment either for the original offense or the subsequent violation. His arguments are without merit. First, &#167; 3583(e) directs courts considering revocation sanctions to consider the class of offense responsible for the original sentence. <i>See Tapia-Escalera,</i> 356 F.3d at 185. Although the punishment imposed in response to the release violations is in addition to prior punishment, it is treated as part of the penalty for the initial offense, thus obviating double jeopardy concerns. <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118364\"><a href=\"/opinion/118364/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, 699-700, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118364\"><a href=\"/opinion/118364/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1795</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118364\"><a href=\"/opinion/118364/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span> (2000). In addition, McInnis argues that his revocation sentence punishes him twice for his cocaine use for which he was referred to community confinement. His revocation sentence, however, was based, among other things, on his later possession of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. IMMUNITY PROMISE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McInnis challenges his revocation sentence on the strength of his claim that a deputy marshal promised him that, for disclosing the location of the marijuana, he would not be prosecuted. The district court was entitled to disbelieve testimony given by McInnis's girlfriend and other friends of McInnis which was squarely contradicted by the deputy's testimony. <i>See United States v. Whalen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196726\"><a href=\"/opinion/196726/united-states-v-whalen/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 532 (1st Cir.1996) (stressing the difficulty of upsetting on appeal credibility determinations by a fact-finder). But even if the deputy had made such a promise, it would lack legal significance for lack of authority to offer such immunity. <i>See United States v. Flemmi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770242\"><a href=\"/opinion/770242/united-states-v-stephen-j-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 86-87 (1st Cir.2000) (requiring a specific source of authority for granting immunity). The Marshal Service is an investigatory arm of the Department of Justice, not a prosecutorial agency. It lacks authority deriving from its investigatory role, even when operating in conjunction with probation officers, to make promises to suspects binding on the United States Attorney. As this court explained in <i>Flemmi,</i> \"the power to investigate does not necessarily encompass (or even reasonably imply) the power to grant use immunity.\" 225 F.3d at 87. McInnis has failed to identify a source of authority for the deputy to make a promise of immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment and sentence of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As this court pointed out in<i>Ramirez-Rivera,</i> 241 F.3d at 40 n. 4, the courts of appeals have not characterized the scope of review in an entirely consistent fashion, though all agree upon a deferential standard of appellate review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> McInnis concedes on brief that the court considered the policy statements</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
