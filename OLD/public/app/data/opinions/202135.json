Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Jonathan R. Saxe, Assistant Federal Public Defender, Federal\nDefender Office, for appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, for\nappellee. Peter E. Papps, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 6, 2006\n\f           BOUDIN,   Chief   Judge.       In   this   appeal,    Miguel       Saez\n\nchallenges   the   refusal   of   the   federal     district    court    in    New\n\nHampshire to sentence him below the guideline range. The principal\n\nbasis urged by Saez for a below-guideline sentence is his claim\n\nthat another judge in the same district court gave a shorter\n\nsentence to another defendant, Gay Finley, who had been involved in\n\nthe same criminal conduct as Saez.        The history is as follows.\n\n           In 2002 or 2003, Saez met Finley in a halfway house in\n\nManchester, New Hampshire, after both had been released from\n\nprison; they moved in together after completing their terms at the\n\nhalfway house and soon afterwards started using and selling heroin.\n\nThe two were arrested in November 2003 after having sold heroin on\n\ntwo consecutive days to a cooperating informant for the Manchester\n\npolice department.\n\n           Finley confessed her guilt and agreed to assist the\n\ngovernment, but she first said (falsely) that Saez was not involved\n\nin the drug dealing.    Confronted with audio tapes of the two drug\n\ntransactions, Finley recanted her denial of Saez' involvement and\n\ncooperated truthfully with the government. She pled guilty in June\n\n2004 to one count of distribution of heroin, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\n(2000).   On February 22, 2005, Judge Steven J. McAuliffe sentenced\n\nher to 39 months in prison.\n\n           Finley qualified as a career offender, see United States\n\nSentencing    Guidelines     (\"U.S.S.G.\")       §     4B1.1    (2005);        this\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcategorization applies to one who is convicted of a felony that is\n\neither a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, and has at\n\nleast twice before been convicted for such crimes, see id. §\n\n4B1.1(a).    Her career offender status automatically placed Finley\n\nin the highest criminal history category and made her subject to a\n\nhigher offense level than would otherwise be applicable.           Id. §\n\n4B1.1(b).\n\n            In Finley's case, her resulting guideline range (after\n\ncertain adjustments were made) was 84 to 105 months.          This range\n\nseems to reflect Finley's assistance to the government (which\n\nrecommended    a   six-level   downward   departure    for   substantial\n\nassistance, U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1) and Finley's claim that her \"criminal\n\nhistory category substantially over-represents the seriousness of\n\n[her] criminal history,\" id. § 4A1.3(b)(1).           In any event, her\n\nsentence of 39 months was expressly framed as a non-guideline\n\nsentence under the post-Booker regime.\n\n            Miguel Saez pled guilty in March 2005, before a different\n\njudge of the same court, Judge Paul J. Barbadoro, to one count of\n\naiding and abetting the distribution of heroin.              21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2 (2000).      Saez also qualified as\n\na career offender, see U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, and the amount of drugs\n\nattributed to him for sentencing purposes was 0.71 grams of heroin.\n\nJudge Barbadoro imposed on Saez a sentence of 130 months.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f             Saez' sentence was at the bottom of the applicable\n\nguideline range after the court applied a three-level downward\n\nadjustment for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, and\n\na   two-level      downward    adjustment     for    rendering    \"substantial\n\nassistance\" to federal authorities (which defense counsel agreed at\n\nthe sentencing hearing was a fair adjustment), see id. § 5K1.1.\n\nSaez argued for a lower, non-guideline sentence based on the small\n\namount of drugs in the count to which he pled and the lower\n\nsentence imposed on Finley.          Judge Barbadoro refused and Saez has\n\nnow appealed.\n\n             The   framework   for    assessing     sentences    imposed   after\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), has been set forth in\n\nour en banc decision in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, --- F.3d\n\n---, 2006 WL 562154 (1st Cir. Mar. 9, 2006).              There we concluded\n\nthat   the   guideline    range,     taking   applicable    departures      into\n\naccount, is the starting point for analysis but that the proponent\n\nof a higher or lower sentence is free to adduce reasons and facts\n\nto support it.      Jiménez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154, at *3.          On appeal,\n\nthe primary issues will ordinarily be whether the sentence is\n\nreasonable and adequately explained, taking account both of the\n\nguidelines and of other statutory factors.             Id. at *3-*4.\n\n             Whether the ultimate sentence is within or without the\n\nguideline range, an appeal urging unreasonableness is permitted,\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154, at *2, as are claims that the court\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ferred on the law or the facts, United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d\n\n31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005).       The government in this case argues that a\n\nsentence    within    the    guidelines     can     never    be   regarded    as\n\nunreasonable. We have rejected that position, Jiménez-Beltre, 2006\n\nWL 562154, at *2, which (whatever the theoretical claims in its\n\nfavor) is contrary to explicit language in Booker.             See 543 U.S. at\n\n260-61.\n\n            Saez says that it was unreasonable to give him a 130-\n\nmonth sentence while Finley, also a career offender involved in the\n\nsame drug transaction, received only 39 months from a different\n\njudge.    Relatedly, he contends that the district court \"refus[ed]\n\nto consider the sentence imposed upon Finley\" when calculating his\n\nsentence,    and    thus    failed   to   consider    \"the    need     to   avoid\n\nunwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar\n\nrecords who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(6).\n\n            The    first   problem   with   Saez'    argument     is   that   the\n\ndistrict court did not \"refus[e] to consider\" Finley's sentence in\n\nconnection with Saez' sentencing, but rather determined that Saez\n\nhad not provided enough information to the court to enable it to\n\nmake a meaningful comparison of the two defendants, even if it had\n\nbeen inclined to do so.          \"In a case in which within the same\n\nconspiracy I'm sentencing both defendants,\" explained the judge at\n\nthe sentencing hearing,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          I hope that I would at least articulate for a\n          defendant why one got a different sentence\n          from the other, but I don't even need to do\n          that here because I don't know anything about\n          that case except for a very limited amount of\n          information that's in [Saez' presentence\n          investigation report] and what you and [the\n          Assistant United States Attorney] ha[ve] told\n          me.\n\n                                    * * *\n\n          I would be abdicating the responsibilities I\n          have as the sentencing judge in this case if I\n          were to simply take a sentence that another\n          judge gave and use that as a baseline to\n          either move up from it or down from it. As I\n          said, I can't engage in that kind of analysis,\n          if for no other reason [than] that I simply\n          don't have enough information to make an\n          independent assessment as to whether I would\n          have given that defendant the same sentence, I\n          don't know.\n\n          \"[T]he proponent of a factor that would work in the\n\nproponent's   favor   has   to   provide   the   basis   to   support   it.\"\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 2006 WL 562154, at *4 (citing United States v.\n\nDerbes, 369 F.3d 579, 582 (1st Cir. 2004)).          Judge Barbadoro had\n\ndetailed information about the drug crime to which both Saez and\n\nFinley pled guilty in this instance, but he had little basis for\n\ncomparing Finley's criminal history with that of Saez beyond the\n\nbare fact that both qualified as career offenders.\n\n          Saez conceded in the district court (as he does on\n\nappeal) that his record was \"more serious\" than Finley's; yet he\n\noffered no details as to how the two defendants' records differed,\n\nsaying only that giving him 51 months would account for the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fdifference.        Thus, one of the two main variables in sentencing--\n\ncriminal history--may well have been quite different.                    No valid\n\ncomparison of sentences could be made without that information.\n\n             As it happens, we know that Judge McAuliffe found that\n\nFinley's     own    career   offender    status   overstated     her     criminal\n\nhistory. One reason, it appears, is that one of Finley's predicate\n\noffenses under the career offender guideline was a failure to\n\nreturn to a halfway house on time; although this might be treated\n\nas a violent felony under First Circuit precedent, cf. United\n\nStates v. Winn, 364 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2004), it is obviously a\n\npretty tame piece of conduct.\n\n             Conversely, Saez' record was indeed more \"serious\" than\n\nFinley's.      According     to   the   presentence     investigation      report\n\n(\"PSR\"), to which Saez did not object, Saez had previously been\n\nconvicted for distribution of cocaine, first degree assault, and\n\nmultiple drug possession crimes, including one count of possession\n\nwhile armed with a firearm.\n\n             As to cooperation, Finley and Saez each told lies; but\n\nFinley admitted her guilt and sought to protect Saez.                    Saez, by\n\ncontrast, asked that the federal charges against him be dropped\n\nbased   on   Finley's    false    exculpation     of   him   (although    he   did\n\neventually send a letter to Finley urging her to \"come clean\" to\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\ffederal    investigators).1    In    the   end,   Finley   assisted   the\n\ngovernment by cooperating as to Saez; Saez, who faced both Finley's\n\ncooperation and an audio tape showing him as a participant, had\n\nlittle choice but to plead guilty--for which he received a three-\n\nlevel downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and two\n\nmore levels as a departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.\n\n           There is a more basic difficulty with Saez' argument\n\nwhich would remain even if he and Finley looked more alike than\n\nthey do.   Congress did aim to reduce the unwarranted disparity in\n\nsentencing for like crimes and criminals.         See United States v.\n\nWogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 969\n\n(1991); United States v. Carr, 932 F.2d 67, 73 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 502 U.S. 834 (1991).    But the aim was almost certainly a\n\nnational uniformity focusing upon a common standard and looking to\n\nhow most cases of the same kind were treated.        See, e.g., Wogan,\n\n938 F.2d at 1449.2\n\n\n     1\n      The prosecutor regarded the letter as being to Saez' credit,\nbut it appears that the letter was sent after it had been\ndetermined that Finley was lying and after the audio tapes of the\ndrug transactions had been furnished to Saez' counsel.\n     2\n      Numerous   other   federal  circuits   have   endorsed   this\ninterpretation of federal sentencing legislation.       See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Newsom, 428 F.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir. 2005), cert.\ndenied, 126 S. Ct. 1455 (2006); United States v. Gallegos, 129 F.3d\n1140, 1143 (10th Cir. 1997); United States v. Hall, 977 F.2d 861,\n863-64 & n.4 (4th Cir. 1992); United States v. LaSalle, 948 F.2d\n215, 218 (6th Cir. 1991); United States v. Joyner, 924 F.2d 454,\n460-61 (2d Cir. 1991). But cf. United States v. McGee, 408 F.3d\n966, 988 (7th Cir. 2005) (suggesting that the district court might\non remand take into account sentences imposed, apparently by the\n\n                                    -8-\n\f            Usually little is to be learned about national uniformity\n\nby pointing to the sentence of one other defendant.              Of course, if\n\nthe same judge sentences two identically situated defendants to\n\nsubstantially         different   terms,   some    explanation   may   well   be\n\nrequired; uniformity aside, the basic requirement of rationality\n\nremains. But with different judges sentencing two defendants quite\n\ndifferently, there is no more reason to think that the first one\n\nwas right than the second.\n\n            The practical objections are also considerable. A single\n\njudge sentencing two defendants for the same offense has the\n\ninformation before him and knows his own reasoning.              By contrast,\n\nto   make   a    valid    comparison    between    defendants    sentenced    by\n\ndifferent judges is far more difficult, as this case illustrates.\n\nFurther, such a comparison opens the door to endless rummaging by\n\nlawyers through sentences in other cases, each side finding random\n\nexamples to support a higher or lower sentence, as their clients'\n\ninterests dictate.\n\n            At the present time, the guidelines themselves are almost\n\ncertainly the best indication of ordinary practice since most\n\nsentences       are   within   the   guidelines.      See   United   States   v.\n\nBoscarino, 437 F.3d 634, 638 (7th Cir. 2006).               The guidelines are\n\nnot a perfect reflection of past practice, see Jiménez-Beltre, 2006\n\nWL 562154, at *3, and other sources of information about national\n\n\nsame judge, on a defendant's co-conspirators).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fsentencing may be available.      But in this context a single example\n\nis about the weakest sort of proof of national practice that can be\n\nimagined.\n\n            Finally, Saez says a lower sentence is reasonable in\n\nlight of the very small amount of drugs involved in the transaction\n\nto which he pled guilty.       Of course, his guideline range already\n\ntook the reduced quantity into account.          Nevertheless, it might be\n\nargued that the quantity could still be relevant--a point we have\n\nnot decided.     See United States v. Morin, 403 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n            As it happens, the record indicates that Saez and Finley\n\nhad been regularly dealing drugs since they left the halfway house.\n\nIn fact, as Saez' PSR makes clear, he has been involved with drugs,\n\nincluding both possession and dealing, for virtually all the\n\nperiods   over    the   last   fifteen   years    that   he   has   not   been\n\nincarcerated.     In any event, the district judge was not obliged to\n\ngive a lower sentence because of the quantity.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Derbes,</i> 369 F.3d 579, 582 (1st Cir.2004)). Judge Barbadoro had detailed information about the drug crime to which both Saez and Finley pled guilty in this instance, but he had little basis for comparing Finley's criminal history with that of Saez beyond the bare fact that both qualified as career offenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saez conceded in the district court (as he does on appeal) that his record was \"more serious\" than Finley's; yet he offered no details as to <i>how</i> the two defendants' records differed, saying only that giving him 51 months would account for the difference. Thus, one of the two main variables in sentencing &#8212; criminal history &#8212; may well have been quite different. No valid comparison of sentences could be made without that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, we know that Judge McAuliffe found that Finley's own career offender status overstated her criminal history. One reason, it appears, is that one of Finley's predicate offenses under the career offender guideline was a failure to return to a halfway house on time; although this <i>might</i> be treated as a violent felony under First Circuit precedent, <i>cf. United States v. Winn,</i> 364 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.2004), it is obviously a pretty tame piece of conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, Saez' record was indeed more \"serious\" than Finley's. According to the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\"), to which Saez did not object, Saez had previously been convicted for distribution of cocaine, first degree assault, and multiple drug possession crimes, including one count of possession while armed with a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to cooperation, Finley and Saez each told lies; but Finley admitted her guilt and sought to protect Saez. Saez, by contrast, asked that the federal charges against him be dropped based on Finley's false exculpation of him (although he did eventually send a letter to Finley urging her to \"come clean\" to federal investigators).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In the end, Finley assisted the government by cooperating as to Saez; Saez, who faced both Finley's cooperation and an audio tape showing him as a participant, had little choice but to plead guilty &#8212; for which he received a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility <i>and</i> two more levels as a departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a more basic difficulty with Saez' argument which would remain even if he and Finley looked more alike than they do. Congress did aim to reduce the unwarranted disparity in sentencing for like crimes and criminals. <i>See United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 969, 112 S.Ct. 441, 116 L.Ed.2d 460 (1991); <i>United States v. Carr,</i> 932 F.2d 67, 73 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 502 U.S. 834, 112 S.Ct. 112, 116 L.Ed.2d 82 (1991). But the aim was almost certainly a <i>national</i> uniformity focusing upon a common standard and looking to how <i>most</i> cases of the same kind were treated. <i>See, e.g., Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d at 1449.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Usually little is to be learned about <i>national</i> uniformity by pointing to the sentence of <i>one</i> other defendant. Of course, if the same judge sentences two identically situated defendants to substantially different terms, some explanation may well be required; uniformity aside, the basic requirement of rationality remains. But with different judges sentencing two defendants quite differently, there is no more reason to think that the first one was right than the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The practical objections are also considerable. A single judge sentencing two defendants for the same offense has the information before him and knows his own reasoning. By contrast, to make a valid comparison between defendants sentenced by different judges is far more difficult, as this case illustrates. Further, such a comparison opens the door to endless rummaging by lawyers through sentences in other cases, each side finding random examples to support a higher or lower sentence, as their clients' interests dictate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the present time, the guidelines themselves are almost certainly the best indication of ordinary practice since most sentences are within the guidelines. <i>See United States v. Boscarino,</i> 437 F.3d 634, 638 (7th Cir.2006). The guidelines are not a perfect reflection of past practice, see <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518, and other sources of information about national sentencing may be available. But in this context a single example is about the weakest sort of proof of national practice that can be imagined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Saez says a lower sentence is reasonable in light of the very small amount of drugs involved in the transaction to which he pled guilty. Of course, his guideline range already took the reduced quantity into account. Nevertheless, it might be argued that the quantity could still be relevant &#8212; a point we have not decided. <i>See United States v. Morin,</i> 403 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, the record indicates that Saez and Finley had been regularly dealing drugs since they left the halfway house. In fact, as Saez' PSR makes clear, he has been involved with drugs, including both possession and dealing, for virtually all the periods over the last fifteen years that he has not been incarcerated. In any event, the district judge was not obliged to give a lower sentence because of the quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The prosecutor regarded the letter as being to Saez' credit, but it appears that the letter was sent after it had been determined that Finley was lying and after the audio tapes of the drug transactions had been furnished to Saez' counsel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Numerous other federal circuits have endorsed this interpretation of federal sentencing legislation<i>See, e.g., United States v.

The principal basis urged by Saez for a below-guideline sentence is his claim that another judge in the same district court gave a shorter sentence to another defendant, Gay Finley, who had been involved in the same criminal conduct as Saez. The history is as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2002 or 2003, Saez met Finley in a halfway house in Manchester, New Hampshire, after both had been released from prison; they moved in together after completing their terms at the halfway house and soon afterwards started using and selling heroin. The two were arrested in November 2003 after having sold heroin on two consecutive days to a cooperating informant for the Manchester police department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finley confessed her guilt and agreed to assist the government, but she first said (falsely) that Saez was not involved in the drug dealing. Confronted with audio tapes of the two drug transactions, Finley recanted her denial of Saez' involvement and cooperated truthfully with the government. She pled guilty in June 2004 to one count of distribution of heroin, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (2000). On February 22, 2005, Judge Steven J. McAuliffe sentenced her to 39 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finley qualified as a career offender, <i>see</i> United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 4B1.1 (2005); this categorization applies to one who is convicted of a felony that is either a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime, and has at least twice before been convicted for such crimes, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 4B1.1(a). Her career offender status automatically placed Finley in the highest criminal history category and made her subject to a higher offense level than would otherwise be applicable. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4B1.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Finley's case, her resulting guideline range (after certain adjustments were made) was 84 to 105 months. This range seems to reflect Finley's assistance to the government (which recommended a six-level downward departure for substantial assistance, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1) and Finley's claim that her \"criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of [her] criminal history,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 4A1.3(b)(1). In any event, her sentence of 39 months was expressly framed as a non-guideline sentence under the post-<i>Booker</i> regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miguel Saez pled guilty in March 2005, before a different judge of the same court, Judge Paul J.

Saez also qualified as a career offender, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, and the amount of drugs attributed to him for sentencing purposes was 0.71 grams of heroin.

According to the presentence investigation report (\"PSR\"), to which Saez did not object, Saez had previously been convicted for distribution of cocaine, first degree assault, and multiple drug possession crimes, including one count of possession while armed with a firearm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to cooperation, Finley and Saez each told lies; but Finley admitted her guilt and sought to protect Saez. Saez, by contrast, asked that the federal charges against him be dropped based on Finley's false exculpation of him (although he did eventually send a letter to Finley urging her to \"come clean\" to federal investigators).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In the end, Finley assisted the government by cooperating as to Saez; Saez, who faced both Finley's cooperation and an audio tape showing him as a participant, had little choice but to plead guilty &#8212; for which he received a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility <i>and</i> two more levels as a departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a more basic difficulty with Saez' argument which would remain even if he and Finley looked more alike than they do. Congress did aim to reduce the unwarranted disparity in sentencing for like crimes and criminals. <i>See United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1449 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></span> (1991); <i>United States v. Carr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560457\"><a href=\"/opinion/560457/united-states-v-terry-c-carr-and-mark-todd-carr/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></span> (1991). But the aim was almost certainly a <i>national</i> uniformity focusing upon a common standard and looking to how <i>most</i> cases of the same kind were treated. <i>See, e.g., Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d at 1449.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Usually little is to be learned about <i>national</i> uniformity by pointing to the sentence of <i>one</i> other defendant. Of course, if the same judge sentences two identically situated defendants to substantially different terms, some explanation may well be required; uniformity aside, the basic requirement of rationality remains. But with different judges sentencing two defendants quite differently, there is no more reason to think that the first one was right than the second.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The practical objections are also considerable. A single judge sentencing two defendants for the same offense has the information before him and knows his own reasoning. By contrast, to make a valid comparison between defendants sentenced by different judges is far more difficult, as this case illustrates. Further, such a comparison opens the door to endless rummaging by lawyers through sentences in other cases, each side finding random examples to support a higher or lower sentence, as their clients' interests dictate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the present time, the guidelines themselves are almost certainly the best indication of ordinary practice since most sentences are within the guidelines. <i>See United States v. Boscarino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793288\"><a href=\"/opinion/793288/united-states-v-nick-s-boscarino/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span>, 638 (7th Cir.2006). The guidelines are not a perfect reflection of past practice, see <i>Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518, and other sources of information about national sentencing may be available. But in this context a single example is about the weakest sort of proof of national practice that can be imagined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Saez says a lower sentence is reasonable in light of the very small amount of drugs involved in the transaction to which he pled guilty. Of course, his guideline range already took the reduced quantity into account. Nevertheless, it might be argued that the quantity could still be relevant &#8212; a point we have not decided. <i>See United States v. Morin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201525\"><a href=\"/opinion/201525/united-states-v-morin/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, the record indicates that Saez and Finley had been regularly dealing drugs since they left the halfway house. In fact, as Saez' PSR makes clear, he has been involved with drugs, including both possession and dealing, for virtually all the periods over the last fifteen years that he has not been incarcerated. In any event, the district judge was not obliged to give a lower sentence because of the quantity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The prosecutor regarded the letter as being to Saez' credit, but it appears that the letter was sent after it had been determined that Finley was lying and after the audio tapes of the drug transactions had been furnished to Saez' counsel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Numerous other federal circuits have endorsed this interpretation of federal sentencing legislation<i>See, e.g., United States v.
