Fletcher, of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.      Plaintiffs-appellants, Janet\n\nand Thomas Donovan (\"the Donovans\"), appeal from the district\n\ncourt's grant of judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants-\n\nappellees.1    After a thorough review of parties' briefs and the\n\nrecord, we affirm the district court's determination for the\n\nreasons stated below.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n            On June 14, 2000, the Donovans submitted an application\n\nto move their house on a public road in Haverhill.               The city\n\nresponded with a list of requirements that the Donovans would have\n\nto meet before the permit could issue, such as having the telephone\n\ncompany remove the wires along the route and obtaining a foundation\n\npermit.    Once the Donovans fulfilled these initial conditions, the\n\nDonovans    contend   that   Flaherty     and   Mayor   Rurak   added   new\n\nrequirements in bad faith. For example, Flaherty told the Donovans\n\nthat they would have to pay for the trimming of the trees along the\n\n4.4 miles of their move route, and that they would need police and\n\nfire department approval.         In addition, Mayor Rurak asked the\n\nHaverhill City Council to hold two hearings regarding the house\n\nmove.\n\n            On October 30, 2000, the Donovans filed an Emergency\n\nMotion for Injunctive Relief in Essex Superior Court to force Mayor\n\n\n1\n   Defendants include the city of Haverhill (\"Haverhill\"); the\nmayor of Haverhill, James Rurak (\"Mayor Rurak\"); and Haverhill's\npublic works director, James Flaherty (\"Flaherty\").\n\n                                    -2-\n\fRurak to issue the permit.         The court denied the claim as unripe.\n\nThen, on November 6, 2000, Mayor Rurak issued the permit, allowing\n\nthe Donovans to move their house on November 12-13, 2000.             Due to\n\nthe delay created by the additional conditions, the Donovans\n\nbrought multiple claims in Essex Superior Court against defendants,\n\nincluding violations of their right to travel on the public ways,\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, due process, and equal protection.           In addition,\n\nthey brought several state law claims.                Defendants removed to\n\nfederal district court and filed a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings, which the district court granted.\n\n                          II.   Standard of Review\n\n          We review Rule 12 dispositions de novo.              Rosa v. Park\n\nWest Bank & Trust Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215 (1st Cir. 2000).               This\n\nmeans   that   \"[w]e      accept   as    true   the   well-pleaded   factual\n\nallegations    of   the   complaint,     draw   all   reasonable   inferences\n\ntherefrom in the plaintiff's favor, and determine whether the\n\ncomplaint, so read, sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery\n\non any cognizable theory.\"         TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc. v. Pan Am. Grain\n\nCo., 215 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          III.      Dismissal of the Complaint Without Granting Leave\n                    to Amend and Undertake Discovery\n\n          The Donovans summarily argue that the district court\n\nerred as a matter of law by dismissing their complaint without\n\ngranting them leave to amend and undertake discovery to avoid\n\ndismissal.     We need not reach the merits of this claim because\n\n                                        -3-\n\fplaintiffs failed to develop their argument and, consequently, have\n\nwaived it for purposes of appeal.           See FDIC v. LeBlanc, 85 F.3d\n\n815, 820 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating that \"'issues averted to in a\n\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, [will be] deemed waived for purposes of appeal'\"\n\n(quoting Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 36 (1st\n\nCir. 1994))).       Other than making a bald assertion of abuse,\n\nplaintiffs fail to explain how the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion or allege what evidence they would have presented had\n\nthe court granted their request to amend.            Therefore, plaintiffs\n\nhave waived this claim.\n\n                          IV.    Right to Travel\n\n           The Donovans contend that the right to move a building on\n\na public way is a subset of the right to travel and, as such, is\n\nthe fundamental right underlying their claims.              Whether or not\n\nhouse-moving is protected, reasonable regulation is permissible and\n\nnecessary.     The ordinance and its application here did not exceed\n\nthe   bounds   of   reasonable    regulation    to   protect     the      public.\n\nTherefore, we affirm dismissal of the Donovans' claims based on the\n\nright to travel.\n\n                        V.   Section 1983 Claims\n\n             The Donovans next claim that defendants violated their\n\nrights   to    equal    protection    and     substantive      due        process,\n\nconstitutional      violations   warranting    relief    under       42    U.S.C.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fยง 1983.2      Plaintiffs contend that defendants violated the Equal\n\nProtection Clause by increasing the procedural bars for plaintiffs\n\nin contrast to another person who applied for and received a permit\n\nin 1996.3      While we realize that a successful equal protection\n\nclaim can be brought by a \"class of one,\" the Donovans must allege\n\nthat they have \"been intentionally treated differently from others\n\nsimilarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the\n\ndifference in treatment.\"         Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528\n\nU.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam).         The Donovans have failed to do\n\nso.\n\n              Although the Donovans allege that, by adding conditions\n\nto the permit application,        Flaherty and Mayor Rurak acted in bad\n\nfaith   and    with   malicious    intent,   they   do   not    provide   any\n\ninformation about how any other party was similarly situated or\n\npresent a motive to explain why the Haverhill officials would treat\n\nthem arbitrarily or irrationally. Thus, the Donovans do not allege\n\nthe elements of a viable equal protection claim.               See Wojcik v.\n\nMass. State Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 104 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(rejecting an equal protection claim where appellant \"failed to\n\n\n\n2\n   Plaintiffs have alleged no cognizable causes of action against\nFlaherty or Mayor Rurak in their individual capacity for violations\nof plaintiffs' civil rights.     Therefore, we only consider the\nclaims asserted against Flaherty, and Mayor Rurak in their official\ncapacities.\n3\n  We summarily affirm dismissal of plaintiff's other section 1983\nclaims on grounds identical to those of the district court.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fidentify   specific     evidence    concerning     similarly   situated\n\nindividuals who received more lenient treatment . . . or to adduce\n\nevidence of an arbitrary or irrational motive\" for the adverse\n\naction).\n\n           VI.   Vagueness Challenge to Local Ordinance\n\n           Lastly, the Donovans claim that the Haverhill ordinance\n\ngoverning the moving of buildings, Haverhill General Code, ch. 123-\n\n1, is void for vagueness on its face because it vests unfettered\n\ndiscretion in Mayor Rurak to grant permits.4         We find that this\n\nclaim lacks merit.\n\n           To prevail in a facial challenge to an ordinance that\n\ndoes not regulate constitutionally protected conduct, plaintiffs\n\nmust surmount a dauntingly high hurdle.          See Village of Hoffman\n\nEstates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc, 455 U.S. 489, 498-99\n\n(1982). Plaintiffs \"must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly\n\nvague in all of its applications.\"       Whiting v. Town of Westerly,\n\n942 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1991); cf. United States v. Salerno, 481\n\nU.S. 739, 745 (1987) (stating that \"[a] facial challenge to a\n\nlegislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to\n\nmount successfully\").    Thus, the Donovans have the formidable task\n\nof showing that \"'no standard of conduct is specified at all.'\"\n\n\n4\n  Plaintiffs also summarily argue that the Haverhill ordinance, as\napplied, violates equal protection. Plaintiffs have waived this\nclaim because they fail to make any effort at developed\nargumentation. See FDIC v. LeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 820 (1st Cir.\n1996).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fVillage of Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 495 n.7 (quoting Coates v.\n\nCity of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614 (1971)).           Plaintiffs cannot\n\nmake this showing.\n\n            As a preliminary manner, we note that the terms of the\n\nHaverhill ordinance clearly specify the conduct that is prohibited:\n\nplaintiffs cannot move their house without a permit.5            Cf. City of\n\nChicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 57 (1999) (striking down an\n\nordinance    for   vagueness   because     it   failed   to   describe   what\n\n\"loitering\" was permissible and what was prohibited).\n\n            Furthermore, contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, the\n\nmayor's discretion in the grant of permits is not unrestrained.\n\nApplicable   Massachusetts     law   dictates     that   \"selectmen\"     grant\n\npermits \"upon such terms as in their opinion the public safety may\n\nrequire.\"    Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 85, ยง 18 (2002) (emphasis added).6\n\nIn addition to restricting the exercise of the mayor's discretion\n\n\n5\n    Haverhill General Code, ch. 123-1 states the following:\n\n      No building or structure shall be moved over or through\n      any public street or way in the city except under a\n      permit granted by the Mayor, and every such permit shall\n      state the streets or ways through or over which and the\n      time within which the building or other structure shall\n      be moved and also every other provision and condition\n      which the Mayor shall deem necessary.\n6\n   In its entirety, section 18 reads: \"No person shall move a\nbuilding in a public way without written permission from the\nselectmen or road commissioners, to be granted upon such terms as\nin their opinion the public safety may require; and the superior\ncourt shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce this section.\"\nMassachusetts applies this section to cities as well as towns.\nCommonwealth v. Byard 200 Mass. 175, 176 (1908).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fto public safety concerns, section 18 provides applicants with\n\nnotice that to secure a moving permit they may have to meet\n\nrequirements necessary to ensure public safety.                As we have stated\n\nbefore, \"[w]here     a   standard   is    not   so   vague      that    reasonably\n\nintelligent people 'must necessarily guess at its meaning,' we must\n\npresume that state courts will give it a limiting construction that\n\nwill preserve its facial constitutionality.\"              Fantasy Book Shop,\n\nInc. v. City of Boston, 652 F.2d 1115, 1123 (1st Cir. 1981)\n\n(quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 607 (1973)).\n\n            The grant of discretion in the issuance of moving permits\n\nis a practical necessity.           Because every house and route is\n\ndifferent, an individual assessment of the impact of each move on\n\nthe community is required.      See id. (stating that a vague factor\n\n\"may be reasonably necessary to embrace all of its legitimately\n\nintended objectives without creating an encyclopedic and unwieldy\n\nordinance\"); see also Brasslett v. Cota, 761 F.2d 827, 838 (1st\n\nCir. 1985) (explaining that the Supreme Court and the First Circuit\n\nhave   upheld   \"catch-all\"    clauses     where     it   is    impractical     to\n\nformulate an exhaustive list of actionable conduct). In this case,\n\nthe    Haverhill   ordinance   necessarily      contained        a     \"catch-all\"\n\nprovision because inclusion of all possible conditions would have\n\ncreated    an   \"unwieldy   ordinance.\"         Further,       section     18   put\n\nplaintiffs on notice that receipt of a moving permit would be\n\nsubject to meeting conditions reasonably related to the public\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fsafety,   and,   in   accordance   with   the   terms   of   the   law,   city\n\nofficials only imposed conditions so related.\n\n                            VII.   Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of judgment on the pleadings to defendants.7                 Costs are\n\nassessed against plaintiff-appellants.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    To the extent that plaintiffs make any state claims, we\ninterpret the district court order as declining to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the pendent state claims pursuant to\n28 U.S.C.A. ยง 1367(c)(3) (2000).\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

Due to the delay created by the additional conditions, the Donovans brought multiple claims in Essex Superior Court against defendants, including violations of their right to travel on the public ways, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, due process, and equal protection. In addition, they brought several state law claims.

Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Rule 12 dispositions <i>de novo. Rosa v.

This means that \"[w]e accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read, sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\" <i>TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc. v.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 14, 2000, the Donovans submitted an application to move their house on a public road in Haverhill. The city responded with a list of requirements that the Donovans would have to meet before the permit could issue, such as having the telephone company remove the wires along the route and obtaining a foundation permit. Once the Donovans fulfilled these initial conditions, the Donovans contend that Flaherty and Mayor Rurak added new requirements in bad faith. For example, Flaherty told the Donovans that they would have to pay for the trimming of the trees along the 4.4 miles of their move route, and that they would need police and fire department approval. In addition, Mayor Rurak asked the Haverhill City Council to hold two hearings regarding the house move.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 30, 2000, the Donovans filed an Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief in Essex Superior Court to force Mayor Rurak to issue the permit. The court denied the claim as unripe. Then, on November 6, 2000, Mayor Rurak issued the permit, allowing the Donovans to move their house on November 12-13, 2000. Due to the delay created by the additional conditions, the Donovans brought multiple claims in Essex Superior Court against defendants, including violations of their right to travel on the public ways, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, due process, and equal protection. In addition, they brought several state law claims. Defendants removed to federal district court and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the district court granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

We need not reach the merits of this claim because plaintiffs failed to develop their argument and, consequently, have waived it for purposes of appeal. <i>See FDIC v. LeBlanc,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196805\"><a href=\"/opinion/196805/fdic-v-leblanc/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, 820 (1st Cir.1996) (stating that \"`issues averted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, [will be] deemed waived for purposes of appeal'\" (quoting <i>Grella v.

The ordinance and its application here did not exceed the bounds of reasonable regulation to protect the public.

In this case, the Haverhill ordinance necessarily contained a \"catch-all\" provision because inclusion of all possible conditions would have created an \"unwieldy ordinance.\" Further, section 18 put plaintiffs on notice that receipt of a moving permit would be subject to meeting conditions reasonably related to the public safety, and, in accordance with the terms of the law, city officials only imposed conditions so related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.
