Roberts appeals from the\n\ndenial   of   Social   Security   disability   benefits.   The   parties\n\nconsented to have the matter heard by a magistrate judge, and this\n\njudge affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security\n\nthat claimant retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to\n\nperform her past work as a clerk-typist.             For the following\n\nreasons, we affirm in part, but vacate and remand for further\n\nproceedings in other respects.\n\n                                    I.\n\n     On judicial review of a disability determination, a court \"is\n\nlimited to determining whether the [administrative law judge]\n\ndeployed the proper legal standards and found facts upon the proper\n\nquantum of evidence.\"     Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (per curiam).     In other words, \"[t]he ALJ's findings of fact\n\nare conclusive when supported by substantial evidence, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n405(g), but are not conclusive when derived by ignoring evidence,\n\nmisapplying the law, or judging matters entrusted to experts.\" Id.\n\nIt also is important to keep in mind that resolution of conflicts\n\nin the evidence and the ultimate determination of disability are\n\nfor the ALJ, not the courts.      Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health and\n\nHuman Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n     Here, the ALJ determined, at step four of the sequential\n\nevaluation process, that claimant retained the RFC to perform her\n\npast work.    \"At step four the initial burden is on the claimant to\n\nshow that she can no longer perform her former work because of her\n\fimpairments.\"       Manso-Pizarro v. Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices, 76 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam).                              This\n\ninitial burden requires the claimant to \"lay the foundation as to\n\nwhat activities her former work entailed, [and to] . . . point out\n\n(unless obvious) -- so as to put in issue -- how her functional\n\nincapacity renders her unable to perform her former usual work.\"\n\nSantiago v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 944 F.2d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).            Once a claimant meets this initial\n\nburden, \"the ALJ must compare the physical and mental demands of\n\n[the claimant's] past work with current functional capability.\"\n\nManso-Pizarro, supra, 76 F.3d at 17.\n\n                                         II.\n\n      A.   Claimant's Mental Condition\n\n      In   relation     to    claimant's       mental     impairment     --    severe\n\ndepression -- we think that claimant met her initial burden in the\n\nstep four process. Claimant testified that, due to her depression,\n\nshe does not go out of her house for days or weeks at a time and\n\nthat she just gives up on life and stays in bed.                        The medical\n\nevidence     in   the   record    also     contains      repeated    references       to\n\nclaimant's (1) difficulties in attending medical appointments, (2)\n\nproblems     in   following      through    with   treatment        plans,    and    (3)\n\ntendency to isolate herself by staying at home and sleeping during\n\nthe   day.        Although    claimant      did    not    tie   these    particular\n\nlimitations to her inability to perform her past job as a clerk\n\ntypist, the connection is obvious.\n\f     In order to be considered mentally capable of performing any\n\ntype of work, a claimant must be able to cope with certain demands.\n\nThese demands include \"the need to be punctual and to attend work\n\non a regular basis, the ability to accept supervision and the\n\ncapacity to remain in the work place for an entire day.\"          Irlanda\n\nOrtiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955 F.2d 765, 770\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam).           It certainly is arguable that\n\nsomeone who, at times, cannot leave her home due to her depression\n\nalso is incapable of being punctual and attending work on a regular\n\nbasis.   We therefore think that claimant's limitations in this\n\nregard have sufficiently \"put in issue . . . how her functional\n\nincapacity renders her unable to perform her former usual work.\"\n\nSee Santiago, supra, 944 F.2d at 5.\n\n     The ALJ thus was obliged to \"compare the physical and mental\n\ndemands of [claimant's] past work with [her] . . . functional\n\ncapability.\"    See Manso-Pizarro, supra, 76 F.3d at 17.       Obviously,\n\nin order to meet this requirement, an RFC assessment was necessary.\n\nHowever, the general rule is that an expert is needed to assess the\n\nextent of functional loss.        Id.    An ALJ may determine RFC only\n\n\"[i]f th[e] evidence suggests a relatively mild . . . impairment\n\nposing, to the layperson's eye, no significant . . . restrictions.\"\n\nId. at 17-18.\n\n     The medical evidence that the ALJ did consider here shows that\n\ncertain of claimant's mental abilities did remain intact. Claimant\n\nconsistently    was   described   as    being   coherent,   relevant,   and\n\foriented; similarly, she never exhibited any thought disorders and\n\nher memory, when tested, always was preserved.            If this were the\n\nonly evidence in the record regarding the extent of claimant's\n\nmental condition, then we think that the record would show a\n\n\"relatively mild . . . impairment posing, to the layperson's eye,\n\nno significant . . . restrictions.\"         See Manso-Pizarro, supra, 76\n\nF.3d at 17-18.       However, and as noted above, there was other\n\nevidence concerning the nature of claimant's mental impairment.\n\n       This evidence -- that claimant had difficulties with (1)\n\nmaintaining attendance, (2) following through with a schedule, and\n\n(3) leaving her house when she is depressed -- was ignored by the\n\nALJ.    Perhaps the reason for this omission was the assumption that\n\nthe    behavior   reflected   in   the   evidence   was   under   claimant's\n\ncontrol.    Indeed, the Commissioner's position on appeal is that\n\nclaimant's problems arose from her non-compliance with treatment\n\nand not from her incapacity to get control of her impairments\n\nthrough treatment.\n\n       While the above position may be correct, we do not think that\n\nthe ALJ was qualified to make an RFC assessment concerning the\n\nextent to which claimant's non-compliance with treatment was under\n\nher control and the extent to which, even assuming compliance with\n\ntreatment, claimant's maladaptive behavior would cease. As we have\n\nstated, an expert's RFC evaluation is required where \"the record .\n\n. . is sufficiently ramified that understanding it requires more\n\nthan a layperson's effort at a commonsense functional capacity\n\fassessment.\"       Manso-Pizarro, supra, 76 F.3d at 19.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, and viewing all of the evidence in the\n\nrecord as a whole, we think that the record indicates more than a\n\nmild impairment which imposes more than slight restrictions on\n\nclaimant's mental ability to function.                 As a result, the ALJ was\n\nnot permitted to make an RFC assessment, and an expert was required\n\nfor this task.        It thus follows that the ALJ's comparison of the\n\ndemands      of   claimant's   past      work   with       her    mental   functional\n\ncapacity,     being    based   on   an    invalid      RFC       assessment,   is   not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n       The   magistrate    judge    had    quite       a    different      reason   for\n\nrejecting the claim of mental disability.                  And, on its face, this\n\nreason has substantial force. The magistrate judge stated that the\n\nplaintiff, based on her own testimony, failed to make the threshold\n\nshowing that, because of mental disability, she was unable to\n\nperform her past relevant work.             Specifically, she stated in the\n\nadministrative hearing that she could not return to her prior job\n\nas a typist because she could not use her fingers or sit for long\n\nperiods of time, problems which arose after the expiration of her\n\ninjured status.       These reasons were the only two given; she did not\n\nclaim that her mental illness prevented her from returning to this\n\njob.    By negative implication she could have been taken to have\n\ndisclaimed such a connection.\n\n       However, this was not the interpretation for her testimony\n\nrelied on by the ALJ.      And, in this case the medical records showed\n\fsignificant depression and plaintiff's testimony, if credited,\n\nraised serious questions about her ability to function in a regular\n\njob. We are therefore still satisfied that a remand is appropriate\n\nbut, before ordering an RFC assessment, the ALJ is free as a\n\nprecondition to require the plaintiff to clarify her answer; and,\n\nif she is not persuasively claiming that the depression precluded\n\nher return to work as a typist, obviously no RFC is required.\n\n      B.   Claimant's Physical Condition\n\n      As for claimant's physical impairment, the ALJ found that she\n\nsuffers from hemochromatosis, which is a disorder of the blood. At\n\nthe   hearing,   claimant    testified   that,   as   a   result   of   this\n\ncondition, she could not perform her prior job as a clerk-typist.\n\nIn particular, claimant stated that she could not type due to the\n\nproblems she had with the joints of her fingers and that she could\n\nnot sit for prolonged periods of time.      As claimant points out, the\n\ndiagnosis of hemochromatosis provides a medical basis for her\n\ncomplaints since one of the symptoms of this disease is joint pain.\n\n      The above sufficiently pointed out how claimant's \"functional\n\nincapacity renders her unable to perform her former usual work.\"\n\nSee Santiago, supra, 944 F.2d at 5.       The ALJ thus was required to\n\n\"compare the physical . . . demands of that past work with\n\n[claimant's] . . . functional capability.\"            See Manso-Pizarro,\n\nsupra, 76 F.3d at 17.       The first question, as before, is whether\n\nthe evidence showed only a \"relatively mild physical impairment\n\nposing, to the layperson's eye, no significant . . . restrictions\";\n\fonly in such a case would the ALJ himself be permitted to make the\n\nrequired RFC assessment.     See id. at 17-18.\n\n     We think that the ALJ here correctly determined that an expert\n\nwas not required for the evaluation of claimant's physical RFC.\n\nDespite the undisputed diagnosis of hemochromatosis, the record\n\nindicates very few complaints of joint pain and no requests for\n\ntreatment for this pain.       Further, in the physical examination\n\nconducted on September 28, 1995, the diagnoses did not include any\n\nreference to joint pain or arthritis.     And, as the ALJ pointed out,\n\nclaimant was receiving treatment for her hemochromatosis.\n\n     Based on the record and on claimant's testimony, the ALJ\n\ndecided that claimant was limited to lifting and carrying 10 pounds\n\nfrequently   and   lifting   and   carrying   20   pounds   occasionally.\n\nBecause these are the only limitations the ALJ mentioned, it is\n\nplain that he implicitly was concluding that claimant's capacities\n\nfor sitting, standing, and using her hands and fingers remained\n\nintact.   There is substantial evidence in the record to support\n\nthis RFC assessment.\n\n     Claimant never specifically complained to any health care\n\nprofessional, during the relevant time, of pain in her fingers or\n\nof an inability to sit or stand.     Further, at the hearing, claimant\n\nstated that she had stopped working as a clerk-typist because the\n\nposition had closed, not because she could not perform the physical\n\ndemands of the job.      In this respect, we think that the ALJ\n\ncorrectly found that claimant's testimony regarding the problems\n\fwith the joints in her fingers and her inability to sit did not\n\nrelate to the period before claimant's insured status had expired.\n\n     It thus appears that, as the ALJ concluded, claimant retained\n\nthe physical RFC to perform her past work as a clerk-typist.\n\nAlthough claimant argues that the ALJ did not consider the specific\n\ndemands of this kind of work in reaching this conclusion, claimant\n\ndoes not offer any information about the job demands that would\n\nraise a question about whether she had the physical capacity to\n\nperform the job.   The ALJ's decision in regard to the impact of\n\nclaimant's physical limitations on her ability to perform her past\n\nwork therefore can be affirmed.\n\n                               III.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is\n\nremanded with directions to remand to the Commissioner for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

However, and as noted above, there was other\n\nevidence concerning the nature of claimant's mental impairment.\n\n       This evidence -- that claimant had difficulties with (1)\n\nmaintaining attendance, (2) following through with a schedule, and\n\n(3) leaving her house when she is depressed -- was ignored by the\n\nALJ.    Perhaps the reason for this omission was the assumption that\n\nthe    behavior   reflected   in   the   evidence   was   under   claimant's\n\ncontrol.    Indeed, the Commissioner's position on appeal is that\n\nclaimant's problems arose from her non-compliance with treatment\n\nand not from her incapacity to get control of her impairments\n\nthrough treatment.\n\n       While the above position may be correct, we do not think that\n\nthe ALJ was qualified to make an RFC assessment concerning the\n\nextent to which claimant's non-compliance with treatment was under\n\nher control and the extent to which, even assuming compliance with\n\ntreatment, claimant's maladaptive behavior would cease. As we have\n\nstated, an expert's RFC evaluation is required where \"the record .\n\n. . is sufficiently ramified that understanding it requires more\n\nthan a layperson's effort at a commonsense functional capacity\n\fassessment.\"       Manso-Pizarro, supra, 76 F.3d at 19.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, and viewing all of the evidence in the\n\nrecord as a whole, we think that the record indicates more than a\n\nmild impairment which imposes more than slight restrictions on\n\nclaimant's mental ability to function.                 As a result, the ALJ was\n\nnot permitted to make an RFC assessment, and an expert was required\n\nfor this task.        It thus follows that the ALJ's comparison of the\n\ndemands      of   claimant's   past      work   with       her    mental   functional\n\ncapacity,     being    based   on   an    invalid      RFC       assessment,   is   not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n       The   magistrate    judge    had    quite       a    different      reason   for\n\nrejecting the claim of mental disability.                  And, on its face, this\n\nreason has substantial force. The magistrate judge stated that the\n\nplaintiff, based on her own testimony, failed to make the threshold\n\nshowing that, because of mental disability, she was unable to\n\nperform her past relevant work.             Specifically, she stated in the\n\nadministrative hearing that she could not return to her prior job\n\nas a typist because she could not use her fingers or sit for long\n\nperiods of time, problems which arose after the expiration of her\n\ninjured status.       These reasons were the only two given; she did not\n\nclaim that her mental illness prevented her from returning to this\n\njob.    By negative implication she could have been taken to have\n\ndisclaimed such a connection.\n\n       However, this was not the interpretation for her testimony\n\nrelied on by the ALJ.      And, in this case the medical records showed\n\fsignificant depression and plaintiff's testimony, if credited,\n\nraised serious questions about her ability to function in a regular\n\njob. We are therefore still satisfied that a remand is appropriate\n\nbut, before ordering an RFC assessment, the ALJ is free as a\n\nprecondition to require the plaintiff to clarify her answer; and,\n\nif she is not persuasively claiming that the depression precluded\n\nher return to work as a typist, obviously no RFC is required.\n\n      B.   Claimant's Physical Condition\n\n      As for claimant's physical impairment, the ALJ found that she\n\nsuffers from hemochromatosis, which is a disorder of the blood. At\n\nthe   hearing,   claimant    testified   that,   as   a   result   of   this\n\ncondition, she could not perform her prior job as a clerk-typist.\n\nIn particular, claimant stated that she could not type due to the\n\nproblems she had with the joints of her fingers and that she could\n\nnot sit for prolonged periods of time.      As claimant points out, the\n\ndiagnosis of hemochromatosis provides a medical basis for her\n\ncomplaints since one of the symptoms of this disease is joint pain.\n\n      The above sufficiently pointed out how claimant's \"functional\n\nincapacity renders her unable to perform her former usual work.\"\n\nSee Santiago, supra, 944 F.2d at 5.       The ALJ thus was required to\n\n\"compare the physical . . . demands of that past work with\n\n[claimant's] . . . functional capability.\"            See Manso-Pizarro,\n\nsupra, 76 F.3d at 17.       The first question, as before, is whether\n\nthe evidence showed only a \"relatively mild physical impairment\n\nposing, to the layperson's eye, no significant . . . restrictions\";\n\fonly in such a case would the ALJ himself be permitted to make the\n\nrequired RFC assessment.     See id. at 17-18.\n\n     We think that the ALJ here correctly determined that an expert\n\nwas not required for the evaluation of claimant's physical RFC.\n\nDespite the undisputed diagnosis of hemochromatosis, the record\n\nindicates very few complaints of joint pain and no requests for\n\ntreatment for this pain.       Further, in the physical examination\n\nconducted on September 28, 1995, the diagnoses did not include any\n\nreference to joint pain or arthritis.     And, as the ALJ pointed out,\n\nclaimant was receiving treatment for her hemochromatosis.\n\n     Based on the record and on claimant's testimony, the ALJ\n\ndecided that claimant was limited to lifting and carrying 10 pounds\n\nfrequently   and   lifting   and   carrying   20   pounds   occasionally.\n\nBecause these are the only limitations the ALJ mentioned, it is\n\nplain that he implicitly was concluding that claimant's capacities\n\nfor sitting, standing, and using her hands and fingers remained\n\nintact.   There is substantial evidence in the record to support\n\nthis RFC assessment.\n\n     Claimant never specifically complained to any health care\n\nprofessional, during the relevant time, of pain in her fingers or\n\nof an inability to sit or stand.     Further, at the hearing, claimant\n\nstated that she had stopped working as a clerk-typist because the\n\nposition had closed, not because she could not perform the physical\n\ndemands of the job.      In this respect, we think that the ALJ\n\ncorrectly found that claimant's testimony regarding the problems\n\fwith the joints in her fingers and her inability to sit did not\n\nrelate to the period before claimant's insured status had expired.\n\n     It thus appears that, as the ALJ concluded, claimant retained\n\nthe physical RFC to perform her past work as a clerk-typist.\n\nAlthough claimant argues that the ALJ did not consider the specific\n\ndemands of this kind of work in reaching this conclusion, claimant\n\ndoes not offer any information about the job demands that would\n\nraise a question about whether she had the physical capacity to\n\nperform the job.   The ALJ's decision in regard to the impact of\n\nclaimant's physical limitations on her ability to perform her past\n\nwork therefore can be affirmed.\n\n                               III.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is\n\nremanded with directions to remand to the Commissioner for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f</pre>",
