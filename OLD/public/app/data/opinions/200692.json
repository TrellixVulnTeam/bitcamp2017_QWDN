Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Torruella, Selya and Lynch,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Tina Schneider on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        October 16, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam.         This   is   the     second    appeal by defendant-\n\nappellant James R. Riggs, Jr.          In his first appeal, Riggs argued\n\nthat the government breached the plea agreement by not recommending\n\nthat he be sentenced on the basis of five to fifty grams of cocaine\n\nbase, as expressly set forth in the agreement.                  We agreed, and\n\ntherefore vacated Riggs's sentence and directed the district court\n\nto consider whether specific performance of the plea agreement or\n\nwithdrawal of the guilty plea was the appropriate remedy.                United\n\nStates v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224-25 (1st Cir. 2002) (Riggs I).\n\nOn remand, Riggs elected to stand on his guilty plea and was\n\nresentenced.\n\n     In the present appeal, Riggs argues that his sentence should\n\nbe vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because (1) the\n\ngovernment    breached    the   plea    agreement     again,    this   time   by\n\nsuggesting that Riggs receive the maximum sentence available under\n\nthe law, even though the government had agreed to recommend a\n\nsentence based on a specific amount of cocaine base, and (2) the\n\ndistrict court erred by imposing a term of supervised release that\n\nexceeded the sentencing guidelines for an offense involving an\n\nunspecified    amount     of    cocaine      base,    without    providing    an\n\nexplanation and advance notice to the parties.             We affirm.1\n\n     With respect to Riggs's first argument, we note that Riggs did\n\n\n     1\n       The court has determined that oral argument would not aid\nthe decisional process. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2)(C); 1st Cir.\nLoc. R. 34(b).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fnot object to any of the government's comments at the resentencing\n\nhearing.   As we said in Riggs I:\n\n     When a defendant has knowledge of conduct ostensibly\n     amounting to a breach of a plea agreement, yet does not\n     bring that breach to the attention of the sentencing\n     court, we review only for plain error.      To establish\n     plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that: (1) there\n     was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error\n     affected the defendant's substantial rights; and (4) the\n     error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or\n     public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nId. at 224 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n     We conclude that there was no plain error here.                 The plea\n\nagreement provided that the parties would recommend a sentence\n\nbased on five to fifty grams of cocaine base, but the parties\n\nsubsequently agreed, prior to resentencing, to narrow that spread\n\nto 35 to 49 grams.      The guideline range for trafficking in 35 to 49\n\ngrams of cocaine base, based on Riggs's total offense level of 27\n\nand his Criminal History Category (VI), is 130 to 162 months of\n\nimprisonment.      At    the   resentencing    hearing,      the   government\n\nrecommended that Riggs receive a 162-month sentence.                While the\n\ngovernment did not specifically mention that its recommendation was\n\nbased on a drug quantity of 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base, it had\n\nso   stipulated   less    than   an    hour   earlier   at    a    presentence\n\nconference.     Moreover, its sentencing recommendation was at the\n\nhigh end of, but clearly within, the guideline range for this drug\n\namount.    Therefore, the government did not breach its obligations\n\nunder the plea agreement.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f     Although Riggs takes issue with the government's failure to\n\nreference the 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base at the disposition\n\nhearing itself, the plea agreement did not specifically say that\n\nthe government had to mention the drug quantity that led to the\n\napplicable guideline range.            What is more, the district court\n\nalready   had    indicated      that   it    was    aware         that    the   parties'\n\nsentencing recommendations would be based on that specific drug\n\nquantity.    Finally, despite the fact that the government recounted\n\nRiggs's involvement in the drug conspiracy and noted that the\n\nconspiracy ended with \"the seizure of several hundred grams of\n\ncrack cocaine,\" these facts were contained in the presentence\n\ninvestigation report.          It was not only appropriate, but also in\n\nconformity with the government's obligations for it to provide the\n\nsentencing      court   with    information        as   to    the       material   facts\n\nsurrounding the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Mata-Grullon,\n\n887 F.2d 23, 24 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that \"the government must\n\nbring all relevant facts to the [sentencing judge's] attention\").\n\n     Riggs's complaint that the government made the requisite\n\nrecommendation      somewhat     grudgingly        avails         him    naught.    The\n\ngovernment's recommendation need not be enthusiastic.                        See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Benchimol, 471 U.S. 453, 455-56 (1985) (stating\n\nthat a    criminal      defendant   has     no   right       to    an    \"enthusiastic\"\n\nrecommendation by the prosecutor in order to achieve compliance\n\nwith a plea agreement).         We interpret the government's statement\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthat Riggs \"should receive the maximum sentence available under the\n\nlaw\" as recommending the maximum guideline sentence available under\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) based on Riggs's total offense level and\n\ncriminal history category.\n\n     We also reject Riggs's second argument.        That argument is\n\nraised for the first time in this appeal (and, therefore, can only\n\nbe reviewed for plain error).   See, e.g., United States v. Duarte,\n\n246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).       Riggs argues that the district\n\ncourt erred by imposing a term of supervised release that exceeded\n\nthe sentencing guidelines for an offense involving an unspecified\n\namount of cocaine base, without providing advance notice to the\n\nparties and an explanation for doing so.      In effect, Riggs treats\n\nthe supervised release term as constituting an upward departure\n\nbecause no drug quantity was alleged in the indictment, included in\n\nthe government's version of the facts, or determined by the court\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.    See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.\n\n466, 490 (2000).   For that reason, he says, he could not receive\n\nmore than the maximum sentence for an unspecified quantity of\n\ncocaine base under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) – a supervised release\n\nterm of two to three years.   See USSG § 5D1.2(a)(2) (providing that\n\nif a term of supervised release is ordered, the length of the term\n\nfor a Class C felony shall be \"at least two years but not more than\n\nthree years\").\n\n     The supervised release term did not exceed the guideline range\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffor the offense to which Riggs pled guilty (and, thus, was not an\n\nupward departure).            The    record     is   clear   that       Riggs   accepted\n\nresponsibility for 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base, making his\n\noffense a 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) offense.                         Because such an\n\noffense is a Class B felony, see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(2), the\n\napplicable guideline provision calls for \"at least three years but\n\nnot   more    than    five    years\"      of    supervised      release.         USSG   §\n\n5D1.2(a)(1).       Thus, the district court's imposition of a five-year\n\nsupervised release term did not exceed the guideline range.\n\n      Moreover, even assuming without deciding that an Apprendi\n\nerror occurred because the length of Riggs's sentence was driven\n\nlargely by drug quantity (a fact neither charged in the indictment\n\nnor submitted to a jury), Riggs stipulated that he was responsible\n\nfor a drug quantity that placed him at a higher statutory level\n\nthan the default statutory maximum, and his sentence fell within\n\nthat higher level.            Consequently, he cannot establish either\n\nprejudice or plain error.           See Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60 (holding that\n\neven if Apprendi error occurred, defendant who admitted to drug\n\nquantity at time of plea suffered no prejudice by omission of\n\nspecific     drug    quantity       in   indictment     or   by    absence      of   jury\n\ndetermination on that point, and, therefore, plain error standard\n\nwas not met).\n\n      For    the    reasons     stated,        the   judgment     and    sentence    are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -7-\n\f",

To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error affected the defendant's substantial rights; and (4) the error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 224 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there was no plain error here. The plea agreement provided that the parties would recommend a sentence based on five to fifty grams of cocaine base, but the parties subsequently agreed, prior to resentencing, to narrow that spread to 35 to 49 grams. The guideline range for trafficking in 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base, based on Riggs's total offense level of 27 and his Criminal History Category (VI), is 130 to 162 months of imprisonment. At the resentencing hearing, the government recommended that Riggs receive a 162 month sentence. While the government did not specifically mention that its recommendation was based on a drug quantity of 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base, it had so stipulated less than an hour earlier at a presentence conference. Moreover, its sentencing recommendation was at the high end of, but clearly within, the guideline range for this drug amount. Therefore, the government did not breach its obligations under the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Riggs takes issue with the government's failure to reference the 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base at the disposition hearing itself, the plea agreement did not specifically say that the government had to mention the drug quantity that led to the applicable guideline range. What is more, the district court already had indicated that it was aware that the parties' sentencing recommendations would be based on that specific drug quantity. Finally, despite the fact that the government recounted Riggs's involvement in the drug conspiracy and noted that the conspiracy ended with \"the seizure of several hundred grams of crack cocaine,\" these facts were contained in the presentence investigation report. It was not only appropriate, but also in conformity with the government's obligations for it to provide the sentencing court with information as to the material facts surrounding the offense. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mata-Grullon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530304\"><a href=\"/opinion/530304/united-states-v-ramon-mata-grullon-aka-santos-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that \"the government must bring all relevant facts to the [sentencing judge's] attention\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riggs's complaint that the government made the requisite recommendation somewhat grudgingly avails him naught. The government's recommendation need not be enthusiastic. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Benchimol,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111427\"><a href=\"/opinion/111427/united-states-v-benchimol/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 455-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111427\"><a href=\"/opinion/111427/united-states-v-benchimol/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2103</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111427\"><a href=\"/opinion/111427/united-states-v-benchimol/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span> (1985) (stating that a criminal defendant has no right to an \"enthusiastic\" recommendation by the prosecutor in order to achieve compliance with a plea agreement). We interpret the government's statement that Riggs \"should receive the maximum sentence available under the law\" as recommending the maximum guideline sentence available under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) based on Riggs's total offense level and criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Riggs's second argument. That argument is raised for the first time in this appeal (and, therefore, can only be reviewed for plain error). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Riggs argues that the district court erred by imposing a term of supervised release that exceeded the sentencing guidelines for an offense involving an unspecified amount of cocaine base, without providing advance notice to the parties and an explanation for doing so. In effect, Riggs treats the supervised release term as constituting an upward departure because no drug quantity was alleged in the indictment, included in the government's version of the facts, or determined by the court beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000). For that reason, he says, he could not receive more than the maximum sentence for an unspecified quantity of cocaine base under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) &#8212; a supervised release term of two to three years. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 5D1.2(a)(2) (providing that if a term of supervised release is ordered, the length of the term for a Class C felony shall be \"at least two years but not more than three years\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supervised release term did not exceed the guideline range for the offense to which Riggs pled guilty (and, thus, was not an upward departure). The record is clear that Riggs accepted responsibility for 35 to 49 grams of cocaine base, making his offense a 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) offense. Because such an offense is a Class B felony, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)(2), the applicable guideline provision calls for \"at least three years but not more than five years\" of supervised release. USSG &#167; 5D1.2(a)(1). Thus, the district court's imposition of a five-year supervised release term did not exceed the guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming without deciding that an <i>Apprendi</i> error occurred because the length of Riggs's sentence was driven largely by drug quantity (a fact neither charged in the indictment nor submitted to a jury), Riggs stipulated that he was responsible for a drug quantity that placed him at a higher statutory level than the default statutory maximum, and his sentence fell within that higher level. Consequently, he cannot establish either prejudice or plain error. <i>See Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60 (holding that even if <i>Apprendi</i> error occurred, defendant who admitted to drug quantity at time of plea suffered no prejudice by omission of specific drug quantity in indictment or by absence of jury determination on that point, and, therefore, plain error standard was not met).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the judgment and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court has determined that oral argument would not aid the decisional process<i>See</i> Fed.
