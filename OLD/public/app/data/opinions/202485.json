José Antonio Fusté,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                     Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Anita Hill Adames on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Thomas F. Klumper,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa E. Rodríguez-Vélez, United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            November 8, 2006\n\f             Per    Curiam.       Harry         Arizmendi-Serrano         (\"Arizmendi\")\n\nappeals from his drug-trafficking conviction on the sole ground\n\nthat he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective\n\nassistance     of    counsel     in    connection         with     his    guilty   plea.\n\nSpecifically,       he   faults       his    trial       counsel    for     erroneously\n\ncalculating his criminal history category and, on the basis of that\n\nmiscalculation, erroneously advising him that he would be eligible,\n\nvia the \"safety valve,\" U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2, to receive a sentence\n\nbelow the statutory mandatory 10-year minimum that would otherwise\n\napply   to   his    offense.      Because         the    existing    record    here    is\n\nsufficiently developed, we depart from our usual practice of\n\ntreating ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised for the\n\nfirst time on direct appeal as premature and, instead, proceed to\n\nconsider     Arizmendi's      claim    on    its       merits.     United    States    v.\n\nNatanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n             \"The touchstone for any ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim is the two-part test laid down by the Supreme Court in\n\nStrickland     v.    Washington,      466       U.S.    668   (1984).       First,    the\n\ndefendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. . . .\n\nSecond, the defendant must show that the deficient performance\n\nprejudiced the defense.\"          United States v. Colon-Torres, 382 F.3d\n\n76, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52,\n\n59 (1985)).        In the context of guilty pleas, \"'[t]he second, or\n\n\"prejudice,\"       requirement    .    .    .     focuses     on   whether    counsel's\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fconstitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of\n\nthe plea process.'\"   Id. at 86 (quoting   Hill, 474 U.S. at 58-59).\n\nTo satisfy that second requirement, a defendant must \"show 'a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not\n\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.'\"\n\nId. (quoting Hill, 474 U.S. at 59).\n\n          We need not determine whether the first requirement is\n\nsatisfied here because Arizmendi has clearly failed to satisfy the\n\nsecond, prejudice requirement.    Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d\n\n769, 775 (1st Cir. 1994).     He does not argue that, absent his\n\ncounsel's error about his criminal history, he would not have pled\n\nguilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Cf. Colon-Torres\n\n(finding serious indicia of prejudice where defendant \"is now\n\nadamant that he wants to have the trial option\").        Rather, he\n\nalleges merely that the error deprived him of \"giving consideration\n\nto exercising the constitutional right to a jury trial.\"   However,\n\nthe record is clear that Arizmendi's last-minute decision to forgo\n\na jury trial was motivated not by his counsel's advice about his\n\neligibility for the safety valve but rather by the government's\n\nstated intention, on the eve of trial, to file an information about\n\nhis prior conviction for a felony drug offense, which would have\n\ndoubled the length of his criminal sentence.1   Moreover, even after\n\n\n     1\n      See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A) (providing for a 20-year\nmandatory minimum sentence if a person violates § 841(a) after a\nprior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final);\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe presentence report found him ineligible for the safety valve\n\nbecause he committed the instant offense while still on probation\n\nfor a prior offense, he made no attempt to vacate his guilty plea\n\nas involuntary or unknowing.\n\n            The other form of prejudice that Arizmendi asserts--that\n\n\"he could have received a more lenient sentence\"--is patently\n\nnonexistent.     The length of his sentence was driven by his prior\n\nrecord and his refusal to cooperate, not by his counsel's advice.\n\nRegardless of counsel's advice one way or the other, he was in fact\n\nineligible for the safety valve and would therefore have been\n\nsubject    to,   at   least,   the   same   ten-year   sentence   ultimately\n\nimposed.    Indeed, if he had gone to trial, and the government had\n\nfiled the intended information, his sentence would have, at least,\n\ndoubled in length.\n\n            Accordingly, we reject Azimendi's ineffective assistance\n\nclaim on its merits and affirm the judgment.              See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n851(a) (prohibiting such an increase in the mandatory minimum\nunless, before trial or entry of a guilty plea, the United States\nfiles an information stating the previous convictions relied upon).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
