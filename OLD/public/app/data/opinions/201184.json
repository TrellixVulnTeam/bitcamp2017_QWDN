Petitioner Azeb Gebre Chebude, a\n\nnative and citizen of Ethiopia, is of Eritrean descent.      In July\n\n2000, shortly after a two-year war between Ethiopia and Eritrea\n\nended, Chebude left Ethiopia and attempted to enter the United\n\nStates using fraudulent documents.       The INS detained her and\n\ncommenced removal proceedings.     Chebude conceded removability but\n\nsought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\") on the ground that, as a person\n\nof Eritrean origin, she would face discrimination and potential\n\ndeportation to Eritrea upon her return.         An Immigration Judge\n\ndenied each form of relief on March 19, 2002.    Chebude appealed the\n\ndenial of her asylum claim to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA), which affirmed the IJ's decision on September 8, 2003.\n\nBecause a number of Chebude's arguments on appeal were not raised\n\nin her briefs to the BIA, and substantial evidence supports the\n\nBIA's rejection of those arguments that she did raise, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in 1998.\n\nChebude, who was the sole witness at her removal hearing, testified\n\nthat her mother is Eritrean and her father is Amharic.       Chebude\n\ntestified that she lost her job as a secretary in August 1999\n\nbecause her employer was afraid he would be investigated by the\n\ngovernment for hiring Eritreans.    She further testified that, also\n\nin August 1999, the police arrested two of her three brothers and\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fforcibly deported them.   Although she, her mother, and Yadic, her\n\nremaining brother, were present during one of the arrests, they\n\nwere not taken.   According to Chebude, her mother was too elderly\n\nand Yadic was too sick to be taken, and Chebude herself was not\n\ntaken because she was the only person available to care for them.\n\n          Over the next several months, she said, the Ethiopian\n\npolice came repeatedly to her house to deport her.   The first time,\n\nshe testified, she was at the hospital caring for Yadic, so they\n\ndid not find her.   The second time, she testified, they again did\n\nnot take her because Yadic had recently passed away and she was in\n\nmourning. After the forty-day mourning period had passed, she went\n\ninto hiding.   During that time, she testified that her mother told\n\nher that government agents had twice come to their house to inquire\n\nas to her whereabouts.\n\n          According to the State Department's country conditions\n\nreport for Ethiopia in 2001, the conflict between Ethiopia and\n\nEritrea lasted through June 2000, when the two nations signed an\n\nagreement ending hostilities.    The report notes that during the\n\nconflict, many Ethiopians of Eritrean origin lost their jobs and\n\naccess to government services, and as many as 75,000 were detained\n\nand forcibly deported.     The report goes on to note that \"the\n\nGovernment stopped forcibly deporting Eritreans and Ethiopians of\n\nEritrean origin after it signed the cessation of hostilities\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fagreement with Eritrea in June 2000\" and that 2,892 such persons\n\nwere repatriated in 2000.\n\n           On March 19, 2002, the IJ denied Chebude's petition for\n\nasylum and withholding of departure.           Although he found Chebude to\n\nbe a \"credible witness,\" he concluded that she lacked a well-\n\nfounded fear   of    future    persecution.       He   determined   that   the\n\nevidence was not sufficient to demonstrate that Chebude had been\n\nsubjected to past persecution.        He described Chebude's allegations\n\nthat authorities repeatedly tried to deport her as \"speculative\"\n\nand noted that, in any event, she had not been deported.              The IJ\n\nalso determined that Chebude was unlikely to be persecuted upon her\n\nreturn, citing State Department country conditions reports that\n\nEthiopia and Eritrea had signed a peace agreement and that Ethiopia\n\nhad stopped deporting individuals of Eritrean descent.                The IJ\n\nfurther stated that \"[t]here is no evidence that Ethiopians [of]\n\nEritrean   descent    are     being   denied    housing   or   education    or\n\nemployment at the present time\" and that Chebude's evidence on that\n\npoint was \"strictly an[ec]dotal and unsubstantiated.\" In addition,\n\nthe IJ denied Chebude's CAT petition on the ground that there was\n\nno evidence that Chebude faced torture upon her return to Ethiopia.\n\n           On April 9, 2002, Chebude appealed from the IJ's denial\n\nof her petition for asylum.       She did not challenge the IJ's denial\n\nof her petition for withholding of departure or CAT protection. In\n\nher brief to the BIA, she stated, \"The only issue in the instant\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fcase is whether conditions have changed in the Respondent's country\n\n. . . to permit the Respondent to return to her country of\n\nnationality without fear.\"         She argued that the \"INS has not\n\nestablished by preponderance of evidence [that] the government of\n\nEthiopia has stopped deporting Ethiopians of Eritrean origin.\"\n\nChebude's brief did not challenge the IJ's finding that she had not\n\nsuffered past persecution or the IJ's conclusion that there was no\n\nevidence that Ethiopians of Eritrean descent were still being\n\ndenied housing, education, and employment at that time.\n\n           On September 8, 2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ's denial of\n\nasylum. The BIA held that Chebude bore the burden of demonstrating\n\na well-founded fear of future persecution \"because the Immigration\n\nJudge   correctly    determined    that   she   did   not   establish   past\n\npersecution.\"      Citing the State Department's country conditions\n\nreport, the BIA determined that Chebude had not met that burden.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           We    review   the   BIA's   decision   under    the   deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard. Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 38,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 2004).       Under that standard, we must affirm the BIA\n\nunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but\n\ncompels it.     Id.; see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992).   Where, as here, the BIA adopted the IJ's reasoning, we\n\nreview that reasoning as if it were articulated by the BIA in the\n\nfirst instance.     Pieterson, 364 F.3d at 43 n.2.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            To be eligible for asylum, an applicant bears the burden\n\nof establishing that she meets the statutory definition of a\n\nrefugee under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\nTo satisfy that definition, the applicant must demonstrate \"a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"     8   U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(42)(A);   see   also    8   C.F.R.   §\n\n208.13(b); Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).          That\n\nfear can be demonstrated in two ways.        First, the applicant can\n\ndemonstrate past persecution on one of the five statutory grounds.\n\nSuch a showing creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Khem, 342 F.3d at 53.\n\nSecond, the applicant can establish a genuine and objectively\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2); El\n\nMoraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 202-03 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Chebude contends that she has met her burden here.          She\n\nraises two new arguments regarding her asylum claim that were not\n\narticulated in her brief to the BIA: (1) that she demonstrated past\n\npersecution based on the deportation of her brothers and the\n\nEthiopian government's repeated attempts to deport her, and (2)\n\nthat she established a genuine and objectively reasonable fear\n\nthat, as an Ethiopian of Eritrean origin, she would be deprived of\n\nhousing, employment, access to government services, her right to\n\nvote, and her citizenship if returned to Ethiopia.            We decline to\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconsider either argument.            Arguments not raised to the BIA are\n\nwaived for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.                   Opere v.\n\nINS, 267 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2001); Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195\n\nF.3d   56,   64   (1st    Cir.   1999).         That   Chebude   mentioned    these\n\narguments in her notice of appeal to the BIA does not excuse her\n\nfailure to raise them in her brief to the BIA.                    See Cumberland\n\nFarms, Inc. v. Montague Econ. Dev. and Indus. Corp., 78 F.3d 10, 12\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that appellant waived an issue raised\n\nin its notice of appeal when it did not refer to the issue in its\n\nbrief).\n\n             The only argument that Chebude raised to the BIA was that\n\nthe State Department's country conditions report did not suffice to\n\nnegate her genuine and objectively reasonable fear of deportation\n\nupon her return to Ethiopia.              Substantial evidence supports the\n\nBIA's rejection of this argument.                 The 2001 country conditions\n\nreport states that \"the Government stopped forcibly deporting\n\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin after it signed the\n\ncessation of hostilities agreement with Eritrea in June 2000\" and\n\nthat 2,892 such persons were repatriated in 2000.                 It also states\n\nthat 80,000 to 100,000 individuals of Eritrean descent continued to\n\nreside in Ethiopia as of the date of the report in 2001.                     Chebude\n\nconceded     in   her    testimony   to    the    IJ   that   \"[a]t   this    moment\n\ncurrently the government is not directly deporting people from\n\nEthiopia to Eritria.\"\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            The   country   conditions   report     does   mention    that\n\n\"Ethiopians of Eritrean origin have been able to obtain exit visas\n\n[to leave Ethiopia] but often are not permitted to return to the\n\ncountry.\"   That statement, though, does not indicate that Ethiopia\n\nhas resumed deportations.        There are concerns that the peace\n\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia may not last.        But we cannot say that\n\nthose concerns compel the conclusion that Chebude would likely face\n\ndeportation upon returning to Ethiopia.\n\n            Chebude also argues that she is entitled to withholding\n\nof departure.     That claim has been waived, as she did not challenge\n\nthe IJ's denial of that relief in her petition to the BIA.           Opere,\n\n267 F.3d at 14.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            The BIA's denial of asylum is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\nTo satisfy that definition, the applicant must demonstrate \"a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"     8   U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(42)(A);   see   also    8   C.F.R.   §\n\n208.13(b); Khem v.

That\n\nfear can be demonstrated in two ways.        First, the applicant can\n\ndemonstrate past persecution on one of the five statutory grounds.\n\nSuch a showing creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); Khem, 342 F.3d at 53.\n\nSecond, the applicant can establish a genuine and objectively\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2); El\n\nMoraghy v.

She\n\nraises two new arguments regarding her asylum claim that were not\n\narticulated in her brief to the BIA: (1) that she demonstrated past\n\npersecution based on the deportation of her brothers and the\n\nEthiopian government's repeated attempts to deport her, and (2)\n\nthat she established a genuine and objectively reasonable fear\n\nthat, as an Ethiopian of Eritrean origin, she would be deprived of\n\nhousing, employment, access to government services, her right to\n\nvote, and her citizenship if returned to Ethiopia.            We decline to\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconsider either argument.            Arguments not raised to the BIA are\n\nwaived for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

That   Chebude   mentioned    these\n\narguments in her notice of appeal to the BIA does not excuse her\n\nfailure to raise them in her brief to the BIA.                    See Cumberland\n\nFarms, Inc. v. Montague Econ. Dev. and Indus. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196630\"><a href=\"/opinion/196630/cumberland-farms-v-montague-economic/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that appellant waived an issue raised\n\nin its notice of appeal when it did not refer to the issue in its\n\nbrief).\n\n             The only argument that Chebude raised to the BIA was that\n\nthe State Department's country conditions report did not suffice to\n\nnegate her genuine and objectively reasonable fear of deportation\n\nupon her return to Ethiopia.              Substantial evidence supports the\n\nBIA's rejection of this argument.                 The 2001 country conditions\n\nreport states that \"the Government stopped forcibly deporting\n\nEritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin after it signed the\n\ncessation of hostilities agreement with Eritrea in June 2000\" and\n\nthat 2,892 such persons were repatriated in 2000.                 It also states\n\nthat 80,000 to 100,000 individuals of Eritrean descent continued to\n\nreside in Ethiopia as of the date of the report in 2001.                     Chebude\n\nconceded     in   her    testimony   to    the    IJ   that   \"[a]t   this    moment\n\ncurrently the government is not directly deporting people from\n\nEthiopia to Eritria.\"\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f            The   country   conditions   report     does   mention    that\n\n\"Ethiopians of Eritrean origin have been able to obtain exit visas\n\n[to leave Ethiopia] but often are not permitted to return to the\n\ncountry.\"   That statement, though, does not indicate that Ethiopia\n\nhas resumed deportations.        There are concerns that the peace\n\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia may not last.        But we cannot say that\n\nthose concerns compel the conclusion that Chebude would likely face\n\ndeportation upon returning to Ethiopia.\n\n            Chebude also argues that she is entitled to withholding\n\nof departure.     That claim has been waived, as she did not challenge\n\nthe IJ's denial of that relief in her petition to the BIA.
