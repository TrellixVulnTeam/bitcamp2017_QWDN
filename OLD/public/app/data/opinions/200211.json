Powers was on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n                       November 19, 2002\n\n____________________\n     * Hon. Betty B. Fletcher, of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      On April 27, 2000, Plaintiff\n\nRichard Hatch was arrested by the Middletown, Rhode Island police\n\ndepartment and charged with assaulting his adopted son (\"John\n\nDoe\").1   There was immediate media interest in the arrest due to\n\nHatch's impending television appearance on the reality game show\n\nSurvivor during its premier season.     Although the police initially\n\nreleased only a redacted copy of Hatch's arrest report to the\n\npress, the National Enquirer soon procured Hatch's redacted mug\n\nshot and a copy of his son's statement to the police, featuring\n\nboth in an article published on May 16, 2000.     Hatch subsequently\n\nfiled this ยง 1983 and state law action against the Town of\n\nMiddletown, Shawn J. Brown, Frank Kluth, Barry Smith, David Leonard\n\nand other unnamed police officers in the United States District\n\nCourt, claiming Fourth Amendment violations arising from a false\n\narrest and violations of his right to privacy under federal and\n\nstate law.\n\n            The district court initially granted defendants' summary\n\njudgment motion in part, dismissing Hatch's Fourth Amendment claim,\n\nhis constitutionally-grounded 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claim, and his state\n\nlaw privacy claims against all defendants except unidentified\n\nofficers.    With respect to the claims against Captain Leonard and\n\nLieutenant Smith, the court determined that the individual police\n\n\n     1\n      Ultimately, the state dropped the assault charges against\nHatch after a Rhode Island Family Court concluded that there was no\nprobable cause to believe that the child had been abused.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fofficers could assert qualified immunity to escape civil liability\n\nunder Rhode Island's privacy statute.       The court at first denied\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment on the state law privacy\n\nclaims   against   various   unnamed   police   officers   who   allegedly\n\nreleased Hatch's mug shot and excerpts of the statement made to the\n\npolice by appellant's son.    The judge issued an Order to Show Cause\n\nwhy the case should not be dismissed since the only remaining\n\ndefendants were unidentified officers.      Hatch failed to answer the\n\nOrder to Show Cause, and the district court dismissed the case.\n\n           Hatch now appeals only his state law privacy claims\n\nagainst Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith.2      After reviewing the\n\n\n     2\n      When Hatch originally sought redress in the district court\nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for alleged violations of his federal right\nto privacy, the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction\nover appellant's pendent state law privacy claims. See 28 U.S.C.\nยง 1367 (1993).    We retain jurisdiction over Hatch's state law\nclaims on appeal even though Hatch has not appealed his federal\nprivacy claims. See United Int'l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf Holdings\nLtd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1219-20 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"The scope of a\nfederal court's jurisdictional power . . . does not fluctuate with\nthe fate of a federal claim at trial or on appeal, but exists if\nthe federal claim initially had substance sufficient to confer\nsubject matter jurisdiction on the [district] court.\").\n     The Tenth Circuit subsequently observed that \"[a] federal\nclaim is insubstantial, and incapable of conferring jurisdiction,\nonly if it is obviously without merit or is wholly frivolous, or is\nclearly foreclosed by prior decisions of the Supreme Court.\" Id.\nat 1220 (internal citations omitted). Appellees do not argue that\nthe district court abused its discretion in exercising supplemental\njurisdiction over Hatch's state law claims, and our review of the\nrecord does not indicate that Hatch's federal privacy claims were\nsufficiently devoid of merit to vitiate federal subject matter\njurisdiction over Hatch's state law claims on appeal.           See\nPejepscot Indus. Park, Inc. v. Maine Cent. R.R. Co., 215 F.3d 195,\n200 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that standard of review for\nsupplemental jurisdiction determinations is abuse of discretion).\n\n                                  -3-\n\frecord, we agree with the district court that Captain Leonard acted\n\nreasonably in the face of two conflicting state statutes, and\n\nfurther conclude that Hatch has failed to establish a claim for\n\nviolation of privacy against Lieutenant Smith under Rhode Island's\n\nPrivacy Statute.    Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                           I.   BACKGROUND\n\n          The events leading up to Richard Hatch's arrest are well\n\ndocumented in Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth & Their Families\n\n(Hatch I), 274 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2001).3       We briefly recount them\n\nhere before turning to the post-arrest period.       On the morning of\n\nApril 27, 2000, a teacher and nurse at John's elementary school\n\nnoticed that John had a bump on his forehead and red marks across\n\nhis neck. John disclosed that he had sustained the injuries during\n\nan early morning run with his father.        According to John, he was\n\nhaving trouble keeping the pace set by the appellant, causing him\n\nto fall to the pavement.   John claimed that Hatch reacted by first\n\npulling the boy up by his earlobe and then forcing him to do\n\npushups by grabbing his neck and pushing his head into the cement.\n\n\n\n     3\n      In Hatch I, Richard Hatch brought suit against the Rhode\nIsland Department for Children, Youth, and Their Families and two\nagency caseworkers, seeking monetary damages for alleged violations\nof his due process right to uninterrupted custody of his child. We\naffirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment for\ndefendants after determining that the Eleventh Amendment barred\nHatch's suit against the agency, and that the caseworkers were\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fAfter hearing John's story, school officials contacted the Rhode\n\nIsland Department for Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) and\n\nthe Middletown police.     Two police officers brought John to the\n\nMiddletown police station, where he was interviewed by a DCYF\n\ncaseworker and examined by a doctor.         The police then contacted\n\nHatch and asked him to report to the police station.           Upon his\n\narrival he was arrested and charged with assaulting his son.          The\n\nnext day, Captain David Leonard, the Public Information Officer for\n\nthe Middletown police, redacted a copy of plaintiff's arrest report\n\nand released it to the media.      The information withheld from the\n\nreport   included    the   mug   shot   of   the   plaintiff   and    the\n\nidentification of the child.\n\n             Over the next few days Captain Leonard fielded requests\n\nfrom the local and national media for Hatch's arrest report and\n\narraignment information. After the initial media blitz, Lieutenant\n\nBarry Smith received a call from the National Enquirer.                He\n\ninformed the Enquirer that \"the bump on the boy's head was the size\n\nof an egg.    He had red marks on his neck and other bruises.\"       A May\n\n16, 2000 article reporting Hatch's arrest included this comment as\n\nwell as the mug shot withheld from his arrest report and large\n\nexcerpts of John's statement to the police.           Lieutenant Smith\n\ndenied having released the mug shot or John's statement to the\n\nNational Enquirer.     Although appellees concede that this release\n\nwas a violation of department policy, Hatch offered no evidence to\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fimplicate Lieutenant Smith or any other Middletown police officer\n\nin the unauthorized release of these materials.\n\n           The district court granted defendants' summary judgment\n\nmotion and dismissed Hatch's false arrest and privacy claims.    In\n\nthis appeal, Hatch challenges the district court's bench ruling\n\nthat the two police officers were entitled to qualified immunity\n\ngiven the uncertainty under Rhode Island law as to what information\n\nconcerning Hatch's arrest could be released as a public record:\n\n           That would be a very difficult question\n           because there's two statutes that seem to\n           conflict here . . . . Given those conflicting\n           statutes and given the fact that Mr. Hatch's\n           privacy right under Rhode Island law arises\n           from a statute that requires, among other\n           things, that the fact be a private fact, it\n           seems to me that it is totally unreasonable\n           and unrealistic to expect that a reasonable\n           officer, under these circumstances, would have\n           recognized that releasing this information\n           violated some right of Mr. Hatch's if, in\n           fact, it did.\n\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\nKelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002), and begin our\n\nanalysis by examining the relevant Rhode Island statutes.\n\n                          II.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Dissemination of Arrest Information Under Rhode Island Law\n\n           Appellant bases his state cause of action on Rhode Island\n\nGeneral Laws ยง 9-1-28.1(b) (the \"Privacy Statute\"), which states in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n           Every person who subjects or causes to be\n           subjected any citizen of this state . . . to a\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           deprivation and/or violation of his or her\n           right to privacy shall be liable to the party\n           injured in an action at law, suit in equity,\n           or any other appropriate proceedings for\n           redress in either the superior court or\n           district court of this state.\n\n\nTo recover civil damages for a privacy violation, the plaintiff\n\nmust establish that:\n\n           (A)      There has been some publication of a private\n                    fact;\n\n           (B)      The fact which has been made public must be one\n                    which would be offensive or objectionable to a\n                    reasonable man of ordinary sensibilities.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws ยง 9-1-28.1(a)(3)(i).\n\n           For a fact to be \"private\" within the meaning of the\n\nstatute, \"plaintiffs must demonstrate that they actually expected\n\na   disclosed    fact    to   remain   private,   and   that   society   would\n\nrecognize this expectation of privacy as reasonable and be willing\n\nto respect it.\"         Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856, 865 (R.I.\n\n1997).   While this standard frequently presents questions of fact,\n\nthe Supreme Court of Rhode Island has categorically determined that\n\nplaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect\n\nto information contained in a public record:            \"[I]t is clear that\n\nthe statutory right to privacy in Rhode Island does not extend to\n\nthose records deemed public.\" Doe v. Edward A. Sherman Publ'g Co.,\n\n593 A.2d 457, 459 (R.I. 1991). Consequently, the critical issue in\n\nthis case is whether Hatch's arrest report is considered a public\n\nrecord under Rhode Island law.               The parties point us to two\n\n                                       -7-\n\fstatutes that bear on the classification of this information -- the\n\nRhode Island Access to Public Records (\"Public Records\") Statute\n\nthat compels the release of all arrest records, and the Child Abuse\n\nStatute that requires all records concerning reports of child abuse\n\nto be kept confidential.4\n\n           1.   The Rhode Island Access to Public Records Statute\n\n           Of the two statutes that potentially govern the status of\n\nRichard Hatch's arrest information, only the Public Records Statute\n\nrefers specifically to arrest records.      See R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 38-2-\n\n2(4)(i)(D).     The statute narrowly circumscribes the universe of\n\nrecords   maintained   by   law   enforcement   agencies   that   are   not\n\nconsidered public records, providing that \"records shall not be\n\ndeemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the records\n\nor information . . . (c) could reasonably be expected to constitute\n\nan unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"       Id.    However, this\n\nprovision concludes with the following caveat: \"Records relating to\n\nmanagement and direction of a law enforcement agency and records or\n\nreports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or\n\ncharges brought against an adult shall be public.\"         Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n           The significance of classifying particular documents as\n\n\"public records\" under Rhode Island law is twofold.           First, any\n\n\n     4\n      The relevant provisions of these two statutes and the Rhode\nIsland Privacy Statute are reproduced in the Appendix at the end of\nthis opinion.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fperson is entitled to review and/or duplicate public records under\n\nreasonable conditions prescribed by the custodian: \"Except as\n\nprovided in ยง 38-3-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file by\n\nany public body . . . shall be public records and every person or\n\nentity shall have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at\n\nsuch   reasonable    time    as   may    be   determined   by   the   custodian\n\nthereof.\"     R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 38-2-3(a).            Hence, sections 38-2-\n\n2(4)(i)(D) and 38-2-3(a) impose an affirmative obligation on law\n\nenforcement agencies to make arrest records available to the\n\npublic.     Second, as noted above, a determination that particular\n\nrecords are public is dispositive as to any privacy claims arising\n\nfrom the release of those records.            Edward A. Sherman Publ'g, 593\n\nA.2d at 458.\n\n            2. The Rhode Island Child Abuse Statute\n\n            Recognizing that certain state or federal laws may impose\n\nconfidentiality requirements with respect to specific information,\n\nthe Public Records Statute places that information outside the\n\nscope of Title 38: \"For the purposes of this chapter, the following\n\nrecords shall not be deemed public . . . (S) Records, reports,\n\nopinions,     information,    and       statements   required    to   be   kept\n\nconfidential by federal law or regulation or state law, or rule of\n\ncourt.\"     R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 38-2-2(4)(i)(S).\n\n             The Rhode Island Child Abuse Statute arguably functions\n\nas such a law.      Without explicitly mentioning arrest records, the\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fstatute provides that \"[a]ll records concerning reports of child\n\nabuse and neglect, including reports made to the department,5 shall\n\nbe confidential except as specifically provided by this chapter .\n\n. . .\"   R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 40-11-13(a).             The subsequent clause of the\n\nprovision imposes penalties for the disclosure of these records,\n\nbut limits the class of people subject to punishment: \"Any employee\n\nor agent of the department violating any of the provisions of this\n\nsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not\n\nmore than two hundred dollars ($200) or shall be imprisoned for not\n\nmore than six (6) months or both.\"             R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 40-11-13(b).\n\n            3. Interpreting the Public Records and Child Abuse\n            Statutes\n\n            Read     together,   the    Public      Records    and    Child   Abuse\n\nStatutes     are     susceptible       to     at    least     three    reasonable\n\ninterpretations.       Appellees observe that ยง 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the\n\nPublic     Records    Statute    classifies         all   \"records    or   reports\n\nreflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges\n\nbrought against an adult\" as public documents.                  They argue that\n\nbecause Hatch's arrest record clearly falls within the scope of\n\nthis provision, Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith only divulged\n\ninformation that was already deemed public under Rhode Island law.\n\nAppellees further assert that ยง 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute\n\n\n\n     5\n      The \"department\" referred to in ยง 40-11-13(a) is defined\nearlier in Chapter 11 of Title 40 as the DCYF. R.I. Gen. Laws ยง\n40-11-2.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fdoes   not        specifically   refer     to    arrest     records   in    its\n\nconfidentiality provision, and by its terms in subsections (a) and\n\n(b) appears only to encompass DCYF records and personnel rather\n\nthan the records of a local police department.               Hence, the Child\n\nAbuse Statute does not undermine the public status of the arrest\n\ninformation in the records of the Middletown police department.\n\n             Alternatively, the language of ยง 40-11-13(a) of the Child\n\nAbuse Statute emphasizes that \"all records concerning reports of\n\nchild abuse and neglect, including reports made to the department,\n\nshall be confidential . . . .\"               R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 40-11-13(a)\n\n(emphasis added). Significantly, the phrase \"all records\" in ยง 40-\n\n11-13(a)     is     not   modified   by    any   language    restricting    the\n\nconfidentiality requirement to DCYF records or personnel. Thus the\n\nChild Abuse Statute might be precisely the kind of confidentiality\n\nstatute contemplated by ยง 38-2-2(4)(i)(S) of the Public Records\n\nStatute, which removes particular records from its purview if\n\nanother law mandates that the records remain confidential.                 Under\n\nthis reading of the statutes, ยง 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute\n\ncreates an exception to the final sentence of ยง 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of\n\nthe Public Records Statute, and prohibits the release of any\n\ninformation concerning reports of child abuse.\n\n             Hatch forgoes this hardline stance in favor of a third\n\ninterpretation of the statutes.           Focusing on the language of ยง 38-\n\n2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute, he argues that the\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fphrase \"records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an\n\nadult and charges brought against [him]\" only authorizes the\n\ndisclosure of a skeletal account of the arrest consistent with the\n\nprovision's denial of public record status to information that\n\n\"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion\n\nof personal privacy.\"      To the extent that any information beyond\n\nRichard Hatch's name and a simple recitation of the charge was\n\nreleased to the media, Hatch insists that his right to privacy was\n\nviolated.\n\n            We find no guidance in the statutes or common law of\n\nRhode Island to aid us in determining what level of detail runs\n\nafoul of the \"reflecting\" language in ยง 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the\n\nPublic Records Statute.      Indeed, the reasonableness of all three\n\ninterpretations illustrates the difficulties faced by Rhode Island\n\npolice officers unsure as to whether an arrest record containing a\n\nreport of child abuse is considered a public record.\n\nB.   Qualified Immunity\n\n            1.    General Principles\n\n            We observed in Hatch I that \"the law strives to balance\n\nits desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state\n\nactors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants\n\nfrom undue interference with the performance of their duties and\n\nfrom threats of liability which, though unfounded, may nevertheless\n\nbe   unbearably    disruptive.\"   Hatch,   274   F.3d   at   20   (quoting\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fBuenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1992)).   In the ยง\n\n1983 context, the United States Supreme Court has struck this\n\nbalance by applying a two-part test to determine whether plaintiffs\n\nmay hold government officials civilly liable for alleged violations\n\nof constitutional and federal statutory rights:\n\n          [A]ppellate assessment of a qualified immunity\n          claim is apportioned into two analytic\n          components. First, if the right asserted by\n          the plaintiff was \"clearly established\" at the\n          time of its alleged violation, we are required\n          to assume that the right was recognized by the\n          defendant    official,     see    Harlow   [v.\n          Fitzgerald], 457 U.S. [800,] 818 [(1982)];\n          Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899, 901 (1st\n          Cir. 1989); second, we will deny the immunity\n          claim if a reasonable official situated in the\n          same circumstances should have understood that\n          the   challenged    conduct    violated   that\n          established    right,    see    Anderson   [v.\n          Creighton], 483 U.S. [635,] 640-41 [(1987)];\n          Rodriguez, 888 F.2d at 901.\n\nBurns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235-36 (1st Cir. 1990); see also\n\nCamilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1999); Aponte\n\nMatos v. Toledo Davila, 135 F.3d 182, 186 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Both prongs of this standard afford government officials\n\nsome degree of protection when they confront statutory ambiguity\n\nwhile executing their official duties.    If we assume that state\n\nofficers in Rhode Island may seek the same qualified immunity from\n\nstate law actions that is available to state officials sued under\n\nยง 1983, the contradictory provisions in the case at bar in the\n\nPublic Records and Child Abuse statutes undermine Hatch's claim\n\nthat his rights were \"clearly established\" with respect to the\n\n                               -13-\n\fnarrow question of whether police officers are prohibited from\n\nreleasing arrest reports containing information of child abuse. As\n\nwe observed in Aponte Matos, this resolution of the first prong is\n\nsufficient to support a finding of qualified immunity.               Aponte\n\nMatos,   135    F.3d   at   187.   Alternatively,   under   the   objective\n\n\"reasonable officer\" standard embodied in the second prong, Captain\n\nLeonard and Lieutenant Smith are strong candidates for qualified\n\nimmunity given the absence of any basis for a \"reasonable officer\"\n\nto conclude that one of the three interpretations outlined above is\n\nthe only correct one.\n\n           However, before we can conclude that the two police\n\nofficers are entitled to qualified immunity, we must examine our\n\nearlier assumption that Rhode Island provides immunity in state law\n\nactions comparable to the immunity that state officers enjoy in ยง\n\n1983 cases, and determine whether this is actually the case.\n\n           2.    Qualified Immunity Under Rhode Island Law\n\n           Although counsel for Hatch conceded at oral argument that\n\nqualified immunity is available to state officers defending claims\n\nunder Rhode Island law, there is no decision from the Supreme Court\n\nof Rhode Island expressly affording government officials common law\n\nimmunity from state law claims.        Nonetheless, Rhode Island's high\n\ncourt has left little doubt that the defense exists for state\n\nofficers under certain circumstances.       In Pontbriand, the Governor\n\nof Rhode Island released the account information of bank depositors\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fto encourage the state legislature to pass legislation compensating\n\ndepositors in state banks and credit unions that were closed\n\nbecause they had no federal deposit insurance.                 Pontbriand, 699\n\nA.2d 856.      The account holders brought suit alleging violations of\n\ntheir right to privacy under state law, prompting the Governor to\n\nclaim that he was entitled to \"good faith\" immunity even if his\n\nactions violated the state privacy statute.              Id.    Reviewing the\n\navailability of this defense, the court observed that \"[a]lthough\n\nnot extensively discussed in our prior cases, it seems beyond doubt\n\nthat the Governor may be entitled to some form of common law\n\nimmunity for his acts performed in good faith.\"                Pontbriand, 699\n\nA.2d at 867 (original emphasis) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\n\nU.S. 800, 813-19 (1982), and Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 247-\n\n48 (1974)).       The court declined to rule on the availability of\n\nimmunity, observing that \"the issue was neither extensively briefed\n\nby     the    parties   nor   reached     by   the   trial   justice     below.\"\n\nPontbriand, 699 A.2d at 867. However, the court signaled the trial\n\njudge that barring plaintiffs' claims on grounds of qualified\n\nimmunity remained an option on remand: \"[W]e are of the opinion\n\nthat    the    determination    regarding      whether   official      qualified\n\nimmunity exists should be left for determination upon remand.\" Id.\n\n              Two years after issuing its decision in Pontbriand, the\n\nSupreme Court of Rhode Island addressed qualified immunity in a\n\ncontext similar to the facts of this case.             See Ensey v. Culhane,\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f727 A.2d 687 (R.I. 1999).           Ensey was falsely accused by his ex-\n\ngirlfriend       of     kidnaping    and     raping     her     at     gunpoint.\n\nNotwithstanding the existence of facts strongly suggesting the\n\nplaintiff's innocence, the police obtained an arrest warrant and\n\nissued a verbal press statement revealing Ensey's identity, the\n\ncharges, and the facts surrounding the investigation.                  After the\n\npolice uncovered the fabrication, plaintiff filed suit against the\n\nSuperintendent of the State Police and ten unnamed police officers,\n\nalleging     a   host    of   violations     of   his   state    and     federal\n\nconstitutional rights and his right to privacy under Rhode Island\n\nlaw. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island made the following comments\n\nin reviewing the defendants' assertion of qualified immunity:\n\n           [D]efendants argue that the doctrine of\n           qualified immunity, an immunity typically\n           afforded to government officials on the\n           federal level, bars plaintiff's claims.      We\n           are of the opinion that, in an appropriate\n           case, the doctrine of qualified immunity might\n           well be applied by this Court. See Harlow v.\n           Fitzgerald,   457   U.S.    800,   818   (1982)\n           (\"government       officials       performing\n           discretionary    functions,    generally    are\n           shielded from liability for civil damages\n           insofar as their conduct does not violate\n           clearly     established       statutory      or\n           constitutional rights of which a reasonable\n           person would have known\").\n\nId. at 690-91.          However, because Ensey could not identify the\n\npolice officers who allegedly violated his rights during the\n\ninvestigation, the court did not reach the question of whether\n\nparticular state officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f          Significantly,     Pontbriand     and    Ensey   reflect      Rhode\n\nIsland's recognition of a qualified immunity defense under state\n\nlaw analogous to the federal doctrine established by the United\n\nStates Supreme Court in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, cited with approval\n\nin both Rhode Island decisions, and routinely applied in ยง 1983\n\ncases.   Hence, we conclude that Hatch's concession that qualified\n\nimmunity is available to officers defending state law claims is\n\nwell grounded in the law of Rhode Island.\n\n          3.    Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith\n\n          Captain Leonard had to navigate between two statutes,\n\nboth of which purported to bestow individual rights on a segment of\n\nthe population.       The Public Records Statute expressly grants\n\nindividuals the right to inspect and/or duplicate any documents\n\nthat are classified as public records, including \"records or\n\nreports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or\n\ncharges brought against an adult . . . .\"          R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 38-2-\n\n2(4)(i)(D).     The Child Abuse Statute protects the parties to an\n\nalleged incident of child abuse by preserving the confidentiality\n\nof all records documenting the event.            R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 40-11-\n\n13(a). Hence, if Captain Leonard had interpreted ยง 40-11-13 of the\n\nChild Abuse Statute to prohibit the release of Hatch's arrest\n\nrecord   in    its   entirety,    members   of    the   media   could    have\n\nlegitimately argued that the police department had violated the\n\nPublic Records Statute.          Given these uncertainties under Rhode\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fIsland law, Captain Leonard did not violate any clearly established\n\nright of Hatch to the privacy of the information released to the\n\nmedia by Leonard. Accordingly, we find that Leonard is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity under Rhode Island law.\n\n           As for Lieutenant Smith, we do not even have to reach the\n\nissue of qualified immunity.     His minor embellishments of the\n\narrest report, while probably ill-advised, did not divulge new\n\ninformation.   Instead, he merely characterized facts contained in\n\na document that had previously been released to the media.     Once\n\nCaptain Leonard released the report to the press, Hatch could no\n\nlonger maintain the expectation that the details contained in the\n\npublicized report would remain private.      Swerdlick v. Koch, 721\n\nA.2d 849, 859 (R.I. 1998) (\"There is no liability [for publication\n\nof private facts] when the defendant merely gives further publicity\n\nto information about the plaintiff that is already public.\")\n\n(quoting Restatement (Second) Torts, ยง 652D cmt. b).         Hence,\n\nSmith's subsequent release of information to the National Enquirer\n\ncannot form the basis of a claim under Rhode Island's Privacy\n\nStatute.\n\n           Hatch's complaint also names the Town of Middletown as a\n\ndefendant. However, his arguments to the district court throughout\n\nthe summary judgment phase and before us focus entirely on the\n\nliability of Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith to the exclusion\n\nof the Town.   Indeed, appellant's brief contains only two opaque\n\n\n                                -18-\n\freferences to the Town's policies, without any elaboration of a\n\ntheory of municipal liability.            We will not address a claim\n\ndeveloped so perfunctorily.6       Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., 916\n\nF.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is settled in this circuit that\n\nissues adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\n\nby   some   developed     argumentation,     are   deemed   to   have   been\n\nabandoned.\").\n\n            Accordingly,    the   district   court's   entry     of   summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants is affirmed.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      There are also vague and undeveloped references to unnamed\npolice officers in appellant's brief. With regard to the officers\nwho allegedly released Hatch's mug shot and John Doe's statement to\nthe police, we note that the district court's initial grant of\npartial summary judgment left open the possibility that Hatch could\nproceed to trial against these officers. However, Hatch's failure\nto proffer any evidence identifying the officers responsible for\nthe release of these materials led the district court to dismiss\nthis element of his claim as well, and Hatch's brief cannot be read\nto challenge this ruling on appeal.\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f                              Appendix\n\n\nAll references below are to provisions of the Rhode Island General\nLaws (2001).\n\n\n9-1-28.1   Right to Privacy -- Action for Deprivation of Right\n\n\n                  (a)   Right to privacy created.

Although the police initially released only a redacted copy of Hatch's arrest report to the press, the <i>National Enquirer</i> soon procured Hatch's redacted mug shot and a copy of his son's statement to the police, featuring both in an article published on May 16, 2000. Hatch subsequently filed this &#167; 1983 and state law action against the Town of Middletown, Shawn J. Brown, Frank Kluth, Barry Smith, David Leonard and other unnamed police officers in the United States District Court, claiming Fourth Amendment violations arising from a false arrest and violations of his right to privacy under federal and state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court initially granted defendants' summary judgment motion in part, dismissing Hatch's Fourth Amendment claim, his constitutionally-grounded 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 claim, and his state law privacy claims against all defendants except unidentified officers. With respect to the claims against Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith, the court determined that the individual police officers could assert qualified immunity to escape civil liability under Rhode Island's privacy statute. The court at first denied defendants' motion for summary judgment on the state law privacy claims against various unnamed police officers who allegedly released Hatch's mug shot and excerpts of the statement made to the police by appellant's son. The judge issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed since the only remaining defendants were unidentified officers.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events leading up to Richard Hatch's arrest are well documented in <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth &amp; Their Families (Hatch I),</i> 274 F.3d 12 (1st Cir.2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We briefly recount them here before turning to the post-arrest period. On the morning of April 27, 2000, a teacher and nurse at John's elementary school noticed that John had a bump on his forehead and red marks across his neck. John disclosed that he had sustained the injuries during an early morning run with his father. According to John, he was having trouble keeping the pace set by the appellant, causing him to fall to the pavement. John claimed that Hatch reacted by first pulling the boy up by his earlobe and then forcing him to do pushups by grabbing his neck and pushing his head into the cement. After hearing John's story, school officials contacted the Rhode Island Department for Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) and the Middletown police. Two police officers brought John to the Middletown police station, where he was interviewed by a DCYF caseworker and examined by a doctor. The police then contacted Hatch and asked him to report to the police station. Upon his arrival he was arrested and charged with assaulting his son. The next day, Captain David Leonard, the Public Information Officer for the Middletown police, redacted a copy of plaintiff's arrest report and released it to the media. The information withheld from the report included the mug shot of the plaintiff and the identification of the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next few days Captain Leonard fielded requests from the local and national media for Hatch's arrest report and arraignment information. After the initial media blitz, Lieutenant Barry Smith received a call from the <i>National Enquirer.</i> He informed the <i>Enquirer</i> that \"the bump on the boy's head was the size of an egg. He had red marks on his neck and other bruises.\" A May 16, 2000 article reporting Hatch's arrest included this comment as well as the mug shot withheld from his arrest report and large excerpts of John's statement to the police. Lieutenant Smith denied having released the mug shot or John's statement to the <i>National Enquirer.</i> Although appellees concede that this release was a violation of department policy, Hatch offered no evidence to implicate Lieutenant Smith or any other Middletown police officer in the unauthorized release of these materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' summary judgment motion and dismissed Hatch's false arrest and privacy claims. In this appeal, Hatch challenges the district court's bench ruling that the two police officers were entitled to qualified immunity given the uncertainty under Rhode Island law as to what information concerning Hatch's arrest could be released as a public record:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That would be a very difficult question because there's two statutes that seem to conflict here.... Given those conflicting statutes and given the fact that Mr. Hatch's privacy right under Rhode Island law arises from a statute that requires, among other things, that the fact be a private fact, it seems to me that it is totally unreasonable and unrealistic to expect that a reasonable officer, under these circumstances, would have recognized that releasing this information violated some right of Mr. Hatch's if, in fact, it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, <i>Kelley v.

Sundlun,</i> 699 A.2d 856, 865 (R.I.1997). While this standard frequently presents questions of fact, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has categorically determined that plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to information contained in a public record: \"[I]t is clear that the statutory right to privacy in Rhode Island does not extend to those records deemed public.\" <i>Doe v. Edward A. Sherman Publ'g Co.,</i> 593 A.2d 457, 459 (R.I.1991). Consequently, the critical issue in this case is whether Hatch's arrest report is considered a public record under Rhode Island law. The parties point us to two statutes that bear on the classification of this information &#8212; the Rhode Island Access to Public Records (\"Public Records\") Statute that compels the release of all arrest records, and the Child Abuse Statute that requires all records concerning reports of child abuse to be kept confidential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Rhode Island Access to Public Records Statute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the two statutes that potentially govern the status of Richard Hatch's arrest information, only the Public Records Statute refers specifically to arrest records. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D). The statute narrowly circumscribes the universe of records maintained by law enforcement agencies that are <i>not</i> considered public records, providing that \"records shall not be deemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the records or information ... (c) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" <i>Id.</i> However, this provision concludes with the following caveat: \"Records relating to management and direction of a law enforcement agency <i>and records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult shall be public.\" Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The significance of classifying particular documents as \"public records\" under Rhode Island law is twofold. First, any person is entitled to review and/or duplicate public records under reasonable conditions prescribed by the custodian: \"Except as provided in &#167; 38-3-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file by any public body ... shall be public records and every person or entity shall have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at such reasonable time as may be determined by the custodian thereof.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2-3(a). Hence, sections 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) and 38-2-3(a) impose an affirmative obligation on law enforcement agencies to make arrest records available to the public. Second, as noted above, a determination that particular records are public is dispositive as to any privacy claims arising from the release of those records. <i>Edward A. Sherman Publ'g,</i> 593 A.2d at 458.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Rhode Island Child Abuse Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that certain state or federal laws may impose confidentiality requirements with respect to specific information, the Public Records Statute places that information outside the scope of Title 38: \"For the purposes of this chapter, the following records shall not be deemed public... (S) Records, reports, opinions, information, and statements required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulation or state law, or rule of court.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(S).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island Child Abuse Statute arguably functions as such a law. Without explicitly mentioning arrest records, the statute provides that \"[a]ll records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect, including reports made to the department,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> shall be confidential except as specifically provided by this chapter....\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(a). The subsequent clause of the provision imposes penalties for the disclosure of these records, but limits the class of people subject to punishment: \"Any employee or agent of the department violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars ($200) or shall be imprisoned for not more than six (6) months or both.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Interpreting the Public Records and Child Abuse Statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read together, the Public Records and Child Abuse Statutes are susceptible to at least three reasonable interpretations. Appellees observe that &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute classifies all \"records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult\" as public documents. They argue that because Hatch's arrest record clearly falls within the scope of this provision, Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith only divulged information that was already deemed public under Rhode Island law. Appellees further assert that &#167; 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute does not specifically refer to arrest records in its confidentiality provision, and by its terms in subsections (a) and (b) appears only to encompass DCYF records and personnel rather than the records of a local police department. Hence, the Child Abuse Statute does not undermine the public status of the arrest information in the records of the Middletown police department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the language of &#167; 40-11-13(a) of the Child Abuse Statute emphasizes that \"<i>all records</i> concerning reports of child abuse and neglect, including reports made to the department, shall be confidential....\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(a) (emphasis added). Significantly, the phrase \"all records\" in &#167; 40-11-13(a) is not modified by any language restricting the confidentiality requirement to DCYF records or personnel. Thus the Child Abuse Statute might be precisely the kind of confidentiality statute contemplated by &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(S) of the Public Records Statute, which removes particular records from its purview if another law mandates that the records remain confidential. Under this reading of the statutes, &#167; 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute creates an exception to the final sentence of &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute, and prohibits the release of <i>any</i> information concerning reports of child abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch forgoes this hardline stance in favor of a third interpretation of the statutes. Focusing on the language of &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute, he argues that the phrase \"records or reports <i>reflecting</i> the initial arrest of an adult and charges brought against [him]\" only authorizes the disclosure of a skeletal account of the arrest consistent with the provision's denial of public record status to information that \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" To the extent that any information beyond Richard Hatch's name and a simple recitation of the charge was released to the media, Hatch insists that his right to privacy was violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no guidance in the statutes or common law of Rhode Island to aid us in determining what level of detail runs afoul of the \"reflecting\" language in &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute. Indeed, the reasonableness of all three interpretations illustrates the difficulties faced by Rhode Island police officers unsure as to whether an arrest record containing a report of child abuse is considered a public record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. General Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We observed in <i>Hatch I</i> that \"the law strives to balance its desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which, though unfounded, may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.\" <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 20 (quoting <i>Buenrostro v. Collazo,</i> 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1992)). In the &#167; 1983 context, the United States Supreme Court has struck this balance by applying a two-part test to determine whether plaintiffs may hold government officials civilly liable for alleged violations of constitutional and federal statutory rights:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ppellate assessment of a qualified immunity claim is apportioned into two analytic components. First, if the right asserted by the plaintiff was \"clearly established\" at the time of its alleged violation, we are required to assume that the right was recognized by the defendant official, <i>see Harlow</i> [<i>v. Fitzgerald</i>], 457 U.S. [800,] 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 [(1982)]; <i>Rodriguez v. Comas,</i> 888 F.2d 899, 901 (1st Cir.1989); second, we will deny the immunity claim if a reasonable official situated in the same circumstances should have understood that the challenged conduct violated that established right, <i>see Anderson</i> [<i>v. Creighton</i>], 483 U.S. [635,] 640-41, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 [(1987)]; <i>Rodriguez,</i> 888 F.2d at 901.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Burns v. Loranger,</i> 907 F.2d 233, 235-36 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also Camilo-Robles v. Zapata,</i> 175 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila,</i> 135 F.3d 182, 186 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both prongs of this standard afford government officials some degree of protection when they confront statutory ambiguity while executing their official duties. If we assume that state officers in Rhode Island may seek the same qualified immunity from state law actions that is available to state officials sued under &#167; 1983, the contradictory provisions in the case at bar in the Public Records and Child Abuse statutes undermine Hatch's claim that his rights were \"clearly established\" with respect to the narrow question of whether police officers are prohibited from releasing arrest reports containing information of child abuse. As we observed in <i>Aponte Matos,</i> this resolution of the first prong is sufficient to support a finding of qualified immunity. <i>Aponte Matos,</i> 135 F.3d at 187. Alternatively, under the objective \"reasonable officer\" standard embodied in the second prong, Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith are strong candidates for qualified immunity given the absence of any basis for a \"reasonable officer\" to conclude that one of the three interpretations outlined above is the only correct one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, before we can conclude that the two police officers are entitled to qualified immunity, we must examine our earlier assumption that Rhode Island provides immunity in state law actions comparable to the immunity that state officers enjoy in &#167; 1983 cases, and determine whether this is actually the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Qualified Immunity Under Rhode Island Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although counsel for Hatch conceded at oral argument that qualified immunity is available to state officers defending claims under Rhode Island law, there is no decision from the Supreme Court of Rhode Island expressly affording government officials common law immunity from state law claims. Nonetheless, Rhode Island's high court has left little doubt that the defense exists for state officers under certain circumstances. In <i>Pontbriand,</i> the Governor of Rhode Island released the account information of bank depositors to encourage the state legislature to pass legislation compensating depositors in state banks and credit unions that were closed because they had no federal deposit insurance. <i>Pontbriand,</i> 699 A.2d 856. The account holders brought suit alleging violations of their right to privacy under state law, prompting the Governor to claim that he was entitled to \"good faith\" immunity even if his actions violated the state privacy statute. <i>Id.</i> Reviewing the availability of this defense, the court observed that \"[a]lthough not extensively discussed in our prior cases, it seems beyond doubt that the Governor <i>may</i> be entitled to <i>some form</i> of common law immunity for his acts performed in good faith.\" <i>Pontbriand,</i> 699 A.2d at 867 (original emphasis) (citing <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 813-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), and <i>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</i> 416 U.S. 232, 247-48, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974)). The court declined to rule on the availability of immunity, observing that \"the issue was neither extensively briefed by the parties nor reached by the trial justice below.\" <i>Pontbriand,</i> 699 A.2d at 867. However, the court signaled the trial judge that barring plaintiffs' claims on grounds of qualified immunity remained an option on remand: \"[W]e are of the opinion that the determination regarding whether official qualified immunity exists should be left for determination upon remand.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years after issuing its decision in <i>Pontbriand,</i> the Supreme Court of Rhode Island addressed qualified immunity in a context similar to the facts of this case. <i>See Ensey v. Culhane,</i> 727 A.2d 687 (R.I. 1999). Ensey was falsely accused by his ex-girlfriend of kidnaping and raping her at gunpoint. Notwithstanding the existence of facts strongly suggesting the plaintiff's innocence, the police obtained an arrest warrant and issued a verbal press statement revealing Ensey's identity, the charges, and the facts surrounding the investigation. After the police uncovered the fabrication, plaintiff filed suit against the Superintendent of the State Police and ten unnamed police officers, alleging a host of violations of his state and federal constitutional rights and his right to privacy under Rhode Island law. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island made the following comments in reviewing the defendants' assertion of qualified immunity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendants argue that the doctrine of qualified immunity, an immunity typically afforded to government officials on the federal level, bars plaintiff's claims. We are of the opinion that, in an appropriate case, the doctrine of qualified immunity might well be applied by this Court. <i>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (\"government officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 690-91. However, because Ensey could not identify the police officers who allegedly violated his rights during the investigation, the court did not reach the question of whether particular state officers were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, <i>Pontbriand</i> and <i>Ensey</i> reflect Rhode Island's recognition of a qualified immunity defense under state law analogous to the federal doctrine established by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> cited with approval in both Rhode Island decisions, and routinely applied in &#167; 1983 cases. Hence, we conclude that Hatch's concession that qualified immunity is available to officers defending state law claims is well grounded in the law of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Captain Leonard had to navigate between two statutes, both of which purported to bestow individual rights on a segment of the population. The Public Records Statute expressly grants individuals the right to inspect and/or duplicate any documents that are classified as public records, including \"records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult....\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2 The Child Abuse Statute protects the parties to an alleged incident of child abuse by preserving the confidentiality of all records documenting the event. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(a). Hence, if Captain Leonard had interpreted &#167; 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute to prohibit the release of Hatch's arrest record in its entirety, members of the media could have legitimately argued that the police department had violated the Public Records Statute. Given these uncertainties under Rhode Island law, Captain Leonard did not violate any clearly established right of Hatch to the privacy of the information released to the media by Leonard. Accordingly, we find that Leonard is entitled to qualified immunity under Rhode Island law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Lieutenant Smith, we do not even have to reach the issue of qualified immunity. His minor embellishments of the arrest report, while probably ill-advised, did not divulge new information. Instead, he merely characterized facts contained in a document that had previously been released to the media. Once Captain Leonard released the report to the press, Hatch could no longer maintain the expectation that the details contained in the publicized report would remain private. <i>Swerdlick v. Koch,</i> 721 A.2d 849, 859 (R.I.1998) (\"There is no liability [for publication of private facts] when the defendant merely gives further publicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.\") (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) Torts, &#167; 652D cmt. b).</i> Hence, Smith's subsequent release of information to the <i>National Enquirer</i> cannot form the basis of a claim under Rhode Island's Privacy Statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch's complaint also names the Town of Middletown as a defendant. However, his arguments to the district court throughout the summary judgment phase and before us focus entirely on the liability of Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith to the exclusion of the Town. Indeed, appellant's brief contains only two opaque references to the Town's policies, without any elaboration of a theory of municipal liability. We will not address a claim developed so perfunctorily.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins.

Although the police initially released only a redacted copy of Hatch's arrest report to the press, the <i>National Enquirer</i> soon procured Hatch's redacted mug shot and a copy of his son's statement to the police, featuring both in an article published on May 16, 2000. Hatch subsequently filed this &#167; 1983 and state law action against the Town of Middletown, Shawn J.

With respect to the claims against Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith, the court determined that the individual police officers could assert qualified immunity to escape civil liability under Rhode Island's privacy statute. The court at first denied defendants' motion for summary judgment on the state law privacy claims against various unnamed police officers who allegedly released Hatch's mug shot and excerpts of the statement made to the police by appellant's son. The judge issued an Order to Show Cause why the case should not be dismissed since the only remaining defendants were unidentified officers.

On the morning of April 27, 2000, a teacher and nurse at John's elementary school noticed that John had a bump on his forehead and red marks across his neck. John disclosed that he had sustained the injuries during an early morning run with his father. According to John, he was having trouble keeping the pace set by the appellant, causing him to fall to the pavement. John claimed that Hatch reacted by first pulling the boy up by his earlobe and then forcing him to do pushups by grabbing his neck and pushing his head into the cement. After hearing John's story, school officials contacted the Rhode Island Department for Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) and the Middletown police. Two police officers brought John to the Middletown police station, where he was interviewed by a DCYF caseworker and examined by a doctor. The police then contacted Hatch and asked him to report to the police station. Upon his arrival he was arrested and charged with assaulting his son. The next day, Captain David Leonard, the Public Information Officer for the Middletown police, redacted a copy of plaintiff's arrest report and released it to the media. The information withheld from the report included the mug shot of the plaintiff and the identification of the child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next few days Captain Leonard fielded requests from the local and national media for Hatch's arrest report and arraignment information. After the initial media blitz, Lieutenant Barry Smith received a call from the <i>National Enquirer.</i> He informed the <i>Enquirer</i> that \"the bump on the boy's head was the size of an egg. He had red marks on his neck and other bruises.\" A May 16, 2000 article reporting Hatch's arrest included this comment as well as the mug shot withheld from his arrest report and large excerpts of John's statement to the police. Lieutenant Smith denied having released the mug shot or John's statement to the <i>National Enquirer.</i> Although appellees concede that this release was a violation of department policy, Hatch offered no evidence to implicate Lieutenant Smith or any other Middletown police officer in the unauthorized release of these materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted defendants' summary judgment motion and dismissed Hatch's false arrest and privacy claims. In this appeal, Hatch challenges the district court's bench ruling that the two police officers were entitled to qualified immunity given the uncertainty under Rhode Island law as to what information concerning Hatch's arrest could be released as a public record:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That would be a very difficult question because there's two statutes that seem to conflict here.... Given those conflicting statutes and given the fact that Mr. Hatch's privacy right under Rhode Island law arises from a statute that requires, among other things, that the fact be a private fact, it seems to me that it is totally unreasonable and unrealistic to expect that a reasonable officer, under these circumstances, would have recognized that releasing this information violated some right of Mr. Hatch's if, in fact, it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, <i>Kelley v.

Sundlun,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1506787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1506787/pontbriand-v-sundlun/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span>, 865 (R.I.1997). While this standard frequently presents questions of fact, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island has categorically determined that plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to information contained in a public record: \"[I]t is clear that the statutory right to privacy in Rhode Island does not extend to those records deemed public.\" <i>Doe v. Edward A. Sherman Publ'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369763\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369763/doe-v-edward-a-sherman-pub-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 459 (R.I.1991). Consequently, the critical issue in this case is whether Hatch's arrest report is considered a public record under Rhode Island law. The parties point us to two statutes that bear on the classification of this information &#8212; the Rhode Island Access to Public Records (\"Public Records\") Statute that compels the release of all arrest records, and the Child Abuse Statute that requires all records concerning reports of child abuse to be kept confidential.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Rhode Island Access to Public Records Statute</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the two statutes that potentially govern the status of Richard Hatch's arrest information, only the Public Records Statute refers specifically to arrest records. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D). The statute narrowly circumscribes the universe of records maintained by law enforcement agencies that are <i>not</i> considered public records, providing that \"records shall not be deemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the records or information ... (c) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" <i>Id.</i> However, this provision concludes with the following caveat: \"Records relating to management and direction of a law enforcement agency <i>and records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult shall be public.\" Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The significance of classifying particular documents as \"public records\" under Rhode Island law is twofold. First, any person is entitled to review and/or duplicate public records under reasonable conditions prescribed by the custodian: \"Except as provided in &#167; 38-3-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file by any public body ... shall be public records and every person or entity shall have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at such reasonable time as may be determined by the custodian thereof.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2-3(a). Hence, sections 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) and 38-2-3(a) impose an affirmative obligation on law enforcement agencies to make arrest records available to the public. Second, as noted above, a determination that particular records are public is dispositive as to any privacy claims arising from the release of those records. <i>Edward A. Sherman Publ'g,</i> 593 A.2d at 458.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Rhode Island Child Abuse Statute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that certain state or federal laws may impose confidentiality requirements with respect to specific information, the Public Records Statute places that information outside the scope of Title 38: \"For the purposes of this chapter, the following records shall not be deemed public... (S) Records, reports, opinions, information, and statements required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulation or state law, or rule of court.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(S).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rhode Island Child Abuse Statute arguably functions as such a law. Without explicitly mentioning arrest records, the statute provides that \"[a]ll records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect, including reports made to the department,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> shall be confidential except as specifically provided by this chapter....\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(a). The subsequent clause of the provision imposes penalties for the disclosure of these records, but limits the class of people subject to punishment: \"Any employee or agent of the department violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars ($200) or shall be imprisoned for not more than six (6) months or both.\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Interpreting the Public Records and Child Abuse Statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read together, the Public Records and Child Abuse Statutes are susceptible to at least three reasonable interpretations. Appellees observe that &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute classifies all \"records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult\" as public documents. They argue that because Hatch's arrest record clearly falls within the scope of this provision, Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith only divulged information that was already deemed public under Rhode Island law. Appellees further assert that &#167; 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute does not specifically refer to arrest records in its confidentiality provision, and by its terms in subsections (a) and (b) appears only to encompass DCYF records and personnel rather than the records of a local police department. Hence, the Child Abuse Statute does not undermine the public status of the arrest information in the records of the Middletown police department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the language of &#167; 40-11-13(a) of the Child Abuse Statute emphasizes that \"<i>all records</i> concerning reports of child abuse and neglect, including reports made to the department, shall be confidential....\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(a) (emphasis added). Significantly, the phrase \"all records\" in &#167; 40-11-13(a) is not modified by any language restricting the confidentiality requirement to DCYF records or personnel. Thus the Child Abuse Statute might be precisely the kind of confidentiality statute contemplated by &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(S) of the Public Records Statute, which removes particular records from its purview if another law mandates that the records remain confidential. Under this reading of the statutes, &#167; 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute creates an exception to the final sentence of &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute, and prohibits the release of <i>any</i> information concerning reports of child abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch forgoes this hardline stance in favor of a third interpretation of the statutes. Focusing on the language of &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute, he argues that the phrase \"records or reports <i>reflecting</i> the initial arrest of an adult and charges brought against [him]\" only authorizes the disclosure of a skeletal account of the arrest consistent with the provision's denial of public record status to information that \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" To the extent that any information beyond Richard Hatch's name and a simple recitation of the charge was released to the media, Hatch insists that his right to privacy was violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no guidance in the statutes or common law of Rhode Island to aid us in determining what level of detail runs afoul of the \"reflecting\" language in &#167; 38-2-2(4)(i)(D) of the Public Records Statute. Indeed, the reasonableness of all three interpretations illustrates the difficulties faced by Rhode Island police officers unsure as to whether an arrest record containing a report of child abuse is considered a public record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. General Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We observed in <i>Hatch I</i> that \"the law strives to balance its desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which, though unfounded, may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.\" <i>Hatch,</i> 274 F.3d at 20 (quoting <i>Buenrostro v.

If we assume that state officers in Rhode Island may seek the same qualified immunity from state law actions that is available to state officials sued under &#167; 1983, the contradictory provisions in the case at bar in the Public Records and Child Abuse statutes undermine Hatch's claim that his rights were \"clearly established\" with respect to the narrow question of whether police officers are prohibited from releasing arrest reports containing information of child abuse. As we observed in <i>Aponte Matos,</i> this resolution of the first prong is sufficient to support a finding of qualified immunity. <i>Aponte Matos,</i> 135 F.3d at 187. Alternatively, under the objective \"reasonable officer\" standard embodied in the second prong, Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith are strong candidates for qualified immunity given the absence of any basis for a \"reasonable officer\" to conclude that one of the three interpretations outlined above is the only correct one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, before we can conclude that the two police officers are entitled to qualified immunity, we must examine our earlier assumption that Rhode Island provides immunity in state law actions comparable to the immunity that state officers enjoy in &#167; 1983 cases, and determine whether this is actually the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Qualified Immunity Under Rhode Island Law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although counsel for Hatch conceded at oral argument that qualified immunity is available to state officers defending claims under Rhode Island law, there is no decision from the Supreme Court of Rhode Island expressly affording government officials common law immunity from state law claims. Nonetheless, Rhode Island's high court has left little doubt that the defense exists for state officers under certain circumstances. In <i>Pontbriand,</i> the Governor of Rhode Island released the account information of bank depositors to encourage the state legislature to pass legislation compensating depositors in state banks and credit unions that were closed because they had no federal deposit insurance. <i>Pontbriand,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1506787\"><a href=\"/opinion/1506787/pontbriand-v-sundlun/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span>. The account holders brought suit alleging violations of their right to privacy under state law, prompting the Governor to claim that he was entitled to \"good faith\" immunity even if his actions violated the state privacy statute. <i>Id.</i> Reviewing the availability of this defense, the court observed that \"[a]lthough not extensively discussed in our prior cases, it seems beyond doubt that the Governor <i>may</i> be entitled to <i>some form</i> of common law immunity for his acts performed in good faith.\" <i>Pontbriand,</i> 699 A.2d at 867 (original emphasis) (citing <i>Harlow v.

The court declined to rule on the availability of immunity, observing that \"the issue was neither extensively briefed by the parties nor reached by the trial justice below.\" <i>Pontbriand,</i> 699 A.2d at 867. However, the court signaled the trial judge that barring plaintiffs' claims on grounds of qualified immunity remained an option on remand: \"[W]e are of the opinion that the determination regarding whether official qualified immunity exists should be left for determination upon remand.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years after issuing its decision in <i>Pontbriand,</i> the Supreme Court of Rhode Island addressed qualified immunity in a context similar to the facts of this case. <i>See Ensey v. Culhane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1895180\"><a href=\"/opinion/1895180/ensey-v-culhane/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span> (R.I. 1999). Ensey was falsely accused by his ex-girlfriend of kidnaping and raping her at gunpoint. Notwithstanding the existence of facts strongly suggesting the plaintiff's innocence, the police obtained an arrest warrant and issued a verbal press statement revealing Ensey's identity, the charges, and the facts surrounding the investigation. After the police uncovered the fabrication, plaintiff filed suit against the Superintendent of the State Police and ten unnamed police officers, alleging a host of violations of his state and federal constitutional rights and his right to privacy under Rhode Island law. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island made the following comments in reviewing the defendants' assertion of qualified immunity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[D]efendants argue that the doctrine of qualified immunity, an immunity typically afforded to government officials on the federal level, bars plaintiff's claims. We are of the opinion that, in an appropriate case, the doctrine of qualified immunity might well be applied by this Court. <i>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1982) (\"government officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 690-91. However, because Ensey could not identify the police officers who allegedly violated his rights during the investigation, the court did not reach the question of whether particular state officers were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, <i>Pontbriand</i> and <i>Ensey</i> reflect Rhode Island's recognition of a qualified immunity defense under state law analogous to the federal doctrine established by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> cited with approval in both Rhode Island decisions, and routinely applied in &#167; 1983 cases. Hence, we conclude that Hatch's concession that qualified immunity is available to officers defending state law claims is well grounded in the law of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Captain Leonard had to navigate between two statutes, both of which purported to bestow individual rights on a segment of the population. The Public Records Statute expressly grants individuals the right to inspect and/or duplicate any documents that are classified as public records, including \"records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult....\" R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 38-2 The Child Abuse Statute protects the parties to an alleged incident of child abuse by preserving the confidentiality of all records documenting the event. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 40-11-13(a). Hence, if Captain Leonard had interpreted &#167; 40-11-13 of the Child Abuse Statute to prohibit the release of Hatch's arrest record in its entirety, members of the media could have legitimately argued that the police department had violated the Public Records Statute. Given these uncertainties under Rhode Island law, Captain Leonard did not violate any clearly established right of Hatch to the privacy of the information released to the media by Leonard. Accordingly, we find that Leonard is entitled to qualified immunity under Rhode Island law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Lieutenant Smith, we do not even have to reach the issue of qualified immunity. His minor embellishments of the arrest report, while probably ill-advised, did not divulge new information. Instead, he merely characterized facts contained in a document that had previously been released to the media. Once Captain Leonard released the report to the press, Hatch could no longer maintain the expectation that the details contained in the publicized report would remain private. <i>Swerdlick v. Koch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1508326\"><a href=\"/opinion/1508326/swerdlick-v-koch/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 859 (R.I.1998) (\"There is no liability [for publication of private facts] when the defendant merely gives further publicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.\") (quoting <i>Restatement (Second) Torts, &#167; 652D cmt. b).</i> Hence, Smith's subsequent release of information to the <i>National Enquirer</i> cannot form the basis of a claim under Rhode Island's Privacy Statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch's complaint also names the Town of Middletown as a defendant. However, his arguments to the district court throughout the summary judgment phase and before us focus entirely on the liability of Captain Leonard and Lieutenant Smith to the exclusion of the Town. Indeed, appellant's brief contains only two opaque references to the Town's policies, without any elaboration of a theory of municipal liability.
