Defendant-appellant\n\nFrancisco Vasconcelos seeks to withdraw his guilty plea in a case\n\nof illegal reentry, asserting that his waiver of his right to a\n\njury trial was not knowing and voluntary.          We hold that the\n\nirregularities in the district court's Rule 11 colloquy, while\n\nconfusing, did not amount to reversible error.       Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of Vasconcelos's motion to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea.\n\n                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Vasconcelos is a native and a citizen of Cape Verde.    In\n\n1971, at age twelve, he entered the United States on a visa.      At\n\nthe time of his entry, Vasconcelos's mother was a lawful permanent\n\nresident and his stepfather was a United States citizen.\n\n           Between 1980 and 1988, Vasconcelos was convicted of\n\nrobbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, and possession of\n\ncocaine.   Based on these convictions, Vasconcelos was deported on\n\nSeptember 14, 1993.      He returned to the United States without\n\npermission, however, and in 1994 was convicted of entering a\n\nbuilding with the intent to commit a felony.          Thereafter, on\n\nOctober 10, 1994, Vasconcelos was again deported.\n\n           Vasconcelos managed to reenter the United States without\n\npermission once again.       On November 7, 2000, he was arrested in\n\nEast Providence, Rhode Island, on charges of drug possession and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fobstructing a police officer.         The Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService took him into custody on July 10, 2001.\n\n              On August 1, 2001, a federal grand jury in the District\n\nof    Rhode    Island    returned    a   one-count     indictment    charging\n\nVasconcelos with illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§\n\n1326(a) and (b)(2). On January 15, 2002, Vasconcelos signed a plea\n\nagreement, in which he agreed to plead guilty to the indictment.\n\nThe government, in turn, agreed to recommend a reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and the lowest possible guideline\n\nsentence.      The agreement stated that Vasconcelos had a right \"to\n\npersist in a plea of not guilty\" and \"to be tried by a jury\" but\n\nthat \"by pleading guilty, he [would give] up his right to a trial.\"\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n              On February 4, 2002, the district court conducted a\n\nchange of plea hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.               At the\n\nhearing, the court asked Vasconcelos if any promises or assurances\n\nnot   included    in    the   plea   agreement   had   been   made   to   him.\n\nVasconcelos replied \"no,\" but his attorney interjected:\n\n      I made two promises to him independently that I would get\n      a copy of an attorney's file named Peter Allen back from\n      the early 1990s, which I did do. Mr. Allen did send me\n      the file, and he had an old [FOIA] request pending up in\n      the Immigration Service about 2 years ago, a copy of his\n      full [FOIA] file, and I've been geared to get him a full\n      copy of his file back from the late 1960s right to the\n      present time, and I will follow through on those\n      promises.\n\nThe court responded, \"All right.\"\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f     Later in the colloquy, the judge informed Vasconcelos that if\n\nhe pled guilty to the crime, he would give up his right to a trial\n\nby jury.      At this point, Vasconcelos asked to talk with his\n\nattorney.     Following their consultation, his attorney told the\n\ncourt that despite his research into the facts of Vasconcelos's\n\ncase,\n\n     we do not have a factual basis for claiming at this point\n     that he's a citizen, and he recognizes and admits as\n     much, that therefore he is guilty of this particular\n     offense and he's asking permission today to allow the\n     Court to accept the plea bargain agreement and to accept\n     the plea of guilty. He has told me, he has just said to\n     me here, that if new facts come up in the future that\n     under some theory which is unknown to us at this point in\n     time, somehow it gets shown to a court that, in fact, he\n     always was a citizen, or something of that sort, that he\n     has legal remedies available to him at that point to try\n     to reopen the case. But I told him that if, in fact,\n     something comes up in the future that's unbeknownst to\n     him, unbeknownst to the documents . . . that if facts\n     arise that could change what he's saying here today, that\n     I would in fact follow up on it.\n\n        To this statement, the trial judge replied \"all right.\"    The\n\njudge then asked Vasconcelos, \"so you understand all that?\"       Next,\n\nthe judge inquired, \"now with all these things in mind that we've\n\nbeen discussing, do you want to plead guilty . . .?\"    The district\n\ncourt accepted Vasconcelos's guilty plea and scheduled a sentencing\n\nhearing. Later, the district court allowed Vasconcelos's motion to\n\ncontinue the sentencing hearing so as to allow Vasconcelos to\n\nobtain his INS file.\n\n        On July 24, 2002, two days before the rescheduled sentencing\n\nhearing, Vasconcelos's attorney filed a motion to withdraw the\n\n                                 -4-\n\fguilty    plea.     The    motion    stated    that    through       \"additional\n\ninvestigation,\" Vasconcelos had discovered: (1) his mother was a\n\nlawful permanent resident at the time she married a U.S. citizen\n\nnamed Bert Little; (2) this marriage occurred before Vasconcelos\n\nimmigrated    to   the    United    States;    (3)    after    the     marriage,\n\nVasconcelos's mother filed a petition with the INS for \"lawful\n\npermanent resident\" status for Vasconcelos; and (4) in 1975, Bert\n\nLittle applied on Vasconcelos's behalf for replacement of a \"lost\n\nalien registration receipt card.\"             Attached to the motion were\n\ncopies of the petition and application.\n\n     On July 26, 2002, the trial court held a hearing on the motion\n\nto withdraw.       At the beginning of the hearing, Vasconcelos's\n\nattorney reminded the court that Vasconcelos had said he would be\n\nback if he had any proof of citizenship.              Vasconcelos's attorney\n\nstated:\n\n     There was a dispute between -- a discussion between\n     myself and Mr. Vasconcelos as to the legal import of that\n     which was there attached as Exhibits 1 and 2 [to the\n     motion], but in the end analysis after more than several\n     hours of discussion over the import, I reached the point\n     where I told Mr. Vasconcelos that what he instructed me\n     to do I would do, and I would file the motion. . . .\n\nThe government responded that there was agreement that no Rule 11\n\ndefect in the plea proceedings had occurred.                  Neither defense\n\ncounsel nor the court reacted to this assertion, and there was no\n\nfurther reference to any Rule 11 problem.               The government also\n\nargued that Vasconcelos's motion to withdraw did not present any\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fevidence that would establish a defense of citizenship.                     The\n\ndistrict court agreed and denied the motion to withdraw, noting\n\nthat Vasconcelos had had \"ample opportunity to establish any claim\n\nof citizenship.\"     The court then sentenced Vasconcelos to the\n\nlowest   possible   sentence    under     the   guidelines:   41   months    of\n\nimprisonment.1\n\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n\n     A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be granted when a\n\ndefendant can make an affirmative showing of \"any fair and just\n\nreason\" for withdrawing the plea.          Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B).2\n\nIn determining whether a defendant met this burden, the district\n\ncourt should evaluate the totality of the circumstances.              United\n\nStates v. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 2000).3\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Vasconcelos moved for a downward departure on the ground that\nhe had a mistaken belief that he was a U.S. citizen. That motion\nwas denied.\n     2\n      At the time of Vasconcelos's guilty plea and sentencing, Rule\n32 permitted a district court judge to grant a motion to withdraw\na guilty plea filed prior to imposition of sentence for \"any fair\nand just reason.\"    Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e).    This provision has\nsince been moved to Rule 11. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B).\n     3\n      Four elements warrant particular attention: (1) the\nplausibility of the proffered reason for withdrawal of the plea;\n(2) the timing of the attempted withdrawal; (3) the presence of a\nclaim of innocence; and (4) whether the circumstances indicate that\nthe plea was not made knowingly and voluntarily within the meaning\nof Fed. R. Crim. P. 11. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d at 8-9. We need not\ndelve into these factors in detail, as we hold infra that even if\nthe district court erred, such error does not warrant reversal.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f     We first consider the question of the appropriate standard of\n\nreview.      Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h) sets forth a harmless error\n\nstandard.       Where a defendant fails to present a Rule 11 challenge\n\nto the district court, however, appellate review is for plain error\n\nonly.     United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 66 (2002).\n\n     It is unclear from the Rule 11 colloquy whether the district\n\ncourt recognized that Vasconcelos might have misunderstood the\n\neffect of his guilty plea on his right to a jury trial.                   Certainly\n\nVasconcelos did not expressly contend below that the district\n\ncourt's Rule 11 colloquy was inadequate or that his plea was\n\ninvoluntary.           His motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the\n\ndistrict     court     was    based    on     the   newly    discovered    evidence\n\nconcerning his citizenship; not until this appeal did Vasconcelos\n\nargue    that    his   plea   was     not    knowing   and   voluntary    and   thus\n\nprohibited by Rule 11.           We need not decide whether Vasconcelos\n\nadequately preserved the Rule 11 issue, because, under either a\n\nharmless error or plain error standard of review, the result is the\n\nsame.    See United States v. Noriega-Millan, 110 F.3d 162, 166-68 &\n\nn.4 (holding any Rule 11 error harmless and declining to decide the\n\nappropriate standard of review).\n\n        Vasconcelos argues that he was not clearly informed that his\n\nplea created finality, or that he was conclusively waiving his\n\nright to a trial by jury.             He points to his counsel's statement\n\nthat he had promised to continue to investigate his case and to\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fbring any new theories about Vasconcelos's innocence before the\n\ncourt.     Moreover,   when     the   trial       judge   was    explaining   to\n\nVasconcelos that he was waiving his right to a jury trial, his\n\ncounsel stated that he had assured Vasconcelos that he would\n\n\"follow up on\" Vasconcelos's case and perhaps \"reopen\" it if\n\nadditional facts came to light.        The trial judge made no attempt to\n\nclarify or correct this statement; he simply replied \"all right,\"\n\nand asked Vasconcelos, \"so you understand all that?\"                  The court\n\nthen allowed Vasconcelos to continue the sentencing hearing so as\n\nto allow him to obtain his INS file.\n\n     We are troubled by the district court's apparent acquiescence\n\nto Vasconcelos's stated intent to continue pursuing his case.\n\nAssuming   without   deciding    that       the   district      court's   actions\n\nconstituted error, we hold that Vasconcelos cannot satisfy either\n\nthe plain error standard required by Vonn or the less demanding\n\nharmless error standard.         Vasconcelos's counsel's promises to\n\n\"follow up on\" or even \"reopen\" the case did not assert a right to\n\na jury trial.   Rather, it appears that Vasconcelos was seeking to\n\npresent any new evidence related to his citizenship to a court.               At\n\nthe Rule 11 hearing, his counsel stated:              \"He has told me . . .\n\nthat if new facts come up in the future that under some theory\n\nwhich is unknown to us at this point in time, somehow it gets shown\n\nto a court that, in fact, he always was a citizen, or something of\n\nthat sort, that he has legal remedies available to him at that\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fpoint to try to reopen the case.\" (emphasis added). That statement\n\nindicates that       Vasconcelos    expected       a    court,    not    a    jury,   to\n\nconsider the new information.\n\n      Vasconcelos received exactly that.                 At the hearing on his\n\nmotion to withdraw his plea, Vasconcelos presented the evidence\n\nthat he believed helped his case; the district court considered it\n\nand   determined      that     it   did     not        affect     his    conviction.\n\nVasconcelos's attorney below effectively conceded, and the district\n\ncourt agreed, that the INS documents attached to his motion to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea did not establish his citizenship or any\n\nother valid defense to the charges against him.                   See United States\n\nv. Soto, 106 F.3d 1040, 1041 (1st Cir. 1997) (good faith belief in\n\none's citizenship is not a defense to a § 1326 charge).                         We note\n\nfurther that Vasconcelos was deported in 1993 and again in 1994; he\n\nhas had a decade to produce evidence of his citizenship, but has\n\nfailed to do so.\n\n      In sum, Vasconcelos would have no viable immigration-related\n\ndefense to the charges if his case were permitted to go to trial.\n\nAccordingly,    we    hold   that   the   district        court    did   not     commit\n\nreversible     error,    and   we   will     not       disturb     its       denial   of\n\nVasconcelos's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Following their consultation, his attorney told the\n\ncourt that despite his research into the facts of Vasconcelos's\n\ncase,\n\n     we do not have a factual basis for claiming at this point\n     that he's a citizen, and he recognizes and admits as\n     much, that therefore he is guilty of this particular\n     offense and he's asking permission today to allow the\n     Court to accept the plea bargain agreement and to accept\n     the plea of guilty. He has told me, he has just said to\n     me here, that if new facts come up in the future that\n     under some theory which is unknown to us at this point in\n     time, somehow it gets shown to a court that, in fact, he\n     always was a citizen, or something of that sort, that he\n     has legal remedies available to him at that point to try\n     to reopen the case. But I told him that if, in fact,\n     something comes up in the future that's unbeknownst to\n     him, unbeknownst to the documents . . . that if facts\n     arise that could change what he's saying here today, that\n     I would in fact follow up on it.\n\n        To this statement, the trial judge replied \"all right.\"    The\n\njudge then asked Vasconcelos, \"so you understand all that?\"       Next,\n\nthe judge inquired, \"now with all these things in mind that we've\n\nbeen discussing, do you want to plead guilty . . .?\"    The district\n\ncourt accepted Vasconcelos's guilty plea and scheduled a sentencing\n\nhearing. Later, the district court allowed Vasconcelos's motion to\n\ncontinue the sentencing hearing so as to allow Vasconcelos to\n\nobtain his INS file.\n\n        On July 24, 2002, two days before the rescheduled sentencing\n\nhearing, Vasconcelos's attorney filed a motion to withdraw the\n\n                                 -4-\n\fguilty    plea.     The    motion    stated    that    through       \"additional\n\ninvestigation,\" Vasconcelos had discovered: (1) his mother was a\n\nlawful permanent resident at the time she married a U.S. citizen\n\nnamed Bert Little; (2) this marriage occurred before Vasconcelos\n\nimmigrated    to   the    United    States;    (3)    after    the     marriage,\n\nVasconcelos's mother filed a petition with the INS for \"lawful\n\npermanent resident\" status for Vasconcelos; and (4) in 1975, Bert\n\nLittle applied on Vasconcelos's behalf for replacement of a \"lost\n\nalien registration receipt card.\"             Attached to the motion were\n\ncopies of the petition and application.\n\n     On July 26, 2002, the trial court held a hearing on the motion\n\nto withdraw.       At the beginning of the hearing, Vasconcelos's\n\nattorney reminded the court that Vasconcelos had said he would be\n\nback if he had any proof of citizenship.              Vasconcelos's attorney\n\nstated:\n\n     There was a dispute between -- a discussion between\n     myself and Mr. Vasconcelos as to the legal import of that\n     which was there attached as Exhibits 1 and 2 [to the\n     motion], but in the end analysis after more than several\n     hours of discussion over the import, I reached the point\n     where I told Mr. Vasconcelos that what he instructed me\n     to do I would do, and I would file the motion. . . .\n\nThe government responded that there was agreement that no Rule 11\n\ndefect in the plea proceedings had occurred.                  Neither defense\n\ncounsel nor the court reacted to this assertion, and there was no\n\nfurther reference to any Rule 11 problem.               The government also\n\nargued that Vasconcelos's motion to withdraw did not present any\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fevidence that would establish a defense of citizenship.                     The\n\ndistrict court agreed and denied the motion to withdraw, noting\n\nthat Vasconcelos had had \"ample opportunity to establish any claim\n\nof citizenship.\"     The court then sentenced Vasconcelos to the\n\nlowest   possible   sentence    under     the   guidelines:   41   months    of\n\nimprisonment.1\n\n                               II.

That motion\nwas denied.\n     2\n      At the time of Vasconcelos's guilty plea and sentencing, Rule\n32 permitted a district court judge to grant a motion to withdraw\na guilty plea filed prior to imposition of sentence for \"any fair\nand just reason.\"    Fed.

P. 11(d)(2)(B).\n     3\n      Four elements warrant particular attention: (1) the\nplausibility of the proffered reason for withdrawal of the plea;\n(2) the timing of the attempted withdrawal; (3) the presence of a\nclaim of innocence; and (4) whether the circumstances indicate that\nthe plea was not made knowingly and voluntarily within the meaning\nof Fed. R. Crim. P. 11. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d at 8-9. We need not\ndelve into these factors in detail, as we hold infra that even if\nthe district court erred, such error does not warrant reversal.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f     We first consider the question of the appropriate standard of\n\nreview.      Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h) sets forth a harmless error\n\nstandard.       Where a defendant fails to present a Rule 11 challenge\n\nto the district court, however, appellate review is for plain error\n\nonly.     United States v. Vonn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118487\"><a href=\"/opinion/118487/united-states-v-vonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (2002).\n\n     It is unclear from the Rule 11 colloquy whether the district\n\ncourt recognized that Vasconcelos might have misunderstood the\n\neffect of his guilty plea on his right to a jury trial.                   Certainly\n\nVasconcelos did not expressly contend below that the district\n\ncourt's Rule 11 colloquy was inadequate or that his plea was\n\ninvoluntary.           His motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the\n\ndistrict     court     was    based    on     the   newly    discovered    evidence\n\nconcerning his citizenship; not until this appeal did Vasconcelos\n\nargue    that    his   plea   was     not    knowing   and   voluntary    and   thus\n\nprohibited by Rule 11.           We need not decide whether Vasconcelos\n\nadequately preserved the Rule 11 issue, because, under either a\n\nharmless error or plain error standard of review, the result is the\n\nsame.    See United States v. Noriega-Millan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739068\"><a href=\"/opinion/739068/united-states-v-rafael-noriega-milln-aka-rafi/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166-68 &\n\nn.4 (holding any Rule 11 error harmless and declining to decide the\n\nappropriate standard of review).\n\n        Vasconcelos argues that he was not clearly informed that his\n\nplea created finality, or that he was conclusively waiving his\n\nright to a trial by jury.             He points to his counsel's statement\n\nthat he had promised to continue to investigate his case and to\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fbring any new theories about Vasconcelos's innocence before the\n\ncourt.     Moreover,   when     the   trial       judge   was    explaining   to\n\nVasconcelos that he was waiving his right to a jury trial, his\n\ncounsel stated that he had assured Vasconcelos that he would\n\n\"follow up on\" Vasconcelos's case and perhaps \"reopen\" it if\n\nadditional facts came to light.        The trial judge made no attempt to\n\nclarify or correct this statement; he simply replied \"all right,\"\n\nand asked Vasconcelos, \"so you understand all that?\"                  The court\n\nthen allowed Vasconcelos to continue the sentencing hearing so as\n\nto allow him to obtain his INS file.\n\n     We are troubled by the district court's apparent acquiescence\n\nto Vasconcelos's stated intent to continue pursuing his case.\n\nAssuming   without   deciding    that       the   district      court's   actions\n\nconstituted error, we hold that Vasconcelos cannot satisfy either\n\nthe plain error standard required by Vonn or the less demanding\n\nharmless error standard.         Vasconcelos's counsel's promises to\n\n\"follow up on\" or even \"reopen\" the case did not assert a right to\n\na jury trial.   Rather, it appears that Vasconcelos was seeking to\n\npresent any new evidence related to his citizenship to a court.               At\n\nthe Rule 11 hearing, his counsel stated:              \"He has told me . . .\n\nthat if new facts come up in the future that under some theory\n\nwhich is unknown to us at this point in time, somehow it gets shown\n\nto a court that, in fact, he always was a citizen, or something of\n\nthat sort, that he has legal remedies available to him at that\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fpoint to try to reopen the case.\" (emphasis added). That statement\n\nindicates that       Vasconcelos    expected       a    court,    not    a    jury,   to\n\nconsider the new information.\n\n      Vasconcelos received exactly that.                 At the hearing on his\n\nmotion to withdraw his plea, Vasconcelos presented the evidence\n\nthat he believed helped his case; the district court considered it\n\nand   determined      that     it   did     not        affect     his    conviction.\n\nVasconcelos's attorney below effectively conceded, and the district\n\ncourt agreed, that the INS documents attached to his motion to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea did not establish his citizenship or any\n\nother valid defense to the charges against him.
