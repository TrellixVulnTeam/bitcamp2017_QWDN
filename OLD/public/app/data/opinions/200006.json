Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Julie Intravaia Stokes on brief pro se.\n     Rebecca J. Wilson, Sandra P. Criss and Peabody & Arnold LLP,\non brief for appellee Stanley R. Merson.\n     Jocelyn M. Sedney, BBO and Brody, Hardoon, Perkins & Kesten on\nbrief for appellee Center for Mental Health and Retardation\nServices, Inc.\n\n\n                           June 20, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam.       The district court dismissed this case\n\nfor a lack of prosecution and a failure to comply with the\n\ncourt's discovery orders. Almost a year later, plaintiff moved\n\nfor relief from the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)\n\nand/or 60(b)(6), alleging that she had been impeded from\n\nprosecuting her case and complying with discovery orders by an\n\nepisode of mental illness.         The district court denied relief\n\nfrom the judgment in an endorsed order and plaintiff appeals\n\nthis denial of her Rule 60(b) motion.\n\n           The summary denial of relief under Rule 60(b) was not\nan abuse of discretion.          Plaintiff's unsupported allegation\n\nthat she suffered from mental illness was insufficient to\nexcuse   the   neglect      of   her    lawsuit       under    Rule    60(b)(1),\nespecially since she was represented by counsel throughout the\n\nproceedings below.       There was no showing that plaintiff was\nincapable of cooperating with her attorney, who also filed the\nRule 60(b) motion on her behalf, and no showing that the\n\nattorney was in any way disabled.                Rule 60(b)(6) is not an\nalternative    path   for    pursuing        relief    based    on    \"excusable\nneglect\" and, anyway, plaintiff has not shown that she was\n\n\"faultless in the delay\" as would be required for any relief\nunder Rule 60(b)(6).
