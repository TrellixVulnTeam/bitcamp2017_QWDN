Strother appeals from his conviction of being a felon in\n\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).      He\n\ncontends that the search that led to his arrest and conviction was\n\nnot supported by probable cause and that he was wrongly deprived of\n\na Franks hearing.     We affirm the judgment below.\n\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n             On April 7, 2000, the government applied for a warrant to\n\nsearch Strother's residence, located on the first floor of 41\n\nKingsdale Street in Dorchester, Massachusetts.       41 Kingsdale is a\n\nthree-story, three-family residence.\n\n             The application in support of the search warrant featured\n\nthe affidavit of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent\n\nNicholas B. Boshears.     In his affidavit, Boshears stated that in\n\nFebruary and March of 2000, a cooperating witness (\"CW-1\") provided\n\nBoshears with information concerning Strother's involvement in\n\nfraudulent check cashing, drug trafficking, and possession of\n\nfirearms.     Approximately a month before the warrant application,\n\nCW-1 told Boshears that he had personal knowledge that Strother\n\nused the first floor of 41 Kingsdale Street to store cocaine,\n\nheroin, and firearms.1\n\n             CW-1 had provided information to Boshears on one previous\n\noccasion, when he advised him of the location of a person wanted on\n\n\n     1\n         For convenience, we assume that CW-1 is male.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fa federal warrant. CW-1's information in that case proved accurate\n\nand ultimately led to the individual's conviction.\n\n            Boshears's affidavit set forth the government's efforts\n\nto corroborate CW-1's information.2           As to Strother's residence,\n\nBoshears stated that a United States Secret Service agent involved\n\nin the investigation had contacted officers of the United States\n\nPostal Police [sic], who in turn interviewed the postal carrier\n\nassigned to deliver mail to 41 Kingsdale.          According to Boshears,\n\nthe postal carrier verified that mail was delivered to the Strother\n\nfamily at the first floor of 41 Kingsdale Street, and postal\n\nrecords also indicated that the first floor was occupied by the\n\nStrother    family.       The   affidavit    additionally    asserted   that,\n\naccording to postal records, floors two and three of 41 Kingsdale\n\nStreet were occupied by the Brisco family and by Dennis and Mildred\n\nRichardson, respectively.\n\n            Based on this information, a magistrate judge issued a\n\nwarrant authorizing the search of \"the apartment residence of\n\nDaryll J. Strother located on the first floor of 41 Kingsdale\n\nStreet, Dorchester, MA . . .\"        The warrant authorized the police to\n\nsearch     for   money,   cocaine,    drug   paraphernalia    and   records,\n\nfirearms, and items showing possession of the premises. The search\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The corroboration of CW-1's statements concerning Strother's\ninvolvement in fraudulent check cashing, drug trafficking, and\npossession of firearms is set forth in detail infra, Section II(A).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fwas conducted on April 17, yielding, inter alia, a twelve-gauge\n\nshotgun and a pistol.\n\n            On June 14, 2000, the grand jury returned an indictment\n\ncharging Strother with being a felon in possession of a firearm in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On December 28, 2001, Strother\n\nmoved to suppress evidence seized during the search on the grounds\n\nthat (1) the affidavit lacked probable cause, and (2) the affidavit\n\ncontained an error that warranted a Franks hearing.          Specifically,\n\nhis Franks claim challenged Boshears’s assertion that he lived at\n\nthe searched residence.     The motion attached an affidavit in which\n\nStrother denied ever having received mail there.\n\n            In response to Strother's request for a Franks hearing,\n\nthe government submitted a second affidavit from Boshears stating\n\nthat any error in the original affidavit -- the one supporting the\n\nwarrant application -- was unintentional. In the second affidavit,\n\nBoshears attested that he reviewed his file and found a copy of a\n\nMarch 17, 2000 memorandum from the Postal Service to the Secret\n\nService agent that stated that 41 Kingsdale \"is a three family\n\nresidence   [where   mail   was   delivered   to]   Dennis    and   Mildred\n\nRichardson, The Brisco Family, and The Struthers [sic] Family.\"\n\nThe memorandum further stated that the mail carrier did not have\n\ninformation as to the specific occupants of each floor.             Boshears\n\nstated that he had no recollection whether he sought more detailed\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\finformation from the postal service concerning the occupants of 41\n\nKingsdale.\n\n           The district court held a non-evidentiary hearing on\n\nJanuary 29, 2002. Two days later, by written memorandum, it denied\n\nStrother's motion to suppress and his request for a Franks hearing.\n\n             On February 26, 2002, Strother entered a conditional plea\n\nof guilty to a superseding indictment charging the same offense,\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).     On June 10, 2002, the court\n\nsentenced him to a term of 180 months in prison.             It entered\n\njudgment on June 18, 2002, and this appeal followed.\n\n                             II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.         Probable cause\n\n           \"In reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, the\n\ndistrict     court's   ultimate   legal   conclusion,    including   the\n\ndetermination that a given set of facts constituted probable cause,\n\nis a question of law subject to de novo review.\"        United States v.\n\nKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 282 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Ornelas v.\n\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 690, 698-99 (1996)).     The district court's\n\nfindings of historical fact are reviewed for clear error.        Id.\n\n           A warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to\n\nbelieve that (1) a crime has been committed (the \"commission\"\n\nelement), and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found\n\nat the place to be searched (the \"nexus\" element).        United States\n\nv. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1996).        \"With regard\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fto the 'nexus' element, the task of a magistrate . . . is 'to make\n\na   practical,    common-sense    decision     whether,    given     all     the\n\ncircumstances set forth in the affidavit before him . . . there is\n\na fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be\n\nfound in a particular place.'\"          United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d\n\n82, 86 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,\n\n238 (1983)).\n\n             In determining the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting\n\na   search   warrant,   we   consider    whether   the   \"totality    of     the\n\ncircumstances\" stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause\n\nto search the premises.      Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 283.         We examine\n\nthe affidavit \"in a practical, common-sense fashion and accord\n\nconsiderable     deference   to   reasonable   inferences    the     [issuing\n\njudicial officer] may have drawn from the attested facts.\"             United\n\nStates v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir.               2002) (quoting\n\nZayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d at 111) (internal quotations omitted).                 Among\n\nthe factors that may contribute to a probable cause determination\n\nare:\n\n             whether an affidavit supports the probable\n             veracity or basis of knowledge of persons\n             supplying    hearsay    information;    whether\n             informant statements are self-authenticating;\n             whether some or all [of] the informant's\n             factual statements were corroborated wherever\n             reasonable and practicable (e.g., through\n             police    surveillance);    and    whether    a\n             law-enforcement      affiant     included     a\n             professional   assessment   of   the   probable\n             significance of the facts related by the\n             informant, based on experience or expertise.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 284 (quoting Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d at 111)\n\n(internal quotations and footnote omitted).                 None of these factors\n\nare individually indispensable; rather, \"stronger evidence on one\n\nor more factors may compensate for a weaker or deficient showing on\n\nanother.\"    Id. (quoting Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d at 111).\n\n            Strother argues that the warrant application failed to\n\nestablish    CW-1's       reliability    because      CW-1's    track    record   was\n\nlimited to one instance of locating an individual wanted by the\n\npolice.      He    also    contends     that    the   warrant      application    was\n\ndeficient as to the nexus element: i.e., whether there was probable\n\ncause to believe that firearms were likely to be found at the\n\nsearched residence.         We disagree and hold that the totality of the\n\ncircumstances set forth in the application demonstrates probable\n\ncause.\n\n            We need not decide whether the supporting affidavit's\n\nrecitation    of    CW-1's    prior     assistance     to    the    authorities    is\n\nsufficient, standing alone, to establish his reliability.                      Here,\n\nCW-1's reliability was bolstered by the detail he provided about\n\nStrother's    criminal      activities     --    including     drug     trafficking,\n\nfraudulent check cashing, and illegal firearms possession -- and by\n\nindependent corroboration thereof.               See Gates, 462 U.S. at 230\n\n(informant's truthfulness and basis of knowledge are not \"entirely\n\nseparate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in\n\nevery case.\")      First, CW-1 told Boshears that in March, 2000, he\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fsaw Strother scooping up large quantities of cocaine, and possibly\n\nheroin, into plastic bags on the first floor of 41 Kingsdale; that\n\nStrother carried the narcotics in small metal tins when outside of\n\nhis apartment; and that Strother used the first floor of 41\n\nKingsdale to store cocaine and heroin.     These allegations were\n\ncorroborated to some degree by, inter alia, Boshears's review of\n\nStrother's criminal record, which included two convictions for\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute; an outstanding\n\nwarrant for his arrest on state drug charges; and a veteran Boston\n\nPolice Officer's statement that Strother was known to \"run drug\n\nsales.\"\n\n          Second, CW-1 told Boshears that Strother was cashing and\n\nproviding others with fraudulent checks.    According to CW-1, the\n\ncheck-cashing scheme involved computer-generated checks that were\n\nprepared to look like payroll checks, made payable in amounts less\n\nthan $500, and cashed at supermarkets by persons who obtained check\n\ncashing privileges at such stores. Boshears's corroboration of the\n\nexistence of and Strother's participation in this scheme included\n\ninformation that (1) in January 2000, at least 41 fraudulent\n\npayroll checks in amounts ranging from $479.00 to $499.96 were\n\ncashed at Boston-area Stop & Shop stores; (2) also in January 2000,\n\na person using Strother's social security number had cashed one of\n\nthese fraudulent checks; and (3) the veteran Boston Police Officer\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fstated that Strother was known to be involved in the distribution\n\nside of a counterfeit check cashing and credit card fraud scheme.\n\n           Third, CW-1 told Boshears that in March, 2000, he had\n\npersonally observed two firearms -- a twelve-gauge pump-style\n\nshotgun and a nine-millimeter pistol -- on the first floor of 41\n\nKingsdale.     To determine whether Strother’s possession of these\n\nfirearms   was      evidence       of   a   crime,   Boshears     reviewed     records\n\nmaintained by the Massachusetts Criminal History Systems Board and\n\nlearned that he had been convicted of several felonies, including,\n\nin 1985, assault to kill, assault and battery with a dangerous\n\nweapon, and        carrying    a    dangerous     weapon.       In    his   affidavit,\n\nBoshears also stated that he relied on his own knowledge that\n\n           (1) under federal law, it is a criminal\n           offense for a previously convicted felon to\n           possess a firearm or ammunition that has\n           crossed a state line at any time after its\n           manufacture; (2) most firearms, and all or\n           almost all ammunition, recovered by law\n           enforcement in Massachusetts were manufactured\n           outside of Massachusetts; and (3) most people\n           store their firearms in their homes and\n           generally keep them for long periods of time\n           because firearms are expensive, do not wear\n           out easily, and are difficult to acquire,\n           especially by persons who possess them\n           unlawfully.\n\n             The    totality       of   these     elements   --      CW-1's   personal\n\nknowledge as to the location of the drugs and firearms, the\n\nspecificity and detail of CW-1's information as to the counterfeit\n\ncheck-cashing scheme, the independent corroboration of several\n\nelements of Strother's criminal activity (including the veteran\n\n                                            -9-\n\fBoston   police     officer's        statements),          and    Strother's     prior\n\nconvictions -- supports the existence of probable cause in this\n\ncase.    See     Khounsavanh,        113    F.3d     at    284.    Especially     when\n\nconsidered in conjunction with the reliability established by CW-\n\n1's   track    record,   we    see    no     error    in    the   district     court's\n\ndetermination that the search warrant was lawful.\n\nB.            Franks hearing\n\n              We review the court's denial of Strother's motion for a\n\nFranks hearing for clear error.               See United States v. Grant, 218\n\nF.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir. 2000).           In Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154\n\n(1978), the Supreme Court held that a defendant is entitled to a\n\nhearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made in an\n\naffidavit supporting a search warrant if he makes a substantial\n\npreliminary showing that (1) a statement in the affidavit was\n\nknowingly and intentionally false, or made with reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth, and (2) the falsehood was necessary to the finding\n\nof probable cause.       Id. at 171-172.\n\n              It is undisputed that the warrant application contained\n\ninaccurate statements as to the government's efforts to confirm\n\nStrother's address.       Boshears's initial affidavit stated that the\n\nrelevant postal carrier had verified that mail was delivered to the\n\nStrother family at the first floor of 41 Kingsdale Street, and that\n\npostal records indicated that the first floor was occupied by the\n\nStrother family.         Later, in response to Strother's motion to\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fsuppress, Boshears stated that the postal service confirmed only\n\nthat mail for \"the Struthers [sic] Family\" was delivered to 41\n\nKingsdale, and that the mail carrier did not have information as to\n\nthe specific occupants of each floor.\n\n          We agree with the district court, however, that Strother\n\ndid not satisfy the second prong of the Franks test.           Even assuming\n\nthat Boshears's misstatements were made with the requisite animus,\n\nthey were not necessary to the finding of probable cause.                  As\n\ndiscussed supra, CW-1's identification of the first floor of 41\n\nKingsdale as the locus of Strother's criminal activity was rendered\n\nreliable, at least to some degree, by his track record and was\n\ncorroborated in large measure by the Postal Service's information\n\nthat Strother lived on one of the three floors of the building.\n\nThe totality   of   this   evidence   was   sufficient    to    support   the\n\nprobable cause determination absent independent corroboration that\n\nStrother lived specifically on the first floor.\n\n          We do not condone the misstatement on the search warrant\n\napplication, regardless of whether it resulted from an innocent\n\noversight,   negligence    or   willful     misconduct.        Because    the\n\nmisinformation was not necessary to support the magistrate judge's\n\nfinding of probable cause, however, we need go no further.           \"[I]f,\n\nwhen material that is the subject of the alleged falsity or\n\nreckless disregard is set to one side, there remains sufficient\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcontent in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable\n\ncause, no hearing is required.\"   Id. at 171-172.\n\n          We AFFIRM the conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

According to Boshears, the postal carrier verified that mail was delivered to the Strother family at the first floor of 41 Kingsdale Street, and postal records also indicated that the first floor was occupied by the Strother family.

On December 28, 2001, Strother moved to suppress evidence seized during the search on the grounds that (1) the affidavit lacked probable cause, and (2) the affidavit contained an error that warranted a <i>Franks</i> hearing. Specifically, his <i>Franks</i> claim challenged Boshears's assertion that he lived at the searched residence.

In the second affidavit, Boshears attested that he reviewed his file and found a copy of a March 17, 2000 memorandum from the Postal Service to the Secret Service agent that stated that 41 Kingsdale \"is a three family residence [where mail was delivered to] Dennis and Mildred Richardson, The Brisco Family, and The Struthers [sic] Family.\" The memorandum further stated that the mail carrier did not have information as to the specific occupants of each floor.

Among the factors that may contribute to a probable cause determination are: whether an affidavit supports the probable veracity or basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information; whether informant statements are self-authenticating; whether some or all [of] the informant's factual statements were corroborated wherever reasonable and practicable (e.g., through police surveillance); and whether a law-enforcement affiant included a professional assessment of the probable significance of the facts related by the informant, based on experience or expertise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284 (quoting <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111) (internal quotations and footnote omitted). None of these factors are individually indispensable; rather, \"stronger evidence on one or more factors may compensate for a weaker or deficient showing on another.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strother argues that the warrant application failed to establish CW-1's reliability because CW-1's track record was limited to one instance of locating an individual wanted by the police. He also contends that the warrant application was deficient as to the nexus element: i.e., whether there was probable cause to believe that firearms were likely to be found at the searched residence. We disagree and hold that the totality of the circumstances set forth in the application demonstrates probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the supporting affidavit's recitation of CW-1's prior assistance to the authorities is sufficient, standing alone, to establish his reliability. Here, CW-1's reliability was bolstered by the detail he provided about Strother's criminal activities &#8212; including drug trafficking, fraudulent check cashing, and illegal firearms possession &#8212; and by independent corroboration thereof. <i>See Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (informant's truthfulness and basis of knowledge are not \"entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\") First, CW-1 told Boshears that in March, 2000, he saw Strother scooping up large quantities of cocaine, and possibly heroin, into plastic bags on the first floor of 41 Kingsdale; that Strother carried the narcotics in small metal tins when outside of his apartment; and that Strother used the first floor of 41 Kingsdale to store cocaine and heroin. These allegations were corroborated to some degree by, inter alia, Boshears's review of Strother's criminal record, which included two convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; an outstanding warrant for his arrest on state drug charges; and a veteran Boston Police Officer's statement that Strother was known to \"run drug sales.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, CW-1 told Boshears that Strother was cashing and providing others with fraudulent checks. According to CW-1, the check-cashing scheme involved computer-generated checks that were prepared to look like payroll checks, made payable in amounts less than $500, and cashed at supermarkets by persons who obtained check cashing privileges at such stores. Boshears's corroboration of the existence of and Strother's participation in this scheme included information that (1) in January 2000, at least 41 fraudulent payroll checks in amounts ranging from $479.00 to $499.96 were cashed at Bostonarea Stop &amp; Shop stores; (2) also in January 2000, a person using Strother's social security number had cashed one of these fraudulent checks; and (3) the veteran Boston Police Officer stated that Strother was known to be involved in the distribution side of a counterfeit check cashing and credit card fraud scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, CW-1 told Boshears that in March, 2000, he had personally observed two firearms &#8212; a twelve-gauge pump-style shotgun and a nine-millimeter pistol &#8212; on the first floor of 41 Kingsdale. To determine whether Strother's possession of these firearms was evidence of a crime, Boshears reviewed records maintained by the Massachusetts Criminal History Systems Board and learned that he had been convicted of several felonies, including, in 1985, assault to kill, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon. In his affidavit, Boshears also stated that he relied on his own knowledge that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) under federal law, it is a criminal offense for a previously convicted felon to possess a firearm or ammunition that has crossed a state line at any time after its manufacture; (2) most firearms, and all or almost all ammunition, recovered by law enforcement in Massachusetts were manufactured outside of Massachusetts; and (3) most people store their firearms in their homes and generally keep them for long periods of time because firearms are expensive, do not wear out easily, and are difficult to acquire, especially by persons who possess them unlawfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The totality of these elements &#8212; CW-1's personal knowledge as to the location of the drugs and firearms, the specificity and detail of CW-1's information as to the counterfeit check-cashing scheme, the independent corroboration of several elements of Strother's criminal activity (including the veteran Boston police officer's statements), and Strother's prior convictions &#8212; supports the existence of probable cause in this case. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284. Especially when considered in conjunction with the reliability established by CW-1's track record, we see no error in the district court's determination that the search warrant was lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Franks</i> hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's denial of Strother's motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing for clear error. <i>See United States v. Grant,</i> 218 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir.2000). In <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a defendant is entitled to a hearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made in an affidavit supporting a search warrant if he makes a substantial preliminary showing that (1) a statement in the affidavit was knowingly and intentionally false, or made with reckless disregard for the truth, and (2) the falsehood was necessary to the finding of probable cause. <i>Id.</i> at 171-172, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the warrant application contained inaccurate statements as to the government's efforts to confirm Strother's address. Boshears's initial affidavit stated that the relevant postal carrier had verified that mail was delivered to the Strother family at the first floor of 41 Kingsdale Street, and that postal records indicated that the first floor was occupied by the Strother family. Later, in response to Strother's motion to suppress, Boshears stated that the postal service confirmed only that mail for \"the Struthers [sic] Family\" was delivered to 41 Kingsdale, and that the mail carrier did not have information as to the specific occupants of each floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court, however, that Strother did not satisfy the second prong of the <i>Franks</i> test. Even assuming that Boshears's misstatements were made with the requisite animus, they were not necessary to the finding of probable cause. As discussed <i>supra,</i> CW-1's identification of the first floor of 41 Kingsdale as the locus of Strother's criminal activity was rendered reliable, at least to some degree, by his track record and was corroborated in large measure by the Postal Service's information that Strother lived on one of the three floors of the building. The totality of this evidence was sufficient to support the probable cause determination absent independent corroboration that Strother lived specifically on the first floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not condone the misstatement on the search warrant application, regardless of whether it resulted from an innocent oversight, negligence or willful misconduct. Because the misinformation was not necessary to support the magistrate judge's finding of probable cause, however, we need go no further. \"[I]f, when material that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disregard is set to one side, there remains sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 171-172, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>AFFIRM</i> the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For convenience, we assume that CW-1 is male</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The corroboration of CW-1's statements concerning Strother's involvement in fraudulent check cashing, drug trafficking, and possession of firearms is set forth in detail<i>infra,</i> Section II(A).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Among the factors that may contribute to a probable cause determination are: whether an affidavit supports the probable veracity or basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information; whether informant statements are self-authenticating; whether some or all [of] the informant's factual statements were corroborated wherever reasonable and practicable (e.g., through police surveillance); and whether a law-enforcement affiant included a professional assessment of the probable significance of the facts related by the informant, based on experience or expertise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284 (quoting <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111) (internal quotations and footnote omitted). None of these factors are individually indispensable; rather, \"stronger evidence on one or more factors may compensate for a weaker or deficient showing on another.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Strother argues that the warrant application failed to establish CW-1's reliability because CW-1's track record was limited to one instance of locating an individual wanted by the police. He also contends that the warrant application was deficient as to the nexus element: i.e., whether there was probable cause to believe that firearms were likely to be found at the searched residence. We disagree and hold that the totality of the circumstances set forth in the application demonstrates probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the supporting affidavit's recitation of CW-1's prior assistance to the authorities is sufficient, standing alone, to establish his reliability. Here, CW-1's reliability was bolstered by the detail he provided about Strother's criminal activities &#8212; including drug trafficking, fraudulent check cashing, and illegal firearms possession &#8212; and by independent corroboration thereof. <i>See Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 230, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2317</span></a></span> (informant's truthfulness and basis of knowledge are not \"entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\") First, CW-1 told Boshears that in March, 2000, he saw Strother scooping up large quantities of cocaine, and possibly heroin, into plastic bags on the first floor of 41 Kingsdale; that Strother carried the narcotics in small metal tins when outside of his apartment; and that Strother used the first floor of 41 Kingsdale to store cocaine and heroin. These allegations were corroborated to some degree by, inter alia, Boshears's review of Strother's criminal record, which included two convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; an outstanding warrant for his arrest on state drug charges; and a veteran Boston Police Officer's statement that Strother was known to \"run drug sales.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, CW-1 told Boshears that Strother was cashing and providing others with fraudulent checks. According to CW-1, the check-cashing scheme involved computer-generated checks that were prepared to look like payroll checks, made payable in amounts less than $500, and cashed at supermarkets by persons who obtained check cashing privileges at such stores. Boshears's corroboration of the existence of and Strother's participation in this scheme included information that (1) in January 2000, at least 41 fraudulent payroll checks in amounts ranging from $479.00 to $499.96 were cashed at Bostonarea Stop &amp; Shop stores; (2) also in January 2000, a person using Strother's social security number had cashed one of these fraudulent checks; and (3) the veteran Boston Police Officer stated that Strother was known to be involved in the distribution side of a counterfeit check cashing and credit card fraud scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, CW-1 told Boshears that in March, 2000, he had personally observed two firearms &#8212; a twelve-gauge pump-style shotgun and a nine-millimeter pistol &#8212; on the first floor of 41 Kingsdale. To determine whether Strother's possession of these firearms was evidence of a crime, Boshears reviewed records maintained by the Massachusetts Criminal History Systems Board and learned that he had been convicted of several felonies, including, in 1985, assault to kill, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon. In his affidavit, Boshears also stated that he relied on his own knowledge that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) under federal law, it is a criminal offense for a previously convicted felon to possess a firearm or ammunition that has crossed a state line at any time after its manufacture; (2) most firearms, and all or almost all ammunition, recovered by law enforcement in Massachusetts were manufactured outside of Massachusetts; and (3) most people store their firearms in their homes and generally keep them for long periods of time because firearms are expensive, do not wear out easily, and are difficult to acquire, especially by persons who possess them unlawfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The totality of these elements &#8212; CW-1's personal knowledge as to the location of the drugs and firearms, the specificity and detail of CW-1's information as to the counterfeit check-cashing scheme, the independent corroboration of several elements of Strother's criminal activity (including the veteran Boston police officer's statements), and Strother's prior convictions &#8212; supports the existence of probable cause in this case. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284. Especially when considered in conjunction with the reliability established by CW-1's track record, we see no error in the district court's determination that the search warrant was lawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Franks</i> hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's denial of Strother's motion for a <i>Franks</i> hearing for clear error. <i>See United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (1978), the Supreme Court held that a defendant is entitled to a hearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made in an affidavit supporting a search warrant if he makes a substantial preliminary showing that (1) a statement in the affidavit was knowingly and intentionally false, or made with reckless disregard for the truth, and (2) the falsehood was necessary to the finding of probable cause. <i>Id.</i> at 171-172, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2674</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that the warrant application contained inaccurate statements as to the government's efforts to confirm Strother's address. Boshears's initial affidavit stated that the relevant postal carrier had verified that mail was delivered to the Strother family at the first floor of 41 Kingsdale Street, and that postal records indicated that the first floor was occupied by the Strother family. Later, in response to Strother's motion to suppress, Boshears stated that the postal service confirmed only that mail for \"the Struthers [sic] Family\" was delivered to 41 Kingsdale, and that the mail carrier did not have information as to the specific occupants of each floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court, however, that Strother did not satisfy the second prong of the <i>Franks</i> test. Even assuming that Boshears's misstatements were made with the requisite animus, they were not necessary to the finding of probable cause. As discussed <i>supra,</i> CW-1's identification of the first floor of 41 Kingsdale as the locus of Strother's criminal activity was rendered reliable, at least to some degree, by his track record and was corroborated in large measure by the Postal Service's information that Strother lived on one of the three floors of the building. The totality of this evidence was sufficient to support the probable cause determination absent independent corroboration that Strother lived specifically on the first floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not condone the misstatement on the search warrant application, regardless of whether it resulted from an innocent oversight, negligence or willful misconduct. Because the misinformation was not necessary to support the magistrate judge's finding of probable cause, however, we need go no further. \"[I]f, when material that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disregard is set to one side, there remains sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 171-172, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
