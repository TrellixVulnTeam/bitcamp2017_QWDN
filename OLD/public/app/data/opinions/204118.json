Lasker, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                  Torruella, Ripple,* and Boudin,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David J. Barend, for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Michael\nJ. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Angel Kelley Brown,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         December 23, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.     Appellant Rashiek T. Cannon\n\npled guilty to a single count of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm, after police found him carrying a loaded gun during a\n\nroutine traffic stop.    The district court imposed a seventy month\n\nsentence based, in part, on its determination that Cannon had\n\npossessed the firearm \"in connection with\" a felony drug offense\n\nfor purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6).      In this appeal, Cannon\n\nchallenges the district court's application of the § 2K2.1(b)(6)\n\nenhancement, contending that the government failed to prove by a\n\npreponderance of evidence that he knew about the existence of drugs\n\nfound in the car in which he was arrested, or that those drugs were\n\nintended for distribution and not personal use.       After careful\n\nreview, we affirm.\n\n                           I.   Background\n\n           A.   Cannon's Arrest1\n\n           On October 5, 2004, three Brockton police officers were\n\non patrol in the area of Walnut Street when they observed a red\n\nsport utility vehicle (SUV) with three occupants exceeding the\n\nspeed limit. The officers flashed their lights and pulled over the\n\nSUV.   As one of the officers approached, he saw Cannon sitting in\n\nthe right front passenger seat with a firearm visible in his right\n\nfront jacket pocket.    He alerted the other officers, secured the\n\n\n1\n    We draw these facts from the uncontested portions of the\npresentence report (PSR). See United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d\n22, 24 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                   -2-\n\fgun –- a loaded .38 caliber Charter Arms revolver –- and then\n\nremoved Cannon from the vehicle and placed him on the pavement.\n\nThe officers ordered the driver, Corey Allen, to get out of the\n\nSUV; they told the rear seat passenger, Carlos Báez, to remain\n\ninside.     Allen tried to flee, but he was quickly caught by the\n\nofficers.\n\n            The   officers   searched    Allen   and   found   that   he   was\n\ncarrying a bag of marijuana.        The quantity of marijuana is not\n\nreflected in the record.      The officers then removed Báez from the\n\nrear seat and searched the SUV.     They found two bags, which the PSR\n\ndescribes as containing \"two large pieces and one small piece\" of\n\ncrack cocaine.     However, there is no information in the record as\n\nto the specific drug quantity.      The record also fails to indicate\n\nwhere in the SUV the crack cocaine was found, whether it was\n\naccessible to Cannon in the front passenger seat, or whether it was\n\nin plain view.\n\n            All three occupants were arrested.          Later, during the\n\nbooking process, the police discovered that Allen had a second bag\n\nof marijuana, also of unknown quantity, hidden in his sock and\n\n$1,715 in cash.    Báez had $100 on him and Cannon had $272.          All of\n\nthe men said that they were unemployed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             B.    Guilty Plea and Sentencing\n\n             Cannon, who had some prior convictions, qualified as a\n\nfelon for purpose of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and was charged under\n\nthe statute with unlawful possession of a firearm.2                In March 2007\n\nCannon moved to have a pre-plea PSR prepared by the Probation\n\nDepartment. The PSR assigned Cannon a criminal history category of\n\nV,    and   recommended    a   four-level      enhancement    under    U.S.S.G.\n\n§    2K2.1(b)(6)    because    Cannon    had   possessed     the    firearm   \"in\n\nconnection with another felony offense, to wit: distribution of\n\nnarcotics.\"        The PSR allowed for a three-level reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and assigned a total offense level of\n\ntwenty-one.       Cannon faced a maximum term of imprisonment of ten\n\nyears, and the PSR arrived at a sentencing range of seventy to\n\neighty-seven months.\n\n             Cannon objected to the PSR's recommended § 2K2.1(b)(6)\n\nenhancement, contending that there was no evidence he knew about\n\nthe drugs found in the SUV or, even if he did, that he intended to\n\ndistribute them.       Cannon emphasized that he did not own the car\n\nand, unlike the driver, did not attempt to flee.             Thus, he argued,\n\nthere was no basis to conclude that he possessed the gun \"in\n\nconnection with\" any drug offense.               The Probation Department\n\nmaintained that the enhancement was proper because it applies when\n\n\n\n2\n   The record does not disclose what charges, if any, were brought\nagainst Allen and Báez.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fa gun is found in close proximity to drugs and has the potential to\n\nfacilitate another felony offense.            See U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(B)(6),\n\napplication note 14.\n\n           Cannon pled guilty in October 2007.              At the Rule 11\n\nhearing, Cannon admitted only to possessing the firearm; there was\n\nno discussion regarding the § 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement or the facts\n\nsupporting that enhancement.      Cannon acknowledged that he could\n\nface up to ten years in prison as a result of his plea.\n\n           Later,   at   the   sentencing       hearing,    the   government\n\nrecommended that Cannon receive full credit for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility and a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines\n\nrange.    Cannon's attorney reasserted his objection to the § 2K2.1\n\n(b)(6) enhancement and, in his allocution, Cannon denied that he\n\nhad \"anything to do with the drugs they found.\"              The government\n\ncountered that circumstantial evidence supported the enhancement,\n\nstating \"there is a very strong argument that the defendant was in\n\nconstructive possession of the drugs.\"\n\n           The district court found that, while it was \"not possible\n\nto decide the question with absolute certainty or, necessarily\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt,\" the evidence supporting the enhancement\n\nwas \"very strong against the defendant.\"         The court concluded that\n\n\"a fair determination of the [enhancement issue] is that it be\n\ndecided   by   putting   a   sentence    at    the   very   bottom   of   the\n\nGuidelines.\"   Accordingly, Cannon was sentenced to seventy months'\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fimprisonment, at the low end of the recommended range.               As the\n\ncourt noted, the sentence \"[took] into consideration that [Cannon]\n\nwas found with drugs and that that was related to the offense in\n\nthis case.\"   This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n           We review the district court's interpretation of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines de novo, factual findings for clear error,\n\nand its application of the Guidelines to a particular set of facts\n\non a \"sliding scale.\"      United States v. Sicher, 576 F.3d 64, 71 &\n\nn.6 (1st Cir. 2009).       Where, as here, a defendant challenges the\n\nfactual predicate supporting the district court's application of a\n\nsentencing enhancement, \"we ask only whether the court clearly\n\nerred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\" United States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d\n\n174, 180 (1st Cir. 2005).          \"[W]here there is more than one\n\nplausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice\n\namong   supportable   alternatives    cannot    be   clearly    erroneous.\"\n\nUnited States v. Campusano, 556 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           Pursuant   to   U.S.S.G.   §   2K2.1(b)(6),   a     defendant   is\n\nsubject to a four-level increase in his base offense calculation if\n\nhe \"used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with\n\nanother felony offense; or possessed . . . any firearm . . . with\n\nknowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fpossessed in connection with another felony offense.\" We have held\n\nthat, as used in this provision of the Guidelines, \"the phrase 'in\n\nconnection with' should be interpreted broadly.\"              United States v.\n\nThompson, 32 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Although there must be a causal or logical\n            relation or sequence between the possession\n            and the related offense, and mere coincidental\n            possession is insufficient, we will find that\n            a firearm has been used \"in connection with\"\n            an offense if the possession has the potential\n            to aid or facilitate the other crime.\n\nUnited States v. Peterson, 233 F.3d 101, 111 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\"[I]n the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is\n\nfound in close proximity to drugs, . . . [the enhancement] is\n\nwarranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of\n\nfacilitating another felony offense.\"              U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6),\n\napplication note 14.\n\n            In this appeal, Cannon argues that the § 2K2.1(b)(6)\n\nenhancement    should    not   have   applied      because     the   record   is\n\ninsufficient to support the inference that he knew about the drugs\n\nor, in the alternative, that the drugs were intended for anything\n\nbut personal consumption.       While Cannon acknowledges that he was\n\nfound with the firearm in \"close proximity\" to drugs, he emphasizes\n\nthe absence of direct proof linking him to the drugs or drug\n\ndistribution, including evidence as to drug quantity, whether the\n\ndrugs found in the SUV were in plain view, or whether they were\n\notherwise   readily     accessible    to    him   in   the   front   seat.    He\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmaintains    that   his   possession        of   the    firearm   was   merely\n\ncoincidental.\n\n            While direct proof of Cannon's knowledge and intent\n\nregarding the drugs may be lacking, \"[a] sentencing court is\n\nentitled to rely on circumstantial evidence, and draw plausible\n\ninferences therefrom\" in determining whether an enhancement should\n\napply.   United States v. Marceau, 554 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(internal citations omitted); see Sicher, 576 F.3d at 71.               Indeed,\n\nin narcotics cases, we have often recognized that knowledge and\n\nintent \"'must be proved largely by circumstantial evidence.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58, 66 (1st Cir. 2000)(quoting\n\nUnited States v. Valencia, 907 F.2d 671, 678 (7th Cir. 1990)).              In\n\nthis case, the record reflects that Cannon, no stranger to the drug\n\ntrade, was arrested with a loaded revolver while traveling in a\n\nvehicle in which police found multiple packages of drugs, as well\n\nas a substantial amount of cash among the occupants, all of whom\n\nindicated they were unemployed.        These circumstantial facts, taken\n\ntogether,   were    sufficient   to    permit     the    district   court   to\n\nreasonably infer under a preponderance standard that Cannon had\n\nknowledge of the drugs and that the drugs were intended for sale\n\nand not personal consumption.         As we discuss, these findings are\n\nintertwined.3\n\n\n3\n  The district court determined that Cannon was \"found with drugs\"\nand that the firearm was possessed \"in the presence at least of\ndrug transactions.\"   These determinations necessarily encompass\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          First, the large quantity of cash found on the driver,\n\nand the lesser but still substantial amounts found on Cannon and\n\nBáez, support the inference that the car's occupants were engaged\n\nin the sale, rather than casual use, of drugs.    See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Ayala-García, 574 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 2009) (finding\n\nthat \"[t]he large amount of cash,\" viz., $1,068, found in bag\n\ncontaining individually-packaged drugs supports inference that\n\ndrugs   were   intended   for   distribution);   United   States   v.\n\nMangual-Santiago, 562 F.3d 411, 425 (1st Cir. 2009) (explaining\n\nthat \"large amounts of cash,\" such as the $1000 found on the\n\ndefendant, \"are . . . probative of the intent to distribute\n\nnarcotics\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n          We have often held that firearms, too, are probative of\n\nan intent to distribute narcotics.     See, e.g., United States v.\n\nRivera-Calderón, 578 F.3d 78, 94 (1st Cir. 2009) (evidence that\n\ndefendant carried firearm in vicinity of armed drug conspiracy\n\nsupports inference of membership in the conspiracy; \"[i]n drug\n\n\nfindings that Cannon knew about the drugs in the SUV and that those\ndrugs were intended for distribution and not personal consumption.\nSee Sicher, 576 F.3d at 71 (explaining that district courts need\nnot \"specify the precise basis for the application of [an]\nenhancement\" because \"a sentencing court's reasoning can often be\ninferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained\nin the pre-sentence report with what the judge did\")(internal\nquotation marks and alterations omitted); see also United States v.\nTavano, 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir. 1993). Because we find these\nfacts sufficient to permit application of the enhancement, we do\nnot address whether the district court found, or the government\nproved, that Cannon was in constructive possession of the drugs, an\nissue which the parties have not briefed in any detail.\n\n                                 -9-\n\ftrafficking firearms have become 'tools of the trade' and thus are\n\nprobative of the existence of a drug conspiracy\").                     While we\n\nacknowledge that a gun's physical proximity to drugs alone may be\n\ninsufficient to justify a court in applying the enhancement in all\n\ncircumstances, cf. United States v. Sturtevant, 62 F.3d 33, 34-35\n\n(1st Cir. 1995)(per curiam)(citing as an example of coincidental\n\npossession \"an accountant who, while forging checks, happens to\n\nhave a gun in the desk drawer\"), the district court was not\n\nrequired to turn a blind eye to the logical relationship between\n\nthe presence of multiple packages of drugs, the loaded firearm, and\n\nthe large amount of cash in determining whether the drugs found in\n\nthe SUV were intended for distribution or personal use. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited   States    v.   Ford,    22   F.3d     374,    383   (1st    Cir.   1994)\n\n(\"[F]irearms and large amounts of cash are each probative of the\n\nintent to distribute narcotics.\"); see also United States v.\n\nFisher, 912 F.2d 728, 731 (4th Cir. 1990)(\"The large amount of cash\n\nfound in [the defendant's] possession and his ownership of handguns\n\nis . . . circumstantial evidence of his involvement in narcotics\n\ndistribution.\").\n\n           We   also    find    Cannon's     history   of    drug   distribution\n\nrelevant to the question of whether he was, as he claims, ignorant\n\nof the drugs and their intended distribution. See United States v.\n\nRichardson, 510 F.3d 622, 628 (6th Cir. 2007) (where defendant \"had\n\ntwo prior convictions for possession with intent to distribute\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcontrolled substances and less than four months after the instant\n\noffense, he was convicted again for possession and distribution of\n\nmarijuana . . . he had an established knowledge and participation\n\nin   drug   trafficking    activity\"     which   supports    inference   that\n\ndefendant possessed gun \"in connection with\" drugs found in close\n\nproximity); United States v. LePage, 477 F.3d 485, 489 (7th Cir.\n\n2007)   (defendant's      prior   sale   of   drugs    \"consistent   with    an\n\ninference that he is a trafficker\").             The PSR indicates that in\n\nMarch 2002 Cannon was and charged with possession of, with intent\n\nto distribute, crack cocaine, after he was found with a bag of\n\ncrack, three bags of marijuana, and $2,485 in cash -– circumstances\n\nstrikingly similar to those of the instant offense. The charge was\n\nlater reduced to simple possession, and Cannon was convicted.               The\n\nPSR also reveals that, just three months after his arrest in this\n\ncase, Cannon was again arrested and subsequently convicted for\n\npossession of, with intent to distribute, crack cocaine.                 This\n\nhistory further supports the inference that Cannon was no idle\n\npassenger at the time of this offense, and that his possession of\n\nthe loaded gun was not mere happenstance.             The district court was\n\npermitted to use its common sense to conclude that Cannon's loaded\n\ngun and the drugs found in the SUV were the tools of a single,\n\nshared criminal endeavor.         Cf. United States v. Batista-Polanco,\n\n927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991)(\"[I]t runs counter to human\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fexperience to suppose that criminal conspirators would welcome\n\ninnocent nonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\").\n\n           In opposing the enhancement, Cannon's principal theme is\n\nthat the record in this case fails to reflect direct evidence of\n\nknowledge, or an intent to distribute, of the sort present in other\n\ncases where § 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancements have been upheld.                 Thus,\n\nCannon emphasizes that he has never admitted to knowledge of the\n\ndrugs, compare United States v. Gonzáles, 506 F.3d 940, 947 (9th\n\nCir. 2007); that no witness ever saw him involved in drug activity\n\nrelated to the instant offense, compare Thompson, 32 F.3d at 7;\n\nthat there is no evidence that the drugs were visible or readily\n\naccessible   to   him,   or    found    alongside   certain    paraphernalia\n\nassociated with drug distribution, such as scales or ledgers,\n\ncompare Peterson, 233 F.3d at 104; and, finally, that there is no\n\nevidence as to the nature of his relationship with Allen and Báez\n\nsufficient to permit an inference of a close association, compare\n\nRichardson, 510 F.3d at 627-28 (attributing knowledge to defendant\n\nof drugs found in his girlfriend's purse).           However, the cases on\n\nwhich Cannon relies do not purport to lay a minimum evidentiary\n\nthreshold for application of an enhancement under § 2K2.1(b)(6).\n\nRather, as we have explained, the issue presented for review is\n\nwhether   the   district      court    clearly   erred   in   finding,   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that Cannon knew about the drugs and\n\nthat the drugs were intended for distribution.                 Based on the\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fconsiderations discussed above, we conclude that the totality of\n\nevidence   before   the     district    court   plausibly       supports   such\n\nconclusions.\n\n           Accordingly, because we find that the record supports the\n\ninference Cannon possessed the loaded gun knowing that there were\n\ndrugs in the SUV which were intended for sale, we hold that\n\nCannon's possession of the firearm had the potential to facilitate\n\nthe offense of distribution -– by emboldening the enterprise,\n\naiding   the   collection    of   a   drug   debt,    or   in   any   number   of\n\nforeseeable ways –- and was therefore \"connect[ed] with\" that\n\nfelony for purposes of the enhancement.              See, e.g., Thompson, 32\n\nF.3d at 8 (noting that \"the usual case in which the § 2K2.1\n\n[enhancement] is used to apply drug guidelines to a firearms\n\noffender is where the defendant used a firearm for protection\n\nduring a drug transaction or had the firearm available to protect\n\nhis supply of drugs\"); see also United States v. Loney, 219 F.3d\n\n281, 288 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"[W]hen a defendant has a loaded gun on\n\nhis person while caught in the midst of a crime that involves\n\nin-person transactions, . . . a district judge can reasonably infer\n\nthat there is a relationship between the gun and the offense\n\n. . . .\" (citing Sturtevant, 62 F.3d at 33)).4\n\n\n4\n   Because we find that the district court plausibly determined\nthat the drugs were intended for distribution, we decline to\naddress the alternative argument raised by the government that\nCannon's possession of the gun in connection with the felony of\nsimple possession of drugs for personal use would support\n\n                                      -13-\n\f          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nenhancement under § 2K2.1(b)(6).

The district court imposed a seventy month\n\nsentence based, in part, on its determination that Cannon had\n\npossessed the firearm \"in connection with\" a felony drug offense\n\nfor purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6).

Cannon's Arrest1\n\n           On October 5, 2004, three Brockton police officers were\n\non patrol in the area of Walnut Street when they observed a red\n\nsport utility vehicle (SUV) with three occupants exceeding the\n\nspeed limit. The officers flashed their lights and pulled over the\n\nSUV.   As one of the officers approached, he saw Cannon sitting in\n\nthe right front passenger seat with a firearm visible in his right\n\nfront jacket pocket.    He alerted the other officers, secured the\n\n\n1\n    We draw these facts from the uncontested portions of the\npresentence report (PSR). See United States v.

Allen tried to flee, but he was quickly caught by the\n\nofficers.\n\n            The   officers   searched    Allen   and   found   that   he   was\n\ncarrying a bag of marijuana.        The quantity of marijuana is not\n\nreflected in the record.      The officers then removed Báez from the\n\nrear seat and searched the SUV.     They found two bags, which the PSR\n\ndescribes as containing \"two large pieces and one small piece\" of\n\ncrack cocaine.     However, there is no information in the record as\n\nto the specific drug quantity.      The record also fails to indicate\n\nwhere in the SUV the crack cocaine was found, whether it was\n\naccessible to Cannon in the front passenger seat, or whether it was\n\nin plain view.\n\n            All three occupants were arrested.          Later, during the\n\nbooking process, the police discovered that Allen had a second bag\n\nof marijuana, also of unknown quantity, hidden in his sock and\n\n$1,715 in cash.    Báez had $100 on him and Cannon had $272.          All of\n\nthe men said that they were unemployed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             B.    Guilty Plea and Sentencing\n\n             Cannon, who had some prior convictions, qualified as a\n\nfelon for purpose of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and was charged under\n\nthe statute with unlawful possession of a firearm.2                In March 2007\n\nCannon moved to have a pre-plea PSR prepared by the Probation\n\nDepartment. The PSR assigned Cannon a criminal history category of\n\nV,    and   recommended    a   four-level      enhancement    under    U.S.S.G.\n\n§    2K2.1(b)(6)    because    Cannon    had   possessed     the    firearm   \"in\n\nconnection with another felony offense, to wit: distribution of\n\nnarcotics.\"        The PSR allowed for a three-level reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility and assigned a total offense level of\n\ntwenty-one.       Cannon faced a maximum term of imprisonment of ten\n\nyears, and the PSR arrived at a sentencing range of seventy to\n\neighty-seven months.\n\n             Cannon objected to the PSR's recommended § 2K2.1(b)(6)\n\nenhancement, contending that there was no evidence he knew about\n\nthe drugs found in the SUV or, even if he did, that he intended to\n\ndistribute them.       Cannon emphasized that he did not own the car\n\nand, unlike the driver, did not attempt to flee.             Thus, he argued,\n\nthere was no basis to conclude that he possessed the gun \"in\n\nconnection with\" any drug offense.               The Probation Department\n\nmaintained that the enhancement was proper because it applies when\n\n\n\n2\n   The record does not disclose what charges, if any, were brought\nagainst Allen and Báez.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fa gun is found in close proximity to drugs and has the potential to\n\nfacilitate another felony offense.            See U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(B)(6),\n\napplication note 14.\n\n           Cannon pled guilty in October 2007.              At the Rule 11\n\nhearing, Cannon admitted only to possessing the firearm; there was\n\nno discussion regarding the § 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement or the facts\n\nsupporting that enhancement.      Cannon acknowledged that he could\n\nface up to ten years in prison as a result of his plea.\n\n           Later,   at   the   sentencing       hearing,    the   government\n\nrecommended that Cannon receive full credit for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility and a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines\n\nrange.    Cannon's attorney reasserted his objection to the § 2K2.1\n\n(b)(6) enhancement and, in his allocution, Cannon denied that he\n\nhad \"anything to do with the drugs they found.\"              The government\n\ncountered that circumstantial evidence supported the enhancement,\n\nstating \"there is a very strong argument that the defendant was in\n\nconstructive possession of the drugs.\"\n\n           The district court found that, while it was \"not possible\n\nto decide the question with absolute certainty or, necessarily\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt,\" the evidence supporting the enhancement\n\nwas \"very strong against the defendant.\"         The court concluded that\n\n\"a fair determination of the [enhancement issue] is that it be\n\ndecided   by   putting   a   sentence    at    the   very   bottom   of   the\n\nGuidelines.\"   Accordingly, Cannon was sentenced to seventy months'\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fimprisonment, at the low end of the recommended range.               As the\n\ncourt noted, the sentence \"[took] into consideration that [Cannon]\n\nwas found with drugs and that that was related to the offense in\n\nthis case.\"   This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.

While Cannon acknowledges that he was\n\nfound with the firearm in \"close proximity\" to drugs, he emphasizes\n\nthe absence of direct proof linking him to the drugs or drug\n\ndistribution, including evidence as to drug quantity, whether the\n\ndrugs found in the SUV were in plain view, or whether they were\n\notherwise   readily     accessible    to    him   in   the   front   seat.    He\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmaintains    that   his   possession        of   the    firearm   was   merely\n\ncoincidental.\n\n            While direct proof of Cannon's knowledge and intent\n\nregarding the drugs may be lacking, \"[a] sentencing court is\n\nentitled to rely on circumstantial evidence, and draw plausible\n\ninferences therefrom\" in determining whether an enhancement should\n\napply.

These circumstantial facts, taken\n\ntogether,   were    sufficient   to    permit     the    district   court   to\n\nreasonably infer under a preponderance standard that Cannon had\n\nknowledge of the drugs and that the drugs were intended for sale\n\nand not personal consumption.

Batista-Polanco,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 1991)(\"[I]t runs counter to human\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fexperience to suppose that criminal conspirators would welcome\n\ninnocent nonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.\").\n\n           In opposing the enhancement, Cannon's principal theme is\n\nthat the record in this case fails to reflect direct evidence of\n\nknowledge, or an intent to distribute, of the sort present in other\n\ncases where § 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancements have been upheld.                 Thus,\n\nCannon emphasizes that he has never admitted to knowledge of the\n\ndrugs, compare United States v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1290259\"><a href=\"/opinion/1290259/united-states-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 947 (9th\n\nCir. 2007); that no witness ever saw him involved in drug activity\n\nrelated to the instant offense, compare Thompson, 32 F.3d at 7;\n\nthat there is no evidence that the drugs were visible or readily\n\naccessible   to   him,   or    found    alongside   certain    paraphernalia\n\nassociated with drug distribution, such as scales or ledgers,\n\ncompare Peterson, 233 F.3d at 104; and, finally, that there is no\n\nevidence as to the nature of his relationship with Allen and Báez\n\nsufficient to permit an inference of a close association, compare\n\nRichardson, 510 F.3d at 627-28 (attributing knowledge to defendant\n\nof drugs found in his girlfriend's purse).           However, the cases on\n\nwhich Cannon relies do not purport to lay a minimum evidentiary\n\nthreshold for application of an enhancement under § 2K2.1(b)(6).\n\nRather, as we have explained, the issue presented for review is\n\nwhether   the   district      court    clearly   erred   in   finding,   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that Cannon knew about the drugs and\n\nthat the drugs were intended for distribution.                 Based on the\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fconsiderations discussed above, we conclude that the totality of\n\nevidence   before   the     district    court   plausibly       supports   such\n\nconclusions.\n\n           Accordingly, because we find that the record supports the\n\ninference Cannon possessed the loaded gun knowing that there were\n\ndrugs in the SUV which were intended for sale, we hold that\n\nCannon's possession of the firearm had the potential to facilitate\n\nthe offense of distribution -– by emboldening the enterprise,\n\naiding   the   collection    of   a   drug   debt,    or   in   any   number   of\n\nforeseeable ways –- and was therefore \"connect[ed] with\" that\n\nfelony for purposes of the enhancement.              See, e.g., Thompson, 32\n\nF.3d at 8 (noting that \"the usual case in which the § 2K2.1\n\n[enhancement] is used to apply drug guidelines to a firearms\n\noffender is where the defendant used a firearm for protection\n\nduring a drug transaction or had the firearm available to protect\n\nhis supply of drugs\"); see also United States v. Loney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769514\"><a href=\"/opinion/769514/united-states-v-alexander-d-loney/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"[W]hen a defendant has a loaded gun on\n\nhis person while caught in the midst of a crime that involves\n\nin-person transactions, . . . a district judge can reasonably infer\n\nthat there is a relationship between the gun and the offense\n\n. . . .\" (citing Sturtevant, 62 F.3d at 33)).4\n\n\n4\n   Because we find that the district court plausibly determined\nthat the drugs were intended for distribution, we decline to\naddress the alternative argument raised by the government that\nCannon's possession of the gun in connection with the felony of\nsimple possession of drugs for personal use would support\n\n                                      -13-\n\f          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nenhancement under § 2K2.1(b)(6).
