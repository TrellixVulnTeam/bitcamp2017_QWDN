R. 32.3\n\n\n             United States Court of Appeals\n                           For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 05-2670\n\n                         UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                    Appellee,\n\n                                         v.\n\n                                WILLIAM LELAND,\n\n                            Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n             APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                         FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n           [Hon. John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                      Before\n\n                          Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                     Siler,** Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Robert M. Napolitano for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              September 22, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             Per Curiam.      In a second superseding indictment, a\n\nfederal grand jury in the District of Maine charged defendant-\n\nappellant William Leland with commission of an array of federal\n\ncontrolled substance and firearms offenses.               See 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S. C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). On January 27,\n\n2004, pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement that called for the\n\ngovernment to move to dismiss one count of the indictment, the\n\nappellant entered guilty pleas to the remaining counts.\n\n             Almost a year later, in a motion filed on January 19,\n\n2005, the appellant sought to withdraw his guilty pleas. Following\n\na hearing, the district court, in a well-reasoned rescript, denied\n\nthe motion.     United States v. Leland, 370 F. Supp. 2d 337, 339-47\n\n(D. Me. 2005) (concluding, inter alia, that the movant lacked a\n\nfair and just reason for his plea-withdrawal request).                On October\n\n27, 2005, the court sentenced the appellant to serve a 252-month\n\nincarcerative term.        This appeal followed.\n\n             We have long adhered to the view that when a trial court\n\naccurately sizes up a case, applies the proper legal rules, and\n\narticulates a persuasive rationale, \"an appellate court should\n\nrefrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own\n\nwords resonate.\"      Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d\n\n218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996); accord, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil\n\nCo.,   202   F.3d   381,   383   (1st    Cir.   2000);   Ayala   v.    Union   de\n\nTronquistas, Local 901, 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); Holders\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fCapital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza\n\nHotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).                  This case\n\nfits snugly within the confines of that principle. Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the judgment below for essentially the reasons elucidated in\n\nthe district court's meticulous analysis of the plea-withdrawal\n\nrequest.\n\n            There is one loose end.          On appeal — unlike in the lower\n\ncourt — the appellant claims that his former attorney provided\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.            A threshold problem stands in\n\nthe way of this Sixth Amendment challenge: no such claim was\n\nadvanced below.    This court has ruled \"with a regularity bordering\n\non the monotonous [that] claims of ineffective assistance cannot\n\nmake their debut on direct review.\"           United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d\n\n1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993).      While the Mala rule admits of a narrow\n\nband of exceptions applicable to cases in which \"the critical facts\n\nare   not   genuinely   in   dispute    and    the   record   is   sufficiently\n\ndeveloped to allow reasoned consideration\" of a freshly minted\n\nineffective assistance claim, United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17\n\nF. 3d 480, 485 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Natenel,\n\n938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991)), this appeal plainly falls\n\noutside the compass of that band of exceptions.                    We therefore\n\nreject the appellant's ineffective assistance claim as premature,\n\nwithout prejudice, however, to his right to raise that claim,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fshould he so desire, in a petition for post-conviction relief under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n            We need go no further.        Having perused the briefs with\n\ncare, entertained oral argument, and canvassed the record in its\n\nentirety, we find fully supportable the district court's conclusion\n\nthat   no   fair   and   just   reason    exists   sufficient   to   justify\n\nwithdrawal of the appellant's guilty pleas.              Consequently, we\n\naffirm the judgment below, without prejudice, however, to the\n\nappellant's right to press his ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim in a collateral proceeding, as described above.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
