William Hernan Builes-Vasquez (Builes)1, a\n\nnative and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of an order of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming without opinion an\n\norder of the Immigration Judge (IJ) denying Builes's application for\n\nasylum.2         For the reasons stated below, we deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n                 Builes entered the United States without a valid entry\n\ndocument on October 17, 2001, and was placed in removal proceedings\n\nfour    days      later.       Builes   filed    an    application    for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT), claiming that he had been persecuted in Colombia\n\nbased       on   his   political   opinion     and    that   he   feared   continued\n\npersecution if he were forced to return to Colombia.\n\n                 At a hearing before the IJ, Builes, the sole witness,\n\ntestified that he managed a farm owned by his father, although both\n\nhe and his parents lived elsewhere.             In early 2000, guerilla forces\n\nvisited the farm, demanded that a \"tax\" be paid every six months,\n\nand threatened to slaughter cattle if the \"tax\" were not paid.\n\nBuiles arranged for the farm's foreman, who lived on the premises,\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      In his brief, the petitioner is referred to as \"Builes\" so we\nuse that name in our opinion.\n        2\n      Builes does not seek review of the BIA's denial of his\napplication for withholding of removal and protection under the\nConvention Against Torture.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fto pay the \"tax\" to the guerillas.      The first payment was made in\n\nearly 2000, the last in June 2001.\n\n             Builes   further   testified   that   in   July   2001,   a\n\nparamilitary group began threatening his family based on the group's\n\nbelief that the Builes family was collaborating with guerilla\n\nforces.   The paramilitaries apparently believed that the \"tax\"\n\npayments were evidence of the Builes family's support of the\n\nguerilla forces. The paramilitary group's threats involved graffiti\n\nat the family farm and telephone calls to Builes's home warning\n\nagainst continued collaboration with the guerilla forces.        Builes\n\nreported the threats to local police, but according to Builes,\n\nnothing was done.     Builes testified that after these incidents, he\n\nwas \"desperate\" to leave Colombia because he felt that his life was\n\nin danger.\n\n             In September 2001, Builes traveled to Medellin, Colombia,\n\nto obtain a passport and stayed with family members in that city for\n\nsome time.    After receiving a fraudulent passport, Builes traveled\n\nthrough Colombia to Venezuela, where he purchased an airline ticket\n\nand eventually arrived in the United States on October 17, 2001.\n\nAbout three months after Builes left Colombia, his father sold the\n\nfarm. Builes's parents and younger siblings still live in Colombia.\n\n             The IJ found Builes's testimony regarding the guerilla\n\nand paramilitary incidents credible, as it was consistent both\n\ninternally and with country condition reports for Colombia.      The IJ\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\falso found, however, that (1) Builes's testimony regarding his\n\nfraudulently obtained passport and his travels through Colombia to\n\nVenezuela    and   the   United   States   was   vague   and   inconsistent;\n\n(2) Builes failed to establish that the threats to his family\n\ncontinued after his father sold the farm; (3) Builes failed to\n\nsubmit copies of the police reports documenting the threats or\n\nstatements from family members corroborating the threats; and (4)\n\nBuiles failed to explain why he could not relocate within Colombia\n\ngiven his previous ability to travel unmolested throughout the\n\ncountry.    Based on these findings, the IJ concluded that Builes was\n\nnot entitled to relief.      The BIA affirmed without opinion.       Builes\n\nthen filed this petition for review, arguing that he made the\n\nnecessary showing to qualify for asylum.\n\n            When the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's decision, \"we\n\ntreat the findings and conclusion[s] of the IJ as the Board's.\"\n\nHerbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).               We will\n\nuphold an IJ's determination denying asylum if it is \"supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"      INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992).     We will reverse only if the evidence presented was so\n\noverwhelming that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nreach the contrary conclusion.        See Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d\n\n16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f               \"To qualify as persecution, [an alien's] experience must\n\nrise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).                      Here, the IJ\n\nfound \"it impossible to conclude . . . that [Builes's] fears of harm\n\nwere   so    significant   that    his    departure      from    his   country    was\n\nnecessary for him to find safe haven.\"              We agree.     The graffiti and\n\ntelephone threats were not addressed to Builes personally.                    Builes\n\nwas    never    directly   confronted        by    the   paramilitary     group    or\n\nthreatened with serious harm.        He traveled throughout Colombia free\n\nfrom harassment.      We cannot conclude that a reasonable factfinder\n\nwould have been compelled to find that Builes's experiences amounted\n\nto more than harassment and unpleasantness. The record supports the\n\nIJ's    conclusion     that   Builes      has      failed   to    establish      past\n\npersecution.\n\n               Generally, if an alien establishes past persecution, he\n\nis presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution unless\n\nthe    INS   proves   otherwise.       See     8   C.F.R.   ยง    208.13(b)(1)(ii).\n\nAlthough Builes is not entitled to this presumption, he nevertheless\n\ncan establish a well-founded fear of future persecution if he can\n\nshow that his fear is \"both genuine and objectively reasonable.\"\n\nNelson, 232 F.3d at 264 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\nThe IJ concluded that after Builes's father sold the family farm,\n\nBuiles had no \"objective reasons to fear harm in his home country\"\n\nsince the guerilla forces made no further demands for \"tax\" payments\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fand the paramilitary group made no further threats related to his\n\nfamily's   perceived   collaboration   with   the   guerilla   forces.\n\nMoreover, the IJ found that members of Builes's family continue to\n\nlive in Colombia and that there was no evidence that these relatives\n\nhave been subjected to threats or physical harm.        Based on the\n\nrecord in this case, we cannot say that a reasonable factfinder\n\nwould be compelled to find that Builes demonstrated a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution. Accordingly, the finding by the IJ that\n\nBuiles failed to establish an objectively reasonable basis to fear\n\nfuture persecution if he is returned to Colombia must be upheld.\n\n           In sum, we hold that substantial evidence supports the\n\nIJ's conclusion that Builes failed to show either past persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of future persecution. We therefore deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
