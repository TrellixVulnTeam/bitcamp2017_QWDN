Oronoz-\nRodríguez, Deputy Solicitor General and Leticia Casalduc-Rabell,\nAssistant Solicitor General, on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             July 13, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam. Jaime Noel Sepúlveda-Carrero appeals the\n\nentry of an award of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 in favor\n\nof Puerto Rico Secretary of Health John V. Rullán in his individual\n\ncapacity.    The award followed a finding that Sepúlveda's political\n\ndiscrimination suit against Rullán was frivolous.           We affirm.\n\n            In 2001, Sepúlveda sued the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nand Rullán, in his official and personal capacities.              Sepúlveda\n\nalleged that unlawful political discrimination prompted his removal\n\nfrom the positions of Regional Medical Director, Aguadilla Sub-\n\nRegion (“Sub-Regional Director”) and Regional Medical Director,\n\nAguadilla-Mayaguez Region (“Regional Director”), in violation of 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.\n\n            Except for the individual capacity claim against Rullán,\n\nthe district court dismissed Sepúlveda's claims.          Later, the court\n\ngranted Rullán summary judgment on the remaining claim insofar as\n\nit pertained to the Regional Director position because “party\n\naffiliation [was] an appropriate requirement for the effective\n\nperformance of the office.”        But the court denied Rullán summary\n\njudgment    insofar   as   the   claim   pertained   to   the   Sub-Regional\n\nDirector position on the ground that there was a material dispute\n\nover whether political affiliation was an appropriate requirement\n\nfor this position.\n\n            Sepúlveda’s claim concerning the Sub-Regional Director\n\nposition went to trial.      At the close of Sepúlveda’s case, Rullán\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fmoved for judgment as a matter of law.                          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.\n\nThe court granted Rullán’s motion, concluding that there was no\n\nevidence that Rullán knew of Sepúlveda’s political affiliation\n\nbefore firing him.         The court subsequently awarded Rullán $16,235\n\nin    attorney’s    fees    on       the    ground       that    Sepúlveda’s    claim       was\n\nfrivolous. Sepúlveda appeals from the fee ruling.\n\n            We review an appeal of an award of attorney’s fees for an\n\nabuse of discretion.           See Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).         Under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, a district court may\n\naward a defendant attorney’s fees only “upon a finding that the\n\nplaintiff's      action        was    frivolous,          unreasonable,        or     without\n\nfoundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.” Tang\n\nv. State of R.I., Dept. of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (quoting Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S.\n\n412, 421 (1978)).          A claim on which a plaintiff cannot present a\n\nprima    facie    case    at    the    time        she    files    a    complaint     may   be\n\nfrivolous.       See Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179,\n\n1192 (1st Cir. 1996).          To establish a prima facie case of political\n\ndiscrimination, a plaintiff must show that the official who took\n\nthe    adverse     action      was     aware       of    the     plaintiff's        political\n\naffiliation.       See Gonzalez-Pina v. Rodriguez, 407 F.3d 425, 431\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Sepúlveda       makes          two    arguments       for    overturning        the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling.               First, he contends that the district\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fcourt abused its discretion in awarding attorney’s fees because he\n\n“survived”     Rullán’s     dismissal       and   summary    judgment      motions.\n\nAlternatively,     he    contends     that    a   serious    medical      condition\n\naffected his ability to testify at trial and prevented him from\n\nfully articulating the evidence supporting his claim.\n\n             That Rullán’s motion to dismiss was partially denied is\n\nirrelevant because the district court was required to accept all\n\n“allegations in the plaintiff's pleadings as true and [to] make all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.”               Rivera v. Rhode\n\nIsland, 402 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2005). Sepúlveda’s “survival” of\n\nthe motion to dismiss means only that he had sufficiently pleaded\n\nat   least   one   viable    cause    of     action,   not   that    he    had   any\n\nevidentiary support for his position.             At summary judgment, Rullán\n\nargued only that he was entitled to judgment because the Regional\n\nand Sub-Regional Director jobs were trust positions.                 There was no\n\nargument at that time that Rullán did not know Sepúlveda’s party\n\naffiliation before firing him.1             Thus, that Sepúlveda’s claim was\n\nnot terminated at summary judgment does not mean that he had a\n\nfoundation to establish the prima facie elements of his claim.\n\n      Sepúlveda’s       argument     that     a   serious    medical      condition\n\nadversely affected his ability to testify at trial fails because he\n\ndid not properly present it for appellate review.                   Sepúlveda did\n\n\n      1\n      Sepúlveda has not argued that the fee award was improper\nbecause of Rullán's failure to move for summary judgment on this\nbasis.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fnot provide a transcript of the trial as required by Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 10(b) or any other evidence to support his claim of poor health.\n\nWe will therefore not analyze this argument.   See Ramirez v. P.R.\n\nFire Servs., 757 F.2d 1357, 1358 (1st Cir. 1985) (“Where an\n\nappellant raises issues that are factually dependent yet fails to\n\nprovide a transcript of the pertinent proceedings in the district\n\ncourt, this circuit has repeatedly held that we will not review the\n\nallegations.”).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
