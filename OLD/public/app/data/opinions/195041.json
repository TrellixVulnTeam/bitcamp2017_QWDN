Petitioner  Samson O. Agbosasa appeals\n                    \n\npro se from  the dismissal  of his motion  under 28 U.S.C.   \n      \n\n2255.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n                               \n\n          In  1990, upon  a plea  of  guilty, petitioner  was\n\nconvicted of falsely representing that he was a United States\n\ncitizen, 18  U.S.C.    911, and was  sentenced to  six months\n\nimprisonment,  that  sentence  to  run  concurrently  with  a\n\nsentence  previously imposed  in  an  unrelated  case.    The\n\nsentencing  court  also  mandated  one  year   of  supervised\n\nrelease, including surrender of defendant to the  Immigration\n\nand  Naturalization   Service  for   deportation  proceedings\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C.   1101, et seq.  Petitioner is currently\n                                    \n\nawaiting deportation.\n\n          The underlying facts and chronology, as culled from\n\nthe files  and records  in the  case, are  not disputed.   In\n\nJanuary  1990, petitioner  was involved  in  a motor  vehicle\n\naccident.  He  retained a lawyer to assist  in processing his\n\nclaim.  In June 1990, petitioner was granted pretrial release\n\nin  a pending criminal  proceeding.  Petitioner's  travel was\n\nrestricted and he was required to make periodic personal  and\n\ntelephonic reports.  On August 27, 1990, an investigator from\n\nthe petitioner's  insurance company  called petitioner  about\n\nhis  accident claim.   The investigator obtained petitioner's\n\nconsent to  (1)  tape the  conversation  and (2)  answer  the\n\n                             -2-\n\nquestions  posed in  the absence  of  his attorney.   At  the\n\noutset of the  conversation, the  investigator inquired  into\n\npetitioner's  citizenship status.   Petitioner stated that he\n\nwas  born in  Lagos, Nigeria,  came to  the United  States in\n\n1979, and became a United States citizen in 1986.\n\n          Approximately   six   weeks   later   a   two-count\n\nindictment was returned against  petitioner charging him with\n\n(1) falsely representing United States citizenship, 18 U.S.C.\n\n   911, and  (2) using  a  false social  security number,  42\n\nU.S.C.    408(g)(2).  On December 7, 1990, petitioner pleaded\n\nguilty to count one and count  two was dropped.  At the  plea\n\nhearing, relying upon petitioner's August 27, 1990 statements\n\nthat he  was a citizen  of the United States,  the government\n\nmade the proffer that at trial it would prove that petitioner\n\nremained a  citizen of  Nigeria.   Petitioner then  responded\n\naffirmatively  to the presiding  judge's express query:   \"Do\n\nyou now  want to plead guilty to . . . the first count of the\n\nindictment in this case,  which charges you with  falsely and\n\nwilfully  representing yourself to be a citizen of the United\n\nStates . . . on or about August 27, 1990?\"\n\n          In July 1992, petitioner filed this   2255 petition\n\nraising two grounds for relief:   (1) that his Miranda rights\n                                                      \n\nwere  violated  during  the  telephone   interview  with  the\n\ninsurance  investigator, and (2) that he was denied effective\n\nassistance of counsel because his attorney refused to move to\n\n                             -3-\n\nsuppress  the  statements  made  during  the  August  27,1990\n\nconversation. In  an accompanying  memorandum and  affidavit,\n\npetitioner  contended that he  learned, several  months after\n\nconviction,  that the investigator's failure to advise him of\n\nhis   Miranda   rights  rendered   petitioner's   citizenship\n             \n\nstatements, made  while he was  on bail awaiting trial  in an\n\nunrelated criminal  case, inadmissible.   Petitioner asserted\n\nthat the investigator  was conspiring with the  government to\n\nentrap him and thus had reason to know that any  admission of\n\nalienage by the defendant would be highly incriminating.\n\n          The government's response to the   2255 hearing was\n\ntwo-fold.   First, it argued that because  the petitioner was\n\nnot in  custody or otherwise  deprived of his  freedom during\n\nthe telephone  conversation with the  insurance investigator,\n\nhis Fifth  Amendment rights  were not  violated.  Miranda  v.\n                                                         \n\nArizona,  384 U.S.  436, 478  (1966).   Second,  petitioner's\n       \n\ncharges that the  investigator was acting as an  agent of the\n\ngovernment were, respondent maintained, false, conclusory and\n\nwithout any factual support.  Relying on Illinois v. Perkins,\n                                                            \n\n496 U.S. 292, 300 (1990),  the government concluded that even\n\nif  the investigator  had been  functioning  as a  government\n\nagent  during the August  27, 1990 telephone  conversation, a\n\nfact which was denied, Miranda warnings are not required when\n                              \n\nan incarcerated  suspect gives  a voluntary  statement to  an\n\nundercover   law   enforcement   official.      Consequently,\n\n                             -4-\n\nrespondent claimed,  as there  were no  allegations that  the\n\nplea proceeding was  deficient under Fed. R. Civ.  P. 11, the\n\npetitioner's  bald  and unelaborated  assertions  provided no\n\nbasis  for     2255  relief   and  were  subject  to  summary\n\ndismissal.\n\n          Petitioner's   opposition   to   the   government's\n\nresponse maintained that the Miranda \"in custody\" requirement\n                                    \n\nhad been satisfied because at  the time of the interview, his\n\nliberty was restricted by the authorities  under the terms of\n\nthe  June 1990 pretrial release order in a pending, unrelated\n\ncase.     Petitioner  also  contended   that  the   insurance\n\ninvestigator   must  have  known  of  that  pending  criminal\n\nproceeding and  petitioner's \"technical custody\"  because (1)\n\nwithin a few hours of the telephone interview, its transcript\n\nwas in the  hands of an Assistant United  States Attorney and\n\n(2)  the  transcript  showed that  the  interview  ranged far\n\nafield of routine  accident claim inquiries in  eliciting the\n\nincriminating information.  Illinois v. Perkins was literally\n                                               \n\ninapplicable, petitioner claimed, because both parties to the\n\ntelephone interview  fully understood each  other's identity.\n\nFinally,  petitioner attaches importance to the fact that the\n\ninvestigator  called petitioner  personally despite  the fact\n\nthat petitioner's attorney had filed the claim.\n\n                             -5-\n\n          The  district court  summarily  denied  the    2255\n\nmotion  \"for  the  reasons  set  forth  in  the  government's\n\nresponse,\" and this appeal ensued.\n\n                             II.\n                               \n\n          We  have  little  difficulty  concluding  that  the\n\ndismissal was correct.  In Illinois v.  Perkins, a prisoner's\n                                               \n\ncell-mate  was an  undercover government  agent who  elicited\n\nincriminating statements about  an offense  unrelated to  the\n\ninmate's incarceration.  In deciding that neither Miranda nor\n                                                         \n\nthe Fifth  Amendment applies to  statements voluntarily given\n\nto an undercover  agent posing as  a fellow inmate,  Perkins,\n                                                            \n\n496 U.S. at 300, the  Court observed that \"detention, whether\n\nor  not  for  the  crime  in question,  does  not  warrant  a\n\npresumption that the use of an undercover agent to speak with\n\nan incarcerated suspect  makes any  confession thus  obtained\n\ninvoluntary.\"  Id. at 299.  When a suspect is unaware that he\n                                                     \n\nis  speaking with  a  government  official,  the  element  of\n\ncoercion  is missing.   Id.   Thus,  the Court  held, Miranda\n                                                             \n\n\"warnings are  not required  to safeguard the  constitutional\n\nrights of inmates who make voluntary statements to undercover\n\nagents.\"  Id. at 300.\n             \n\n          Even  if  we  were to  assume,  arguendo,  that the\n                                                  \n\npretrial  release order in the unrelated criminal case placed\n\nrestrictions  on petitioner's  liberty  so as  to  constitute\n\n                             -6-\n\ncustody  for Miranda purposes  at the time  of the interview,\n                    \n\nand  also  assume  that the  investigator  was  an undercover\n\nagent, given the fact that  petitioner does not claim that he\n\nknew, at the time of the interview, that the investigator was\n                                  \n\na government  agent, his  claim to  Miranda protections  must\n                                           \n\nfail.    No such  warnings  needed  to  be given  before  the\n\ninvestigator  here  asked  the questions  that  elicited  the\n\nincriminating response.    Petitioner's  further  claim  that\n\nMiranda  was  implicated   because  he  was  represented   by\n       \n\ncounsel  -- either  in the  insurance  matter or  the pending\n\ncriminal  case  -- fares  no  better,  since the  element  of\n\ncoercion was not satisfied.\n\n          Similarly,  regarding  the   claim  that  counsel's\n\nconduct  was deficient because he failed  to move to suppress\n\npetitioner's voluntary statements made  on August 27,1990, no\n\nprejudice resulted.   In short,  it cannot be said  that \"but\n\nfor  counsel's errors,  the  result  below  would  have  been\n\ndifferent.\"   See Murchu  v. United States,  926 F.2d  50, 58\n                                          \n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 99 (1991).\n                        \n\n          Accordingly, even under the conspiratorial scenario\n\npetitioner posits,  the petition  was,  as a  matter of  law,\n\nproperly  subject to summary  dismissal.  We  have considered\n\npetitioner's remaining arguments and find them without merit.\n\n          Affirmed.\n                  \n\n                             -7-\n",

Sec. 911, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, that sentence to run concurrently with a sentence previously imposed in an unrelated case.

In January 1990, petitioner was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  He retained a lawyer to assist in processing his claim.  In June 1990, petitioner was granted pretrial release in a pending criminal proceeding.  Petitioner's travel was restricted and he was required to make periodic personal and telephonic reports.  On August 27, 1990, an investigator from the petitioner's insurance company called petitioner about his accident claim.  The investigator obtained petitioner's consent to (1) tape the conversation and (2) answer the questions posed in the absence of his attorney.  At the outset of the conversation, the investigator inquired into petitioner's citizenship status.  Petitioner stated that he was born in Lagos, Nigeria, came to the United States in 1979, and became a United States citizen in 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately six weeks later a two-count indictment was returned against petitioner charging him with (1) falsely representing United States citizenship, 18 U.S.C.

At the plea hearing, relying upon petitioner's August 27, 1990 statements that he was a citizen of the United States, the government made the proffer that at trial it would prove that petitioner remained a citizen of Nigeria.

In an accompanying memorandum and affidavit, petitioner contended that he learned, several months after conviction, that the investigator's failure to advise him of his Miranda rights rendered petitioner's citizenship statements, made while he was on bail awaiting trial in an unrelated criminal case, inadmissible.

First, it argued that because the petitioner was not in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom during the telephone conversation with the insurance investigator, his Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966).  Second, petitioner's charges that the investigator was acting as an agent of the government were, respondent maintained, false, conclusory and without any factual support.  Relying on  Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 300 (1990), the government concluded that even if the investigator had been functioning as a government agent during the August 27, 1990 telephone conversation, a fact which was denied, Miranda warnings are not required when an incarcerated suspect gives a voluntary statement to an undercover law enforcement official.  Consequently, respondent claimed, as there were no allegations that the plea proceeding was deficient under Fed.  R. Civ.

In Illinois v. Perkins, a prisoner's cell-mate was an undercover government agent who elicited incriminating statements about an offense unrelated to the inmate's incarceration.  In deciding that neither Miranda nor the Fifth Amendment applies to statements voluntarily given to an undercover agent posing as a fellow inmate,  Perkins, 496 U.S. at 300, the Court observed that \"detention, whether or not for the crime in question, does not warrant a presumption that the use of an undercover agent to speak with an incarcerated suspect makes any confession thus obtained involuntary.\"   Id. at 299.  When a suspect is unaware that he is speaking with a government official, the element of coercion is missing.  Id. Thus, the Court held, Miranda \"warnings are not required to safeguard the constitutional rights of inmates who make voluntary statements to undercover agents.\"  Id. at 300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the pretrial release order in the unrelated criminal case placed restrictions on petitioner's liberty so as to constitute custody for Miranda purposes at the time of the interview, and also assume that the investigator was an undercover agent, given the fact that petitioner does not claim that he knew, at the time of the interview, that the investigator was a government agent, his claim to Miranda protections must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No such warnings needed to be given before the investigator here asked the questions that elicited the incriminating response.

Agbosasa appeals pro se from the dismissal of his motion under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, upon a plea of guilty, petitioner was convicted of falsely representing that he was a United States citizen, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 911, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, that sentence to run concurrently with a sentence previously imposed in an unrelated case.  The sentencing court also mandated one year of supervised release, including surrender of defendant to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101, et seq. Petitioner is currently awaiting deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying facts and chronology, as culled from the files and records in the case, are not disputed.  In January 1990, petitioner was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  He retained a lawyer to assist in processing his claim.  In June 1990, petitioner was granted pretrial release in a pending criminal proceeding.  Petitioner's travel was restricted and he was required to make periodic personal and telephonic reports.  On August 27, 1990, an investigator from the petitioner's insurance company called petitioner about his accident claim.  The investigator obtained petitioner's consent to (1) tape the conversation and (2) answer the questions posed in the absence of his attorney.  At the outset of the conversation, the investigator inquired into petitioner's citizenship status.  Petitioner stated that he was born in Lagos, Nigeria, came to the United States in 1979, and became a United States citizen in 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately six weeks later a two-count indictment was returned against petitioner charging him with (1) falsely representing United States citizenship, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 911, and (2) using a false social security number, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 408(g)(2).  On December 7, 1990, petitioner pleaded guilty to count one and count two was dropped.  At the plea hearing, relying upon petitioner's August 27, 1990 statements that he was a citizen of the United States, the government made the proffer that at trial it would prove that petitioner remained a citizen of Nigeria.  Petitioner then responded affirmatively to the presiding judge's express query: \"Do you now want to plead guilty to ... the first count of the indictment in this case, which charges you with falsely and wilfully representing yourself to be a citizen of the United States ... on or about August 27, 1990?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, petitioner filed this Sec. 2255 petition raising two grounds for relief:  (1) that his Miranda rights were violated during the telephone interview with the insurance investigator, and (2) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney refused to move to suppress the statements made during the August 27,1990 conversation.  In an accompanying memorandum and affidavit, petitioner contended that he learned, several months after conviction, that the investigator's failure to advise him of his Miranda rights rendered petitioner's citizenship statements, made while he was on bail awaiting trial in an unrelated criminal case, inadmissible.  Petitioner asserted that the investigator was conspiring with the government to entrap him and thus had reason to know that any admission of alienage by the defendant would be highly incriminating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's response to the Sec. 2255 hearing was two-fold.  First, it argued that because the petitioner was not in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom during the telephone conversation with the insurance investigator, his Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.   Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 478 (1966).  Second, petitioner's charges that the investigator was acting as an agent of the government were, respondent maintained, false, conclusory and without any factual support.  Relying on  Illinois v. Perkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112452\"><a href=\"/opinion/112452/illinois-v-perkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 300 (1990), the government concluded that even if the investigator had been functioning as a government agent during the August 27, 1990 telephone conversation, a fact which was denied, Miranda warnings are not required when an incarcerated suspect gives a voluntary statement to an undercover law enforcement official.  Consequently, respondent claimed, as there were no allegations that the plea proceeding was deficient under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 11, the petitioner's bald and unelaborated assertions provided no basis for Sec. 2255 relief and were subject to summary dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's opposition to the government's response maintained that the Miranda \"in custody\" requirement had been satisfied because at the time of the interview, his liberty was restricted by the authorities under the terms of the June 1990 pretrial release order in a pending, unrelated case.  Petitioner also contended that the insurance investigator must have known of that pending criminal proceeding and petitioner's \"technical custody\" because (1) within a few hours of the telephone interview, its transcript was in the hands of an Assistant United States Attorney and (2) the transcript showed that the interview ranged far afield of routine accident claim inquiries in eliciting the incriminating information.  Illinois v. Perkins was literally inapplicable, petitioner claimed, because both parties to the telephone interview fully understood each other's identity.  Finally, petitioner attaches importance to the fact that the investigator called petitioner personally despite the fact that petitioner's attorney had filed the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court summarily denied the Sec. 2255 motion \"for the reasons set forth in the government's response,\" and this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have little difficulty concluding that the dismissal was correct.  In Illinois v. Perkins, a prisoner's cell-mate was an undercover government agent who elicited incriminating statements about an offense unrelated to the inmate's incarceration.  In deciding that neither Miranda nor the Fifth Amendment applies to statements voluntarily given to an undercover agent posing as a fellow inmate,  Perkins, 496 U.S. at 300, the Court observed that \"detention, whether or not for the crime in question, does not warrant a presumption that the use of an undercover agent to speak with an incarcerated suspect makes any confession thus obtained involuntary.\"   Id. at 299.  When a suspect is unaware that he is speaking with a government official, the element of coercion is missing.  Id. Thus, the Court held, Miranda \"warnings are not required to safeguard the constitutional rights of inmates who make voluntary statements to undercover agents.\"  Id. at 300.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the pretrial release order in the unrelated criminal case placed restrictions on petitioner's liberty so as to constitute custody for Miranda purposes at the time of the interview, and also assume that the investigator was an undercover agent, given the fact that petitioner does not claim that he knew, at the time of the interview, that the investigator was a government agent, his claim to Miranda protections must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No such warnings needed to be given before the investigator here asked the questions that elicited the incriminating response.  Petitioner's further claim that Miranda was implicated because he was represented by counsel-either in the insurance matter or the pending criminal case-fares no better, since the element of coercion was not satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, regarding the claim that counsel's conduct was deficient because he failed to move to suppress petitioner's voluntary statements made on August 27,1990, no prejudice resulted.  In short, it cannot be said that \"but for counsel's errors, the result below would have been different.\"   See Murchu v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556391\"><a href=\"/opinion/556391/noel-o-murchu-aka-noel-murphy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
