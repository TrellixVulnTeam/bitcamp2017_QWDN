Scott, and O'Melveny & Myers LLP were on\nsupplemental brief for appellant.\n     Vijay Shanker, U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division,\nAppellate Section, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United\nStates Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States\nAttorney, Chief, Appellate Division, and Thomas F. Klumper,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on supplemental brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 21, 2008\n\n\n\n                         OPINION EN BANC\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge.   Manuel Vega-Santiago appealed from\n\nhis conviction on one count of armed carjacking, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2119(1) (2000), and two counts of related weapons offenses, id. §§\n\n924(c)(1)(A), 922(k), asserting various trial errors.       He also\n\nappealed from his prison sentence of 240 months, which represented\n\nan upward variance from the sentencing guidelines range of 177 to\n\n191 months that would otherwise have applied to him.\n\n          A panel of this court affirmed Vega's conviction and\n\nsentence, remanding only to correct a discrepancy between the\n\nwritten and oral judgments.   United States v. Vega-Santiago, ---\n\nF.3d ---, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 25420 (1st Cir. Oct. 31, 2007).   We\n\ngranted rehearing en banc to consider the panel's ruling that the\n\ndistrict judge must provide \"notice\" to litigants before imposing\n\na sentence outside the guideline range--a requirement that the\n\npanel found satisfied in this case.\n\n          The facts in detail can be found in the panel opinion.\n\nVega, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 25420, at *2-*9.    Pertinently, here the\n\ndistrict judge chose--pursuant to the sentencing regime established\n\nby the Supreme Court, United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005);\n\nsee also United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc)--to impose a sentence above the range applicable\n\nunder the sentencing guidelines.       He did so after weighing the\n\nsentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)--in particular,\n\nthe nature of the offense and the background of the offender.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fNeither the presentence report nor the government's pre-hearing\n\nsubmissions had suggested varying from the guidelines.\n\n          The question before us is whether a district court,\n\nbefore sua sponte imposing a sentence outside the recommended\n\nguideline range, must automatically provide advance notice to the\n\nparties of its intent to do so and its contemplated reasoning.   The\n\ncircuit courts being divided,1 the Supreme Court is now likely to\n\ndecide the issue, United States v. Irizarry, 458 F.3d 1208, 1212\n\n(11th Cir. 2006), cert. granted, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 409 (Jan. 4, 2008)\n\n(No. 06-7517), but until it does, district judges in this circuit\n\nare entitled to guidance on an issue potentially present in every\n\nsentencing.   Our answer is that notice is sometimes, but not\n\nalways, required.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Five circuits have held that notice is required.       United\nStates v. Anati, 457 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir. 2006); United States v.\nDavenport, 445 F.3d 366, 371 (4th Cir. 2006); United States v.\nCousins, 469 F.3d 572, 580 (6th Cir. 2006); United States v. Evans-\nMartinez, 448 F.3d 1163, 1164 (9th Cir. 2006); United States v.\nAtencio, 476 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007).\n     Four have concluded to the contrary. United States v. Vampire\nNation, 451 F.3d 189, 195 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Mejia-\nHuerta, 480 F.3d 713, 722 (5th Cir. 2007), petition for cert.\nfiled, 75 U.S.L.W. 3585 (Apr. 18, 2007) (No. 06-1381); United\nStates v. Long Soldier, 431 F.3d 1120, 1122 (8th Cir. 2005); United\nStates v. Irizarry, 458 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir. 2006), cert.\ngranted, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 409 (Jan. 4, 2008) (No. 06-7517); see also\nUnited States v. Walker, 447 F.3d 999, 1006 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(holding notice no longer required even for traditional\ndepartures).\n\n                               -3-\n\f                Much   of   the   dispute    among   our    sister    circuits    has\n\nconcerned the applicability of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n32(h).      The rule provides that:\n\n                Before   the  court   may  depart   from  the\n                applicable sentencing range on a ground not\n                identified for departure either in the\n                presentence report or in a party's prehearing\n                submission, the court must give the parties\n                reasonable notice that it is contemplating\n                such a departure. The notice must specify any\n                ground on which the court is contemplating a\n                departure.\n\n                Prior to Booker, the guidelines were mandatory save for\n\n\"departures\" that could be allowed by the district judge only in\n\naccordance with rules imposed both by the governing statute and the\n\nguidelines themselves.            The term \"departures\" refers specifically\n\nto   just       such   deviations.        Rule   32(h)     speaks    explicitly    of\n\n\"departures,\" a term with a precise legal meaning.                         U.S.S.G. §\n\n1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (2007); United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874\n\nF.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1989).             Departures continue to be available\n\nafter Booker and it is to them that Rule 32(h) is addressed.\n\n                Booker has created new latitude for district judges by\n\npermitting them to treat the guidelines as advisory and, after\n\ncalculating the guideline sentence (including any departure), to\n\nimpose      a    different    sentence      based    on    the   broader     criteria\n\nidentified in the statute.               Such deviations have been variously\n\nlabeled--\"variance\"          is    one    common     term--but      they    are   not\n\n\"departures\" either in technical terminology or in common parlance.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fOn its face, Rule 32(h) cannot apply of its own force to variances,\n\na distinct concept developed after the rule was promulgated.\n\n             It is far from clear whether the drafters of the rule\n\nwould have included variances within the rule if they had then\n\nexisted, but it does not matter: a formal rule can be changed\n\nthrough     the   statutorily    prescribed   rulemaking   process,      which\n\nincludes congressional oversight of proposed changes, but it cannot\n\nbe rewritten ad hoc by an individual judge or panel.                      \"[A]\n\nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute\n\nwhat it says there.\"        Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249,\n\n253-54 (1992).      So, too, with formally adopted rules.\n\n             The more difficult question is whether the reasoning that\n\nprompted Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129 (1991)--the decision\n\nthat Rule 32(h) codified--should be extended without qualification\n\nto   this   new   context   to   establish    a   judicially   created    rule\n\nrequiring automatic advance notice for variances.                The Supreme\n\nCourt could, and might in the end, choose to do so.            But this would\n\nbe an expansion of Burns' holding, which was specifically directed\n\nto departures.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The government, which has an obvious interest in obtaining\nnotice of contemplated downward variances, has reversed the\nposition it took before the panel and now insists that Rule 32(h)\ndoes apply.    But it imbues the notice requirement with such\nflexibility as to whether and when notice must be given that its\nposition is ultimately quite different from Vega's.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f              The Court in Burns held that courts may not depart from\n\nthe guidelines if neither the presentence report nor the pre-\n\nhearing submissions of the parties had requested such a departure,\n\nunless reasonable notice is provided. That requirement was said to\n\nbe implicit in the demands of a federal rule giving parties the\n\nright    to     comment    on   \"matters    relating    to   the    appropriate\n\nsentence.\"3      Without notice, the Court reasoned, counsel will be\n\nunprepared      to    comment   meaningfully   on    grounds    for   departure\n\nproposed by the judge, resulting in a lack of adversarial testing.\n\nBurns, 501 U.S. at 135.\n\n              There are competing arguments as to whether and how far\n\nBurns and its rationales bear on variances; and the Supreme Court\n\nwill answer those questions in due course.             But our view is that,\n\nin this different context, adopting a mechanical rule would be a\n\nmistake: it would not respond to the realities of a system in which\n\njudges are afforded much broader discretion than in the recent\n\npast,    it   would    reinforce   guideline      sentencing,   and    it   would\n\nconsiderably complicate and prolong the sentencing process.\n\n              A bright-line advance notice requirement for potential\n\ndepartures fit sensibly within the mandatory guideline regime in\n\nplace    when    Burns    was   decided.    The    guidelines      provided   for\n\ndepartures, and articulated specific grounds upon which they can\n\n\n     3\n      This rule remains in force, Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(C), but\nreflects only a general policy on the right to comment and does not\nspecify at all whether and when notice of anything must be given.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f(and cannot) be premised.         E.g., U.S.S.G. §§ 4A1.3, 5K1.1-2.23.\n\nAlthough   in     theory   the   possible   grounds   for   departure   were\n\nunbounded, in practice they functioned almost as a set of auxiliary\n\nguidelines.     See United States v. Koon, 518 U.S. 81, 95-96 (1996)\n\n(\"The court must bear in mind the Commission's expectation that\n\ndepartures based on grounds not mentioned in the Guidelines will be\n\n'highly infrequent.'\").\n\n           Thus, departures presented a finite number of specific,\n\ndiscrete   (and    often   binary)   determinations    that   would   govern\n\ndepartures and thus the ultimate sentence. It made sense to advise\n\nthe parties in advance of any proposed departure so as allow them\n\nto dispute the facts critical to the departure and to assist the\n\ncourt on pertinent legal questions.4            The premised facts were\n\nreviewable for clear error; the legal rulings, fully reviewable.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3742(e).        In short, departures looked much like the\n\ncustomary fare of adversarial litigation.\n\n           Under Booker, Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456\n\n(2007), and now Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586 (2007), the\n\nsentencing inquiry, after calculating the guideline range, is far\n\nmore broad, open-ended and discretionary.              Under Booker, the\n\ndistrict court must independently consider the statutory sentencing\n\n\n\n     4\n      Departures often required the judge to analyze not only the\nguidelines, but also the policy statements of the Commission (which\nwere binding, Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36 (1993)), and\nthe circuit law relating to appropriate and inappropriate grounds.\n\n                                     -7-\n\ffactors, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), which are phrased in very general\n\nterms    (e.g., \"the nature and circumstances of the offense\"; the\n\nneed for the sentence to \"to reflect the seriousness of the\n\noffense\").       A variant sentence may then be imposed based on a\n\ncomplex of factors whose interplay and precise weight cannot even\n\nbe precisely described.\n\n               The district judge draws on information from the trial,\n\nthe     pre-sentence     report     and     the    parties'    commentary,     the\n\ndefendant's      allocution,   victims'         statements,   letters,   its   own\n\nreview    of    these   materials    before       the   sentencing   hearing   and\n\nwhatever is added during the hearing.              Throughout the hearing, the\n\njudge may well be revising his views depending on what is presented\n\nand how counsel respond to questions.              This is a fluid and dynamic\n\nprocess and the court itself may not know until the end whether a\n\nvariance will be adopted, let alone on what grounds.\n\n               Yet in order to provide advance notice of any value, a\n\ndistrict court would have to advise not only that a variance is\n\npossible but also the ground and reasoning behind it before he has\n\neven heard the full presentation.               This is very different than the\n\nidentification in advance of a particular ground of departure that\n\nmay or may not be invoked.           \"[R]equiring advance notice of 'any\n\nground' . . . would undoubtedly prove to be unworkable.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 197 (3d Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f            Further, a mechanical requirement of such notice is\n\nunnecessary.     In the normal case a competent lawyer--and for\n\nincompetence other remedies are available--will anticipate most of\n\nwhat might occur at the sentencing hearing--based on the trial, the\n\npre-sentence report, the exchanges of the parties concerning the\n\nreport, and the preparation of mitigation evidence. Garden variety\n\nconsiderations of culpability, criminal history, likelihood of re-\n\noffense, seriousness of the crime, nature of the conduct and so\n\nforth should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who\n\nhave prepared for sentencing.\n\n            Were a mechanical notice rule imposed, some judges would\n\nshy away from imposing non-guideline sentences that the parties had\n\nnot proposed in advance, increasing the \"gravitational pull\" of the\n\nguidelines, United States v. Trujillo-Terrazas, 405 F.3d 814, 819\n\n(10th Cir. 2005), and compromising the greater freedom sought by\n\nBooker and Rita.     See, e.g., Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2465 (holding that\n\na district judge \"does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption\n\nthat the Guidelines sentence should apply\").          Alternatively, the\n\njudge would often have to employ a burdensome two-stage regime,\n\nexplaining at the end of the first hearing his proposed sentence\n\nand then conducting a follow-up hearing based on such notice.\n\n            The preferable solution is thus not a mechanical rule\n\nmandating   formal    notice   in   every   case   where   the   judge   may\n\nconceivably vary from the guidelines.         Rather, when proposing to\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fadopt a variant sentence relying on some ground or factor that\n\nwould unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel,\n\na judge must either provide advance notice or, on request, grant a\n\ncontinuance in order to accommodate a reasonable desire for more\n\nevidence or further research.    No formal rule is required for us to\n\nadopt such a prudential policy as a matter of precedent.\n\n          In practice such cases of unfair surprise, probably rare,\n\nare not that hard to identify; and this case is not one of them.\n\nHere, the district judge relied primarily on three particular\n\ndetails of the crime--that it involved the invasion of a home,\n\ndeath threats and a near-miss firing of a gun--and that Vega had\n\nbeen previously arrested (but not convicted) on charges of violent\n\ncrime.   The details of the crime were well known to counsel; and\n\nVega had admitted his prior \"brushes with the law\" which were noted\n\nin the pre-sentence report.5\n\n          Defense   counsel    may   not   have   anticipated   that   the\n\ndistrict judge would rely upon those particular facts to impose an\n\nabove-guideline sentence, but having that knowledge in advance\n\nwould not have made any obvious difference.        The facts themselves\n\nwere familiar and undisputed, so there is no concern here that\n\n\n\n     5\n      Vega points out that the district judge agreed to strike that\nportion of the PSR at the start of the sentencing hearing. But, as\nthe judge explained when delivering the sentence, it was removed\nonly because Vega's counsel was concerned that the Bureau of\nPrisons would use it to \"jack up his security level.\" The truth of\nthe admission was not contested.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcounsel might have been able, with notice, to challenge them.    And\n\nnowhere else in the law is the judge required to explain his\n\nreasoning before counsel have argued to him.\n\n          In granting rehearing en banc we invited supplemental\n\nbriefing not only on the panel's automatic notice requirement but\n\non whether there was unfair surprise in this case. Defense counsel\n\nhave added new arguments to those earlier presented to the panel.\n\nBut we agree with the panel's original view that unfair surprise\n\nhas not been established.   At sentencing defense counsel had ample\n\nopportunity and incentive, without any advance notice of a possible\n\nvariance, to make the same arguments now offered to us.\n\n          First, Vega submits that mitigating evidence about his\n\nfamily circumstances could have been offered.       But mitigating\n\nevidence would have been relevant to sentencing with or without a\n\nvariance from the guideline range. The principal factor cited, the\n\ndeath of Vega's father shortly before the crime, was readily\n\ndetectable by counsel and potentially useful to argue for a lower\n\nsentence within or (under Booker) below the guideline range.\n\n          Next, Vega contends that a carjacking that involves\n\ninvading a home is no worse, for purposes of the section 3553(a)\n\nfactors, than an ordinary carjacking.   We fail to see how further\n\nnotice was necessary in order to prepare that argument about the\n\nseriousness   of    the   offense   facts--a   typical    sentencing\n\nconsideration.   Comparing and contrasting a defendant's particular\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fcrime to its \"heartland\" prototype is always relevant.     That the\n\njudge might think that a home invasion carried an extra sense of\n\nmenace is hardly a surprise.\n\n            Finally, Vega says that the death threat and firing of\n\nthe gun were already taken into account by the guidelines, and that\n\nwith more notice, defense counsel would have been prepared to point\n\nthat out.   But a factor that is worked into the guideline calculus\n\nmay still be considered by a district judge in the section 3553(a)\n\nanalysis. See, e.g., United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 93-94\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 927 (2007).\n\nAnyway Vega's counsel did emphasize--without requiring any special\n\nnotice--that the enhancements provided in the guidelines were\n\nsufficient.    The district judge simply did not agree.\n\n            Parts I, II, III(A), and III(C) of the panel opinion are\n\nreinstated; Vega's conviction and sentence are affirmed; and the\n\ncase is remanded for correction of the written judgment.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                                Dissents follow.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Reserving and Dissenting).\n\nThe circumstances that force me to state my views at this time\n\nleave me no alternative but to partially emulate Justice Felix\n\nFrankfurter's response to similar constraints, about which he\n\nstated:\n\n                   Time is required not only for the\n            primary task of analyzing in detail the\n            materials on which the Court relies. It is\n            equally required for adequate reflection upon\n            the meaning of these materials and their\n            bearing on the issues now before the Court.\n            Reflection is a slow process. Wisdom, like\n            good wine, requires maturing.\n\n                   Moreover, the judgments of this Court\n            are collective judgments. They are neither\n            solo performances nor debates between two\n            sides, each of which has its mind quickly made\n            up and then closed. The judgments of this\n            Court   presuppose  full    consideration   and\n            reconsideration by all of the reasoned views\n            of each. Without adequate study there cannot\n            be adequate reflection.       Without adequate\n            reflection    there    cannot    be    adequate\n            deliberation and discussion. And without\n            these, there cannot be that full interchange\n            of minds which is indispensable to wise\n            decision and its persuasive formulation.\n\n                   The circumstances being what they are,\n            I am forced, deeply as I regret it, to reserve\n            for a later date [the full] expression of my\n            views.\n\nReid   v.   Covert,   351   U.S.   489,    492   (1956)   (Frankfurter,   J.,\n\nreserving).\n\n            This solution is, of course, hardly a satisfactory one,\n\nas it would leave me, an active member of this Court, without an\n\neffective voice and vote at a crucial juncture in this proceeding\n\n                                    -13-\n\f-- a result which affects the substantive rights of the parties to\n\nthis appeal.    I believe that the parties are entitled to the\n\nbenefit of my views, even if they are considered to be in error by\n\nsome of my colleagues.\n\n           Although I am in substantial agreement with the views\n\nexpressed by Judge Lipez in his excellent dissent, I am also deeply\n\nconcerned by the serious policy, procedural, and substantive issues\n\nraised by the unwarranted haste which has characterized this en\n\nbanc proceeding.   Accordingly, I must state my views, even if in a\n\npreliminary and incomplete fashion.\n\n           The convocation of this particular en banc proceeding\n\nhighlights the whimsical and uneven manner in which this circuit\n\noften applies the rehearing rules.     Indeed, both the granting and\n\ndenying of petitions for these extraordinary proceedings evince a\n\ndouble-standard with respect to which issues are deemed meritorious\n\nof such review. See, e.g., Cerqueira v. American Airlines, No. 07-\n\n1824 (1st Cir. XXXX) (Torruella, J. dissenting).    Time constraints\n\ndo not allow for an exhaustive inventory of this asseveration, but\n\nthe circumstances of this present appeal demonstrate one such\n\nexample.\n\n           In this case, before either the appellant or the appellee\n\nhad the opportunity to seek en banc review, the court undertook a\n\nrather unusual procedure and ordered en banc rehearing sua sponte.\n\nThe appeal thus metamorphosed into one more relevant to, and\n\n\n                                -14-\n\freflective of, a judicially fueled agenda.              That agenda became\n\nevident in light of the Government's own change of heart:               both\n\nsides now agree that Rule 32(h) applies to post-Booker variances.\n\nFurthermore, the issue for which the en banc court was convened is\n\npresently before the Supreme Court, see United States v. Irizarry,\n\n458 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir. 2006), cert. granted, 128 S. Ct. 828\n\n(2008), and will most likely be decided in a definitive way before\n\nJune.   At a minimum, circumstances would seem to counsel awaiting\n\nthe   decision   of   the   Supreme    Court   rather   than   unnecessarily\n\ninvesting our limited judicial resources on this one.\n\n           In any event, I am opposed to the majority's disregard\n\nfor the unequivocal language of Rule 32(h) and the clear mandate of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129 (1991).\n\nSpecifically, in Burns, the Court observed that the purpose of Rule\n\n32 was to promote \"focused, adversarial resolution of the legal and\n\nfactual issues.\"      Id. at 137.      The Court recognized that in the\n\nabsence of notice, parties would make arguments \"in a random and\n\nwasteful way by trying to anticipate and negate every conceivable\n\nground on which the district court might choose to depart on its\n\nown initiative\" or, worse yet, \"the parties [may] not even try to\n\nanticipate such a development,\" and leave the contemplated grounds\n\nuntested by the adversarial process.           Id.\n\n           The majority's opinion substitutes these requirements\n\nwith what is, in effect, an unauthorized rule-making amendment to\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fRule 32 by this court.       The majority has concocted a vague standard\n\nfor pre-sentence notice which will inevitably lead to interminable\n\nlitigation as to what a \"competent and reasonably prepared counsel\"\n\nwould have anticipated.        Slip Op. at 10.          This will undoubtedly\n\nhave the effect of causing more delay and a greater waste of\n\njudicial resources than the occasional continuance forecast by the\n\nmajority's opinion were the Rule 32 standard to be followed.                  See\n\nSlip Op. at 8.          The fact is that such continuances might be\n\nnecessary   in   only    a   handful    of    cases.6     In   any   event,   the\n\npostponement of sentencing is a minor inconvenience to the judicial\n\nsystem when weighed against the basic due process protections\n\nafforded by the Rule 32 notice requirements.              See Burns, 501 U.S.\n\nat 138 (noting that \"were we to read Rule 32 to dispense with\n\nnotice, we would then have to confront the serious question whether\n\nnotice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause\"\n\n(emphasis added)).       I dissent.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Of the federal post-Booker cases, only 1.5% of cases had\nsentences above the Guidelines and only 11.9% were below (53.5% of\nwhich arose in the five circuits which already require the Rule 32\nnotice). See U.S. Sentencing Comm'n, 4th Quarter Report (2006),\navailable at\nhttp://www.ussc.gov/sc_cases/Quarter_Report_4th_07.pdf.\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting. I respectfully dissent\n\nfrom the majority's conclusion that the reasonable notice required\n\nby Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129 (1991), and Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 32(h) is inapplicable to Guidelines variances.\n\nThe majority's rejection of a reasonable notice requirement in\n\nfavor of a new standard based on whether \"some ground or factor\n\n. . . would unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared\n\ncounsel\" leaves district court judges without the very guidance\n\nthe majority purports to offer them.         Indeed, the government now\n\nalso agrees that the reasonable notice required by Burns and Rule\n\n32(h) must apply to Guidelines variances to ensure full adversarial\n\ntesting of the issues related to sentencing.\n\n           Moreover, having further considered the issue in the\n\ncontext of en banc briefing and argument, I have become convinced\n\nthat the reasonable notice requirement means notice of a possible\n\nvariance   being   contemplated   by   the   judge   in   advance   of    the\n\nsentencing hearing. Such prehearing notice is most consistent with\n\nRule 32's directive that parties be given the opportunity to\n\ncomment on matters \"relating to an appropriate sentence.\"           Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(i)(1)(C).    This rule does not mean that every failure\n\nto give prehearing notice will require a new proceeding.                 Such\n\nerrors lend themselves to harmless error review.            In this case,\n\nhowever, I cannot find that the error was harmless, and I therefore\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fwould vacate Vega's sentence and remand for a new sentencing\n\nhearing.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           My conclusion that notice may be deemed \"reasonable\" only\n\nif given in advance of the sentencing hearing is informed by\n\nmultiple considerations.   Most importantly, the interest at stake\n\nfor the defendant – the length of incarceration – could not be more\n\ncritical, even when the potential difference in a defendant's\n\nsentence would be \"merely\" a matter of months.   Whether or not the\n\nDue Process Clause is implicated,7 the defendant's opportunity to\n\ncomment meaningfully when a court contemplates a sentence outside\n\nthe Guidelines is of utmost importance.\n\n           It also is significant, as the panel opinion observed,\n\nthat implicit in Burns and Rule 32(h) \"is the understanding that\n\nRule 32(h) notice would serve as an alternative to the forms of\n\nprehearing notice expressly referenced\" in the rule, i.e., the\n\npresentence report or a party's prehearing submission.       United\n\nStates v. Vega-Santiago,   --- F.3d ---, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 25420\n\n(1st Cir. Oct. 31, 2007), at *38 (emphasis in original).    Thus, a\n\nrule of pre-hearing notice is more consistent with the principles\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The Supreme Court noted in Burns that its construction of\nRule 32 avoided \"the serious question whether notice in this\nsetting is mandated by the Due Process Clause.\" 501 U.S. at 138.\n\n                                -18-\n\farticulated in Burns and incorporated into Rule 32.8              To require\n\ncounsel   to   respond   off-the-cuff      to   a   previously   unannounced\n\nrationale for a non-Guidelines sentence is to deny the very period\n\nof deliberation that \"notice\" is intended to guarantee.            Even when\n\ncompetent counsel is familiar with all of the facts of the crime\n\nand the general principles of sentencing law, he or she may not\n\nimmediately appreciate their relevance to the proposed variance\n\nfrom the Guidelines.      Accord United States v. Calzada-Maravillas,\n\n443 F.3d 1301, 1304 (10th Cir. 2006) (observing that the \"key\n\ncomponent\" of the notice requirement is \"notice in advance of the\n\nsentencing hearing\").\n\n           In addition, a bright-line rule of prehearing notice\n\nwould provide unambiguous direction to both the parties and the\n\ncourt, with minimal burden.      We must keep in perspective the small\n\nnumber of cases at issue here.          At the en banc oral argument, the\n\ngovernment represented that, in most instances, departures or\n\nvariances are either proposed by the Probation Department in the\n\npresentence report or requested by one of the parties.                   This\n\nunderstanding    that    sua   sponte    variances    by   the   court   occur\n\ninfrequently informed the conclusion reached by the original panel,\n\nwhich included an experienced district court judge. It will be the\n\n\n\n     8\n       I am, of course, well aware that Rule 32(h) applies by its\nterms only to sentencing departures.     It is the principles of\nBurns, which are reflected in Rule 32(h), that make the notice\nrequirement equally applicable to sentencing variances.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fexceptional occasion when a court must provide its own prehearing\n\nnotice of a contemplated ground for a variance; in such instances,\n\nthe court would be able to alert the parties with a brief written\n\norder.   A continuance would be necessary even more rarely, when a\n\nrationale for a variance first arises at the sentencing hearing.\n\n           Moreover, requiring that notice be given as a matter of\n\ncourse before the hearing reduces the possibility that the court\n\nwill be blind-sided by a party's last-minute attempt to secure a\n\nnon-Guidelines sentence.        The judge is obviously in a better\n\nposition to evaluate the merits of a variance if it is proposed in\n\nadvance.    With a rule of advance notice, the government and\n\ndefendant will have greater incentive to present all arguments for\n\na   non-Guidelines   sentence    in   their   prehearing   submissions,\n\nfacilitating sentencing proceedings that most fairly take into\n\naccount all relevant considerations.\n\n           However, even a rule of advance notice will not eliminate\n\nsome questions of reasonableness.        The content of the notice and\n\nits timing in relation to the date of the hearing and the issues to\n\nbe addressed are elements of reasonableness.       As for content, the\n\npanel opinion pointed to the requirement in Burns that the notice\n\n\"specifically identify the ground on which the district court is\n\ncontemplating an upward departure.\" 501 U.S. at 138-39. A similar\n\nrequirement should apply to a contemplated variance.          Any less\n\nexacting requirement would impose on the parties \"the burden of\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fguessing the particular grounds on which the court might choose to\n\nincrease [or decrease] the sentence.\"    Vega-Santiago, --- F.3d at\n\n---, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 25420, at *36.\n\n          As for timing, reasonableness will depend on whether the\n\nparties were given sufficient opportunity to prepare meaningful\n\ncomment on the previously unannounced ground for deviating from the\n\nGuidelines. If addressing the court's contemplated rationale would\n\nrequire minimal legal research or investigation of facts, a brief\n\nperiod of time would be adequate.     But if, for example, the court\n\nannounced that it might rely on mitigation evidence presented in\n\nletters submitted by multiple individuals, the parties might need\n\ntime to review the submissions and conduct further investigation.\n\nIn such circumstances, reasonable notice would have to be given far\n\nenough in advance of the hearing to accommodate such preparation.\n\n          Regardless of the complexity or novelty of the court's\n\nsua sponte rationale, at least some advance warning is crucial to\n\nensure the most effective advocacy and, in turn, \"the thorough\n\nadversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure,\"\n\nRita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2465 (2007).          Other\n\ncircuits also have explicitly adopted this view. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Cole, 496 F.3d 188, 191 (2d    Cir. 2007) (\"[N]otice given\n\nduring the course of the sentencing hearing and put into effect\n\nless than two hours later was insufficient.\"); United States v.\n\nFlanders, 491 F.3d 1197, 1220 (10th Cir. 2007) (finding that the\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fcourt's announcement on the first day of sentencing that it might\n\nimpose a non-Guidelines sentence was \"plainly insufficient under\n\nRule 32(h)\").\n\n           A failure to provide reasonable notice will not always\n\nrequire resentencing.      In some cases, the reviewing court may be\n\nsatisfied that lack of proper notice was harmless because it would\n\nnot have placed the defendant in a position to comment more\n\neffectively on the proposed variance.        Where, for example, counsel\n\nhad the opportunity to provide a thoughtful response to the court's\n\nrationale for a variance and where the defendant on appeal offered\n\nno additional rebuttal to the court's rationale, it would be\n\nappropriate to conclude that the lack of notice was harmless.              If,\n\nhowever, a defendant identifies plausible rebuttals to the court's\n\nrationale that could have been made if counsel had been given time\n\nto    prepare,   the   principles    of    Burns   require      resentencing.\n\nOtherwise, \"a critical sentencing determination will go untested by\n\nthe    adversarial     process   contemplated      by    Rule   32   and   the\n\nGuidelines.\"     Burns, 501 U.S. at 137.\n\n           The harmless error analysis addresses many of the same\n\nconsiderations     that   were   included    in    the   panel's     favorable\n\nevaluation of the reasonableness of the notice provided near the\n\noutset of the sentencing hearing in this case.             However, for the\n\nreasons stated, I now conclude that the better approach is to make\n\nadvance notice the rule and to engage in harmless error review when\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fthe rule is violated.       As I explain in the following section, the\n\nerror in this case was not harmless.\n\n                                          II.\n\n               As soon as the government proposed at Vega's sentencing\n\nhearing that the court go beyond the Guidelines term of 57 to 71\n\nmonths, his counsel protested that the defense should have been\n\nadvised    in    advance   \"so    it     can    be   prepared     to   rebut   these\n\narguments.\"       The court disagreed that notice was required, heard\n\ntestimony from the victims, and explained that the crime warranted\n\na higher sentence because, inter alia, it involved a home invasion\n\nwith a shooting and was therefore \"not a regular car jacking.\"\n\nCounsel unsuccessfully argued in response that the presentence\n\nreport and the Guidelines recommendation took the particular facts\n\nof the crime into account.             In announcing the sentence, the court\n\nreferred to defendant's \"invad[ing] the privacy of a home in the\n\nmiddle    of    the   night,\"    the    victim's     plea   for   mercy,   and   the\n\ndischarge of the weapon.\n\n               In his en banc brief, Vega offers several arguments that\n\ncould have been made at the sentencing hearing if counsel had\n\nreceived advance notice that the court was contemplating a variance\n\nbased on the specific details of the offense:9\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Although these arguments were not made to the panel, I deem\nit appropriate to consider them on en banc review because we\nspecifically invited argument on the notice issue.\n\n                                         -23-\n\f          ! In response to the court's concern that the\n          carjacking was unusual because it involved a\n          home    invasion     that    caused   serious\n          psychological injury to the victims, counsel\n          could [have] challenged the veracity of the\n          victims' claims of paralyzing fear, noting\n          that [the victim] responded to the robbery by\n          getting a gun, firing 13 shots at Mr. Vega-\n          Santiago as he drove away on a public street,\n          and then reloading and \"go[ing] after the\n          defendant\" with his friend in an SUV. Counsel\n          also could have argued that being robbed and\n          fired upon by an armed gunman in any location\n          causes serious emotional trauma, and that the\n          marginal cost of enduring the crime at home,\n          as   opposed   to   numerous   other  private\n          locations, does not justify a variance from\n          the guideline range.\n\n          ! In response to the court's reliance on the\n          shot fired during the robbery, counsel could\n          have   pointed   out   that   the  mandatory\n          consecutive sentence on Count Two already\n          reflected a three-year increase because \"the\n          firearm [was] discharged\" rather than merely\n          \"brandished.\"      Compare    18  U.S.C.   §\n          924(c)(1)(A)(iii)     (ten-year    mandatory\n          minimum), with 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)\n          (seven-year mandatory minimum).\n\n          ! In response to the court's reliance on the\n          death threat and pleas for mercy, counsel\n          could have explained the effect of the\n          guideline   adjustment  for   death  threats,\n          U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), which was applied\n          in this case, and could have reminded the\n          court of \"the need to avoid unwarranted\n          sentence disparities among defendants with\n          similar records who have been found guilty of\n          similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).\n\nAppellant's En Banc Brief at 21-22 (citations omitted).\n\n          These arguments, which directly challenge the need for a\n\nnon-Guidelines sentence to meet the court's objectives, are neither\n\nfrivolous nor tangential to the court's reasoning.   We cannot know\n\n                               -24-\n\ftheir impact on the court if counsel had had the opportunity to\n\npresent them at the sentencing hearing.        The court expressed\n\nconcern that Vega's sentence \"reflect how serious this offense\n\nwas.\"   Although defense counsel argued at the hearing that the\n\nGuidelines sentencing range would accomplish that purpose, the\n\nbrief adds specific content, supported by authority, to the more\n\ngeneral argument that the Guidelines already accounted for the\n\nfacts that bothered the judge.        It is precisely this sort of\n\ndeveloped presentation by counsel, reinforced by legal and factual\n\nreferences, that is denied a defendant who is not given advance\n\nnotice of the court's contemplated grounds for a non-Guidelines\n\nsentence. Moreover, in its explanation for the sentence, the court\n\nalso referred to Vega's admission that he had \"previous brushes\n\nwith the law which included violent crime allegations for which he\n\nwas not convicted\" – a basis for deviating that the court had not\n\npreviously mentioned and for which, therefore, no notice was\n\nprovided.\n\n            Where, as here, a defendant demonstrates that lack of\n\nnotice deprived him of \"full adversary testing of the issues\n\nrelevant\" to his sentence, Burns, 501 U.S. at 135, the error cannot\n\nbe deemed harmless and a remand for resentencing is necessary.\n\n                               III.\n\n            The majority predicts that \"a mechanical notice rule\"\n\nwould cause undesirable consequences.      In their view, it would\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fcause judges to \"shy away from imposing non-guideline sentences\n\nthat the parties had not proposed in advance,\" or, alternatively,\n\n\"the judge would often have to employ a burdensome two-stage\n\nregime.\"    Neither of these assertions has merit.\n\nA. Multiple Proceedings\n\n            The majority's concern that an advance notice rule would\n\noften require a two-stage sentencing process reveals a fundamental\n\nmisunderstanding of the sentencing process.        My colleagues appear\n\nto believe that a judge enters the courtroom for a sentencing\n\nhearing with little sense of the sentence he or she intends to\n\nimpose or the factors that will affect that sentence.           They assume\n\nthat these factors will become apparent only during the course of\n\nthe hearing and that, if notice is required for a decision to\n\ndeviate    from   the   Guidelines,   many   variances   will    require   a\n\ncontinuance and second hearing.\n\n            That concern is at odds with reality. While the majority\n\nmay be correct that a judge will not make a final sentencing\n\ndecision until the end of the hearing, and \"may well be revising\n\nhis views depending on what is presented and how counsel respond to\n\nquestions,\" the judge will arrive at that hearing after a review of\n\nthe presentence report and other relevant materials.             He or she\n\nwill already have a developed view of what the appropriate sentence\n\nis, including its length.       To be sure, the judge's views may be\n\naltered by what he or she hears at the hearing.          But a judge will\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\falmost always have considered in advance of the hearing whether an\n\nupward or downward variance is appropriate.             To suggest less\n\nforethought on the part of the sentencing judge is to suggest that\n\nthe judge enters the hearing unprepared.\n\n            In other words, the ultimate decision to deviate from the\n\nGuidelines – made at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing,\n\nafter adversary testing of the issues – should not be confused with\n\nthe earlier inclination – developed before the hearing – to focus\n\nattention    on   particular   factors   that   might   warrant   such   a\n\ndeviation.    The notice required by Rule 32(h) is not that a court\n\nwill impose a variance, but only that it is considering factors\n\nthat may justify a variance.      Hence, it would pose no burden for\n\nthe court to provide notice in advance of the hearing that such a\n\nvariance is contemplated. In those few instances where the court's\n\ninclination to impose a variance is based on a factor or factors\n\nraised for the first time at the hearing, the principles of Burns\n\nand Rule 32(h) require the court to provide sufficient notice to\n\nenable both the defendant and the government to consider, research\n\nand thoughtfully respond to the new ground.             In that case a\n\ncontinuance of the sentencing hearing would be required.             Such\n\ncontinuances would be a small price to pay for the fairness to all\n\nparties of the advance notice requirement.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fB. The Role of the Guidelines\n\n            The     notion     that   a    rule     of     advance     notice    would\n\ninappropriately      incline     judges     toward       the   Guidelines   is   also\n\nseriously flawed.        In multiple cases this term, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explicitly confirmed that the Guidelines remain a central part\n\nof the sentencing process post-Booker.                   The Guidelines are \"the\n\nstarting point and the initial benchmark\" for sentencing decisions,\n\nGall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 596 (2007), entitled to\n\n\"respectful consideration,\" Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct.\n\n558, 570 (2007), because \"in the ordinary case, the [Sentencing]\n\nCommission's recommendation of a sentencing range will 'reflect a\n\nrough approximation of sentences that might achieve § 3553(a)'s\n\nobjectives,'\" id. at 574 (quoting Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2465).                      See\n\nalso United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.\n\n2006 (en banc) (holding that the district court normally should\n\nbegin with a Guidelines calculation).\n\n            The majority does not dispute the continuing centrality\n\nof   the   Guidelines     to    the   sentencing         process.      Indeed,   they\n\nacknowledge the Guidelines' \"gravitational pull.\"                       They worry,\n\nhowever, that an advance notice requirement will increase the\n\nGuidelines'       pull   on    district     court    judges      and    hence    could\n\ncompromise the changes in the sentencing process effected by the\n\nSupreme Court in Booker and its progeny.                       The suggestion that\n\ndistrict court judges would shy away from sua sponte variances as\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fa matter of convenience is misguided.           It is inconceivable to me\n\nthat, having given the Guidelines due consideration and finding\n\nthem lacking, a judge would suppress the independent judgment\n\nrequired by the Supreme Court simply to avoid providing the parties\n\nwith reasonable prehearing notice.          The modest burden of preparing\n\na brief notice or, in the rare case, continuing an already convened\n\nsentencing hearing to a later date would not deter a judge from\n\nimposing a variance.\n\n           Rather    than    justifying      less     notice,       the   broader\n\nsentencing    discretion    afforded   to    district      judges    post-Booker\n\nrequires that defendants be given the same advance warning of the\n\ncourt's contemplated rationale for deviating from the Guidelines\n\nthat Burns required for sentencing departures.                  As the panel\n\nopinion observed, the need for notice remains acute because of the\n\nvirtually limitless number of factors that may be used to support\n\na variance.     Although notice under Rule 32 is owed to both the\n\ndefendant and the government, the defendant's interest in preparing\n\nthe most persuasive argument available against an upward variance\n\nis obviously of particular significance.            Defendants should not be\n\nplaced in the untenable position of \"trying to anticipate and\n\nnegate every conceivable ground on which the district court might\n\nchoose to depart on its own initiative\" or risk allowing \"a\n\ncritical     sentencing    determination      [to]    go    untested      by   the\n\nadversarial process.\"       Burns, 501 U.S. at 137.\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\f           The majority acknowledges that there are some cases\n\nwhere, as a matter of fairness, notice must be provided.             But the\n\nmajority's proposed approach – providing notice or granting a\n\ncontinuance when the court proposes to rely on a ground that would\n\n\"unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel\" – has\n\nat least three serious flaws.          First, it gives no guidance at all\n\nto district judges.       Without an anchor in either the Due Process\n\nClause or a bright-line rule, the majority's standard offers\n\nsentencing judges no framework within which to evaluate the need\n\nfor notice.   Fairness, surprise and reasonable preparation are all\n\nelusive concepts that individual judges will see differently.\n\n           Second, the ambiguity of the standard leaves every non-\n\nGuidelines    sentence    that   was    imposed   without   notice   open    to\n\nchallenge on appeal.      Surprise arguably exists any time the court\n\nannounces, for the first time at the sentencing hearing, its sua\n\nsponte intention to deviate from the Guidelines, and surprise will\n\nrarely be deemed \"fair\" by a defendant who has a right, under Rule\n\n32,   to   comment   on    matters       affecting   the    length   of     his\n\nincarceration. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(1)(C). Debate over what\n\nit means for counsel to be \"reasonably prepared\" for a sentencing\n\nhearing surely will consume more judicial time than judges would\n\nexpend in giving prehearing notice.           Moreover, the standard is so\n\nvague that appellate courts could rarely, if ever, conclude that\n\nthe sentencing court had erred.\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\f            Third, the majority suggests that most cases would not\n\ninvolve   unfair        surprise      because   courts       typically     would    base\n\nvariances       on    \"[g]arden    variety      considerations\"       such    as    the\n\nlikelihood of recidivism or the seriousness of the crime.                     But the\n\ncommonality of such factors is not the issue.                   What matters is how\n\nthe court is processing all of the information relevant to those\n\nfactors and its inclination to take an exceptional view of them.\n\nIn the absence of advance notice, neither the defendant nor the\n\ngovernment has reason to anticipate that the usual factors may lead\n\nto a non-Guidelines sentence, and advocating for a lower sentence\n\nor higher sentence within a Guidelines range is not the same as\n\nadvocating against the court's inclination to sentence outside the\n\nGuidelines.          That difference is reflected in the new arguments\n\nasserted in Vega's en banc brief, which specifically emphasize why\n\nthe   court's        concerns   did    not   require     a    sentence     beyond    the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            In sum, an easily administered bright-line rule requiring\n\nadvance notice in all cases would promote both actual fairness in\n\nsentencing and \"the perception of fair sentencing,\" Gall, 128 S.\n\nCt. at 597, without undue burdens on the courts.                  The Supreme Court\n\nalready has recognized the need for a reasonable notice requirement\n\nin the context of departures.                In the post-Booker era, when the\n\ncourt has broader discretion to go outside the Guidelines, notice\n\nremains     a    critical       component     of   the       defendant's    right     to\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fmeaningfully comment on the appropriateness of a non-Guidelines\n\nsentence.   I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               -32-\n\f",

The term \"departures\" refers specifically\n\nto   just       such   deviations.        Rule   32(h)     speaks    explicitly    of\n\n\"departures,\" a term with a precise legal meaning.                         U.S.S.G. §\n\n1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (2007); United States v.

That requirement was said to\n\nbe implicit in the demands of a federal rule giving parties the\n\nright    to     comment    on   \"matters    relating    to   the    appropriate\n\nsentence.\"3      Without notice, the Court reasoned, counsel will be\n\nunprepared      to    comment   meaningfully   on    grounds    for   departure\n\nproposed by the judge, resulting in a lack of adversarial testing.\n\nBurns, 501 U.S. at 135.\n\n              There are competing arguments as to whether and how far\n\nBurns and its rationales bear on variances; and the Supreme Court\n\nwill answer those questions in due course.             But our view is that,\n\nin this different context, adopting a mechanical rule would be a\n\nmistake: it would not respond to the realities of a system in which\n\njudges are afforded much broader discretion than in the recent\n\npast,    it   would    reinforce   guideline      sentencing,   and    it   would\n\nconsiderably complicate and prolong the sentencing process.\n\n              A bright-line advance notice requirement for potential\n\ndepartures fit sensibly within the mandatory guideline regime in\n\nplace    when    Burns    was   decided.    The    guidelines      provided   for\n\ndepartures, and articulated specific grounds upon which they can\n\n\n     3\n      This rule remains in force, Fed. R. Crim.

See, e.g., Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2465 (holding that\n\na district judge \"does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption\n\nthat the Guidelines sentence should apply\").          Alternatively, the\n\njudge would often have to employ a burdensome two-stage regime,\n\nexplaining at the end of the first hearing his proposed sentence\n\nand then conducting a follow-up hearing based on such notice.\n\n            The preferable solution is thus not a mechanical rule\n\nmandating   formal    notice   in   every   case   where   the   judge   may\n\nconceivably vary from the guidelines.         Rather, when proposing to\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fadopt a variant sentence relying on some ground or factor that\n\nwould unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel,\n\na judge must either provide advance notice or, on request, grant a\n\ncontinuance in order to accommodate a reasonable desire for more\n\nevidence or further research.    No formal rule is required for us to\n\nadopt such a prudential policy as a matter of precedent.\n\n          In practice such cases of unfair surprise, probably rare,\n\nare not that hard to identify; and this case is not one of them.\n\nHere, the district judge relied primarily on three particular\n\ndetails of the crime--that it involved the invasion of a home,\n\ndeath threats and a near-miss firing of a gun--and that Vega had\n\nbeen previously arrested (but not convicted) on charges of violent\n\ncrime.   The details of the crime were well known to counsel; and\n\nVega had admitted his prior \"brushes with the law\" which were noted\n\nin the pre-sentence report.5\n\n          Defense   counsel    may   not   have   anticipated   that   the\n\ndistrict judge would rely upon those particular facts to impose an\n\nabove-guideline sentence, but having that knowledge in advance\n\nwould not have made any obvious difference.        The facts themselves\n\nwere familiar and undisputed, so there is no concern here that\n\n\n\n     5\n      Vega points out that the district judge agreed to strike that\nportion of the PSR at the start of the sentencing hearing. But, as\nthe judge explained when delivering the sentence, it was removed\nonly because Vega's counsel was concerned that the Bureau of\nPrisons would use it to \"jack up his security level.\" The truth of\nthe admission was not contested.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcounsel might have been able, with notice, to challenge them.    And\n\nnowhere else in the law is the judge required to explain his\n\nreasoning before counsel have argued to him.\n\n          In granting rehearing en banc we invited supplemental\n\nbriefing not only on the panel's automatic notice requirement but\n\non whether there was unfair surprise in this case. Defense counsel\n\nhave added new arguments to those earlier presented to the panel.\n\nBut we agree with the panel's original view that unfair surprise\n\nhas not been established.   At sentencing defense counsel had ample\n\nopportunity and incentive, without any advance notice of a possible\n\nvariance, to make the same arguments now offered to us.\n\n          First, Vega submits that mitigating evidence about his\n\nfamily circumstances could have been offered.       But mitigating\n\nevidence would have been relevant to sentencing with or without a\n\nvariance from the guideline range. The principal factor cited, the\n\ndeath of Vega's father shortly before the crime, was readily\n\ndetectable by counsel and potentially useful to argue for a lower\n\nsentence within or (under Booker) below the guideline range.\n\n          Next, Vega contends that a carjacking that involves\n\ninvading a home is no worse, for purposes of the section 3553(a)\n\nfactors, than an ordinary carjacking.   We fail to see how further\n\nnotice was necessary in order to prepare that argument about the\n\nseriousness   of    the   offense   facts--a   typical    sentencing\n\nconsideration.   Comparing and contrasting a defendant's particular\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fcrime to its \"heartland\" prototype is always relevant.     That the\n\njudge might think that a home invasion carried an extra sense of\n\nmenace is hardly a surprise.\n\n            Finally, Vega says that the death threat and firing of\n\nthe gun were already taken into account by the guidelines, and that\n\nwith more notice, defense counsel would have been prepared to point\n\nthat out.   But a factor that is worked into the guideline calculus\n\nmay still be considered by a district judge in the section 3553(a)\n\nanalysis. See, e.g., United States v. Scherrer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202150\"><a href=\"/opinion/202150/united-states-v-scherrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93-94\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Wisdom, like\n            good wine, requires maturing.\n\n                   Moreover, the judgments of this Court\n            are collective judgments. They are neither\n            solo performances nor debates between two\n            sides, each of which has its mind quickly made\n            up and then closed. The judgments of this\n            Court   presuppose  full    consideration   and\n            reconsideration by all of the reasoned views\n            of each. Without adequate study there cannot\n            be adequate reflection.       Without adequate\n            reflection    there    cannot    be    adequate\n            deliberation and discussion.

Accordingly, I must state my views, even if in a\n\npreliminary and incomplete fashion.\n\n           The convocation of this particular en banc proceeding\n\nhighlights the whimsical and uneven manner in which this circuit\n\noften applies the rehearing rules.     Indeed, both the granting and\n\ndenying of petitions for these extraordinary proceedings evince a\n\ndouble-standard with respect to which issues are deemed meritorious\n\nof such review.

Time constraints\n\ndo not allow for an exhaustive inventory of this asseveration, but\n\nthe circumstances of this present appeal demonstrate one such\n\nexample.\n\n           In this case, before either the appellant or the appellee\n\nhad the opportunity to seek en banc review, the court undertook a\n\nrather unusual procedure and ordered en banc rehearing sua sponte.\n\nThe appeal thus metamorphosed into one more relevant to, and\n\n\n                                -14-\n\freflective of, a judicially fueled agenda.

The Court recognized that in the\n\nabsence of notice, parties would make arguments \"in a random and\n\nwasteful way by trying to anticipate and negate every conceivable\n\nground on which the district court might choose to depart on its\n\nown initiative\" or, worse yet, \"the parties [may] not even try to\n\nanticipate such a development,\" and leave the contemplated grounds\n\nuntested by the adversarial process.

The majority has concocted a vague standard\n\nfor pre-sentence notice which will inevitably lead to interminable\n\nlitigation as to what a \"competent and reasonably prepared counsel\"\n\nwould have anticipated.        Slip Op. at 10.          This will undoubtedly\n\nhave the effect of causing more delay and a greater waste of\n\njudicial resources than the occasional continuance forecast by the\n\nmajority's opinion were the Rule 32 standard to be followed.                  See\n\nSlip Op. at 8.          The fact is that such continuances might be\n\nnecessary   in   only    a   handful    of    cases.6     In   any   event,   the\n\npostponement of sentencing is a minor inconvenience to the judicial\n\nsystem when weighed against the basic due process protections\n\nafforded by the Rule 32 notice requirements.              See Burns, 501 U.S.\n\nat 138 (noting that \"were we to read Rule 32 to dispense with\n\nnotice, we would then have to confront the serious question whether\n\nnotice in this setting is mandated by the Due Process Clause\"\n\n(emphasis added)).

Indeed, the government now\n\nalso agrees that the reasonable notice required by Burns and Rule\n\n32(h) must apply to Guidelines variances to ensure full adversarial\n\ntesting of the issues related to sentencing.\n\n           Moreover, having further considered the issue in the\n\ncontext of en banc briefing and argument, I have become convinced\n\nthat the reasonable notice requirement means notice of a possible\n\nvariance   being   contemplated   by   the   judge   in   advance   of    the\n\nsentencing hearing. Such prehearing notice is most consistent with\n\nRule 32's directive that parties be given the opportunity to\n\ncomment on matters \"relating to an appropriate sentence.\"           Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(i)(1)(C).    This rule does not mean that every failure\n\nto give prehearing notice will require a new proceeding.                 Such\n\nerrors lend themselves to harmless error review.

We must keep in perspective the small\n\nnumber of cases at issue here.          At the en banc oral argument, the\n\ngovernment represented that, in most instances, departures or\n\nvariances are either proposed by the Probation Department in the\n\npresentence report or requested by one of the parties.                   This\n\nunderstanding    that    sua   sponte    variances    by   the   court   occur\n\ninfrequently informed the conclusion reached by the original panel,\n\nwhich included an experienced district court judge.

It is the principles of\nBurns, which are reflected in Rule 32(h), that make the notice\nrequirement equally applicable to sentencing variances.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fexceptional occasion when a court must provide its own prehearing\n\nnotice of a contemplated ground for a variance; in such instances,\n\nthe court would be able to alert the parties with a brief written\n\norder.   A continuance would be necessary even more rarely, when a\n\nrationale for a variance first arises at the sentencing hearing.\n\n           Moreover, requiring that notice be given as a matter of\n\ncourse before the hearing reduces the possibility that the court\n\nwill be blind-sided by a party's last-minute attempt to secure a\n\nnon-Guidelines sentence.        The judge is obviously in a better\n\nposition to evaluate the merits of a variance if it is proposed in\n\nadvance.    With a rule of advance notice, the government and\n\ndefendant will have greater incentive to present all arguments for\n\na   non-Guidelines   sentence    in   their   prehearing   submissions,\n\nfacilitating sentencing proceedings that most fairly take into\n\naccount all relevant considerations.\n\n           However, even a rule of advance notice will not eliminate\n\nsome questions of reasonableness.        The content of the notice and\n\nits timing in relation to the date of the hearing and the issues to\n\nbe addressed are elements of reasonableness.       As for content, the\n\npanel opinion pointed to the requirement in Burns that the notice\n\n\"specifically identify the ground on which the district court is\n\ncontemplating an upward departure.\" 501 U.S. at 138-39. A similar\n\nrequirement should apply to a contemplated variance.          Any less\n\nexacting requirement would impose on the parties \"the burden of\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fguessing the particular grounds on which the court might choose to\n\nincrease [or decrease] the sentence.\"    Vega-Santiago, --- F.3d at\n\n---, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">25420</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *36.\n\n          As for timing, reasonableness will depend on whether the\n\nparties were given sufficient opportunity to prepare meaningful\n\ncomment on the previously unannounced ground for deviating from the\n\nGuidelines.

In some cases, the reviewing court may be\n\nsatisfied that lack of proper notice was harmless because it would\n\nnot have placed the defendant in a position to comment more\n\neffectively on the proposed variance.        Where, for example, counsel\n\nhad the opportunity to provide a thoughtful response to the court's\n\nrationale for a variance and where the defendant on appeal offered\n\nno additional rebuttal to the court's rationale, it would be\n\nappropriate to conclude that the lack of notice was harmless.              If,\n\nhowever, a defendant identifies plausible rebuttals to the court's\n\nrationale that could have been made if counsel had been given time\n\nto    prepare,   the   principles    of    Burns   require      resentencing.\n\nOtherwise, \"a critical sentencing determination will go untested by\n\nthe    adversarial     process   contemplated      by    Rule   32   and   the\n\nGuidelines.\"     Burns, 501 U.S. at 137.\n\n           The harmless error analysis addresses many of the same\n\nconsiderations     that   were   included    in    the   panel's     favorable\n\nevaluation of the reasonableness of the notice provided near the\n\noutset of the sentencing hearing in this case.             However, for the\n\nreasons stated, I now conclude that the better approach is to make\n\nadvance notice the rule and to engage in harmless error review when\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fthe rule is violated.       As I explain in the following section, the\n\nerror in this case was not harmless.\n\n                                          II.\n\n               As soon as the government proposed at Vega's sentencing\n\nhearing that the court go beyond the Guidelines term of 57 to 71\n\nmonths, his counsel protested that the defense should have been\n\nadvised    in    advance   \"so    it     can    be   prepared     to   rebut   these\n\narguments.\"       The court disagreed that notice was required, heard\n\ntestimony from the victims, and explained that the crime warranted\n\na higher sentence because, inter alia, it involved a home invasion\n\nwith a shooting and was therefore \"not a regular car jacking.\"\n\nCounsel unsuccessfully argued in response that the presentence\n\nreport and the Guidelines recommendation took the particular facts\n\nof the crime into account.             In announcing the sentence, the court\n\nreferred to defendant's \"invad[ing] the privacy of a home in the\n\nmiddle    of    the   night,\"    the    victim's     plea   for   mercy,   and   the\n\ndischarge of the weapon.\n\n               In his en banc brief, Vega offers several arguments that\n\ncould have been made at the sentencing hearing if counsel had\n\nreceived advance notice that the court was contemplating a variance\n\nbased on the specific details of the offense:9\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Although these arguments were not made to the panel, I deem\nit appropriate to consider them on en banc review because we\nspecifically invited argument on the notice issue.\n\n                                         -23-\n\f          ! In response to the court's concern that the\n          carjacking was unusual because it involved a\n          home    invasion     that    caused   serious\n          psychological injury to the victims, counsel\n          could [have] challenged the veracity of the\n          victims' claims of paralyzing fear, noting\n          that [the victim] responded to the robbery by\n          getting a gun, firing 13 shots at Mr. Vega-\n          Santiago as he drove away on a public street,\n          and then reloading and \"go[ing] after the\n          defendant\" with his friend in an SUV. Counsel\n          also could have argued that being robbed and\n          fired upon by an armed gunman in any location\n          causes serious emotional trauma, and that the\n          marginal cost of enduring the crime at home,\n          as   opposed   to   numerous   other  private\n          locations, does not justify a variance from\n          the guideline range.\n\n          ! In response to the court's reliance on the\n          shot fired during the robbery, counsel could\n          have   pointed   out   that   the  mandatory\n          consecutive sentence on Count Two already\n          reflected a three-year increase because \"the\n          firearm [was] discharged\" rather than merely\n          \"brandished.\"      Compare    18  U.S.C.   §\n          924(c)(1)(A)(iii)     (ten-year    mandatory\n          minimum), with 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)\n          (seven-year mandatory minimum).\n\n          ! In response to the court's reliance on the\n          death threat and pleas for mercy, counsel\n          could have explained the effect of the\n          guideline   adjustment  for   death  threats,\n          U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), which was applied\n          in this case, and could have reminded the\n          court of \"the need to avoid unwarranted\n          sentence disparities among defendants with\n          similar records who have been found guilty of\n          similar conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).\n\nAppellant's En Banc Brief at 21-22 (citations omitted).\n\n          These arguments, which directly challenge the need for a\n\nnon-Guidelines sentence to meet the court's objectives, are neither\n\nfrivolous nor tangential to the court's reasoning.   We cannot know\n\n                               -24-\n\ftheir impact on the court if counsel had had the opportunity to\n\npresent them at the sentencing hearing.        The court expressed\n\nconcern that Vega's sentence \"reflect how serious this offense\n\nwas.\"   Although defense counsel argued at the hearing that the\n\nGuidelines sentencing range would accomplish that purpose, the\n\nbrief adds specific content, supported by authority, to the more\n\ngeneral argument that the Guidelines already accounted for the\n\nfacts that bothered the judge.        It is precisely this sort of\n\ndeveloped presentation by counsel, reinforced by legal and factual\n\nreferences, that is denied a defendant who is not given advance\n\nnotice of the court's contemplated grounds for a non-Guidelines\n\nsentence. Moreover, in its explanation for the sentence, the court\n\nalso referred to Vega's admission that he had \"previous brushes\n\nwith the law which included violent crime allegations for which he\n\nwas not convicted\" – a basis for deviating that the court had not\n\npreviously mentioned and for which, therefore, no notice was\n\nprovided.\n\n            Where, as here, a defendant demonstrates that lack of\n\nnotice deprived him of \"full adversary testing of the issues\n\nrelevant\" to his sentence, Burns, 501 U.S. at 135, the error cannot\n\nbe deemed harmless and a remand for resentencing is necessary.\n\n                               III.\n\n            The majority predicts that \"a mechanical notice rule\"\n\nwould cause undesirable consequences.      In their view, it would\n\n\n                               -25-\n\fcause judges to \"shy away from imposing non-guideline sentences\n\nthat the parties had not proposed in advance,\" or, alternatively,\n\n\"the judge would often have to employ a burdensome two-stage\n\nregime.\"    Neither of these assertions has merit.\n\nA. Multiple Proceedings\n\n            The majority's concern that an advance notice rule would\n\noften require a two-stage sentencing process reveals a fundamental\n\nmisunderstanding of the sentencing process.        My colleagues appear\n\nto believe that a judge enters the courtroom for a sentencing\n\nhearing with little sense of the sentence he or she intends to\n\nimpose or the factors that will affect that sentence.           They assume\n\nthat these factors will become apparent only during the course of\n\nthe hearing and that, if notice is required for a decision to\n\ndeviate    from   the   Guidelines,   many   variances   will    require   a\n\ncontinuance and second hearing.\n\n            That concern is at odds with reality. While the majority\n\nmay be correct that a judge will not make a final sentencing\n\ndecision until the end of the hearing, and \"may well be revising\n\nhis views depending on what is presented and how counsel respond to\n\nquestions,\" the judge will arrive at that hearing after a review of\n\nthe presentence report and other relevant materials.             He or she\n\nwill already have a developed view of what the appropriate sentence\n\nis, including its length.       To be sure, the judge's views may be\n\naltered by what he or she hears at the hearing.          But a judge will\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\falmost always have considered in advance of the hearing whether an\n\nupward or downward variance is appropriate.             To suggest less\n\nforethought on the part of the sentencing judge is to suggest that\n\nthe judge enters the hearing unprepared.\n\n            In other words, the ultimate decision to deviate from the\n\nGuidelines – made at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing,\n\nafter adversary testing of the issues – should not be confused with\n\nthe earlier inclination – developed before the hearing – to focus\n\nattention    on   particular   factors   that   might   warrant   such   a\n\ndeviation.    The notice required by Rule 32(h) is not that a court\n\nwill impose a variance, but only that it is considering factors\n\nthat may justify a variance.      Hence, it would pose no burden for\n\nthe court to provide notice in advance of the hearing that such a\n\nvariance is contemplated. In those few instances where the court's\n\ninclination to impose a variance is based on a factor or factors\n\nraised for the first time at the hearing, the principles of Burns\n\nand Rule 32(h) require the court to provide sufficient notice to\n\nenable both the defendant and the government to consider, research\n\nand thoughtfully respond to the new ground.             In that case a\n\ncontinuance of the sentencing hearing would be required.             Such\n\ncontinuances would be a small price to pay for the fairness to all\n\nparties of the advance notice requirement.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fB. The Role of the Guidelines\n\n            The     notion     that   a    rule     of     advance     notice    would\n\ninappropriately      incline     judges     toward       the   Guidelines   is   also\n\nseriously flawed.

Indeed,   they\n\nacknowledge the Guidelines' \"gravitational pull.\"                       They worry,\n\nhowever, that an advance notice requirement will increase the\n\nGuidelines'       pull   on    district     court    judges      and    hence    could\n\ncompromise the changes in the sentencing process effected by the\n\nSupreme Court in Booker and its progeny.

It is inconceivable to me\n\nthat, having given the Guidelines due consideration and finding\n\nthem lacking, a judge would suppress the independent judgment\n\nrequired by the Supreme Court simply to avoid providing the parties\n\nwith reasonable prehearing notice.          The modest burden of preparing\n\na brief notice or, in the rare case, continuing an already convened\n\nsentencing hearing to a later date would not deter a judge from\n\nimposing a variance.\n\n           Rather    than    justifying      less     notice,       the   broader\n\nsentencing    discretion    afforded   to    district      judges    post-Booker\n\nrequires that defendants be given the same advance warning of the\n\ncourt's contemplated rationale for deviating from the Guidelines\n\nthat Burns required for sentencing departures.                  As the panel\n\nopinion observed, the need for notice remains acute because of the\n\nvirtually limitless number of factors that may be used to support\n\na variance.     Although notice under Rule 32 is owed to both the\n\ndefendant and the government, the defendant's interest in preparing\n\nthe most persuasive argument available against an upward variance\n\nis obviously of particular significance.            Defendants should not be\n\nplaced in the untenable position of \"trying to anticipate and\n\nnegate every conceivable ground on which the district court might\n\nchoose to depart on its own initiative\" or risk allowing \"a\n\ncritical     sentencing    determination      [to]    go    untested      by   the\n\nadversarial process.\"       Burns, 501 U.S. at 137.\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\f           The majority acknowledges that there are some cases\n\nwhere, as a matter of fairness, notice must be provided.             But the\n\nmajority's proposed approach – providing notice or granting a\n\ncontinuance when the court proposes to rely on a ground that would\n\n\"unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel\" – has\n\nat least three serious flaws.          First, it gives no guidance at all\n\nto district judges.       Without an anchor in either the Due Process\n\nClause or a bright-line rule, the majority's standard offers\n\nsentencing judges no framework within which to evaluate the need\n\nfor notice.   Fairness, surprise and reasonable preparation are all\n\nelusive concepts that individual judges will see differently.\n\n           Second, the ambiguity of the standard leaves every non-\n\nGuidelines    sentence    that   was    imposed   without   notice   open    to\n\nchallenge on appeal.      Surprise arguably exists any time the court\n\nannounces, for the first time at the sentencing hearing, its sua\n\nsponte intention to deviate from the Guidelines, and surprise will\n\nrarely be deemed \"fair\" by a defendant who has a right, under Rule\n\n32,   to   comment   on    matters       affecting   the    length   of     his\n\nincarceration.

Debate over what\n\nit means for counsel to be \"reasonably prepared\" for a sentencing\n\nhearing surely will consume more judicial time than judges would\n\nexpend in giving prehearing notice.           Moreover, the standard is so\n\nvague that appellate courts could rarely, if ever, conclude that\n\nthe sentencing court had erred.\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\f            Third, the majority suggests that most cases would not\n\ninvolve   unfair        surprise      because   courts       typically     would    base\n\nvariances       on    \"[g]arden    variety      considerations\"       such    as    the\n\nlikelihood of recidivism or the seriousness of the crime.                     But the\n\ncommonality of such factors is not the issue.                   What matters is how\n\nthe court is processing all of the information relevant to those\n\nfactors and its inclination to take an exceptional view of them.\n\nIn the absence of advance notice, neither the defendant nor the\n\ngovernment has reason to anticipate that the usual factors may lead\n\nto a non-Guidelines sentence, and advocating for a lower sentence\n\nor higher sentence within a Guidelines range is not the same as\n\nadvocating against the court's inclination to sentence outside the\n\nGuidelines.          That difference is reflected in the new arguments\n\nasserted in Vega's en banc brief, which specifically emphasize why\n\nthe   court's        concerns   did    not   require     a    sentence     beyond    the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            In sum, an easily administered bright-line rule requiring\n\nadvance notice in all cases would promote both actual fairness in\n\nsentencing and \"the perception of fair sentencing,\" Gall, 128 S.\n\nCt. at 597, without undue burdens on the courts.                  The Supreme Court\n\nalready has recognized the need for a reasonable notice requirement\n\nin the context of departures.                In the post-Booker era, when the\n\ncourt has broader discretion to go outside the Guidelines, notice\n\nremains     a    critical       component     of   the       defendant's    right     to\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fmeaningfully comment on the appropriateness of a non-Guidelines\n\nsentence.   I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               -32-\n\f</pre>",
