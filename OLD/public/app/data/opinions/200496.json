This    appeal    is   one   phase   of\n\ncommercial litigation that has lasted over a decade.                It involves\n\nliabilities pertaining to insurance coverage provided by Liberty\n\nMutual Insurance Company and an affiliate (jointly \"Liberty\").\n\nThere is now little factual dispute but the contractual provisions\n\n(reprinted, in pertinent part, in an appendix to this opinion) are\n\ncomplex. We begin with a summary description of the background and\n\nprocedural progress of the case, reserving detail for discussion of\n\nthe several remaining disputes.\n\n          In     January     1989,     Household      International,         Inc.\n\n(\"Household\"), decided to divest certain assets, either in spin-\n\noffs to shareholders or through outright sales to third parties.\n\nThe Thermos Company (\"Thermos\") was one of the subsidiaries formed\n\nas part of Household's reorganization plan, and various assets and\n\nliabilities from the rest of Household were transferred to Thermos\n\nthrough a series of assignment and assumption agreements (\"A&A\n\nagreements\").       In   June   1989,      after     an     intensive    weekend\n\nnegotiation, Household entered into a 139-page purchase agreement\n\n(\"purchase agreement\"), to sell Thermos to Nippon Sanso K.K. in a\n\ncash-for-share    transaction    for    $134      million    (the   latter      two\n\nentities collectively \"Nippon\").\n\n          The purchase agreement had to be completed quickly, yet\n\nthe underlying insurance policies--themselves only one aspect of\n\nthe purchase--were complex and covered a number of Household\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fcompanies including Thermos.           Negotiations were conducted under\n\nthreat    of    a   scheduled   auction    of    Thermos   by   Household,     and\n\napparently the negotiators lacked first-hand knowledge of the\n\ninsurance policies.         Nevertheless, the purchase agreement made\n\nquite specific arrangements to allocate the still-open burdens and\n\nbenefits of policy periods preceding the sale of Thermos.\n\n               For the purpose of the present disputes, it is critical\n\nto understand just how pre-sale policy periods could have post-sale\n\nconsequences. Liberty Mutual insured Household for the years 1984-\n\n1988.1    The insurance covered three lines--workers' compensation,\n\ngeneral liability and automobile claims–-each covered by a separate\n\npolicy.    Each policy covered a one-year period (e.g., one policy\n\nprovided       automobile   coverage     for    1984)   and   each    policy   was\n\noccurrence-based,       meaning   that    it    insured    against    losses   for\n\noccurrences in one policy year regardless of the time of claim.\n\nSubject to limitations periods, claims might easily be made long\n\nafter the policy year.\n\n               The premiums for each policy consisted of two elements.\n\nThe first is known as the initial premium, which is a projected\n\namount determined in advance of the policy year and based on\n\ninformation submitted by Household to Liberty.                       This initial\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The policies were formally issued to a subsidiary of\nHousehold, and Household and all Household subsidiaries were listed\nas named insureds, but this detail can be disregarded.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fpremium is paid to Liberty in installments over five years, and\n\nthese installments are known as deferred premiums.\n\n            The second element consists of \"retrospective premium\n\nadjustments,\" known as retros, which are adjustments to the initial\n\npremium amount based on actual claims experience.                Retros are\n\nassessed annually, beginning approximately twenty months after the\n\npolicy period expires.     For example, the 1984 automobile policy,\n\nalthough covering only accidents occurring in 1984, may result in\n\nretros in 1987, 1988, and so on.              Because the actual claims\n\nexperience can (indeed probably will) diverge from the initial\n\nprojection, retros can result in either credits (refunds from\n\nLiberty to Household) or debits (further payments by Household to\n\nLiberty).     Either way, retros do not alter the obligation to\n\ncomplete the deferred payments of the initial premium.\n\n            Thus, one set of issues posed by the sale concerned post-\n\nsale responsibility--as between Household and Nippon--for amounts\n\nowed or coming due as a result of policies covering the pre-sale\n\nyears.   These issues included (1) who was responsible for paying\n\ndeferred premiums still unpaid at the time of sale, and (2) who\n\nwould pay retro debits and/or benefit from retro credits as actual\n\nclaims experience generated new retros.\n\n            To the extent that Nippon was responsible for any of\n\nthese payments,    a   second   set    of   issues   concerned   the   proper\n\nallocation of Thermos's proportionate share as between it and\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fHousehold.   Before the sale each single policy covered a number of\n\nHousehold businesses, including operations that were retained by\n\nHousehold    or   otherwise   disposed   of   under   the   plan   of\n\nreorganization.    Prior to Household's 1989 reorganization, it\n\ninternally allocated retros to each profit center, including the\n\nThermos operations; it made the internal allocation according to a\n\nmethod known as the \"traditional method.\"\n\n             The purchase agreement explicitly addresses retros and\n\nthe allocation of retros between Thermos and other Household units;\n\nbut the provisions are more usefully described in conjunction with\n\nthe analysis of legal issues later in this decision.    See purchase\n\nagreement § 5.10(b).   In addition, the purchase agreement contains\n\na representation by Household that, while arguably unclear in its\n\nliteral language,2 both sides now treat as warranting that the\n\ninitial premium (including deferred installments) due Liberty for\n\nthe pre-sale policy years had already been paid.       The agreement\n\nalso contains an indemnification clause: section 9.2 obligated\n\nHousehold to indemnify Nippon against \"all Losses and Claims based\n\nupon, arising out of, or resulting from . . . any failure of\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      \"All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums\nwith respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the\nClosing Date have been paid . . . . Such policies are sufficient\nfor compliance with all requirements of law . . . and will remain\nin full force and effect through the respective dates set forth in\nSchedule 3.12 without the payment of additional premiums.\"\nPurchase agreement § 3.12.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f[Household] to perform in all material respects [its] obligation\n\nunder [the purchase agreement].\"\n\n          After   the   sale   of   Thermos,     Household   continued   to\n\nprovide, for a fee, certain administrative services with respect to\n\nthe insurance policies written by Liberty.         Household apportioned\n\nto Nippon a share of the credit and debit retros, and it also\n\nbilled Nippon for a portion of the deferred premiums; all of these\n\napportionments were done according to the traditional method.\n\nNippon paid the assessments, including about $1.6 million in\n\ndeferred premiums, until around March 1992 when Household, taking\n\nthe view that Nippon should pay Liberty directly for deferred\n\npremiums and retro debits, tired of this middleman function and\n\nstopped paying Liberty on Nippon's behalf.\n\n          Liberty then sued Household in the federal district court\n\nin Massachusetts in May 1992.        Roughly at the same time, Nippon\n\nstopped reimbursing Household for retros and deferred premiums.\n\nHousehold reacted by suing Nippon in state court in Illinois.            The\n\ntwo actions were effectively consolidated in the district court\n\nlitigation when Liberty added Nippon as a defendant in the Liberty-\n\nHousehold suit and the two defendants--Household and Nippon--filed\n\ncross claims against each other.          The parties agree that Illinois\n\nlaw supplies the substantive rules of decision.\n\n          In September 1997, after a two-week bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court issued a decision on a set of issues between\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fHousehold and Nippon.          Among other rulings, it determined that\n\nHousehold rather than Nippon was liable for all of the deferred\n\npremiums and owed Nippon $1.6 million in restitution; that as to\n\nthe   allocation   of     retros,    Household       had     improperly        used     the\n\ntraditional     method    instead     of    the     so-called         \"share      formula\"\n\nprovided in the purchase agreement; that the allocation of debits\n\nand credits should be computed for each policy individually; and,\n\nfinally, that Household did not owe Nippon attorneys' fees under\n\nthe indemnification clause.\n\n           In   March     1999,     the    district        court      made    additional\n\npertinent rulings. Most important, it decided that under the terms\n\nof the purchase agreement, Nippon had an obligation to pay retro\n\ndebits but did not have a right to receive retro credits which\n\ninstead accrued to Household's benefit.                The court also rejected\n\nNippon's   claim   for     prejudgment          interest    on     the     $1.6    million\n\nrestitution of deferred premiums that Household had mistakenly\n\ncollected from Nippon.            The court also declined to reconsider\n\nearlier rulings.         A final judgment was entered after Liberty and\n\nHousehold settled the disputes between them.\n\n           Nippon has now appealed, making three claims: first, that\n\nas to retros, it is entitled as to each policy to offset debits\n\nagainst credits and also to retain any net credits; second, that it\n\nis entitled to prejudgment interest on the $1.6 million in deferred\n\npremiums   restored      to   it;   and    third,     that       it   is     entitled    to\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fattorneys' fees and other litigation expenses.               Our review is de\n\nnovo as to questions of law and for clear error as to fact-findings\n\nby the district court.       Fed. R. Civ. P. 52; Principal Mut. Life\n\nIns. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc., 233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Credits and Debits. The trickiest question is the offset\n\nof credits against debits and retention of net credits.                    Recall\n\nthat an individual policy (say, automobile coverage for accidents\n\noccurring    in   1984)   will   likely    result   in   a   series   of    retro\n\nadjustments in each later year as claims are made; for one later\n\nyear, this might be a debit obligating Household or Thermos to pay\n\nLiberty a further premium adjustment and for the next year it might\n\nbe a credit resulting in a refund by Liberty.            Nippon concedes that\n\nit is responsible under the purchase agreement for debits, but it\n\nwants to be able, as to any policy, to reduce debits owed to\n\nLiberty by credits from years when Liberty must make refunds (and\n\nalso to retain any net credits).\n\n            The   district   court   decided    this     issue   in   favor    of\n\nHousehold.    It pointed out that in section 5.10(b), the purchase\n\nagreement provides that Nippon would pay outright (or reimburse\n\nHousehold) its defined \"share\" of \"any self retention or deductible\n\n(including . . . any retrospectively-rated premium adjustments\n\n[i.e., retros]),\" subject to a proviso that Nippon is obligated to\n\npay to Household \"no more than the self retention or deductible\n\namounts\" actually paid by Household to Liberty.              The court pointed\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fout that Nippon is the only one required to \"pay or bear\" and that\n\nnothing in this agreement, or elsewhere, said that retro credits\n\nshould accrue to Nippon.\n\n             On this issue the purchase agreement is hardly a model\n\nof lucidity-–the price of drafting a complex document over a\n\nweekend–-but we broaden the focus and come to a different result.\n\nThe language stressed by the district court comes from only one\n\npart of the section governing insurance.         Even taken by itself,\n\nsubsection (b) of section 5.10 inflicts on Nippon Sanso K.K.\n\nliability   for   \"any   retrospectively-rated   premium   adjustments\"\n\nattributable to Thermos; and because such adjustments can include\n\ncredits as well as debits, this language does not clearly indicate\n\nthat Nippon is liable for debits but Household keeps all the\n\ncredits.    One could equally well urge that Nippon is responsible\n\nfor any net obligation to Liberty under each policy.\n\n            Recognizing that the contract does not deal expressly\n\nwith \"credits\" (or \"debits\" for that matter), our obligation is to\n\ntake the relevant insurance provisions as a whole and give them a\n\nsensible reading in light of their language and the discerned\n\npurpose of the parties.     See, e.g., Shelton v. Andres, 478 N.E.2d\n\n311, 314 (Ill. 1985); 2 Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts,\n\n§ 7.10, at 276-77 (2d ed. 1998).    Of course, if there were precise\n\ncontract language on point, that would govern; but, failing that\n\nand also lacking here any extrinsic evidence that the parties\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fexplicitly discussed the debit/credit issue and arrived at a\n\nsolution, we must interpolate.          Whether the result is an actual\n\nrendition of what the parties agreed or what reasonable parties in\n\nthat position would have intended is often a blurred distinction.\n\nSee id. §§ 7.9, 7.11, at 273-74, 280.\n\n            Here, subsection (b) is part of a broader whole–-section\n\n5.10–-intended to address a peculiar problem posed by a number of\n\nelements: that Household's individual policies each covered both\n\nThermos    and   other   companies    that   were   retained   or   otherwise\n\ndisposed of by Household; that claimants could be litigating or\n\neven bringing new claims after the sale but for pre-sale events;\n\nand that retrospective adjustments of the premiums for pre-sale\n\npolicy years could and probably would occur after the sale.             Thus,\n\nthe simple carrying over of existing insurer-insured relations that\n\nwould exist where a sold or spun-off company simply carried its own\n\ninsurance and took the policy with it could not work in this\n\ninstance.\n\n            The purchase agreement starts in section 5.10(a) with the\n\npremise that the policies for pre-sale years were contracts between\n\nLiberty and Household and \"have not been assigned to\" Nippon Sanso\n\nK.K. or Thermos.    See also purchase agreement § 5.10(d).          Then, the\n\nsame subsection provides in substance that Household will assist\n\nNippon in \"pursuing any rights\" that Thermos might have under the\n\npolicies    covering     claims      pertaining     to   Thermos'    pre-sale\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\foperations, including the right (so far as the insurer permitted)\n\nto claim directly against the insurer and \"to receive directly any\n\nrecoveries thereunder.\" Subsection (c) provides inter alia that if\n\ninstead Household gets the money, it shall pay the money over to\n\nNippon.\n\n            Of course, in exchange, Household understandably wanted\n\nNippon to be responsible for additional payments required for\n\ncoverage as to Thermos since Nippon was receiving the benefit of\n\nthe protection as to Thermos.             Thus, having given Nippon rights\n\nunder subsections (a), (c), and (d), subsection (b) of the same\n\nsection is devoted to protecting Household by providing that Nippon\n\nwill reimburse Household for its expenses in relation to the\n\ninsurance   coverage    for     Thermos    and    that     Nippon       will   bear   or\n\nreimburse Household for Thermos' \"share\" of retro adjustments.\n\nThere is more detail but this is the thrust of the provision.3\n\n            Against    this   background,        we    hold      that   the    purchase\n\nagreement   gives     Nippon,    in   relation        to   the    coverage      Liberty\n\nprovided Thermos, the benefit of retro credits as well as the\n\nliability for retro debits under each individual policy.                       Although\n\nsubsection (b) is phrased to provide protection for Household, it\n\n\n     3\n      The final proviso of section 5.10(b), earlier mentioned,\nmakes clear that Nippon's liability to Household for \"self\nretention\" amounts–-e.g., retro debits owed to Liberty–-will be \"no\nmore than\" Household's payments to Liberty for Thermos coverage.\nNippon relies upon this language to show that debits should be\nreduced by credits, but that argument is not necessary to our own\nanalysis.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fis part of the larger scheme of section 5.10 that aims to make\n\nNippon bear the costs and get the benefits of the policies with\n\nrespect to Thermos.     Those benefits include retro credits as well\n\nas the insurer's reimbursements for third-party claims exceeding\n\ndeductibles;    this   might   even    be    implied   by    the   reference   in\n\nsubsection (a) to Thermos' \"rights\" under the policies.\n\n            Further, as to every policy each later year will generate\n\na separate credit or debit (or occasionally zero) depending on how\n\nfar new claims experience indicates that the initial premium\n\noverestimated (for credits) or underestimated (for debits) the risk\n\nof claims.    Each retro, whether paid to or received from Liberty,\n\nis only a further refinement designed to make the ultimate premium\n\nfor   the   policy   year   more   closely     match   the    ultimate   claims\n\nexperience.    To impose liability on Nippon for debits but to say\n\nthat Household keeps the credits is an improbable arrangement and\n\ninvites bizarre results.4\n\n             Given the structure of the insurance provisions, one\n\nmight think that Nippon should also bear the cost of the initial\n\npremium, an impression reinforced (wrongly, for deferral is merely\n\n\n\n      4\n      The easiest example is to imagine two different \"experience\"\nyears, say, 1987 and 1988, pertaining to the 1984 automobile\npolicy. On Household's reading, it would keep a credit of $10\ngenerated in 1987 and Nippon would pay a debit of $10 generated in\n1988; and yet if the underlying claims had come in a different\norder, so that each year alone generated a zero adjustment, neither\ncompany would pay (or receive refunds).      In both examples, of\ncourse, Liberty's position remains the same.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fa financing mechanism) by the fact that the initial premium is paid\n\nover five years.    Having chosen not to appeal the district court's\n\ncontrary ruling, Household cannot now dispute that it, rather than\n\nNippon, is responsible for the initial premium.    Rather, Household\n\nargues in the converse that, because it bears the initial premium,\n\nit should also get the benefit of retro credits, which could be\n\nviewed as a partial return of the premium that it has already paid\n\nor is paying.\n\n          To this there are two answers.         The first is that\n\nHousehold itself already benefitted from the initial premium,\n\nbecause that premium allowed Thermos to be covered in the years\n\nwhen it was still owned by Household.     Second, while Nippon also\n\nbenefits from the initial premium because these are occurrence-\n\nbased policies, whatever implicit obligation (based on the logic of\n\nsection 5.10) might otherwise be imputed to Nippon to share in the\n\ninitial premium is explicitly negated elsewhere: in the separate\n\nwarranty provision of the contract, Household itself warranted\n\n(inaccurately) that the deferred premiums had been paid in full.\n\nPurchase agreement § 3.12.     Thus any benefit Nippon got from the\n\ndischarge of the deferred premiums was bargained for and presumably\n\nreflected in the purchase price.\n\n          As it happens, although we do not rely upon this fact,\n\nHousehold's initial practice after the sale tends to bear out our\n\nunderstanding.     While Household continued to act as middleman, it\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fcharged Thermos for any deferred premiums that Household had paid\n\nin   respect   of   Thermos'   coverage   (apparently   unaware   of   its\n\nwarranty), but it also gave Nippon retro credits.       When tripped up\n\nas to the former error by discovery of the warranty, Household\n\nsought to recoup by claiming entitlement to the credits.          But the\n\ncredits, in our view, are properly paired with the debits under the\n\ninsurance provision of the contract, and Household's obligation as\n\nto deferred premiums stems from its own explicit warranty.\n\n           Prejudgment Interest.     As already noted, Household had\n\nbilled Nippon for deferred portions of the initial premium due to\n\nLiberty.   Nippon has now been awarded judgment against Household\n\nfor about $1.6 million in these deferred premiums. In the district\n\ncourt, Household argued that, at the time of the reorganization and\n\nbefore the sale, Thermos had assumed liability for the deferred\n\npayments under the pertinent A&A agreement.       In its 1997 decision,\n\nthe district court said that the A&A agreement was silent and,\n\nnoting that the purchase agreement warranted that all premiums had\n\nbeen paid as of the date of closing, ruled that this obligation\n\nremained with Household.\n\n           The merits of the ruling are not before us because\n\nHousehold has not appealed it.       Instead, it is Nippon who claims\n\nthat the district court erred in failing also to award prejudgment\n\ninterest on the refunded premiums, which interest (Nippon says) now\n\namounts to approximately $1 million.       Nippon relies primarily upon\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthe indemnification provision of the purchase agreement insuring\n\nNippon against all losses due to Household's breach of the purchase\n\nagreement.    Nippon regards the time-value of the $1.6 million as a\n\nloss inflicted by Household's wrongful billing of the $1.6 million\n\nto Nippon, and section 1.11A of the purchase agreement defines loss\n\nto include lost \"interest.\"\n\n          The difficulty with Nippon's indemnification theory is\n\nthat the purchase agreement contains a non-survival clause with\n\nrespect to warranties, which clause provides that the warranties\n\nterminated as of the closing and \"cease[ed] to be of further force\n\nand effect\"--save warranties specifically enumerated.           Purchase\n\nagreement § 9.1.    The \"premiums paid\" warranty was not among those\n\npreserved as a basis for post-closing liability.           To treat the\n\nimproper billing (post-closing) by Household of deferred premiums\n\nas   itself    a   breach   of   the     warranty   and   as   triggering\n\nindemnification appears to contradict the no-survival provision.5\n\nMoreover, the indemnification provision upon which Nippon relies\n\nlists the warranties for which indemnification is available, and\n\nagain the \"premiums paid\" warranty is not among the ones named as\n\neligible. Purchase agreement §§ 3.12, 9.2(a)(ii).\n\n\n     5\n      This does not mean that the district court was wrong in\nconsidering the warranty when it concluded that the purchase\nagreement did not transfer to Nippon Household's pre-existing\nresponsibility to pay deferred premiums. Our own intuition is the\nsame as the district court's, namely, that the warranty could not\nbe a basis for recovery but could still cast light on what other\ncontractual provisions did or did not do.\n\n                                  -15-\n\f          Nippon argues that the charging of deferred premiums also\n\nviolated a different provision of the purchase agreement, namely,\n\nsection 5.10(b) which obligates Household to charge Nippon its\n\nshare of the retros and–-implicitly, according to Nippon–-nothing\n\nmore.   We agree with the district court that the retro share\n\nformula simply \"does not apply\" to responsibility for initial\n\npremiums, whether deferred or otherwise.   Indeed, Nippon's opening\n\nbrief said that Household's improper charging of deferred premiums\n\nis \"a violation of the contract that had nothing to do with retro\n\nshare calculations.\"    In any event, Nippon's argument, not made in\n\nthe opening brief but only in the reply, is waived.       Keeler v.\n\nPutnam Fiduciary Trust Co., 238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Once past the indemnification clause, whether prejudgment\n\ninterest should be awarded is, under Illinois law, left to the\n\ndiscretion of the judge.     In re Wernick, 535 N.E.2d 876, 887-89\n\n(Ill. 1989).   The underlying award of $1.6 million rested upon a\n\nrestitution theory–-that the liability for deferred premiums was\n\nthat of Household, had not been shifted from it, and had been\n\nmistakenly billed to Nippon–-but the district court also found that\n\nthis was not a bad faith error nor one equitably warranting\n\nprejudgment interest.\n\n          In the district court, Nippon urged that it was entitled\n\nto prejudgment interest on equitable grounds as well as under the\n\nindemnification clause.      In this court, Nippon has seemingly\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fabandoned any challenge to the district court's rejection of this\n\nequitable argument.    At least it fails to develop it in any serious\n\nway, which leads to the same result.      See Prisma Zona Exploratoria\n\nde Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Calderon, 310 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Attorneys' Fees & Litigation Expenses.            Nippon also\n\nsought attorneys' fees and litigation expenses in the district\n\ncourt.    Attorneys' fees and costs are included as compensable loss\n\nunder the purchase agreement's indemnification provision so far as\n\nthey are \"based upon, arising out of, or resulting from . . .             any\n\nfailure of [Household] to perform in all material respects [its]\n\nobligations.\"    Purchase agreement § 9.2; see also id. § 1.11A.          We\n\nhave already noted that the billing of the deferred premiums,\n\nalthough mistaken and requiring restitution, was not a breach of\n\nthe purchase agreement except as to the expired warranty; and thus\n\nNippon cannot be reimbursed for attorneys' fees for that breach.\n\n            However,   Nippon   also   seeks   attorneys'    fees   for    a\n\ndifferent breach of the agreement:         Household's breach of the\n\nprovision governing allocation of retros as between Nippon and\n\nother business covered by the same policies.        The district court\n\nruled that there was such a breach by Household because, as already\n\nnoted, it made allocations of retros based on its traditional\n\nmethod.    In doing so, Household ignored an explicit provision of\n\nthe agreement that specified the so-called \"share formula\" for\n\nallocating retros.     Purchase agreement § 5.10(b).        The details of\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fthe dispute    need    not    be   described       because     Household      has    not\n\nappealed from the district court's finding of violation; but\n\nHousehold    does    defend    against      Nippon's        claim     that    Nippon's\n\nattorneys' fees should be paid.\n\n            The district court refused to award Nippon attorneys'\n\nfees,   conceding     that    Household         had    breached      the   allocation\n\nprovision but saying that \"no damages [in the form of attorney's\n\nfees] resulted from this breach.\"               The district court's reasoning\n\nwas as follows:\n\n                   However, Nippon Sanso and Thermos are\n            not entitled to litigation costs and expenses\n            under section 9.2 because their losses did not\n            result from [Household's] breach.     Even if\n            [Household] had attempted to calculate Nippon\n            Sanso's share under section 5.10(b) from the\n            outset, this litigation would have proceeded\n            in the same way with the same expenses. The\n            primary focus of phase I of this case has been\n            the definition of the share percentage and its\n            application, as to which the parties simply\n            had    very     different    interpretations.\n            Therefore, [Household's] breach of section\n            5.10 did not cause this litigation nor its\n            cost.\n\n            This critique does not fully answer Nippon's claim.\n\nLitigation may have been inevitable because the parties disagreed\n\nabout varying       provisions     and    could       not   settle   the     case;   but\n\nHousehold    was    responsible      for        conduct     violating      the   share\n\nallocation formula and the litigation embraced that issue.                       To the\n\nextent that Nippon incurred attorneys' fees to resolve the share\n\nallocation issue, there is no obvious reason why they should not\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fconstitute losses due to Household's breach, whether the breach and\n\nthe litigation were inevitable or not.   The indemnification clause\n\ndoes not make Household's bad faith or equities in favor of Nippon\n\na condition of Nippon's recovery.\n\n          Of course, this does not make Household liable for\n\nNippon's litigation expenses in resolving other disputed issues and\n\nthe allocation error may have been a very small part of litigation\n\nthat has spanned over ten years.   Household argues that early on it\n\nconceded its breach in using the traditional method, suggesting\n\nthat Nippon's expenses on this issue were slight or unnecessary;\n\nbut Nippon points to some evidence to the contrary and the district\n\ncourt made no findings on this point.      On remand, the district\n\ncourt must decide what portion, if any, of Nippon's reasonable\n\nlitigation costs as to the allocation issue is over and above what\n\nit would have incurred anyway because of disputes on other issues.\n\n          Further, Nippon argues that the dispute was not limited\n\nto the question of whether the traditional method or the share\n\nformula of allocation should be used; Nippon says that litigation\n\nwas required to settle a dispute concerning, inter alia, the proper\n\nnumerator to be used in implementing the share formula.        That\n\ndispute was itself settled by the district court in Nippon's favor,\n\nso Nippon claims that its attorneys' fees as to this issue are also\n\ncovered by the indemnification clause.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f          Since Household apparently did not use the share formula\n\nat all, arguably this interpretive dispute, even though entailing\n\nlitigation,   may   not   be   a   breach   of   the   purchase   agreement\n\nwarranting indemnification; yet on the other hand if Household's\n\ninterpretation of the formula in the litigation below did not\n\nconform to the requirements of the contract, then perhaps that\n\nmisinterpretation would have been breach and indemnification would\n\nbe due.   But these wrinkles are for the parties and the district\n\ncourt on remand.\n\n          This case is about money, but only money, and should have\n\nbeen settled (each party being right on some part of the case)\n\nearly in the district court process.          The cost of not settling,\n\nwhich both sides now bear, is attorneys' fees incurred over many\n\nyears-–most of them beyond any claim of reimbursement--and the\n\ncontinuing distraction of busy executives.         We have been forced to\n\nremand on one narrow issue which in the nature of things is not\n\nsusceptible to a perfect answer.            Before more of the district\n\ncourt's time is consumed in this endeavor, counsel ought to call\n\ntheir principals' attention to the cost and settle what remains.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed as to the\n\ndenial of prejudgment interest and the denial of attorneys' fees\n\nattributable to Household's mistaken billing of deferred premiums,\n\nreversed as to the refusal to assign retro credits to Nippon\n\nalthough without disturbing the prior ruling that the allocation of\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fretros should be calculated separately as to each policy, vacated\n\nas to the denial of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses on the\n\nshare allocation issue, and remanded for proceedings consistent\n\nwith this decision.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -21-\n\f                                   APPENDIX\n\n           Section 1.11A.          \"Loss\" shall mean any loss, damage,\n\nliability cost and expense, including, without limitation, any\n\ninterest, fine, court cost, reasonable investigation cost, penalty\n\nand   attorneys'   and    expert    witnesses'      fees,    disbursements    and\n\nexpenses, subtracting from any Loss any insurance proceeds actually\n\nreceived by any person or entity incurring a Loss.\n\n           Section 3.12.

It involves liabilities pertaining to insurance coverage provided by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and an affiliate (jointly \"Liberty\"). There is now little factual dispute but the contractual provisions (reprinted, in pertinent part, in an appendix to this opinion) are complex. We begin with a summary description of the background and procedural progress of the case, reserving detail for discussion of the several remaining disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1989, Household International, Inc. (\"Household\"), decided to divest certain assets, either in spin-offs to shareholders or through outright sales to third parties. The Thermos Company (\"Thermos\") was one of the subsidiaries formed as part of Household's reorganization plan, and various assets and liabilities from the rest of Household were transferred to Thermos through a series of assignment and assumption agreements (\"A &amp; A agreements\"). In June 1989, after an intensive weekend negotiation, Household entered into a 139-page purchase agreement (\"purchase agreement\"), to sell Thermos to Nippon Sanso K.K. in a cash-for-share transaction for $134 million (the latter two entities collectively \"Nippon\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchase agreement had to be completed quickly, yet the underlying insurance policies &#8212; themselves only one aspect of the purchase &#8212; were complex and covered a number of Household companies including Thermos. Negotiations were conducted under threat of a scheduled auction of Thermos by Household, and apparently the negotiators lacked first-hand knowledge of the insurance policies. Nevertheless, the purchase agreement made quite specific arrangements to allocate the still-open burdens and benefits of policy periods preceding the sale of Thermos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of the present disputes, it is critical to understand just how presale policy periods could have post-sale consequences. Liberty Mutual insured Household for the years 1984-1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The insurance covered three lines &#8212; workers' compensation, general liability and automobile claims &#8212; each covered by a separate policy. Each policy covered a one-year period (<i>e.g.,</i> one policy provided automobile coverage for 1984) and each policy was occurrence-based, meaning that it insured against losses for occurrences in one policy year regardless of the time of claim. Subject to limitations periods, claims might easily be made long after the policy year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premiums for each policy consisted of two elements. The first is known as the <i>initial premium,</i> which is a projected amount determined in advance of the policy year and based on information submitted by Household to Liberty. This initial premium is paid to Liberty in installments over five years, and these installments are known as <i>deferred premiums.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element consists of \"retrospective premium adjustments,\" known as <i>retros,</i> which are adjustments to the initial premium amount based on actual claims experience. Retros are assessed annually, beginning approximately twenty months after the policy period expires. For example, the 1984 automobile policy, although covering only accidents occurring in 1984, may result in retros in 1987, 1988, and so on. Because the actual claims experience can (indeed probably will) diverge from the initial projection, retros can result in either credits (refunds from Liberty to Household) or debits (further payments by Household to Liberty). Either way, retros do not alter the obligation to complete the deferred payments of the initial premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, one set of issues posed by the sale concerned post-sale responsibility &#8212; as between Household and Nippon &#8212; for amounts owed or coming due as a result of policies covering the pre-sale years. These issues included (1) who was responsible for paying deferred premiums still unpaid at the time of sale, and (2) who would pay retro debits and/or benefit from retro credits as actual claims experience generated new retros.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Nippon was responsible for any of these payments, a second set of issues concerned the proper allocation of Thermos's proportionate share as between it and Household. Before the sale each <i>single</i> policy covered a number of Household businesses, including operations that were retained by Household or otherwise disposed of under the plan of reorganization. Prior to Household's 1989 reorganization, it internally allocated retros to each profit center, including the Thermos operations; it made the internal allocation according to a method known as the \"traditional method.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchase agreement explicitly addresses retros and the allocation of retros between Thermos and other Household units; but the provisions are more usefully described in conjunction with the analysis of legal issues later in this decision. <i>See</i> purchase agreement &#167; 5.10(b). In addition, the purchase agreement contains a representation by Household that, while arguably unclear in its literal language,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> both sides now treat as warranting that the initial premium (including deferred installments) due Liberty for the pre-sale policy years had already been paid. The agreement also contains an indemnification clause: section 9.2 obligated Household to indemnify Nippon against \"all Losses and Claims based upon, arising out of, or resulting from ... any failure of [Household] to perform in all material respects [its] obligation under [the purchase agreement].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the sale of Thermos, Household continued to provide, for a fee, certain administrative services with respect to the insurance policies written by Liberty. Household apportioned to Nippon a share of the credit and debit retros, and it also billed Nippon for a portion of the deferred premiums; all of these apportionments were done according to the traditional method. Nippon paid the assessments, including about $1.6 million in deferred premiums, until around March 1992 when Household, taking the view that Nippon should pay Liberty directly for deferred premiums and retro debits, tired of this middleman function and stopped paying Liberty on Nippon's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty then sued Household in the federal district court in Massachusetts in May 1992. Roughly at the same time, Nippon stopped reimbursing Household for retros and deferred premiums. Household reacted by suing Nippon in state court in Illinois. The two actions were effectively consolidated in the district court litigation when Liberty added Nippon as a defendant in the Liberty-Household suit and the two defendants &#8212; Household and Nippon &#8212; filed cross claims against each other. The parties agree that Illinois law supplies the substantive rules of decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, after a two-week bench trial, the district court issued a decision on a set of issues between Household and Nippon. Among other rulings, it determined that Household rather than Nippon was liable for all of the deferred premiums and owed Nippon $1.6 million in restitution; that as to the allocation of retros, Household had improperly used the traditional method instead of the so-called \"share formula\" provided in the purchase agreement; that the allocation of debits and credits should be computed for each policy individually; and, finally, that Household did not owe Nippon attorneys' fees under the indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, the district court made additional pertinent rulings. Most important, it decided that under the terms of the purchase agreement, Nippon had an obligation to pay retro debits but did not have a right to receive retro credits which instead accrued to Household's benefit. The court also rejected Nippon's claim for prejudgment interest on the $1.6 million restitution of deferred premiums that Household had mistakenly collected from Nippon. The court also declined to reconsider earlier rulings. A final judgment was entered after Liberty and Household settled the disputes between them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nippon has now appealed, making three claims: first, that as to retros, it is entitled as to each policy to offset debits against credits and also to retain any net credits; second, that it is entitled to prejudgment interest on the $1.6 million in deferred premiums restored to it; and third, that it is entitled to attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses. Our review is <i>de novo</i> as to questions of law and for clear error as to fact-findings by the district court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52; <i>Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc.,</i> 233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Credits and Debits.</i> The trickiest question is the offset of credits against debits and retention of net credits. Recall that an individual policy (say, automobile coverage for accidents occurring in 1984) will likely result in a series of retro adjustments in each later year as claims are made; for one later year, this might be a debit obligating Household or Thermos to pay Liberty a further premium adjustment and for the next year it might be a credit resulting in a refund by Liberty. Nippon concedes that it is responsible under the purchase agreement for debits, but it wants to be able, as to any policy, to reduce debits owed to Liberty by credits from years when Liberty must make refunds (and also to retain any net credits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided this issue in favor of Household. It pointed out that in section 5.10(b), the purchase agreement provides that Nippon would pay outright (or reimburse Household) its defined \"share\" of \"any self retention or deductible (including ... any retrospectively-rated premium adjustments [<i>i.e.,</i> retros]),\" subject to a proviso that Nippon is obligated to pay to Household \"no more than the self retention or deductible amounts\" actually paid by Household to Liberty. The court pointed out that Nippon is the only one required to \"pay or bear\" and that nothing in this agreement, or elsewhere, said that retro credits should accrue to Nippon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue the purchase agreement is hardly a model of lucidity &#8212; the price of drafting a complex document over a weekend &#8212; but we broaden the focus and come to a different result. The language stressed by the district court comes from only one part of the section governing insurance. Even taken by itself, subsection (b) of section 5.10 inflicts on Nippon Sanso K.K. liability for \"any retrospectively-rated premium adjustments\" attributable to Thermos; and because such adjustments can include credits as well as debits, this language does not clearly indicate that Nippon is liable for debits but Household keeps all the credits. One could equally well urge that Nippon is responsible for any <i>net</i> obligation to Liberty under each policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that the contract does not deal expressly with \"credits\" (or \"debits\" for that matter), our obligation is to take the relevant insurance provisions as a whole and give them a sensible reading in light of their language and the discerned purpose of the parties. <i>See, e.g., Shelton v. Andres,</i> 106 Ill.2d 153, 87 Ill. Dec. 954, 478 N.E.2d 311, 314 (1985); 2 Farnsworth, <i>Farnsworth on Contracts,</i> &#167; 7.10, at 276-77 (2d ed.1998). Of course, if there were precise contract language on point, that would govern; but, failing that and also lacking here any extrinsic evidence that the parties explicitly discussed the debit/credit issue and arrived at a solution, we must interpolate. Whether the result is an actual rendition of what the parties agreed or what reasonable parties in that position would have intended is often a blurred distinction. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 7.9, 7.11, at 273-74, 280.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, subsection (b) is part of a broader whole &#8212; section 5.10 &#8212; intended to address a peculiar problem posed by a number of elements: that Household's individual policies each covered both Thermos and other companies that were retained or otherwise disposed of by Household; that claimants could be litigating or even bringing new claims after the sale but for pre-sale events; and that retrospective adjustments of the premiums for pre-sale policy years could and probably would occur after the sale. Thus, the simple carrying over of existing insurer-insured relations that would exist where a sold or spun-off company simply carried its own insurance and took the policy with it could not work in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchase agreement starts in section 5.10(a) with the premise that the policies for pre-sale years were contracts between Liberty and Household and \"have not been assigned to\" Nippon Sanso K.K. or Thermos. <i>See also</i> purchase agreement &#167; 5.10(d). Then, the same subsection provides in substance that Household will assist Nippon in \"pursuing any rights\" that Thermos might have under the policies covering claims pertaining to Thermos' pre-sale operations, including the right (so far as the insurer permitted) to claim directly against the insurer and \"to receive directly any recoveries thereunder.\" Subsection (c) provides <i>inter alia</i> that if instead Household gets the money, it shall pay the money over to Nippon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, in exchange, Household understandably wanted Nippon to be responsible for additional payments required for coverage as to Thermos since Nippon was receiving the benefit of the protection as to Thermos. Thus, having given Nippon rights under subsections (a), (c), and (d), subsection (b) of the same section is devoted to protecting Household by providing that Nippon will reimburse Household for its expenses in relation to the insurance coverage for Thermos and that Nippon will bear or reimburse Household for Thermos' \"share\" of retro adjustments. There is more detail but this is the thrust of the provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we hold that the purchase agreement gives Nippon, in relation to the coverage Liberty provided Thermos, the benefit of retro credits as well as the liability for retro debits under each individual policy. Although subsection (b) is phrased to provide protection for Household, it is part of the larger scheme of section 5.10 that aims to make Nippon bear the costs and get the benefits of the policies with respect to Thermos. Those benefits include retro credits as well as the insurer's reimbursements for third-party claims exceeding deductibles; this might even be implied by the reference in subsection (a) to Thermos' \"rights\" under the policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, as to every policy each later year will generate a separate credit or debit (or occasionally zero) depending on how far new claims experience indicates that the initial premium overestimated (for credits) or underestimated (for debits) the risk of claims. Each retro, whether paid to or received from Liberty, is only a further refinement designed to make the ultimate premium for the policy year more closely match the ultimate claims experience. To impose liability on Nippon for debits but to say that Household keeps the credits is an improbable arrangement and invites bizarre results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the structure of the insurance provisions, one might think that Nippon should also bear the cost of the initial premium, an impression reinforced (wrongly, for deferral is merely a financing mechanism) by the fact that the initial premium is paid over five years. Having chosen not to appeal the district court's contrary ruling, Household cannot now dispute that it, rather than Nippon, is responsible for the initial premium. Rather, Household argues in the converse that, because it bears the initial premium, it should also get the benefit of retro credits, which could be viewed as a partial return of the premium that it has already paid or is paying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this there are two answers. The first is that Household itself <i>already</i> benefitted from the initial premium, because that premium allowed Thermos to be covered in the years when it was still owned by Household. Second, while Nippon also benefits from the initial premium because these are occurrence-based policies, whatever implicit obligation (based on the logic of section 5.10) might otherwise be imputed to Nippon to share in the initial premium is explicitly negated elsewhere: in the separate warranty provision of the contract, Household itself warranted (inaccurately) that the deferred premiums had been paid in full. Purchase agreement &#167; 3.12. Thus any benefit Nippon got from the discharge of the deferred premiums was bargained for and presumably reflected in the purchase price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, although we do not rely upon this fact, Household's initial practice after the sale tends to bear out our understanding. While Household continued to act as middleman, it charged Thermos for any deferred premiums that Household had paid in respect of Thermos' coverage (apparently unaware of its warranty), but it also gave Nippon retro credits. When tripped up as to the former error by discovery of the warranty, Household sought to recoup by claiming entitlement to the credits. But the credits, in our view, are properly paired with the debits under the insurance provision of the contract, and Household's obligation as to deferred premiums stems from its own explicit warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Prejudgment Interest.</i> As already noted, Household had billed Nippon for deferred portions of the initial premium due to Liberty. Nippon has now been awarded judgment against Household for about $1.6 million in these deferred premiums. In the district court, Household argued that, at the time of the reorganization and before the sale, Thermos had assumed liability for the deferred payments under the pertinent A &amp; A agreement. In its 1997 decision, the district court said that the A &amp; A agreement was silent and, noting that the purchase agreement warranted that all premiums had been paid as of the date of closing, ruled that this obligation remained with Household.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the ruling are not before us because Household has not appealed it. Instead, it is Nippon who claims that the district court erred in failing also to award prejudgment interest on the refunded premiums, which interest (Nippon says) now amounts to approximately $1 million. Nippon relies primarily upon the indemnification provision of the purchase agreement insuring Nippon against all losses due to Household's breach of the purchase agreement. Nippon regards the time-value of the $1.6 million as a loss inflicted by Household's wrongful billing of the $1.6 million to Nippon, and section 1.11A of the purchase agreement defines loss to include lost \"interest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with Nippon's indemnification theory is that the purchase agreement contains a non-survival clause with respect to warranties, which clause provides that the warranties terminated as of the closing and \"cease[ed] to be of further force and effect\" &#8212; save warranties specifically enumerated. Purchase agreement &#167; 9.1. The \"premiums paid\" warranty was not among those preserved as a basis for post-closing liability. To treat the improper billing (post-closing) by Household of deferred premiums as itself a breach of the warranty and as triggering indemnification appears to contradict the no-survival provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, the indemnification provision upon which Nippon relies lists the warranties for which indemnification is available, and again the \"premiums paid\" warranty is not among the ones named as eligible. Purchase agreement &#167;&#167; 3.12, 9.2(a)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nippon argues that the charging of deferred premiums also violated a different provision of the purchase agreement, namely, section 5.10(b) which obligates Household to charge Nippon its share of the retros and &#8212; implicitly, according to Nippon &#8212; nothing more. We agree with the district court that the retro share formula simply \"does not apply\" to responsibility for initial premiums, whether deferred or otherwise. Indeed, Nippon's opening brief said that Household's improper charging of deferred premiums is \"a violation of the contract that had <i>nothing</i> to do with retro share calculations.\" In any event, Nippon's argument, not made in the opening brief but only in the reply, is waived. <i>Keeler v. Putnam Fiduciary Trust Co.,</i> 238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past the indemnification clause, whether prejudgment interest should be awarded is, under Illinois law, left to the discretion of the judge. <i>In re Wernick,</i> 127 Ill.2d 61, 129 Ill.Dec. 111, 535 N.E.2d 876, 887-89 (1989). The underlying award of $1.6 million rested upon a restitution theory &#8212; that the liability for deferred premiums was that of Household, had not been shifted from it, and had been mistakenly billed to Nippon &#8212; but the district court also found that this was not a bad faith error nor one equitably warranting prejudgment interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, Nippon urged that it was entitled to prejudgment interest on equitable grounds as well as under the indemnification clause. In this court, Nippon has seemingly abandoned any challenge to the district court's rejection of this equitable argument. At least it fails to develop it in any serious way, which leads to the same result. <i>See Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Calderon,</i> 310 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Attorneys' Fees &amp; Litigation Expenses.</i> Nippon also sought attorneys' fees and litigation expenses in the district court. Attorneys' fees and costs are included as compensable loss under the purchase agreement's indemnification provision so far as they are \"based upon, arising out of, or resulting from ... any failure of [Household] to perform in all material respects [its] obligations.\" Purchase agreement &#167; 9.2; <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 1.11A. We have already noted that the billing of the deferred premiums, although mistaken and requiring restitution, was not a breach of the purchase agreement except as to the expired warranty; and thus Nippon cannot be reimbursed for attorneys' fees for <i>that</i> breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Nippon also seeks attorneys' fees for a different breach of the agreement: Household's breach of the provision governing allocation of retros as between Nippon and other business covered by the same policies. The district court ruled that there was such a breach by Household because, as already noted, it made allocations of retros based on its traditional method. In doing so, Household ignored an explicit provision of the agreement that specified the so-called \"share formula\" for allocating retros. Purchase agreement &#167; 5.10(b). The details of the dispute need not be described because Household has not appealed from the district court's finding of violation; but Household does defend against Nippon's claim that Nippon's attorneys' fees should be paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to award Nippon attorneys' fees, conceding that Household had breached the allocation provision but saying that \"no damages [in the form of attorney's fees] resulted from this breach.\" The district court's reasoning was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Nippon Sanso and Thermos are not entitled to litigation costs and expenses under section 9.2 because their losses did not result from [Household's] breach. Even if [Household] had attempted to calculate Nippon Sanso's share under section 5.10(b) from the outset, this litigation would have proceeded in the same way with the same expenses. The primary focus of phase I of this case has been the definition of the share percentage and its application, as to which the parties simply had very different interpretations. Therefore, [Household's] breach of section 5.10 did not cause this litigation nor its cost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This critique does not fully answer Nippon's claim. Litigation may have been inevitable because the parties disagreed about varying provisions and could not settle the case; but Household was responsible for conduct violating the share allocation formula and the litigation embraced that issue. To the extent that Nippon incurred attorneys' fees to resolve the share allocation issue, there is no obvious reason why they should not constitute losses due to Household's breach, whether the breach and the litigation were inevitable or not. The indemnification clause does <i>not</i> make Household's bad faith or equities in favor of Nippon a condition of Nippon's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, this does not make Household liable for Nippon's litigation expenses in resolving other disputed issues and the allocation error may have been a very small part of litigation that has spanned over ten years. Household argues that early on it conceded its breach in using the traditional method, suggesting that Nippon's expenses on this issue were slight or unnecessary; but Nippon points to some evidence to the contrary and the district court made no findings on this point. On remand, the district court must decide what portion, if any, of Nippon's reasonable litigation costs as to the allocation issue is over and above what it would have incurred anyway because of disputes on other issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Nippon argues that the dispute was not limited to the question of whether the traditional method or the share formula of allocation should be used; Nippon says that litigation was required to settle a dispute concerning, <i>inter alia,</i> the proper numerator to be used in implementing the share formula. That dispute was itself settled by the district court in Nippon's favor, so Nippon claims that its attorneys' fees as to this issue are also covered by the indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Household apparently did not use the share formula at all, arguably this interpretive dispute, even though entailing litigation, may not be a breach of the purchase agreement warranting indemnification; yet on the other hand if Household's interpretation of the formula in the litigation below did not conform to the requirements of the contract, then perhaps <i>that</i> misinterpretation would have been breach and indemnification would be due. But these wrinkles are for the parties and the district court on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is about money, but only money, and should have been settled (each party being right on some part of the case) early in the district court process.

It involves liabilities pertaining to insurance coverage provided by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and an affiliate (jointly \"Liberty\"). There is now little factual dispute but the contractual provisions (reprinted, in pertinent part, in an appendix to this opinion) are complex. We begin with a summary description of the background and procedural progress of the case, reserving detail for discussion of the several remaining disputes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1989, Household International, Inc. (\"Household\"), decided to divest certain assets, either in spin-offs to shareholders or through outright sales to third parties. The Thermos Company (\"Thermos\") was one of the subsidiaries formed as part of Household's reorganization plan, and various assets and liabilities from the rest of Household were transferred to Thermos through a series of assignment and assumption agreements (\"A &amp; A agreements\"). In June 1989, after an intensive weekend negotiation, Household entered into a 139-page purchase agreement (\"purchase agreement\"), to sell Thermos to Nippon Sanso K.K. in a cash-for-share transaction for $134 million (the latter two entities collectively \"Nippon\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchase agreement had to be completed quickly, yet the underlying insurance policies &#8212; themselves only one aspect of the purchase &#8212; were complex and covered a number of Household companies including Thermos. Negotiations were conducted under threat of a scheduled auction of Thermos by Household, and apparently the negotiators lacked first-hand knowledge of the insurance policies. Nevertheless, the purchase agreement made quite specific arrangements to allocate the still-open burdens and benefits of policy periods preceding the sale of Thermos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of the present disputes, it is critical to understand just how presale policy periods could have post-sale consequences. Liberty Mutual insured Household for the years 1984-1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The insurance covered three lines &#8212; workers' compensation, general liability and automobile claims &#8212; each covered by a separate policy. Each policy covered a one-year period (<i>e.g.,</i> one policy provided automobile coverage for 1984) and each policy was occurrence-based, meaning that it insured against losses for occurrences in one policy year regardless of the time of claim. Subject to limitations periods, claims might easily be made long after the policy year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premiums for each policy consisted of two elements. The first is known as the <i>initial premium,</i> which is a projected amount determined in advance of the policy year and based on information submitted by Household to Liberty. This initial premium is paid to Liberty in installments over five years, and these installments are known as <i>deferred premiums.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element consists of \"retrospective premium adjustments,\" known as <i>retros,</i> which are adjustments to the initial premium amount based on actual claims experience. Retros are assessed annually, beginning approximately twenty months after the policy period expires. For example, the 1984 automobile policy, although covering only accidents occurring in 1984, may result in retros in 1987, 1988, and so on. Because the actual claims experience can (indeed probably will) diverge from the initial projection, retros can result in either credits (refunds from Liberty to Household) or debits (further payments by Household to Liberty). Either way, retros do not alter the obligation to complete the deferred payments of the initial premium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, one set of issues posed by the sale concerned post-sale responsibility &#8212; as between Household and Nippon &#8212; for amounts owed or coming due as a result of policies covering the pre-sale years. These issues included (1) who was responsible for paying deferred premiums still unpaid at the time of sale, and (2) who would pay retro debits and/or benefit from retro credits as actual claims experience generated new retros.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Nippon was responsible for any of these payments, a second set of issues concerned the proper allocation of Thermos's proportionate share as between it and Household. Before the sale each <i>single</i> policy covered a number of Household businesses, including operations that were retained by Household or otherwise disposed of under the plan of reorganization. Prior to Household's 1989 reorganization, it internally allocated retros to each profit center, including the Thermos operations; it made the internal allocation according to a method known as the \"traditional method.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchase agreement explicitly addresses retros and the allocation of retros between Thermos and other Household units; but the provisions are more usefully described in conjunction with the analysis of legal issues later in this decision. <i>See</i> purchase agreement &#167; 5.10(b). In addition, the purchase agreement contains a representation by Household that, while arguably unclear in its literal language,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> both sides now treat as warranting that the initial premium (including deferred installments) due Liberty for the pre-sale policy years had already been paid. The agreement also contains an indemnification clause: section 9.2 obligated Household to indemnify Nippon against \"all Losses and Claims based upon, arising out of, or resulting from ... any failure of [Household] to perform in all material respects [its] obligation under [the purchase agreement].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the sale of Thermos, Household continued to provide, for a fee, certain administrative services with respect to the insurance policies written by Liberty. Household apportioned to Nippon a share of the credit and debit retros, and it also billed Nippon for a portion of the deferred premiums; all of these apportionments were done according to the traditional method. Nippon paid the assessments, including about $1.6 million in deferred premiums, until around March 1992 when Household, taking the view that Nippon should pay Liberty directly for deferred premiums and retro debits, tired of this middleman function and stopped paying Liberty on Nippon's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liberty then sued Household in the federal district court in Massachusetts in May 1992. Roughly at the same time, Nippon stopped reimbursing Household for retros and deferred premiums. Household reacted by suing Nippon in state court in Illinois. The two actions were effectively consolidated in the district court litigation when Liberty added Nippon as a defendant in the Liberty-Household suit and the two defendants &#8212; Household and Nippon &#8212; filed cross claims against each other. The parties agree that Illinois law supplies the substantive rules of decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, after a two-week bench trial, the district court issued a decision on a set of issues between Household and Nippon. Among other rulings, it determined that Household rather than Nippon was liable for all of the deferred premiums and owed Nippon $1.6 million in restitution; that as to the allocation of retros, Household had improperly used the traditional method instead of the so-called \"share formula\" provided in the purchase agreement; that the allocation of debits and credits should be computed for each policy individually; and, finally, that Household did not owe Nippon attorneys' fees under the indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999, the district court made additional pertinent rulings. Most important, it decided that under the terms of the purchase agreement, Nippon had an obligation to pay retro debits but did not have a right to receive retro credits which instead accrued to Household's benefit. The court also rejected Nippon's claim for prejudgment interest on the $1.6 million restitution of deferred premiums that Household had mistakenly collected from Nippon. The court also declined to reconsider earlier rulings. A final judgment was entered after Liberty and Household settled the disputes between them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nippon has now appealed, making three claims: first, that as to retros, it is entitled as to each policy to offset debits against credits and also to retain any net credits; second, that it is entitled to prejudgment interest on the $1.6 million in deferred premiums restored to it; and third, that it is entitled to attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses. Our review is <i>de novo</i> as to questions of law and for clear error as to fact-findings by the district court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52; <i>Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199156\"><a href=\"/opinion/199156/principal-mutual-v-racal-datacom-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Credits and Debits.</i> The trickiest question is the offset of credits against debits and retention of net credits. Recall that an individual policy (say, automobile coverage for accidents occurring in 1984) will likely result in a series of retro adjustments in each later year as claims are made; for one later year, this might be a debit obligating Household or Thermos to pay Liberty a further premium adjustment and for the next year it might be a credit resulting in a refund by Liberty. Nippon concedes that it is responsible under the purchase agreement for debits, but it wants to be able, as to any policy, to reduce debits owed to Liberty by credits from years when Liberty must make refunds (and also to retain any net credits).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided this issue in favor of Household. It pointed out that in section 5.10(b), the purchase agreement provides that Nippon would pay outright (or reimburse Household) its defined \"share\" of \"any self retention or deductible (including ... any retrospectively-rated premium adjustments [<i>i.e.,</i> retros]),\" subject to a proviso that Nippon is obligated to pay to Household \"no more than the self retention or deductible amounts\" actually paid by Household to Liberty. The court pointed out that Nippon is the only one required to \"pay or bear\" and that nothing in this agreement, or elsewhere, said that retro credits should accrue to Nippon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue the purchase agreement is hardly a model of lucidity &#8212; the price of drafting a complex document over a weekend &#8212; but we broaden the focus and come to a different result. The language stressed by the district court comes from only one part of the section governing insurance. Even taken by itself, subsection (b) of section 5.10 inflicts on Nippon Sanso K.K. liability for \"any retrospectively-rated premium adjustments\" attributable to Thermos; and because such adjustments can include credits as well as debits, this language does not clearly indicate that Nippon is liable for debits but Household keeps all the credits. One could equally well urge that Nippon is responsible for any <i>net</i> obligation to Liberty under each policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that the contract does not deal expressly with \"credits\" (or \"debits\" for that matter), our obligation is to take the relevant insurance provisions as a whole and give them a sensible reading in light of their language and the discerned purpose of the parties. <i>See, e.g., Shelton v. Andres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248545\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248545/shelton-v-andres/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Of course, if there were precise contract language on point, that would govern; but, failing that and also lacking here any extrinsic evidence that the parties explicitly discussed the debit/credit issue and arrived at a solution, we must interpolate. Whether the result is an actual rendition of what the parties agreed or what reasonable parties in that position would have intended is often a blurred distinction. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 7.9, 7.11, at 273-74, 280.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, subsection (b) is part of a broader whole &#8212; section 5.10 &#8212; intended to address a peculiar problem posed by a number of elements: that Household's individual policies each covered both Thermos and other companies that were retained or otherwise disposed of by Household; that claimants could be litigating or even bringing new claims after the sale but for pre-sale events; and that retrospective adjustments of the premiums for pre-sale policy years could and probably would occur after the sale. Thus, the simple carrying over of existing insurer-insured relations that would exist where a sold or spun-off company simply carried its own insurance and took the policy with it could not work in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purchase agreement starts in section 5.10(a) with the premise that the policies for pre-sale years were contracts between Liberty and Household and \"have not been assigned to\" Nippon Sanso K.K. or Thermos. <i>See also</i> purchase agreement &#167; 5.10(d). Then, the same subsection provides in substance that Household will assist Nippon in \"pursuing any rights\" that Thermos might have under the policies covering claims pertaining to Thermos' pre-sale operations, including the right (so far as the insurer permitted) to claim directly against the insurer and \"to receive directly any recoveries thereunder.\" Subsection (c) provides <i>inter alia</i> that if instead Household gets the money, it shall pay the money over to Nippon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, in exchange, Household understandably wanted Nippon to be responsible for additional payments required for coverage as to Thermos since Nippon was receiving the benefit of the protection as to Thermos. Thus, having given Nippon rights under subsections (a), (c), and (d), subsection (b) of the same section is devoted to protecting Household by providing that Nippon will reimburse Household for its expenses in relation to the insurance coverage for Thermos and that Nippon will bear or reimburse Household for Thermos' \"share\" of retro adjustments. There is more detail but this is the thrust of the provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we hold that the purchase agreement gives Nippon, in relation to the coverage Liberty provided Thermos, the benefit of retro credits as well as the liability for retro debits under each individual policy. Although subsection (b) is phrased to provide protection for Household, it is part of the larger scheme of section 5.10 that aims to make Nippon bear the costs and get the benefits of the policies with respect to Thermos. Those benefits include retro credits as well as the insurer's reimbursements for third-party claims exceeding deductibles; this might even be implied by the reference in subsection (a) to Thermos' \"rights\" under the policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, as to every policy each later year will generate a separate credit or debit (or occasionally zero) depending on how far new claims experience indicates that the initial premium overestimated (for credits) or underestimated (for debits) the risk of claims. Each retro, whether paid to or received from Liberty, is only a further refinement designed to make the ultimate premium for the policy year more closely match the ultimate claims experience. To impose liability on Nippon for debits but to say that Household keeps the credits is an improbable arrangement and invites bizarre results.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the structure of the insurance provisions, one might think that Nippon should also bear the cost of the initial premium, an impression reinforced (wrongly, for deferral is merely a financing mechanism) by the fact that the initial premium is paid over five years. Having chosen not to appeal the district court's contrary ruling, Household cannot now dispute that it, rather than Nippon, is responsible for the initial premium. Rather, Household argues in the converse that, because it bears the initial premium, it should also get the benefit of retro credits, which could be viewed as a partial return of the premium that it has already paid or is paying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this there are two answers. The first is that Household itself <i>already</i> benefitted from the initial premium, because that premium allowed Thermos to be covered in the years when it was still owned by Household. Second, while Nippon also benefits from the initial premium because these are occurrence-based policies, whatever implicit obligation (based on the logic of section 5.10) might otherwise be imputed to Nippon to share in the initial premium is explicitly negated elsewhere: in the separate warranty provision of the contract, Household itself warranted (inaccurately) that the deferred premiums had been paid in full. Purchase agreement &#167; 3.12. Thus any benefit Nippon got from the discharge of the deferred premiums was bargained for and presumably reflected in the purchase price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, although we do not rely upon this fact, Household's initial practice after the sale tends to bear out our understanding. While Household continued to act as middleman, it charged Thermos for any deferred premiums that Household had paid in respect of Thermos' coverage (apparently unaware of its warranty), but it also gave Nippon retro credits. When tripped up as to the former error by discovery of the warranty, Household sought to recoup by claiming entitlement to the credits. But the credits, in our view, are properly paired with the debits under the insurance provision of the contract, and Household's obligation as to deferred premiums stems from its own explicit warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Prejudgment Interest.</i> As already noted, Household had billed Nippon for deferred portions of the initial premium due to Liberty. Nippon has now been awarded judgment against Household for about $1.6 million in these deferred premiums. In the district court, Household argued that, at the time of the reorganization and before the sale, Thermos had assumed liability for the deferred payments under the pertinent A &amp; A agreement. In its 1997 decision, the district court said that the A &amp; A agreement was silent and, noting that the purchase agreement warranted that all premiums had been paid as of the date of closing, ruled that this obligation remained with Household.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of the ruling are not before us because Household has not appealed it. Instead, it is Nippon who claims that the district court erred in failing also to award prejudgment interest on the refunded premiums, which interest (Nippon says) now amounts to approximately $1 million. Nippon relies primarily upon the indemnification provision of the purchase agreement insuring Nippon against all losses due to Household's breach of the purchase agreement. Nippon regards the time-value of the $1.6 million as a loss inflicted by Household's wrongful billing of the $1.6 million to Nippon, and section 1.11A of the purchase agreement defines loss to include lost \"interest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with Nippon's indemnification theory is that the purchase agreement contains a non-survival clause with respect to warranties, which clause provides that the warranties terminated as of the closing and \"cease[ed] to be of further force and effect\" &#8212; save warranties specifically enumerated. Purchase agreement &#167; 9.1. The \"premiums paid\" warranty was not among those preserved as a basis for post-closing liability. To treat the improper billing (post-closing) by Household of deferred premiums as itself a breach of the warranty and as triggering indemnification appears to contradict the no-survival provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, the indemnification provision upon which Nippon relies lists the warranties for which indemnification is available, and again the \"premiums paid\" warranty is not among the ones named as eligible. Purchase agreement &#167;&#167; 3.12, 9.2(a)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nippon argues that the charging of deferred premiums also violated a different provision of the purchase agreement, namely, section 5.10(b) which obligates Household to charge Nippon its share of the retros and &#8212; implicitly, according to Nippon &#8212; nothing more. We agree with the district court that the retro share formula simply \"does not apply\" to responsibility for initial premiums, whether deferred or otherwise. Indeed, Nippon's opening brief said that Household's improper charging of deferred premiums is \"a violation of the contract that had <i>nothing</i> to do with retro share calculations.\" In any event, Nippon's argument, not made in the opening brief but only in the reply, is waived. <i>Keeler v. Putnam Fiduciary Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199235\"><a href=\"/opinion/199235/keeler-v-putnam-fiduciary/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past the indemnification clause, whether prejudgment interest should be awarded is, under Illinois law, left to the discretion of the judge. <i>In re Wernick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2222312\"><a href=\"/opinion/2222312/in-re-estate-of-wernick/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

The underlying award of $1.6 million rested upon a restitution theory &#8212; that the liability for deferred premiums was that of Household, had not been shifted from it, and had been mistakenly billed to Nippon &#8212; but the district court also found that this was not a bad faith error nor one equitably warranting prejudgment interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, Nippon urged that it was entitled to prejudgment interest on equitable grounds as well as under the indemnification clause. In this court, Nippon has seemingly abandoned any challenge to the district court's rejection of this equitable argument. At least it fails to develop it in any serious way, which leads to the same result. <i>See Prisma Zona Exploratoria de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Calderon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200157\"><a href=\"/opinion/200157/prisma-zona-explorat-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Attorneys' Fees &amp; Litigation Expenses.</i> Nippon also sought attorneys' fees and litigation expenses in the district court. Attorneys' fees and costs are included as compensable loss under the purchase agreement's indemnification provision so far as they are \"based upon, arising out of, or resulting from ... any failure of [Household] to perform in all material respects [its] obligations.\" Purchase agreement &#167; 9.2; <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 1.11A. We have already noted that the billing of the deferred premiums, although mistaken and requiring restitution, was not a breach of the purchase agreement except as to the expired warranty; and thus Nippon cannot be reimbursed for attorneys' fees for <i>that</i> breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Nippon also seeks attorneys' fees for a different breach of the agreement: Household's breach of the provision governing allocation of retros as between Nippon and other business covered by the same policies. The district court ruled that there was such a breach by Household because, as already noted, it made allocations of retros based on its traditional method. In doing so, Household ignored an explicit provision of the agreement that specified the so-called \"share formula\" for allocating retros. Purchase agreement &#167; 5.10(b). The details of the dispute need not be described because Household has not appealed from the district court's finding of violation; but Household does defend against Nippon's claim that Nippon's attorneys' fees should be paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to award Nippon attorneys' fees, conceding that Household had breached the allocation provision but saying that \"no damages [in the form of attorney's fees] resulted from this breach.\" The district court's reasoning was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Nippon Sanso and Thermos are not entitled to litigation costs and expenses under section 9.2 because their losses did not result from [Household's] breach. Even if [Household] had attempted to calculate Nippon Sanso's share under section 5.10(b) from the outset, this litigation would have proceeded in the same way with the same expenses. The primary focus of phase I of this case has been the definition of the share percentage and its application, as to which the parties simply had very different interpretations. Therefore, [Household's] breach of section 5.10 did not cause this litigation nor its cost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This critique does not fully answer Nippon's claim. Litigation may have been inevitable because the parties disagreed about varying provisions and could not settle the case; but Household was responsible for conduct violating the share allocation formula and the litigation embraced that issue. To the extent that Nippon incurred attorneys' fees to resolve the share allocation issue, there is no obvious reason why they should not constitute losses due to Household's breach, whether the breach and the litigation were inevitable or not. The indemnification clause does <i>not</i> make Household's bad faith or equities in favor of Nippon a condition of Nippon's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, this does not make Household liable for Nippon's litigation expenses in resolving other disputed issues and the allocation error may have been a very small part of litigation that has spanned over ten years. Household argues that early on it conceded its breach in using the traditional method, suggesting that Nippon's expenses on this issue were slight or unnecessary; but Nippon points to some evidence to the contrary and the district court made no findings on this point. On remand, the district court must decide what portion, if any, of Nippon's reasonable litigation costs as to the allocation issue is over and above what it would have incurred anyway because of disputes on other issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Nippon argues that the dispute was not limited to the question of whether the traditional method or the share formula of allocation should be used; Nippon says that litigation was required to settle a dispute concerning, <i>inter alia,</i> the proper numerator to be used in implementing the share formula. That dispute was itself settled by the district court in Nippon's favor, so Nippon claims that its attorneys' fees as to this issue are also covered by the indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Household apparently did not use the share formula at all, arguably this interpretive dispute, even though entailing litigation, may not be a breach of the purchase agreement warranting indemnification; yet on the other hand if Household's interpretation of the formula in the litigation below did not conform to the requirements of the contract, then perhaps <i>that</i> misinterpretation would have been breach and indemnification would be due. But these wrinkles are for the parties and the district court on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is about money, but only money, and should have been settled (each party being right on some part of the case) early in the district court process. The cost of not settling, which both sides now bear, is attorneys' fees incurred over many years &#8212; most of them beyond any claim of reimbursement &#8212; and the continuing distraction of busy executives. We have been forced to remand on one narrow issue which in the nature of things is not susceptible to a perfect answer. Before more of the district court's time is consumed in this endeavor, counsel ought to call their principals' attention to the cost and settle what remains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed</i> as to the denial of prejudgment interest and the <i>denial</i> of attorneys' fees attributable to Household's mistaken billing of deferred premiums, <i>reversed</i> as to the refusal to assign retro credits to Nippon although without disturbing the prior ruling that the allocation of retros should be calculated separately as to each policy, <i>vacated</i> as to the denial of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses on the share allocation issue, and <i>remanded</i> for proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>APPENDIX</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1.11A. \"Loss\" shall mean any loss, damage, liability cost and expense, including, without limitation, any interest, fine, court cost, reasonable investigation cost, penalty and attorneys' and expert witnesses' fees, disbursements and expenses, subtracting from any Loss any insurance proceeds actually received by any person or entity incurring a Loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3.12. <i>Insurance.</i> Schedule 3.12 hereto sets forth, as of the date hereof, a list of all currently effective insurance policies relating to the Leisure Products and Houseware Business issued in favor of Household, Thermos UK, Thermos Pty., CTP, Thermos and/or TDR, the identity of the respective insurance carriers, the respective policy periods and the respective limits and retentions.

On Household's reading, it would keep a credit of $10 generated in 1987 and Nippon would pay a debit of $10 generated in 1988; and yet if the underlying claims had come in a different order, so that each year alone generated a zero adjustment, neither company would pay (or receive refunds). In both examples, of course, Liberty's position remains the same</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This does not mean that the district court was wrong in considering the warranty when it concluded that the purchase agreement did not transfer to Nippon Household's pre-existing responsibility to pay deferred premiums. Our own intuition is the same as the district court's, namely, that the warranty could not be a basis for recovery but could still cast light on what other contractual provisions did or did not do</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
