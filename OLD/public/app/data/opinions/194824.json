Wilfredo  Gongora  appeals  from  a\r                                 \n\njudgment dismissing his  motion to vacate his  sentence under\n\n28 U.S.C.  2255.   He claims that his  sentence was illegally\n\nenhanced  in  violation  of  21 U.S.C.   851.1    Finding  no\n\nillegal enhancement, we affirm.\n\n                           I.     \n\n     On September  24, 1987,  Gongora and  eight others  were\n\narrested on the high seas  aboard the COLOSO II, a Panamanian\n\ntugboat.  The  Coast Guard  made the  arrest after  observing\n\nnumerous  bales of marijuana  being thrown from  the tugboat.\n\nGongora and the captain and  other crew members of the COLOSO\n\nII were charged with violating 46 U.S.C. App.  1903(a) and 18\n\nU.S.C.  2  (aiding and  abetting the  unlawful possession  of\n\n5818  kilograms of marijuana,  with the intent  to distribute\n\nsame, on  board a vessel  subject to the jurisdiction  of the\n\nUnited  States).      A   jury  convicted  Gongora  and   his\n\ncodefendants on December 16, 1987.\n\n     The  statute   the  defendants   were  convicted   under\n\nincorporates the  penalty provisions  of 21  U.S.C.  960  for\n\n                    \r                                \n\n1.   21 U.S.C.  851(a)(1) provides, in relevant part, that:\n\n     No  person who stands convicted of an offense under\n     this part [i.e., 21  U.S.C.  841 et seq.] shall  be\n     sentenced to increased punishment by reason of  one\n     or more prior convictions,  unless before trial, or\n     before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States\n     attorney files an  information with the court  (and\n     serves a copy  of such information on the person or\n     counsel for  the  person) stating  in  writing  the\n     previous convictions to be relied upon....\n\n                             -2-\r\n\nfirst  offenders and the penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C.  962\n\nfor  second  offenders.2     Under  21  U.S.C.    960,  first\n\noffenders are  subject to a mandatory minimum  penalty of ten\n\nyears' imprisonment and five years of supervised release, and\n\na maximum term of life imprisonment.  A person convicted of a\n\nsecond  or subsequent  offense \"is  punishable by  a  term of\n\nimprisonment twice that otherwise  authorized\" and \"twice the\n\nterm  of supervised release otherwise authorized.\"  21 U.S.C.\n\n 962(a). Thus, repeat offenders  of 46 U.S.C. App.   1903 are\n\nsubject  to a  mandatory minimum  sentence  of twenty  years'\n\nimprisonment and ten  years of supervised release.   However,\n\nto subject  a repeat offender to that  mandatory minimum, the\n\ngovernment  must first  file  an  information  notifying  the\n\noffender of the prior convictions  it intends to rely upon in\n\nseeking an  enhanced sentence  under 21  U.S.C.  851. See  21\r                                                                     \n\nU.S.C.   962(c)(\"Section 851 of  this title shall  apply with\n\n                    \r                                \n\n2.   46 U.S.C.

Craveiro, 907 F.2d 260,\r                                                          \n\n262  &amp;  n.  4  (1st   Cir.),  cert.  denied,  498  U.S.  1015\r                                                       \n\n(1990)(noting that double penalties for second or  subsequent\n\nconviction  under 21 U.S.C.  962 required proof of recidivism\n\nunder procedures set forth in 21 U.S.C.  851(a)(1)). \n\n     The case was called for sentencing on February 25, 1988.\n\nSix of  the crew  members had no  prior criminal  records and\n\nreceived  sentences of ten years' imprisonment and five years\n\nof  supervised  release,  the  mandatory  minimum  for  first\n\noffenders under 21  U.S.C.  960(b)(1)(G).  Before  trial, the\n\nprosecutor had  filed an  information  notifying the  captain\n\n(defendant  Corpus) that the government would seek to enhance\n\nhis sentence pursuant to 21  U.S.C.  851 on the basis of  his\n\nprior  marijuana  smuggling  conviction.     The  trial judge\n\nsentenced  the captain to  a thirty-year prison  term and ten\n\nyears  of supervised release.   Another crew  member (Alfonso\n\nGonzalez) had a prior conviction for marijuana smuggling, but\n\nthe  government had not filed a  851 information with respect\n\nto him.  Gonzalez received a thirty-year prison term and five\n\nyears of supervised release.                                 \n\n     Similarly,  the  government  also did  not  file  a  851\n\ninformation on Gongora, the last to be called for sentencing.\n\nGongora's Presentence Report (PSR) indicated that Gongora was\n\n                             -4-\r\n\nsubject to  the ten  year-to-life range  applicable to  first\n\noffenders  under 21 U.S.C.   960(b)(1)(G).  However,  the PSR\n\nalso identified  two prior arrests  for drug crimes.   One of\n\nthese resulted in  a 1983 conviction for  violating 21 U.S.C.\n\n 955a, the  predecessor to 46  U.S.C. App.   1903.3   Gongora\n\ninitially denied  that he  was the  person with the  criminal\n\nrecord described in  the PSR.   The  district court continued\n\nGongora's  sentencing so that an evidentiary hearing could be\n\nheld.   Gongora's  counsel moved  to waive  the hearing.   On\n\nMarch  3,  1988,  Gongora admitted  to  the  1983 conviction.\n\nNevertheless, the  district court proceeded  with the hearing\n\nand an FBI fingerprint expert established that Gongora indeed\n\nhad been  convicted of  the 1983  marijuana smuggling  charge\n\nunder 21 U.S.C.  955a.  \n\n     The  trial  court  sentenced Gongora  to  thirty  years'\n\nimprisonment  and  five  years of  supervised  release.   All\n\nconvictions  were  affirmed  on direct  appeal.    See United\r                                                                         \n\nStates v. Corpus, 882 F.2d  546 (1st Cir. 1989).  Thereafter,\r                            \n\nthe district  court entered  two  orders affecting  Gongora's\n\nsentence.   On  September 6,  1989, it  ordered that  all the\n\ndefendants' supervised  release terms  should be  replaced by\n\nterms of special parole.  Amended judgments issued.  On April\n\n                    \r                                \n\n3.  The 1983 conviction was for Gongora's participation in an\nattempt  to import 57,265 pounds of marijuana into the United\nStates.  The  Puerto Rico federal district  court (Torruella,\nJ.)  sentenced Gongora to three years' imprisonment and three\nyears of special parole.  \n\n                             -5-\r\n\n17,  1990,  the   court  clarified  its  previous   order  by\n\nspecifying that the  defendants were not eligible  for parole\n\nunder the 1986 amendments to  21 U.S.C.   960 and 962.   This\n\nruling was affirmed on  appeal.  See United States  v. De Los\r                                                                         \n\nSantos-Himitola, 924 F.2d 380 (1st Cir. 1991).4  \r                           \n\n     In  1991,   Gongora  filed  the  instant   2255  motion.\n\nRelying on  Hardy v. United  States, 691 F.2d 39,  41-42 (1st\r                                               \n\nCir.   1982)(vacating   sentence   where   record   suggested\n\ngovernment  may  not have  filed   851  information), Gongora\n\nargued  that his sentence had been illegally enhanced because\n\nthe  district court  had relied  on his  prior conviction  in\n\nimposing his thirty-year  prison term and the  government had\n\nfailed  to file a  pretrial enhancement information  under 21\n\nU.S.C.   851.   Gongora maintained  that  the district  court\n\nlacked jurisdiction  to impose  the thirty-year  sentence and\n\nthat his  sentence should be  reduced to the ten  year prison\n\n                    \r                                \n\n4.  In De Los Santos-Himitola, 924 F.2d at 381-82  &amp; n. 2, we\r                                         \nobserved that the  district court correctly left  the special\nparole terms in place when it determined that  the defendants\nwere not eligible for parole,  but that the Supreme Court had\ngranted  certiorari review  on whether the  mandatory minimum\nsupervised  release terms required by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act\nof 1986  applied to  offenses committed  between October  27,\n1986 and November  1, 1987.  The Supreme  Court answered this\nquestion in  the affirmative.   See  Gozlon-Peretz v.  United\r                                                                         \nStates,   498  U.S.  395,   404-410  (1991).     Thus,  these\r                  \ndefendants'  sentences  may  include  an  incorrect  term  of\nspecial  parole. See Padilla  Palacios v. United  States, 932\r                                                                    \nF.2d 31, 32-34 (1st Cir. 1991)(per curiam)(holding supervised\nrelease applied to  2255 petitioner convicted of violating 46\nU.S.C. App.  1903). As the issue  has not been raised, we  do\nnot consider it.    \n\n                             -6-\r\n\nterm imposed on  the first offenders.  Gongora  filed several\n\ndocuments  in  support  of his   2255  motion,  including the\n\ndistrict  court's  September  6,  1989  order   revoking  the\n\ndefendants' supervised release  terms.  Footnote one  of that\n\norder  stated: \"Defendants  with  prior criminal  convictions\n\nwere sentenced  under 21  U.S.C. section 962(a),  authorizing\n\nsentences  twice the  length  of  those otherwise  provided.\"\n\nGongora  insists that this  notation shows that  the district\n\ncourt impermissibly imposed  a twenty-year mandatory  minimum\n\nterm on  Gongora as  a repeat offender  under 21  U.S.C.  962\n\nthen added ten  years.  The government conceded  that no  851\n\ninformation  had been  filed  on  Gongora,  but  argued  that\n\nGongora  had been sentenced under 21 U.S.C.  960(b)(1)(G) and\n\nthat  his sentence had not been  unlawfully enhanced since it\n\nwas within  the ten  year-to-life range  applicable to  first\n\noffenders  under that statute.  The government further argued\n\nthat Gongora's five-year supervised release term  showed that\n\nthe district court  did not unlawfully enhance  his sentence,\n\nas  a ten-year  term would  have been  required for  a repeat\n\noffender.   The government maintained that Gongora's sentence\n\nwas unreviewable under United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443,\r                                                          \n\n447  (1972)(\"... a  sentence imposed  by  a federal  district\n\njudge, if within  statutory limits, is generally  not subject\n\nto review.\")        The district court ruled that Gongora had\n\nnot been sentenced  under 21 U.S.C.  962 but  rather had been\n\n                             -7-\r\n\nsentenced    to a  term  within  the  ten year-to-life  range\n\napplicable  to  him  under  21  U.S.C.   960(b)(1)(G).    The\n\nsentencing judge  acknowledged  that he  had  considered  the\n\nprior conviction in imposing the  sentence.  However, in view\n\nof the fact  that Gongora did not contend that  Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP.  32(c)(governing disclosure of PSR) had been violated, the\n\njudge discerned no illegality in the thirty-year sentence and\n\ndismissed Gongora's  2255 motion.   This appeal followed. \n\n                             II.\n\n       \"Congress enacted section  851(a)(1) and the procedure\n\nfor  filing   an  information  to   protect  defendants  from\n\nreceiving increased  statutory sentences  ... resulting  from\n\nprior,  incorrectly   charged  offenses   ...  and  to   give\n\ndefendants the  opportunity to show  that they  were not  the\n\npersons convicted.\" United  States v.

The Coast Guard made the arrest after observing numerous bales of marijuana being thrown from the tugboat.  Gongora and the captain and other crew members of the COLOSO II were charged with violating 46 U.S.C. App. &#167; 1903(a) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (aiding and abetting the unlawful possession of 5818 kilograms of marijuana, with the intent to distribute same, on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States).

A person convicted of a second or subsequent offense \"is punishable by a term of imprisonment twice that otherwise authorized\" and \"twice the term of supervised release otherwise authorized.\"  21 U.S.C. &#167; 962(a).  Thus, repeat offenders of 46 U.S.C. App. &#167; 1903 are subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years' imprisonment and ten years of supervised release.  However, to subject a repeat offender to that mandatory minimum, the government must first file an information notifying the offender of the prior convictions it intends to rely upon in seeking an enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962(c)(\"Section 851 of this title shall apply with respect to any proceeding to sentence a person under this section.\")   See also United States v. Craveiro, 907 F.2d 260, 262 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1015 (1990)(noting that double penalties for second or subsequent conviction under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962 required proof of recidivism under procedures set forth in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was called for sentencing on February 25, 1988.  Six of the crew members had no prior criminal records and received sentences of ten years' imprisonment and five years of supervised release, the mandatory minimum for first offenders under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  Before trial, the prosecutor had filed an information notifying the captain (defendant Corpus) that the government would seek to enhance his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851 on the basis of his prior marijuana smuggling conviction.  The trial judge sentenced the captain to a thirty-year prison term and ten years of supervised release.  Another crew member (Alfonso Gonzalez) had a prior conviction for marijuana smuggling, but the government had not filed a &#167; 851 information with respect to him.  Gonzalez received a thirty-year prison term and five years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the government also did not file a &#167; 851 information on Gongora, the last to be called for sentencing.  Gongora's Presentence Report (PSR) indicated that Gongora was subject to the ten year-to-life range applicable to first offenders under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  However, the PSR also identified two prior arrests for drug crimes.  One of these resulted in a 1983 conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 955a, the predecessor to 46 U.S.C. App. &#167; 1903.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Gongora initially denied that he was the person with the criminal record described in the PSR. The district court continued Gongora's sentencing so that an evidentiary hearing could be held.  Gongora's counsel moved to waive the hearing.  On March 3, 1988, Gongora admitted to the 1983 conviction.  Nevertheless, the district court proceeded with the hearing and an FBI fingerprint expert established that Gongora indeed had been convicted of the 1983 marijuana smuggling charge under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 955a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sentenced Gongora to thirty years' imprisonment and five years of supervised release.  All convictions were affirmed on direct appeal.   See United States v. Corpus, 882 F.2d 546 (1st Cir. 1989).  Thereafter, the district court entered two orders affecting Gongora's sentence.  On September 6, 1989, it ordered that all the defendants' supervised release terms should be replaced by terms of special parole.  Amended judgments issued.  On April 17, 1990, the court clarified its previous order by specifying that the defendants were not eligible for parole under the 1986 amendments to 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 960 and 962.  This ruling was affirmed on appeal.   See United States v. De Los Santos-Himitola, 924 F.2d 380 (1st Cir. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Gongora filed the instant &#167; 2255 motion.  Relying on  Hardy v. United States, 691 F.2d 39, 41-42 (1st Cir. 1982)(vacating sentence where record suggested government may not have filed &#167; 851 information), Gongora argued that his sentence had been illegally enhanced because the district court had relied on his prior conviction in imposing his thirty-year prison term and the government had failed to file a pretrial enhancement information under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851.  Gongora maintained that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose the thirty-year sentence and that his sentence should be reduced to the ten year prison term imposed on the first offenders.  Gongora filed several documents in support of his &#167; 2255 motion, including the district court's September 6, 1989 order revoking the defendants' supervised release terms.  Footnote one of that order stated: \"Defendants with prior criminal convictions were sentenced under 21 U.S.C. section 962(a), authorizing sentences twice the length of those otherwise provided.\"  Gongora insists that this notation shows that the district court impermissibly imposed a twenty-year mandatory minimum term on Gongora as a repeat offender under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962 then added ten years.  The government conceded that no &#167; 851 information had been filed on Gongora, but argued that Gongora had been sentenced under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G) and that his sentence had not been unlawfully enhanced since it was within the ten year-to-life range applicable to first offenders under that statute.  The government further argued that Gongora's five-year supervised release term showed that the district court did not unlawfully enhance his sentence, as a ten-year term would have been required for a repeat offender.  The government maintained that Gongora's sentence was unreviewable under  United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 447 (1972)(\"... a sentence imposed by a federal district judge, if within statutory limits, is generally not subject to review.\")  The district court ruled that Gongora had not been sentenced under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962 but rather had been sentenced to a term within the ten year-to-life range applicable to him under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  The sentencing judge acknowledged that he had considered the prior conviction in imposing the sentence.  However, in view of the fact that Gongora did not contend that Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(governing disclosure of PSR) had been violated, the judge discerned no illegality in the thirty-year sentence and dismissed Gongora's &#167; 2255 motion.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Congress enacted section 851(a)(1) and the procedure for filing an information to protect defendants from receiving increased statutory sentences ... resulting from prior, incorrectly charged offenses ... and to give defendants the opportunity to show that they were not the persons convicted.\"   United States v. Wallace, 895 F.2d 487, 489 (8th Cir. 1989) (citations omitted).  In  Hardy v. United States, 691 F.2d at 41, we observed that a district court lacks jurisdiction to enhance a convicted defendant's sentence on its own motion if the government has not filed an information seeking a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851(a)(1).   See also United States v. Belanger, 970 F.2d 416, 418 (7th Cir. 1992)(\"Failure to file [&#167; 851] information before trial deprives the district court of jurisdiction to impose an enhanced sentence.\");   United States v. Williams, 899 F.2d 1526, 1528-29 (6th Cir. 1990);   United States v. Olson, 716 F.2d 850, 851-54 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, this rule is not dispositive of the present case, for it is clear that the district court had jurisdiction to impose Gongora's thirty-year prison sentence as it was within the ten year-to-life range applicable to first offenders.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  Section 851 applies only where the government seeks to enhance the mandatory statutory minimum or maximum sentence of a defendant.   See, e.g., United States v. French, 974 F.2d 687, 697-98 (6th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 1431 (1993) (&#167; 851 applied where defendant's mandatory sentence was enhanced from twenty years to life under recidivist provision of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A));   United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 616 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 1625 (1991) (\"The section 851(a)(1) enhancement notice requirement applies 'to situations in which a convicted defendant's statutory minimum or maximum penalty is enhanced ...' \")(citation omitted);  United States v. Wallace, 895 F.2d at 490 (same).  The fact that the government did not file a &#167; 851 information on Gongora meant that the district court was not compelled to impose the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment and ten years of supervised release required by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962.  However, the absence of this information did not rob the district court of its discretion to impose such a sentence under the statutory authority vested in it under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of a &#167; 851 enhancement information does not preclude a sentencing court from considering a defendant's prior convictions in determining whether the defendant should be treated as a Career Offender under the Sentencing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guidelines.

While this is a pre-Guidelines case, the rationale of these authorities applies with like force to Gongora's claim.

The Supreme Court answered this question in the affirmative.   See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404-410 (1991).  Thus, these defendants' sentences may include an incorrect term of special parole.   See Padilla Palacios v.

Six of the crew members had no prior criminal records and received sentences of ten years' imprisonment and five years of supervised release, the mandatory minimum for first offenders under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  Before trial, the prosecutor had filed an information notifying the captain (defendant Corpus) that the government would seek to enhance his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851 on the basis of his prior marijuana smuggling conviction.  The trial judge sentenced the captain to a thirty-year prison term and ten years of supervised release.  Another crew member (Alfonso Gonzalez) had a prior conviction for marijuana smuggling, but the government had not filed a &#167; 851 information with respect to him.  Gonzalez received a thirty-year prison term and five years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the government also did not file a &#167; 851 information on Gongora, the last to be called for sentencing.  Gongora's Presentence Report (PSR) indicated that Gongora was subject to the ten year-to-life range applicable to first offenders under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  However, the PSR also identified two prior arrests for drug crimes.  One of these resulted in a 1983 conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 955a, the predecessor to 46 U.S.C. App. &#167; 1903.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Gongora initially denied that he was the person with the criminal record described in the PSR. The district court continued Gongora's sentencing so that an evidentiary hearing could be held.  Gongora's counsel moved to waive the hearing.  On March 3, 1988, Gongora admitted to the 1983 conviction.  Nevertheless, the district court proceeded with the hearing and an FBI fingerprint expert established that Gongora indeed had been convicted of the 1983 marijuana smuggling charge under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 955a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sentenced Gongora to thirty years' imprisonment and five years of supervised release.  All convictions were affirmed on direct appeal.   See United States v.

Thereafter, the district court entered two orders affecting Gongora's sentence.  On September 6, 1989, it ordered that all the defendants' supervised release terms should be replaced by terms of special parole.  Amended judgments issued.  On April 17, 1990, the court clarified its previous order by specifying that the defendants were not eligible for parole under the 1986 amendments to 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 960 and 962.  This ruling was affirmed on appeal.   See United States v. De Los Santos-Himitola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555049\"><a href=\"/opinion/555049/united-states-v-jose-de-los-santos-himitola-walber-meza-navarro-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Gongora filed the instant &#167; 2255 motion.

Gongora maintained that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose the thirty-year sentence and that his sentence should be reduced to the ten year prison term imposed on the first offenders.  Gongora filed several documents in support of his &#167; 2255 motion, including the district court's September 6, 1989 order revoking the defendants' supervised release terms.  Footnote one of that order stated: \"Defendants with prior criminal convictions were sentenced under 21 U.S.C. section 962(a), authorizing sentences twice the length of those otherwise provided.\"  Gongora insists that this notation shows that the district court impermissibly imposed a twenty-year mandatory minimum term on Gongora as a repeat offender under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962 then added ten years.  The government conceded that no &#167; 851 information had been filed on Gongora, but argued that Gongora had been sentenced under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G) and that his sentence had not been unlawfully enhanced since it was within the ten year-to-life range applicable to first offenders under that statute.  The government further argued that Gongora's five-year supervised release term showed that the district court did not unlawfully enhance his sentence, as a ten-year term would have been required for a repeat offender.  The government maintained that Gongora's sentence was unreviewable under  United States v. Tucker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108427\"><a href=\"/opinion/108427/united-states-v-tucker/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 447 (1972)(\"... a sentence imposed by a federal district judge, if within statutory limits, is generally not subject to review.\")  The district court ruled that Gongora had not been sentenced under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962 but rather had been sentenced to a term within the ten year-to-life range applicable to him under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G).  The sentencing judge acknowledged that he had considered the prior conviction in imposing the sentence.  However, in view of the fact that Gongora did not contend that Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 32(c)(governing disclosure of PSR) had been violated, the judge discerned no illegality in the thirty-year sentence and dismissed Gongora's &#167; 2255 motion.

The fact that the government did not file a &#167; 851 information on Gongora meant that the district court was not compelled to impose the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment and ten years of supervised release required by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 962.
