In September 2009, Ashleigh\n\nPruell   and   Amy    Gordon   filed    this     putative    class   action    in\n\nMassachusetts    Superior      Court    against    named    hospitals   in    the\n\nCaritas Christi hospital network and two of its senior executives\n\n(collectively,       \"Caritas\").       Pruell    and   Gordon,    employees    of\n\nCaritas, purport to represent a class of over 12,000 Caritas\n\nhospital employees and claim that they and other class members were\n\ndeprived of compensation for work performed during their meal\n\nbreak, for work performed before and after shifts, and for time\n\nspent attending training sessions.\n\n           All of the claims asserted in the complaint rest on state\n\nlaw; they arise under Massachusetts statutes--Massachusetts Payment\n\nof Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148; the Massachusetts\n\nMinimum Fair Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, §§ 1A and 15--or\n\nits common law: breach of contract or implied contract; money had\n\nand received; quantum meruit/unjust enrichment; fraud; negligent\n\nmisrepresentation;       equitable      and     promissory       estoppel;    and\n\nconversion.\n\n           Caritas removed the case to federal district court on the\n\nground that section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act\n\n(\"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 185, debarred plaintiffs' state law claims\n\nand Caritas thereafter moved to dismiss the claims, while Pruell\n\nand Gordon moved to remand the case to state court on the ground\n\nthat removal had been improper.              Section 301 says nothing about\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fstate claims or removal, but under its aegis the Supreme Court has\n\nbuilt an edifice of doctrine that transmutes certain state law\n\nclaims into federal claims, permits their removal on the basis of\n\nfederal question doctrine, and in certain instances then allows\n\ntheir dismissal in federal court.1\n\n          The   state   claims   are    so   treated   because   of   their\n\nrelationship to collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\") that are\n\nsubject to federal labor laws, and section 301 is only one of\n\nseveral preemption doctrines that the Supreme Court has constructed\n\nto maintain a uniform federal body of law governing labor matters.\n\n          In this instance, after a hearing on the cross motions,\n\nthe district court in September 2010 granted Caritas' motion to\n\ndismiss, primarily because the court viewed the state claims as\n\npreempted by federal law and denied the motion of Pruell and Gordon\n\nseeking a remand.2   To supply the necessary link to CBAs subject to\n\nfederal law, the district court accepted Caritas' allegation that\n\nat least some members of the putative class are represented by\n\nunions under various CBAs and it then concluded that the claims\n\n\n\n     1\n      Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 451\n(1957); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 220-21 (1985);\nAvco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists, 390\nU.S. 557, 559-60 (1968). See generally 4 N.P. Lareau, National\nLabor Relations Act: Law and Practice § 36.06 (2d ed. 2010).\n     2\n      Here, twelve of the thirteen counts were dismissed as\npreempted; the last count was dismissed because the parties agreed\nthat section 15 of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151 created no private right\nof action.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fasserted in the case would be preempted because one or more CBAs\n\nwould have to be interpreted in order to determine whether there\n\nhad been underpayment of wages and by how much.\n\n           Pruell and Gordon now appeal and, the dismissal having\n\nbeen on legal grounds, our review is de novo.              O'Donnell v. Boggs,\n\n611 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2010).        Pruell and Gordon say that their\n\nclaims rest on state law independent of, and not preempted by, the\n\nLMRA and that adjudication of the claims requires no interpretation\n\nof any CBA, although calculating damages for union members of the\n\nclass   could   require    mechanical      resort    to   one    or    more     CBAs.\n\nAccordingly, their request is for a remand to state court.\n\n           Caritas charges plaintiffs' counsel with having filed\n\ncopycat complaints, in numerous courts against various hospitals,\n\nall with sketchily inadequate factual allegations.                    It says that\n\nthe district court properly dismissed the complaint based on\n\ncomplete   preemption      because   CBAs    govern       the   target     of    the\n\ncomplaint--what    hours    are   compensable       and   on    what    terms--and\n\nbecause interpretation of the CBAs would be needed to assess the\n\nmerits and (if liability did exist) to calculate damages.\n\n           Both sides have slid by the threshold issue.                  In a case\n\nof this kind, removal and dismissal based on complete preemption\n\nunder the LMRA must start with a plaintiff covered by a CBA for it\n\nis that fact that establishes subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\nfederal district court.      Avco Corp. 390 U.S. at 560 (1968).               If the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fplaintiffs are non-union workers unaffected by any CBA, section 301\n\nand its case law glosses are irrelevant, state law would apply with\n\nfull force and, assuming removal were possible, it would have to be\n\non some other jurisdictional basis such as diversity not here\n\nalleged.\n\n           Caritas certainly has contracts with union members--\n\nseveral are in the record--but the parties have left us, and the\n\ndistrict court, in the dark as to whether either of the named\n\nplaintiffs is covered by a CBA.            Both sides think that class\n\nmembers' status is sufficient: thus, Caritas says that various\n\nclass members are union members but does not even expressly allege\n\nthat the named plaintiffs are among them. Plaintiffs point to lack\n\nof such an allegation as an objection to removal, adding that in\n\nany event the claims of non-union class members should not have\n\nbeen dismissed.\n\n           Curiously, we have had trouble finding a precedent for a\n\ncase like this in which removal under section 301 was sought or\n\naccomplished without some clear indication that a named plaintiff\n\nwas an employee covered by a CBA.         Several companion cases against\n\nother   Massachusetts   hospitals    have    been    filed   by   plaintiffs'\n\ncounsel, and in each it appears to be colorably alleged that the\n\nnamed plaintiffs include union members.             Manning v. Boston Med.\n\nCtr. Corp., No. 09-11724-RWZ, 2011 WL 864798, at *2 (D. Mass. Mar.\n\n10, 2011); Cavallaro v. UMass Mem'l Healthcare, Inc., No. 09-40181-\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fFDS, slip op. at 8 (D. Mass. Dec. 20, 2010).        This is typical in\n\ncases that are removed under section 301.\n\n            But precedent in related fields resolves the question\n\nwhether the status of class members matters.            The usual rule in\n\nclass actions is that to establish subject matter jurisdiction one\n\nlooks only to the named plaintiffs and their claims.                See 5 W.\n\nMoore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 23.63[1][b] (3d ed. 2011).\n\nThis,    with   occasional   modest   qualifications,    is   the   rule   in\n\ndetermining whether diversity of citizenship exists, whether amount\n\nin controversy is established, whether a plaintiff has standing and\n\nwhether the controversy has become moot.3\n\n            Indeed, in most respects, the class members other than\n\nthe named plaintiffs are merely potential parties until subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction for the named plaintiffs is established and the\n\ndistrict court has decided to certify a class.            As one circuit\n\ncourt explained, \"a class action, when filed, includes only the\n\nclaims of the named plaintiff or plaintiffs. The claims of unnamed\n\nclass members are added to the action later, when the action is\n\ncertified as a class under Rule 23.\"        Gibson, 261 F.3d at 940.\n\n            It follows that, as Judge Posner stated, where the\n\n\"district court never had jurisdiction over the claim of the class\n\n\n     3\n      Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546\n(2005); Snyder v. Harris, 394 U.S. 332, 340 (1969); Gibson v.\nChrysler Corp., 261 F.3d 927, 940 (9th Cir. 2001), cert. denied,\n534 U.S. 1104 (2002); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494\n(1974); Bd. of Sch. Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128 (1975).\n\n                                      -6-\n\frepresentative . . . it had no jurisdiction over the class action\n\neither even if the claims of some of the members of the class were\n\nwithin its jurisdiction.\"          Denberg v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., 696 F.2d\n\n1193, 1197 (7th Cir. 1983) (en banc), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 926\n\n(1984).   Neither party offers any citations or argument to suggest\n\nthat a different rule applies in LMRA preemption cases.\n\n              In   the   present    case,    the   district   judge     made   no\n\ndetermination whether the two named plaintiffs were covered by\n\nCBAs; the defendants presumably could find out but apparently have\n\nnot; and the plaintiffs' counsel, who almost certainly know or\n\ncould easily determine by asking their clients, remain coy--saying\n\nonly that the defendants have failed to allege specifically that\n\nthe   named    plaintiffs    are    union    members.   Nor    is   the   answer\n\notherwise obvious from record documents we have perused.\n\n              Accordingly,    the     district     court's    subject     matter\n\njurisdiction is currently in doubt, the case cannot proceed until\n\nthat is established, and resolving that issue should be the first\n\norder of business on remand.                If there is no subject matter\n\njurisdiction because neither plaintiff is covered by a CBA, then\n\nthe case should never have been removed and must be remanded to the\n\nstate court.       So long as non-union plaintiffs pursue their own\n\nclaims or represent others who are also not covered by CBAs, that\n\nis a state case under state law.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          Strictly speaking, the case could be remanded now to the\n\nstate court on the ground that the defendants have not adequately\n\nalleged a basis for removal and that the burden of proof on\n\njurisdiction lies with the party who removed the case to federal\n\ncourt.    BIW Deceived v. Local S6, Indus. Union of                 Marine &\n\nShipbuilding Workers, 132 F.3d 824, 831 (1st Cir. 1997).             But, of\n\ncourse, the named plaintiffs may be union members and the coyness\n\nof plaintiffs' counsel does invite enough suspicion to warrant\n\nlimited discovery, Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 363\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), if this proves necessary.\n\n          Because a CBA might prove to cover one or both of the\n\nnamed plaintiffs, we might expedite matters by considering now the\n\ndistrict court's rationale for finding state claims by such a\n\nplaintiff to be transmuted into dismissible section 301 claims.\n\nThe district court pointed to the need for resort to the CBA to\n\ndetermine whether underpayments had occurred and by how much.               And\n\nthe CBA might also contain arbitration or grievance remedies that,\n\nas yet unexhausted, channel the complaints away from the federal\n\ncourt.   These concerns are common grounds for refusing to allow a\n\nremoved section 301 action to proceed.            See 4 N.P. Lareau, supra\n\nnote 1, § 36.06[3].\n\n          However, current Supreme Court precedents create some\n\nuncertainties   as   to   when   dismissal   of    the   removed   action   is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fappropriate,4 although this circuit has developed case law on\n\ncertain of these issues, see O'Donnell, 611 F.3d 50; BIW Deceived,\n\n132 F.3d 824; Fleabite v. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc., 131 F.3d 21 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).     Review of the district court's rationale is thus\n\nunwise, even perhaps inappropriate, unless and until the district\n\ncourt learns whether any CBA is implicated in claims asserted by\n\nthe named plaintiffs and, if so, the precise terms.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is vacated and the\n\nmatter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\n\ndecision.    Each side is to bear its own costs.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Such uncertainties involve, among other things:      what it\nmeans to \"interpret,\" rather than merely \"consult,\" a CBA, compare\nAllis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 214 (1985) with\nLivadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U.S. 107, 124 (1994); whether state law\nrights that a court would regard as non-waivable can nevertheless\nbe preempted, see Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486\nU.S. 399, 407 n.7(1988); what posture of the federal claim permits\nremoval, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386 (1987); and\nwhen a state law claim implicating section 301 should proceed as a\nfederal claim, or simply be dismissed, see Int'l Bhd. of Elec.\nWorkers v. Heckler, 481 U.S. 851 (1987).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Pruell and Gordon, employees of Caritas, purport to represent a class of over 12,000 Caritas hospital employees and claim that they and other class members were deprived of compensation for work performed during their meal break, for work performed before and after shifts, and for time spent attending training sessions.</p>\n<p>All of the claims asserted in the complaint rest on state law; they arise under Massachusetts statutesMassachusetts Payment of Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148; the Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wages Act, Mass. Gen.

Neither party offers any citations or argument to suggest that a different rule applies in LMRA preemption cases.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the district judge made no determination whether the two named plaintiffs were covered by CBAs; the defendants presumably could find out but apparently have not; and the plaintiffs' counsel, who almost certainly know or could easily determine by asking their clients, remain coysaying only that the defendants have failed to allege specifically that the named plaintiffs are union members. Nor is the answer otherwise obvious from record documents we have perused.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the district court's subject matter jurisdiction is currently in doubt, the case cannot proceed until that is established, and resolving that issue should be the first order of business on remand. If there is no subject matter jurisdiction because neither plaintiff is covered by a CBA, then the case should never have been removed and must be remanded to the state court. So long as non-union plaintiffs pursue their own claims or represent others who are also not covered by CBAs, that is a state case under state law.</p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, the case could be remanded now to the state court on the ground that the defendants have not adequately alleged a basis for removal and that the burden of proof on jurisdiction lies with the party who removed the case to federal court. <i>BIW Deceived v. Local S6, Indus. Union of Marine &amp; Shipbuilding Workers,</i> 132 F.3d 824, 831 (1st Cir.1997). But, of course, the named plaintiffs may be union members and the coyness of plaintiffs' counsel does invite enough suspicion to warrant limited discovery, <i>Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista,</i> 254 F.3d 358, 363 (1st Cir.2001), if this proves necessary.</p>\n<p>Because a CBA might prove to cover one or both of the named plaintiffs, we might expedite matters by considering now the district court's rationale for finding state claims by such a plaintiff to be transmuted into dismissible section 301 claims. The district court pointed to the need for resort to the CBA to determine whether underpayments had occurred and by how much. And the CBA might also contain arbitration or grievance remedies that, as yet unexhausted, channel the complaints away from the federal court. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> These concerns are common grounds for refusing to allow a removed section 301 action to proceed. <i>See</i> 4 N.P. Lareau, <i>supra</i> note 1, § 36.06[3].</p>\n<p>However, current Supreme Court precedents create some uncertainties as to when dismissal of the removed action is appropriate,<sup>[4]</sup> although this circuit has developed case law on certain of these issues, <i>see </i><i>O'Donnell,</i> 611 F.3d 50; <i>BIW Deceived,</i> 132 F.3d 824; <i>Flibotte v.

Alfred with whom Barry J. Miller, Jessica M. Schauer, Sarah N. Turner and Seyfarth Shaw LLP were on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In September 2009, Ashleigh Pruell and Amy Gordon filed this putative class action in Massachusetts Superior Court against named hospitals in the Caritas Christi hospital network and two of its senior executives (collectively, \"Caritas\"). Pruell and Gordon, employees of Caritas, purport to represent a class of over 12,000 Caritas hospital employees and claim that they and other class members were deprived of compensation for work performed during their meal break, for work performed before and after shifts, and for time spent attending training sessions.</p>\n<p>All of the claims asserted in the complaint rest on state law; they arise under Massachusetts statutesMassachusetts Payment of Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 148; the Massachusetts Minimum Fair Wages Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151, §§ 1A and 15or its common law: breach of contract or implied contract; money had and received; <i>quantum meruit</i> /unjust enrichment; fraud; negligent misrepresentation; equitable and promissory estoppel; and conversion.</p>\n<p>Caritas removed the case to federal district court on the ground that section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 185, debarred plaintiffs' state law claims and Caritas thereafter moved to dismiss the claims, while Pruell and Gordon moved to remand the case to state court on the ground that removal had been improper. Section 301 says nothing about state claims or removal, but under its aegis the Supreme Court has built an edifice of doctrine that transmutes certain state law claims into federal claims, permits their removal on the basis of federal question doctrine, and in certain instances then allows their dismissal in federal court.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The state claims are so treated because of their relationship to collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\") that are subject to federal labor laws, and section 301 is only one of several preemption doctrines that the Supreme Court has constructed to maintain a uniform federal body of law governing labor matters.</p>\n<p>In this instance, after a hearing on the cross motions, the district court in September 2010 granted Caritas' motion to dismiss, primarily because the court viewed the state claims as preempted by federal law, and denied the motion of Pruell and Gordon seeking a remand.<sup>[2]</sup> To supply the necessary link to CBAs subject to federal law, the district court accepted Caritas' allegation that at least <i>some</i> members of the putative class are represented by unions under various CBAs and it then concluded that the claims asserted in the case would be preempted because one or more CBAs would have to be interpreted in order to determine whether there had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> been underpayment of wages and by how much.</p>\n<p>Pruell and Gordon now appeal and, the dismissal having been on legal grounds, our review is <i>de novo. </i><i>O'Donnell v. Boggs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150277\"><a href=\"/opinion/150277/odonnell-v-boggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2010). Pruell and Gordon say that their claims rest on state law independent of, and not preempted by, the LMRA and that adjudication of the claims requires no interpretation of any CBA, although calculating damages for union members of the class could require mechanical resort to one or more CBAs. Accordingly, their request is for a remand to state court.</p>\n<p>Caritas charges plaintiffs' counsel with having filed copycat complaints, in numerous courts against various hospitals, all with sketchily inadequate factual allegations. It says that the district court properly dismissed the complaint based on complete preemption because CBAs govern the target of the complaintwhat hours are compensable and on what termsand because interpretation of the CBAs would be needed to assess the merits and (if liability did exist) to calculate damages.</p>\n<p>Both sides have slid by the threshold issue. In a case of this kind, removal and dismissal based on complete preemption under the LMRA must <i>start</i> with a plaintiff <i>covered</i> by a CBA for it is that fact that establishes subject matter jurisdiction in the federal district court. <i>Avco Corp.,</i> 390 U.S. at 560, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107655\"><a href=\"/opinion/107655/avco-corp-v-machinists/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1235</span></a></span> (1968). If the plaintiffs are non-union workers unaffected by any CBA, section 301 and its case law glosses are irrelevant, state law would apply with full force and, assuming removal were possible, it would have to be on some other jurisdictional basis such as diversity not here alleged.</p>\n<p>Caritas certainly has contracts with union membersseveral are in the record but the parties have left us, and the district court, in the dark as to whether either of the named plaintiffs is covered by a CBA. Both sides think that class members' status is sufficient: thus, Caritas says that various class members are union members but does not even expressly allege that the named plaintiffs are among them. Plaintiffs point to lack of such an allegation as an objection to removal, adding that in any event the claims of <i>non-union</i> class members should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p>Curiously, we have had trouble finding a precedent for a case like this in which removal under section 301 was sought or accomplished without some clear indication that a named plaintiff was an employee covered by a CBA. Several companion cases against other Massachusetts hospitals have been filed by plaintiffs' counsel, and in each it appears to be colorably alleged that the named plaintiffs include union members. <i>Manning v. Boston Med. Ctr. Corp.,</i> No. 09-11724-RWZ, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">864798</span></span>, at *2 (D.Mass. Mar. 10, 2011); <i>Cavallaro v. UMass Mem'l Healthcare, Inc.,</i> No. 09-40181-FDS, slip op. at 8 (D.Mass. Dec. 20, 2010). This is typical in cases that are removed under section 301.</p>\n<p>But precedent in related fields resolves the question whether the status of class members matters. The usual rule in class actions is that to establish subject matter jurisdiction one looks only to the named plaintiffs and their claims. <i>See</i> 5 W. Moore et al, <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> § 23.63[1][b] (3d ed. 2011). This, with occasional modest qualifications, is the rule in determining whether diversity of citizenship exists, whether amount in controversy is established, whether a plaintiff has standing and whether the controversy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> has become moot.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, in most respects, the class members other than the named plaintiffs are merely potential parties until subject matter jurisdiction for the named plaintiffs is established and the district court has decided to certify a class. As one circuit court explained, \"a class action, when filed, includes only the claims of the named plaintiff or plaintiffs. The claims of unnamed class members are added to the action later, when the action is certified as a class under Rule 23.\" <i>Gibson,</i> 261 F.3d at 940.</p>\n<p>It follows that, as Judge Posner stated, where the \"district court never had jurisdiction over the claim of the class representative ... it had no jurisdiction over the class action either even if the claims of some of the members of the class were within its jurisdiction.\" <i>Denberg v.
