Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and Samantha M.\nJewett, Legal Intern, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         September 3, 2003\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.           Nelson Santana was convicted\n\nof   conspiracy   to    distribute      and    to    possess    with     intent    to\n\ndistribute between one-half and five kilograms of cocaine.                      After\n\nconsidering Santana's challenges, which were ably briefed and well\n\nargued, we affirm.\n\n                          I.     Background Facts\n\n           In   1998,   local,       state,   and    federal    law    enforcement\n\nagencies began an investigation of suspected cocaine and marijuana\n\ntraffickers in southern New Hampshire.              They debriefed informants,\n\nused undercover agents to attempt to purchase drugs, conducted\n\nphysical   surveillance,       and    reviewed      telephone        records.      In\n\naddition, beginning February 22, 2001, law enforcement agencies\n\nconducted court authorized wire taps on four telephone numbers,\n\nincluding a cellular telephone belonging to Alfred Nickerson.\n\n           Telephone     calls    between      Nickerson       and    Santana    were\n\nrecorded on May 7 and May 9, 2001.            Based on those calls and other\n\ninformation gathered during their investigation, law enforcement\n\nagents believed Santana regularly supplied cocaine to Nickerson and\n\nthat a drug transfer was going to take place May 9.\n\n           At about 10:30 a.m. on May 9, an agent with the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (\"DEA\") saw Santana enter the apartment\n\ncomplex at 210 Brook Village Road in Nashua, New Hampshire, where\n\nSantana's ex-wife lives. Santana left about 1:00 p.m., accompanied\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fby an unidentified male.           Santana spoke briefly and shook hands\n\nwith this man before driving away.\n\n           Also on May 9, investigators were watching Nickerson.\n\nLeaving his home at about 9:05 a.m., he stopped at several Nashua\n\nbusinesses including R.J. Motor Sports.              This stop is significant\n\nbecause agents watched Nickerson leave R.J. Motor Sports May 7 with\n\na   package.    At   trial,       the   government     alleged      that   Nickerson\n\nobtained marijuana from Roger Paget, the owner of R.J. Motor\n\nSports.   The defense argued at trial that Nickerson's cocaine also\n\ncame from Paget.\n\n           On May 9, Nickerson left R.J. Motor Sports empty-handed.\n\nHe then drove to the Brook Village Road apartment complex, arriving\n\nat approximately 12:30 p.m. and leaving (alone) fifteen minutes\n\nlater.    The surveilling officer saw him enter the complex, but\n\ncould not identify which apartment, if any, he entered.\n\n           Believing       that    Nickerson     and      Santana    made    a   drug\n\ntransaction inside the Brook Village Road complex, investigators\n\nordered state troopers to stop Nickerson's car.                      Nickerson was\n\n\"clearly nervous\"; the trooper ordered him out of the car to ensure\n\nher safety.    She then found what she believed to be marijuana in\n\nNickerson's    car   and    arrested      him.       An    inventory       search   of\n\nNickerson's car yielded approximately eight ounces of cocaine, four\n\nounces of marijuana, a digital scale, an address book, and more\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthan one thousand dollars.        After his arrest, Nickerson agreed to\n\nbecome a government informant.\n\n             A grand jury indicted Santana on April 10, 2002, and he\n\nwas arrested on April 11, 2002 and charged with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute more than five kilograms of cocaine between 1997 and May\n\n2001.      At Santana's trial, Nickerson testified that Santana had\n\nbeen his long-time supplier of cocaine and that he purchased\n\ncocaine from Santana up to and including the day of Nickerson's\n\narrest -- May 9, 2001.          Nickerson said that he and Santana had\n\nlittle social interaction and mainly communicated about drugs.\n\nNickerson also testified that he used and sold marijuana, which he\n\nobtained from Paget, the owner of R.J. Motor Sports.\n\n             On September 24, 2002, a jury found Santana guilty of\n\nconspiring to possess and possessing with intent to distribute\n\nbetween one-half and five kilograms of cocaine.                    He was sentenced\n\nto   121   months   imprisonment      to    be     followed   by    four   years   of\n\nsupervised release and ordered to forfeit money, certain real\n\nproperty and an automobile.           This appeal followed.\n\n                                II.    Discussion\n\nA.   Motion to Suppress Wiretaps\n\n             An   April   27,   2001,      order    permitting      wiretapping    of\n\nNickerson's       telephone     identified         Santana    as      a    potential\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\finterceptee.1      Conversations on that line between Santana and\n\nNickerson were recorded on May 7 and May 9, 2001.              Santana appeals\n\nthe district court's denial of his motion to suppress the evidence\n\nand his request for a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S.\n\n154, 155 (1978).      The government does not contend that Santana\n\nlacks standing to seek suppression of the wiretap evidence.\n\n             Santana claims that the wiretap violated Title III of the\n\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2510-2522 (2000) (\"Title III\") -- the federal statute governing\n\nelectronic surveillance -- because (1) probable cause did not exist\n\nto support the wiretap and (2) there was no required showing of\n\nnecessity for the wiretap.         He also asserts that a Franks hearing\n\nwas    warranted   because    of   material      misrepresentations      by   the\n\naffiant.\n\n             First, Santana asserts that while the government had\n\nprobable cause to suspect Nickerson was committing or would commit\n\na crime, it lacked probable cause to identify Santana as involved\n\nin criminal activity and therefore had no right to identify Santana\n\nas    an   interceptee.      We   review    de   novo   the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that the facts in the affidavit constituted probable\n\ncause. United States v. Strother, 318 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nAny findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.                   Id.      Our\n\n\n\n1\n  The government may record conversations only between the target\ntelephone and identified interceptees.\n\n                                      -5-\n\finquiry is whether the affidavit \"provided a sufficient basis for\n\na finding of probable cause,\"   United States v. Scibelli, 549 F.2d\n\n222, 226 (1st Cir. 1977); that is, we must determine \"if the facts\n\nset forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the\n\ndetermination that was made.\"    United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,\n\n325 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003).         Probable cause exists when the\n\naffidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood\n\nthat an offense has been or is being committed.      United States v.\n\nVigeant, 176 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The affidavit contains the following information about\n\nSantana:2 that an informant knew Santana was Nickerson's cocaine\n\nsupplier for many years and as recently as two months before the\n\naffidavit was made; that the informant (correctly) knew that\n\nSantana had previously been arrested on drug charges and that\n\nSantana's brother was in prison following a drug conviction; and\n\nthat several phone calls had been placed from Nickerson (the\n\nprimary target of the investigation and wiretap) to the cell phone\n\nof Santana's girlfriend and to Santana's ex-wife, and that Santana\n\nwas thought to use each of those phones.       We therefore find that\n\nthere was a sufficient basis for the issuing judge to determine\n\n\n\n\n2\n    We note that the apartment number of Santana's ex-wife is\nincorrect in several places in the affidavit. This error is not\nmaterial because even when it is excised from the affidavit, there\nis probable cause. See United States v. Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d\n12, 34 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat Santana was committing, had committed, or was about to commit\n\nthe listed drug-related crimes.\n\n           Second, Santana asserts that the government did not\n\ndemonstrate necessity for the wiretap.            The necessity requirement\n\nunder   Title    III   requires    that    the    government's      interception\n\napplication include \"a full and complete statement as to whether or\n\nnot other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or\n\nwhy they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to\n\nbe too dangerous.\"      18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c).         The application must\n\n\"demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable, good faith\n\neffort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before\n\nresorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of\n\ntelephone calls.\" United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227, 1237 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).     However, the government need not demonstrate that it\n\nexhausted all investigative procedures.             United States v. López,\n\n300 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2002).           When reviewing the government's\n\nshowing   of    necessity,   our   role     \"is   not   to   make    a   de   novo\n\ndetermination of sufficiency as if [we] were [the issuing judge],\n\nbut to decide if the facts set forth in the application were\n\nminimally adequate to support the determination that was made.\"\n\nId. at 53 (quotation omitted); see also United States v. Ashley,\n\n876 F.2d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"The government affidavit is\n\nadequate if it satisfies the burden that it indicate a 'reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\flikelihood' that alternative techniques would fail to expose the\n\ncrime.\").\n\n            We find that the government's application contained the\n\nrequired details regarding its inability to pursue the criminal\n\nactivity through less intrusive means. The affidavit stated, among\n\nother things,    that       physical    surveillance      and    the   use   of   pen\n\nregister    information      had   been   employed;       that   no    confidential\n\ninformants were available to purchase drugs; that not enough\n\ninformation was known to seek a search warrant; and that garbage\n\nsearches were not possible.            The affiant therefore stated that a\n\nwiretap was necessary to uncover the full scope of the conspiracy,\n\nincluding conclusive proof of identity and information as to how\n\nthe drug sales were made.          See Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d at 9-10\n\n(showing of necessity made under similar circumstanced).                     We find\n\nthat the affidavit does not fall below the standard of minimal\n\nadequacy.    See Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d at 33.\n\n            Finally,    a    Franks     hearing      is   required      \"where    the\n\ndefendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false\n\nstatement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard\n\nfor   the   truth,   was     included     by   the   affiant     in    the   warrant\n\naffidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the\n\nfinding of probable cause.\"            Franks, 438 U.S. at 155.          A district\n\ncourt's determination that the requisite showing for a Franks\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fhearing has not been made is overturned only if clearly erroneous.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Here, there was no clear error in the district court's\n\ndenial of a Franks hearing.        The only error identified by Santana\n\nis a reference to the wrong apartment unit number.             The government\n\nsubmitted an affidavit that the error was, at most, negligent, and\n\nSantana has no evidence to suggest that it was done knowingly or\n\nintentionally.       See United States v. Adams, 305 F.3d 30, 36 n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (noting that \"[m]ere inaccuracies, even negligent\n\nones, are not enough\" to warrant a Franks hearing).                    Santana\n\nasserts that the apartment listing was done with reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth because the surveilling officer was not the affiant,\n\nand the affiant did not verify the apartment number.                Failure to\n\ninvestigate, however, does not evidence a reckless disregard for\n\nthe truth.        United States v. Ranney, 298 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n            Moreover,     even   if   Santana   were    able   to    meet   the\n\npreliminary hurdle in seeking a Franks hearing, he has not shown\n\nthat     absent    the   false   information    the    affidavit     contained\n\ninsufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause.               As\n\nwe explained above, the exact apartment unit number of Santana's\n\nex-wife was not necessary to demonstrate probable cause.\n\n            We hold that the affidavit supporting the application to\n\nintercept calls from Nickerson's cellular phone to Santana showed\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fprobable cause, made the required demonstration of necessity, and\n\ndid not contain egregious misrepresentations necessitating a Franks\n\nhearing.     The district court properly admitted evidence of the\n\ntelephone calls between Santana and Nickerson.\n\nB.   Evidence of Prior Criminal Acts\n\n           Santana also challenges the district court's decision to\n\nallow introduction of a prior drug conspiracy between him and\n\nNickerson.     We review the admission of prior bad act evidence for\n\nabuse of discretion.     United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113,\n\n118 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Santana was charged with participating in a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine from\n\nsometime \"in or about 1997\" until May 2001.         At trial, however,\n\nNickerson testified that his former drug supplier introduced him to\n\nSantana around 1992, and he bought one-half to one ounce of cocaine\n\nfrom Santana every week or two until some point in 1996.           Nickerson\n\nstated that Santana usually \"fronted\" him the cocaine.             Nickerson\n\nsaid that he stopped buying cocaine in 1996 and Santana told him to\n\ncontact him in the future if he wanted to buy drugs again.\n\nNickerson further testified that he approached Santana in 1997 and\n\nresumed purchasing cocaine from Santana.        Santana was charged and\n\nconvicted for this second relationship.\n\n             Santana objected to Nickerson's testimony about their\n\nfirst   drug   conspiracy.    The    district   court   gave   a    limiting\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\finstruction,    informing     the    jury       that    it     could   only    consider\n\nNickerson's testimony in deciding how the charged conspiracy or a\n\ntrust relationship was formed, how the conspiracy operated, the\n\nidentity of Santana, and Nickerson's credibility.                      Santana argues\n\nthat   any   probative     value    of    the    testimony       was    substantially\n\noutweighed by its prejudice and should not have been admitted.\n\n             Evidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to show bad\n\ncharacter and consequent propensity to commit crimes, but may be\n\nadmitted if it satisfies a two-part analysis: \"First, the past\n\nincident     must   have   some     relevance          other    than    to    show   the\n\ndefendant's propensity to commit the crime.                        Second, even if\n\nspecially relevant, the danger of prejudice cannot substantially\n\noutweigh the probative value of the evidence.\"                     United States v.\n\nAgudelo, 988 F.2d 285, 287 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations omitted); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Evid. 403, 404(b).\n\n             Reviewing the evidence here and the limiting instruction\n\ngiven by the trial judge, we find no abuse of discretion.                        It is\n\nproper to include evidence of prior bad acts in conspiracy cases if\n\nthey \"explain the background, formation, and development of the\n\nillegal relationship and, more specifically, to help the jury\n\nunderstand the basis for the co-conspirators' relationship of\n\nmutual trust.\"      United States v. Escobar-de Jesús, 187 F.3d 148,\n\n169 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal citations omitted).                             Santana's\n\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that the evidence had \"special\"\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fprobative value.          The question is whether its probative value was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n            All of Nickerson's testimony, including the details of\n\ntheir drug     dealings        in     the    early       1990's,      was    prejudicial    to\n\nSantana; it was not an abuse of discretion, though, to find that\n\nthe   prejudice     did     not      substantially         outweigh         the   testimony's\n\nprobative    value.            First,       the   trial        court    gave      a   limiting\n\ninstruction.       See United States v. Vest, 842 F.2d 1319, 1327 (1st\n\nCir. 1988) (finding that prejudicial effect can be reduced by\n\nissuing an appropriate limiting instruction).                          Second, although we\n\nare   concerned     about       the     length      of    time     between        Santana   and\n\nNickerson's       first    meeting       and      Santana's        arrest,        their   early\n\nrelationship was similar to the charged conspiracy and explained\n\nhow the later drug conspiracy was formed.                          See United States v.\n\nFrankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Probative value\n\nmust be considered in light of the remoteness in time of the other\n\nact   and   the    degree       of    resemblance         to    the    crime      charged.\").\n\nFinally, there was other evidence regarding Santana's involvement\n\nin the drug conspiracy, including surveillance evidence, recorded\n\nphone calls, and Nickerson's testimony that he purchased cocaine\n\nfrom Santana up to and including May 9, 2001.                         Cf. United States v.\n\nAguilar-Aranceta,         58    F.3d     796,     801     (1st     Cir.     1995)     (holding\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in admitting testimony where\n\nthe prior conviction was the only evidence of knowing possession).\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\f              We have noted the difficulty of balancing probative value\n\nand prejudice in this situation:\n\n              The more similar the prior bad act evidence is\n              to the charged crime, the more likely it is to\n              be deemed relevant under 404(b). Yet the more\n              the prior bad act resembles the crime, the\n              more likely it is that the jury will infer\n              that a defendant who committed the prior bad\n              act would be likely to commit the crime\n              charged.\n\nVaroudakis, 233 F.3d at 123.           While we might have weighed the\n\nprejudicial effect and probative value differently, the district\n\ncourt   did    not   abuse   its   discretion   in   admitting   Nickerson's\n\ntestimony.     See id. at 122 (\"The district court's determination on\n\nthis issue merits great deference on appeal.\").\n\nC.   Agent's Testimony\n\n              Finally, Santana contends that the district court erred\n\nin allowing certain expert testimony from DEA Agent Jean Drouin.\n\nWe review that evidentiary decision for an abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. López-López, 282 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2002).           The\n\nhallmark of abuse of discretion review is deference.               See Gen.\n\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 143 (1997).\n\n              Santana also appeals the district court's denial of his\n\nmotion for a mistrial as a result of Drouin's testimony.           We review\n\nthat decision only for a manifest abuse of discretion, and \"we will\n\nuphold the court's ruling unless the movant demonstrates a clear\n\nshowing of prejudice.\"        Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d at 14.\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          Agent Drouin was surveilling Nickerson on May 7, 2001,\n\nwhen Nickerson entered R.J. Motor Sports and emerged carrying a bag\n\ncontaining a box-like object with rounded corners.    Shortly after\n\nbeing seen carrying the suspicious bag, Nickerson placed a phone\n\ncall to Ricky Rano, one of his customers, stating, \"Thank you in\n\nhand!\" -- a call which investigators understood to inform the\n\ncustomer that drugs were available.    Investigators had information\n\nthat Paget (the owner of R.J. Motor Sports) supplied Nickerson with\n\nmarijuana, which he then sold to Rano.       Drouin did not arrest\n\nNickerson that day.\n\n          Nickerson was not arrested until May 9, 2001 -- the day\n\nhe made a phone call to Santana and allegedly met with Santana\n\ninside the Brook Village Road apartment complex.     When Nickerson\n\nwas arrested, he had eight ounces of cocaine in his car.        The\n\nprosecution alleged that he received the cocaine from Santana the\n\nday of his arrest.    The defense, however, argued that the cocaine\n\ncould have come from Paget on May 7, when Nickerson carried a bag\n\nout of R.J. Motor Sports.\n\n          Agent Drouin testified for the prosecution.    When asked\n\nwhy he did not arrest Nickerson on May 7, he responded that he\n\n\"knew it was marijuana.\" Asked the basis for his knowledge, Drouin\n\nanswered that it was based on the characteristics of the package,\n\nintercepted telephone calls, and controlled buys from Rano, and\n\nadded \"we knew Alfred Nickerson was picking up what Ricky Rano\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fwanted, which was marijuana.\"    Drouin also testified that when he\n\nsearched Nickerson's home on May 9, he smelled marijuana; he then\n\ndiscovered a wrapping containing marijuana residue that was similar\n\nto the wrapping on the package Nickerson carried on May 7.\n\n           Santana raises two distinct evidentiary appeals.     First,\n\nhe alleges that it was error to allow testimony that Drouin could\n\nsmell marijuana during the search of Nickerson's home, stating\n\n\"[i]t should have been excluded under Rule 701 of the Rules of\n\nEvidence because it was not 'rationally based on the perception of\n\nthe witness,' and because it was not helpful to the determination\n\nof a fact in issue, as well as because it did not meet the criteria\n\nin Rule 702 and case law.\"\n\n           We find Santana's first evidentiary challenge meritless.\n\nIt is axiomatic that a witness may testify as to his personal\n\nknowledge -- here, what he smelled.      Fed. R. Evid. 602; see also\n\nSheek v. Asia Badger, Inc., 235 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nThere was a sufficient foundation for this testimony because Drouin\n\ntestified that his job exposed him to marijuana, and another\n\nwitness testified that marijuana residue was found on the wrapper.\n\nSee United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 157 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(holding   that   past   experience    and   personal   knowledge   and\n\nobservation may qualify a lay witness to identify drugs).           The\n\ncontent of the wrapper was in issue because the defense wanted the\n\njury to infer that it could be cocaine, while the government\n\n\n                                -15-\n\falleged that it was marijuana. Santana suggests for the first time\n\non appeal that the testimony should have been excluded under Rule\n\n702.    However, Drouin's testimony as to what he smelled was based\n\non his perception and therefore he was not required to qualify as\n\nan expert under Rule 702.          It was not an abuse of discretion to\n\nadmit Drouin's lay opinion testimony that he smelled marijuana\n\nduring a search of Nickerson's home.             See id.\n\n              Next, Santana asserts that Drouin was not qualified to\n\ngive either a lay or expert opinion that he \"knew\" what was in the\n\npackage Nickerson was carrying.             The defense objected and also\n\nmoved   for    a   mistrial,    arguing   that    the   evidence   irreparably\n\nprejudiced Santana's right to a fair trial because the theory of\n\nthe defense was that the package contained the cocaine that was\n\nlater discovered in Nickerson's car.\n\n              We find that any error in permitting Drouin to testify\n\nthat he knew Nickerson carried marijuana, and not cocaine, on\n\nMay 7, was harmless.      See United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (noting that harmless error applies to evidentiary\n\nrulings).     The defense was able to cross-examine Drouin to expose\n\nperception difficulties including the fact that Drouin watched\n\nNickerson from across a busy street.          Drouin also stated on cross-\n\nexamination that he only \"knew\" what was in the bag because of the\n\nongoing investigation.         Moreover, Nickerson himself testified that\n\nhe was carrying marijuana in the bag Drouin saw him carrying out of\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fR.J. Motor Sports that day.      Any error in allowing Drouin to\n\ntestify that Nickerson had marijuana did not likely affect the\n\noutcome and was therefore harmless.     See United States v. Brown,\n\n938 F.2d 1482, 1488 (1st Cir. 1988) (finding erroneous admission of\n\nevidence harmless because it was not crucial to the conviction).\n\nFinally, because Santana has not demonstrated clear prejudice, we\n\nuphold the district court's denial of his motion for a mistrial.\n\nSee Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d at 14.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          Santana's conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

After considering Santana's challenges, which were ably briefed and well argued, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies began an investigation of suspected cocaine and marijuana traffickers in southern New Hampshire. They debriefed informants, used undercover agents to attempt to purchase drugs, conducted physical surveillance, and reviewed telephone records. In addition, beginning February 22, 2001, law enforcement agencies conducted court authorized wire taps on four telephone numbers, including a cellular telephone belonging to Alfred Nickerson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Telephone calls between Nickerson and Santana were recorded on May 7 and May 9, 2001. Based on those calls and other information gathered during their investigation, law enforcement agents believed Santana regularly supplied cocaine to Nickerson and that a drug transfer was going to take place May 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 10:30 a.m. on May 9, an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") saw Santana enter the apartment complex at 210 Brook Village Road in Nashua, New Hampshire, where Santana's ex-wife lives. Santana left about 1:00 p.m., accompanied by an unidentified male. Santana spoke briefly and shook hands with this man before driving away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on May 9, investigators were watching Nickerson. Leaving his home at about 9:05 a.m., he stopped at several Nashua businesses including R.J. Motor Sports. This stop is significant because agents watched Nickerson leave R.J. Motor Sports May 7 with a package. At trial, the government alleged that Nickerson obtained marijuana from Roger Paget, the owner of R.J. Motor Sports. The defense argued at trial that Nickerson's cocaine also came from Paget.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, Nickerson left R.J. Motor Sports empty-handed. He then drove to the Brook Village Road apartment complex, arriving at approximately 12:30 p.m. and leaving (alone) fifteen minutes later. The surveilling officer saw him enter the complex, but could not identify which apartment, if any, he entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Believing that Nickerson and Santana made a drug transaction inside the Brook Village Road complex, investigators ordered state troopers to stop Nickerson's car. Nickerson was \"clearly nervous\"; the trooper ordered him out of the car to ensure her safety. She then found what she believed to be marijuana in Nickerson's car and arrested him. An inventory search of Nickerson's car yielded approximately eight ounces of cocaine, four ounces of marijuana, a digital scale, an address book, and more than one thousand dollars. After his arrest, Nickerson agreed to become a government informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury indicted Santana on April 10, 2002, and he was arrested on April 11, 2002 and charged with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine between 1997 and May 2001. At Santana's trial, Nickerson testified that Santana had been his long-time supplier of cocaine and that he purchased cocaine from Santana up to and including the day of Nickerson's arrest &#8212; May 9, 2001. Nickerson said that he and Santana had little social interaction and mainly communicated about drugs. Nickerson also testified that he used and sold marijuana, which he obtained from Paget, the owner of R.J. Motor Sports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 2002, a jury found Santana guilty of conspiring to possess and possessing with intent to distribute between one-half and five kilograms of cocaine. He was sentenced to 121 months imprisonment to be followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit money, certain real property and an automobile. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Suppress Wiretaps</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An April 27, 2001, order permitting wiretapping of Nickerson's telephone identified Santana as a potential interceptee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Conversations on that line between Santana and Nickerson were recorded on May 7 and May 9, 2001. Santana appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the evidence and his request for a hearing under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> 438 U.S. 154, 155, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). The government does not contend that Santana lacks standing to seek suppression of the wiretap evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana claims that the wiretap violated Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-2522 (2000) (\"Title III\") &#8212; the federal statute governing electronic surveillance &#8212; because (1) probable cause did not exist to support the wiretap and (2) there was no required showing of necessity for the wiretap. He also asserts that a <i>Franks</i> hearing was warranted because of material misrepresentations by the affiant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Santana asserts that while the government had probable cause to suspect Nickerson was committing or would commit a crime, it lacked probable cause to identify Santana as involved in criminal activity and therefore had no right to identify Santana as an interceptee. We review de novo the district court's determination that the facts in the affidavit constituted probable cause. <i>United States v. Strother,</i> 318 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir.2003). Any findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i> Our inquiry is whether the affidavit \"provided a sufficient basis for a finding of probable cause,\" <i>United States v. Scibelli,</i> 549 F.2d 222, 226 (1st Cir.1977); that is, we must determine \"if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made.\" <i>United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2003). Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed. <i>United States v. Vigeant,</i> 176 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit contains the following information about Santana:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> that an informant knew Santana was Nickerson's cocaine supplier for many years and as recently as two months before the affidavit was made; that the informant (correctly) knew that Santana had previously been arrested on drug charges and that Santana's brother was in prison following a drug conviction; and that several phone calls had been placed from Nickerson (the primary target of the investigation and wiretap) to the cell phone of Santana's girlfriend and to Santana's ex-wife, and that Santana was thought to use each of those phones. We therefore find that there was a sufficient basis for the issuing judge to determine that Santana was committing, had committed, or was about to commit the listed drug-related crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Santana asserts that the government did not demonstrate necessity for the wiretap. The necessity requirement under Title III requires that the government's interception application include \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c). The application must \"demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.\" <i>United States v. London,</i> 66 F.3d 1227, 1237 (1st Cir.1995). However, the government need not demonstrate that it exhausted all investigative procedures. <i>United States v. L&#243;pez,</i> 300 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir.2002). When reviewing the government's showing of necessity, our role \"is not to make a de novo determination of sufficiency as if [we] were [the issuing judge], but to decide if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 53 (quotation omitted); <i>see also United States v. Ashley,</i> 876 F.2d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir.1989) (\"The government affidavit is adequate if it satisfies the burden that it indicate a `reasonable likelihood' that alternative techniques would fail to expose the crime.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the government's application contained the required details regarding its inability to pursue the criminal activity through less intrusive means. The affidavit stated, among other things, that physical surveillance and the use of pen register information had been employed; that no confidential informants were available to purchase drugs; that not enough information was known to seek a search warrant; and that garbage searches were not possible. The affiant therefore stated that a wiretap was necessary to uncover the full scope of the conspiracy, including conclusive proof of identity and information as to how the drug sales were made. <i>See Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 9-10 (showing of necessity made under similar circumstanced). We find that the affidavit does not fall below the standard of minimal adequacy. <i>See Nelson-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 319 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a <i>Franks</i> hearing is required \"where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155, 98 S.Ct. 2674. A district court's determination that the requisite showing for a <i>Franks</i> hearing has not been made is overturned only if clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no clear error in the district court's denial of a <i>Franks</i> hearing. The only error identified by Santana is a reference to the wrong apartment unit number. The government submitted an affidavit that the error was, at most, negligent, and Santana has no evidence to suggest that it was done knowingly or intentionally. <i>See United States v. Adams,</i> 305 F.3d 30, 36 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"[m]ere inaccuracies, even negligent ones, are not enough\" to warrant a <i>Franks</i> hearing). Santana asserts that the apartment listing was done with reckless disregard for the truth because the surveilling officer was not the affiant, and the affiant did not verify the apartment number. Failure to investigate, however, does not evidence a reckless disregard for the truth. <i>United States v. Ranney,</i> 298 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if Santana were able to meet the preliminary hurdle in seeking a <i>Franks</i> hearing, he has not shown that absent the false information the affidavit contained insufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause. As we explained above, the exact apartment unit number of Santana's ex-wife was not necessary to demonstrate probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the affidavit supporting the application to intercept calls from Nickerson's cellular phone to Santana showed probable cause, made the required demonstration of necessity, and did not contain egregious misrepresentations necessitating a <i>Franks</i> hearing. The district court properly admitted evidence of the telephone calls between Santana and Nickerson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidence of Prior Criminal Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana also challenges the district court's decision to allow introduction of a prior drug conspiracy between him and Nickerson. We review the admission of prior bad act evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 118 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana was charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine from sometime \"in or about 1997\" until May 2001. At trial, however, Nickerson testified that his former drug supplier introduced him to Santana around 1992, and he bought one-half to one ounce of cocaine from Santana every week or two until some point in 1996. Nickerson stated that Santana usually \"fronted\" him the cocaine. Nickerson said that he stopped buying cocaine in 1996 and Santana told him to contact him in the future if he wanted to buy drugs again. Nickerson further testified that he approached Santana in 1997 and resumed purchasing cocaine from Santana. Santana was charged and convicted for this second relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana objected to Nickerson's testimony about their first drug conspiracy. The district court gave a limiting instruction, informing the jury that it could only consider Nickerson's testimony in deciding how the charged conspiracy or a trust relationship was formed, how the conspiracy operated, the identity of Santana, and Nickerson's credibility. Santana argues that any probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by its prejudice and should not have been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to show bad character and consequent propensity to commit crimes, but may be admitted if it satisfies a two-part analysis: \"First, the past incident must have some relevance other than to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime. Second, even if specially relevant, the danger of prejudice cannot substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Agudelo,</i> 988 F.2d 285, 287 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing the evidence here and the limiting instruction given by the trial judge, we find no abuse of discretion. It is proper to include evidence of prior bad acts in conspiracy cases if they \"explain the background, formation, and development of the illegal relationship and, more specifically, to help the jury understand the basis for the co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust.\" <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 169 (1st Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted). Santana's counsel conceded at oral argument that the evidence had \"special\" probative value. The question is whether its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of Nickerson's testimony, including the details of their drug dealings in the early 1990's, was prejudicial to Santana; it was not an abuse of discretion, though, to find that the prejudice did not substantially outweigh the testimony's probative value. First, the trial court gave a limiting instruction. <i>See United States v. Vest,</i> 842 F.2d 1319, 1327 (1st Cir.1988) (finding that prejudicial effect can be reduced by issuing an appropriate limiting instruction). Second, although we are concerned about the length of time between Santana and Nickerson's first meeting and Santana's arrest, their early relationship was similar to the charged conspiracy and explained how the later drug conspiracy was formed. <i>See United States v. Frankhauser,</i> 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Probative value must be considered in light of the remoteness in time of the other act and the degree of resemblance to the crime charged.\"). Finally, there was other evidence regarding Santana's involvement in the drug conspiracy, including surveillance evidence, recorded phone calls, and Nickerson's testimony that he purchased cocaine from Santana up to and including May 9, 2001. <i>Cf. United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta,</i> 58 F.3d 796, 801 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding district court abused its discretion in admitting testimony where the prior conviction was the only evidence of knowing possession).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted the difficulty of balancing probative value and prejudice in this situation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more similar the prior bad act evidence is to the charged crime, the more likely it is to be deemed relevant under 404(b).

While we might have weighed the prejudicial effect and probative value differently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Nickerson's testimony. <i>See id.</i> at 122 (\"The district court's determination on this issue merits great deference on appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Agent's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Santana contends that the district court erred in allowing certain expert testimony from DEA Agent Jean Drouin. We review that evidentiary decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2002). The hallmark of abuse of discretion review is deference. <i>See Gen. Elec. Co. v.

We review that decision only for a manifest abuse of discretion, and \"we will uphold the court's ruling unless the movant demonstrates a clear showing of prejudice.\" <i>Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Drouin was surveilling Nickerson on May 7, 2001, when Nickerson entered R.J. Motor Sports and emerged carrying a bag containing a box-like object with rounded corners. Shortly after being seen carrying the suspicious bag, Nickerson placed a phone call to Ricky Rano, one of his customers, stating, \"Thank you in hand!\" &#8212; a call which investigators understood to inform the customer that drugs were available. Investigators had information that Paget (the owner of R.J. Motor Sports) supplied Nickerson with marijuana, which he then sold to Rano. Drouin did not arrest Nickerson that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nickerson was not arrested until May 9, 2001 &#8212; the day he made a phone call to Santana and allegedly met with Santana inside the Brook Village Road apartment complex. When Nickerson was arrested, he had eight ounces of cocaine in his car. The prosecution alleged that he received the cocaine from Santana the day of his arrest. The defense, however, argued that the cocaine could have come from Paget on May 7, when Nickerson carried a bag out of R.J. Motor Sports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Drouin testified for the prosecution. When asked why he did not arrest Nickerson on May 7, he responded that he \"knew it was marijuana.\" Asked the basis for his knowledge, Drouin answered that it was based on the characteristics of the package, intercepted telephone calls, and controlled buys from Rano, and added \"we knew Alfred Nickerson was picking up what Ricky Rano wanted, which was marijuana.\" Drouin also testified that when he searched Nickerson's home on May 9, he smelled marijuana; he then discovered a wrapping containing marijuana residue that was similar to the wrapping on the package Nickerson carried on May 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana raises two distinct evidentiary appeals. First, he alleges that it was error to allow testimony that Drouin could smell marijuana during the search of Nickerson's home, stating \"[i]t should have been excluded under Rule 701 of the Rules of Evidence because it was not `rationally based on the perception of the witness,' and because it was not helpful to the determination of a fact in issue, as well as because it did not meet the criteria in Rule 702 and case law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Santana's first evidentiary challenge meritless. It is axiomatic that a witness may testify as to his personal knowledge &#8212; here, what he smelled. Fed. R.Evid. 602; <i>see also Sheek v. Asia Badger,</i> <i>Inc.,</i> 235 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir.2000). There was a sufficient foundation for this testimony because Drouin testified that his job exposed him to marijuana, and another witness testified that marijuana residue was found on the wrapper. <i>See United States v. Paiva,</i> 892 F.2d 148, 157 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that past experience and personal knowledge and observation may qualify a lay witness to identify drugs). The content of the wrapper was in issue because the defense wanted the jury to infer that it could be cocaine, while the government alleged that it was marijuana. Santana suggests for the first time on appeal that the testimony should have been excluded under Rule 702. However, Drouin's testimony as to what he smelled was based on his perception and therefore he was not required to qualify as an expert under Rule 702. It was not an abuse of discretion to admit Drouin's lay opinion testimony that he smelled marijuana during a search of Nickerson's home. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Santana asserts that Drouin was not qualified to give either a lay or expert opinion that he \"knew\" what was in the package Nickerson was carrying. The defense objected and also moved for a mistrial, arguing that the evidence irreparably prejudiced Santana's right to a fair trial because the theory of the defense was that the package contained the cocaine that was later discovered in Nickerson's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that any error in permitting Drouin to testify that he knew Nickerson carried marijuana, and not cocaine, on May 7, was harmless. <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30, 46 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that harmless error applies to evidentiary rulings). The defense was able to cross-examine Drouin to expose perception difficulties including the fact that Drouin watched Nickerson from across a busy street. Drouin also stated on cross-examination that he only \"knew\" what was in the bag because of the ongoing investigation. Moreover, Nickerson himself testified that he was carrying marijuana in the bag Drouin saw him carrying out of R.J. Motor Sports that day. Any error in allowing Drouin to testify that Nickerson had marijuana did not likely affect the outcome and was therefore harmless. <i>See United States v. Brown,</i> 938 F.2d 1482, 1488 (1st Cir.1991) (finding erroneous admission of evidence harmless because it was not crucial to the conviction). Finally, because Santana has not demonstrated clear prejudice, we uphold the district court's denial of his motion for a mistrial. <i>See Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

After considering Santana's challenges, which were ably briefed and well argued, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies began an investigation of suspected cocaine and marijuana traffickers in southern New Hampshire. They debriefed informants, used undercover agents to attempt to purchase drugs, conducted physical surveillance, and reviewed telephone records. In addition, beginning February 22, 2001, law enforcement agencies conducted court authorized wire taps on four telephone numbers, including a cellular telephone belonging to Alfred Nickerson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Telephone calls between Nickerson and Santana were recorded on May 7 and May 9, 2001. Based on those calls and other information gathered during their investigation, law enforcement agents believed Santana regularly supplied cocaine to Nickerson and that a drug transfer was going to take place May 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about 10:30 a.m. on May 9, an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") saw Santana enter the apartment complex at 210 Brook Village Road in Nashua, New Hampshire, where Santana's ex-wife lives. Santana left about 1:00 p.m., accompanied by an unidentified male. Santana spoke briefly and shook hands with this man before driving away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on May 9, investigators were watching Nickerson. Leaving his home at about 9:05 a.m., he stopped at several Nashua businesses including R.J. Motor Sports. This stop is significant because agents watched Nickerson leave R.J. Motor Sports May 7 with a package. At trial, the government alleged that Nickerson obtained marijuana from Roger Paget, the owner of R.J. Motor Sports. The defense argued at trial that Nickerson's cocaine also came from Paget.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 9, Nickerson left R.J. Motor Sports empty-handed. He then drove to the Brook Village Road apartment complex, arriving at approximately 12:30 p.m. and leaving (alone) fifteen minutes later. The surveilling officer saw him enter the complex, but could not identify which apartment, if any, he entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Believing that Nickerson and Santana made a drug transaction inside the Brook Village Road complex, investigators ordered state troopers to stop Nickerson's car. Nickerson was \"clearly nervous\"; the trooper ordered him out of the car to ensure her safety. She then found what she believed to be marijuana in Nickerson's car and arrested him. An inventory search of Nickerson's car yielded approximately eight ounces of cocaine, four ounces of marijuana, a digital scale, an address book, and more than one thousand dollars. After his arrest, Nickerson agreed to become a government informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury indicted Santana on April 10, 2002, and he was arrested on April 11, 2002 and charged with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine between 1997 and May 2001. At Santana's trial, Nickerson testified that Santana had been his long-time supplier of cocaine and that he purchased cocaine from Santana up to and including the day of Nickerson's arrest &#8212; May 9, 2001. Nickerson said that he and Santana had little social interaction and mainly communicated about drugs. Nickerson also testified that he used and sold marijuana, which he obtained from Paget, the owner of R.J. Motor Sports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 2002, a jury found Santana guilty of conspiring to possess and possessing with intent to distribute between one-half and five kilograms of cocaine. He was sentenced to 121 months imprisonment to be followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit money, certain real property and an automobile.

Santana appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress the evidence and his request for a hearing under <i>Franks v. Delaware,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 155, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He also asserts that a <i>Franks</i> hearing was warranted because of material misrepresentations by the affiant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Santana asserts that while the government had probable cause to suspect Nickerson was committing or would commit a crime, it lacked probable cause to identify Santana as involved in criminal activity and therefore had no right to identify Santana as an interceptee. We review de novo the district court's determination that the facts in the affidavit constituted probable cause. <i>United States v.

Any findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i> Our inquiry is whether the affidavit \"provided a sufficient basis for a finding of probable cause,\" <i>United States v.

Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed. <i>United States v.

We therefore find that there was a sufficient basis for the issuing judge to determine that Santana was committing, had committed, or was about to commit the listed drug-related crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Santana asserts that the government did not demonstrate necessity for the wiretap. The necessity requirement under Title III requires that the government's interception application include \"a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2518(1)(c). The application must \"demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.\" <i>United States v. London,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196355\"><a href=\"/opinion/196355/united-states-v-london/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1237 (1st Cir.1995). However, the government need not demonstrate that it exhausted all investigative procedures. <i>United States v.

When reviewing the government's showing of necessity, our role \"is not to make a de novo determination of sufficiency as if [we] were [the issuing judge], but to decide if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made.\" <i>Id.</i> at 53 (quotation omitted); <i>see also United States v.

The affidavit stated, among other things, that physical surveillance and the use of pen register information had been employed; that no confidential informants were available to purchase drugs; that not enough information was known to seek a search warrant; and that garbage searches were not possible. The affiant therefore stated that a wiretap was necessary to uncover the full scope of the conspiracy, including conclusive proof of identity and information as to how the drug sales were made. <i>See Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 9-10 (showing of necessity made under similar circumstanced). We find that the affidavit does not fall below the standard of minimal adequacy. <i>See Nelson-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 319 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, a <i>Franks</i> hearing is required \"where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\" <i>Franks,</i> 438 U.S. at 155, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2674</span></a></span>. A district court's determination that the requisite showing for a <i>Franks</i> hearing has not been made is overturned only if clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was no clear error in the district court's denial of a <i>Franks</i> hearing. The only error identified by Santana is a reference to the wrong apartment unit number. The government submitted an affidavit that the error was, at most, negligent, and Santana has no evidence to suggest that it was done knowingly or intentionally. <i>See United States v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200132\"><a href=\"/opinion/200132/united-states-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 36 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"[m]ere inaccuracies, even negligent ones, are not enough\" to warrant a <i>Franks</i> hearing). Santana asserts that the apartment listing was done with reckless disregard for the truth because the surveilling officer was not the affiant, and the affiant did not verify the apartment number. Failure to investigate, however, does not evidence a reckless disregard for the truth. <i>United States v.

Evidence of Prior Criminal Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana also challenges the district court's decision to allow introduction of a prior drug conspiracy between him and Nickerson. We review the admission of prior bad act evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Varoudakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199172\"><a href=\"/opinion/199172/united-states-v-varoudakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana was charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine from sometime \"in or about 1997\" until May 2001. At trial, however, Nickerson testified that his former drug supplier introduced him to Santana around 1992, and he bought one-half to one ounce of cocaine from Santana every week or two until some point in 1996. Nickerson stated that Santana usually \"fronted\" him the cocaine. Nickerson said that he stopped buying cocaine in 1996 and Santana told him to contact him in the future if he wanted to buy drugs again. Nickerson further testified that he approached Santana in 1997 and resumed purchasing cocaine from Santana. Santana was charged and convicted for this second relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana objected to Nickerson's testimony about their first drug conspiracy. The district court gave a limiting instruction, informing the jury that it could only consider Nickerson's testimony in deciding how the charged conspiracy or a trust relationship was formed, how the conspiracy operated, the identity of Santana, and Nickerson's credibility. Santana argues that any probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by its prejudice and should not have been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to show bad character and consequent propensity to commit crimes, but may be admitted if it satisfies a two-part analysis: \"First, the past incident must have some relevance other than to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime. Second, even if specially relevant, the danger of prejudice cannot substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Agudelo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602349\"><a href=\"/opinion/602349/united-states-v-jorge-eliecer-agudelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span>, 287 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing the evidence here and the limiting instruction given by the trial judge, we find no abuse of discretion. It is proper to include evidence of prior bad acts in conspiracy cases if they \"explain the background, formation, and development of the illegal relationship and, more specifically, to help the jury understand the basis for the co-conspirators' relationship of mutual trust.\" <i>United States v. Escobar-de Jes&#250;s,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 169 (1st Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted). Santana's counsel conceded at oral argument that the evidence had \"special\" probative value. The question is whether its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of Nickerson's testimony, including the details of their drug dealings in the early 1990's, was prejudicial to Santana; it was not an abuse of discretion, though, to find that the prejudice did not substantially outweigh the testimony's probative value. First, the trial court gave a limiting instruction. <i>See United States v. Vest,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503754\"><a href=\"/opinion/503754/united-states-v-george-h-vest/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, 1327 (1st Cir.1988) (finding that prejudicial effect can be reduced by issuing an appropriate limiting instruction). Second, although we are concerned about the length of time between Santana and Nickerson's first meeting and Santana's arrest, their early relationship was similar to the charged conspiracy and explained how the later drug conspiracy was formed. <i>See United States v. Frankhauser,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196693\"><a href=\"/opinion/196693/united-states-v-frankhauser/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Probative value must be considered in light of the remoteness in time of the other act and the degree of resemblance to the crime charged.\"). Finally, there was other evidence regarding Santana's involvement in the drug conspiracy, including surveillance evidence, recorded phone calls, and Nickerson's testimony that he purchased cocaine from Santana up to and including May 9, 2001. <i>Cf. United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698646\"><a href=\"/opinion/698646/united-states-v-esperanza-aguilar-aranceta/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 801 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding district court abused its discretion in admitting testimony where the prior conviction was the only evidence of knowing possession).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted the difficulty of balancing probative value and prejudice in this situation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more similar the prior bad act evidence is to the charged crime, the more likely it is to be deemed relevant under 404(b). Yet the more the prior bad act resembles the crime, the more likely it is that the jury will infer that a defendant who committed the prior bad act would be likely to commit the crime charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d at 123. While we might have weighed the prejudicial effect and probative value differently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Nickerson's testimony. <i>See id.</i> at 122 (\"The district court's determination on this issue merits great deference on appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Agent's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Santana contends that the district court erred in allowing certain expert testimony from DEA Agent Jean Drouin. We review that evidentiary decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. L&#243;pez-L&#243;pez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2002). The hallmark of abuse of discretion review is deference. <i>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118157\"><a href=\"/opinion/118157/general-electric-co-v-joiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 143, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118157\"><a href=\"/opinion/118157/general-electric-co-v-joiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We review that decision only for a manifest abuse of discretion, and \"we will uphold the court's ruling unless the movant demonstrates a clear showing of prejudice.\" <i>Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Drouin was surveilling Nickerson on May 7, 2001, when Nickerson entered R.J. Motor Sports and emerged carrying a bag containing a box-like object with rounded corners. Shortly after being seen carrying the suspicious bag, Nickerson placed a phone call to Ricky Rano, one of his customers, stating, \"Thank you in hand!\" &#8212; a call which investigators understood to inform the customer that drugs were available. Investigators had information that Paget (the owner of R.J. Motor Sports) supplied Nickerson with marijuana, which he then sold to Rano. Drouin did not arrest Nickerson that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nickerson was not arrested until May 9, 2001 &#8212; the day he made a phone call to Santana and allegedly met with Santana inside the Brook Village Road apartment complex. When Nickerson was arrested, he had eight ounces of cocaine in his car. The prosecution alleged that he received the cocaine from Santana the day of his arrest. The defense, however, argued that the cocaine could have come from Paget on May 7, when Nickerson carried a bag out of R.J. Motor Sports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Drouin testified for the prosecution. When asked why he did not arrest Nickerson on May 7, he responded that he \"knew it was marijuana.\" Asked the basis for his knowledge, Drouin answered that it was based on the characteristics of the package, intercepted telephone calls, and controlled buys from Rano, and added \"we knew Alfred Nickerson was picking up what Ricky Rano wanted, which was marijuana.\" Drouin also testified that when he searched Nickerson's home on May 9, he smelled marijuana; he then discovered a wrapping containing marijuana residue that was similar to the wrapping on the package Nickerson carried on May 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana raises two distinct evidentiary appeals. First, he alleges that it was error to allow testimony that Drouin could smell marijuana during the search of Nickerson's home, stating \"[i]t should have been excluded under Rule 701 of the Rules of Evidence because it was not `rationally based on the perception of the witness,' and because it was not helpful to the determination of a fact in issue, as well as because it did not meet the criteria in Rule 702 and case law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Santana's first evidentiary challenge meritless. It is axiomatic that a witness may testify as to his personal knowledge &#8212; here, what he smelled. Fed. R.Evid. 602; <i>see also Sheek v. Asia Badger,</i> <i>Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199219\"><a href=\"/opinion/199219/sheek-v-raytheon-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 695 (1st Cir.2000). There was a sufficient foundation for this testimony because Drouin testified that his job exposed him to marijuana, and another witness testified that marijuana residue was found on the wrapper. <i>See United States v. Paiva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534182\"><a href=\"/opinion/534182/united-states-v-james-earl-paiva/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 157 (1st Cir.1989) (holding that past experience and personal knowledge and observation may qualify a lay witness to identify drugs). The content of the wrapper was in issue because the defense wanted the jury to infer that it could be cocaine, while the government alleged that it was marijuana. Santana suggests for the first time on appeal that the testimony should have been excluded under Rule 702. However, Drouin's testimony as to what he smelled was based on his perception and therefore he was not required to qualify as an expert under Rule 702. It was not an abuse of discretion to admit Drouin's lay opinion testimony that he smelled marijuana during a search of Nickerson's home. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Santana asserts that Drouin was not qualified to give either a lay or expert opinion that he \"knew\" what was in the package Nickerson was carrying. The defense objected and also moved for a mistrial, arguing that the evidence irreparably prejudiced Santana's right to a fair trial because the theory of the defense was that the package contained the cocaine that was later discovered in Nickerson's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that any error in permitting Drouin to testify that he knew Nickerson carried marijuana, and not cocaine, on May 7, was harmless. <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that harmless error applies to evidentiary rulings). The defense was able to cross-examine Drouin to expose perception difficulties including the fact that Drouin watched Nickerson from across a busy street. Drouin also stated on cross-examination that he only \"knew\" what was in the bag because of the ongoing investigation. Moreover, Nickerson himself testified that he was carrying marijuana in the bag Drouin saw him carrying out of R.J. Motor Sports that day. Any error in allowing Drouin to testify that Nickerson had marijuana did not likely affect the outcome and was therefore harmless. <i>See United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564957\"><a href=\"/opinion/564957/united-states-v-kenneth-michael-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1482</span></a></span>, 1488 (1st Cir.1991) (finding erroneous admission of evidence harmless because it was not crucial to the conviction). Finally, because Santana has not demonstrated clear prejudice, we uphold the district court's denial of his motion for a mistrial. <i>See Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.
