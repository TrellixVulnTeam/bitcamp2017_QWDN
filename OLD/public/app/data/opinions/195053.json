This appeal impels us to revisit\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge.\n                              \n\na  tragic incident  that occurred  nearly  a decade  ago.   After\n\ntouring familiar terrain,  we affirm the district  court's denial\n\nof relief under 28 U.S.C.   2255 (1988).\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\n          Defendant-appellant Steven  McGill worked  as a  prison\n\nguard at a state penitentiary in Cranston, Rhode Island.  On July\n\n10, 1984,  at about 3:30  p.m., McGill was conversing  with Roger\n\nAlessio  (an inmate)  in  a  so-called  \"reception area\"  at  the\n\nprison.  A second guard,  Kenneth Kaplan, passed through the area\n\nen route to the kitchen and, following standard  practice, handed\n\nhis weaponry  to McGill  for safekeeping.   In Kaplan's  absence,\n\nMcGill began to mimic elements of  a scene from a motion picture,\n\nThe Deerhunter (Universal  Studios 1978), depicting the  abuse of\n              \n\nprisoners of war  by North Vietnamese soldiers.  In the course of\n\nthis  periculous psychodrama,  McGill  forced  Alessio to  remain\n\nseated while  he, McGill, emptied  the second guard's  handgun of\n\nall but one bullet, spun  the cylinder several times, flailed his\n\narms wildly, and screamed, \"Mau!  Mau!\"  McGill proceeded to pull\n\nthe trigger twice, first while aiming the weapon at his own head,\n\nand thereafter while aiming it at  Alessio's head.  On the second\n\npull  of  the  trigger,  the  gun  discharged, resulting  in  the\n\ninmate's death.\n\n          A jury  convicted McGill  of depriving  another of  his\n\ncivil rights  while acting under  color of state law,  with death\n\nresulting.    See  18  U.S.C.    242  (1988).    We  affirmed the\n                 \n\n                                2\n\nconviction  on direct  appeal,  without  prejudice,  however,  to\n\nappellant's  right   to  litigate   questions  concerning   trial\n\ncounsel's  effectiveness   through  an   application  for   post-\n\nconviction relief.  See United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 17-\n                                               \n\n19  (1st Cir.  1991).   The district court  subsequently rejected\n\nappellant's  ineffective  assistance  claim  without  pausing  to\n\nconvene an evidentiary hearing.  The instant appeal followed.\n\nII.  ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n          This appeal presents  two issues.   We deal first  with\n\nthe contention that the court below  erred in refusing to hold an\n\nevidentiary  hearing   on  appellant's   application  for   post-\n\nconviction   relief.    Once   past  that  hurdle,   we  confront\n\nappellant's assertion  that the  court erred  in declaring  trial\n\ncounsel's services  acceptable notwithstanding  that counsel  (a)\n\nallowed The Deerhunter to be shown  to the jury in its  entirety,\n                      \n\nwithout objection, and (b) failed to produce a firearms expert as\n\npromised in the opening statement.\n\nIII.  THE NEED FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\n          Courts  are  busy  places.    Not  surprisingly,  then,\n\nevidentiary hearings on motions are the exception, not  the rule.\n\nWe have repeatedly  stated that, even in the  criminal context, a\n\ndefendant is not  entitled as of right to  an evidentiary hearing\n\non a pretrial or posttrial  motion.  See, e.g., United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nMala,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir. 1993) [No. 91-2229, slip op. at\n    \n\n8-9]; United  States v.  Tardiff, 969 F.2d  1283, 1286  (1st Cir.\n                                \n\n1992); United  States v.  DeCologero, 821 F.2d  39, 44  (1st Cir.\n                                    \n\n                                3\n\n1987).  Thus, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a\n\nfairly  heavy  burden   of  demonstrating  a  need   for  special\n\ntreatment.  See  United States v. Panitz, 907  F.2d 1267, 1273-74\n                                        \n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (collecting cases).\n\n          In most situations, motions can be  \"heard\" effectively\n\non the papers,  with the parties submitting  evidentiary proffers\n\nby means of affidavits, documentary exhibits, and the like.  See,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Aoude  v.  Mobil Oil  Corp., 862  F.2d 890,  894 (1st  Cir.\n                                 \n\n1988); DeCologero,  821 F.2d at  44.  In borderline  cases \"[t]he\n                 \n\ntest  for granting  an  evidentiary hearing  in  a criminal  case\n\nshould  be substantive:    did the  defendant  make a  sufficient\n\nthreshold  showing  that material  facts  were  in  doubt  or  in\n\ndispute?\"  Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.  Applying this standard, the\n                 \n\ncourt below, after allowing the parties to supplement the record,\n\nsee  Rule 7, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, determined\n   \n\nthat   there  were   \"no  factual   issues   in  dispute,\"   and,\n\nconsequently, refused to schedule an evidentiary hearing.\n\n          Appellant  derides  this  ruling.     He  claims  that,\n\nalthough section  2255  petitions are  admittedly  motions,  see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Rule 2, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings,  they are\n    \n\nspecial, and the movant should be afforded an evidentiary hearing\n\nas a  matter of course  unless the government shows  that none is\n\nnecessary.   This thesis    which  implies  that something  about\n\nsection  2255 creates  a  presumption  in  favor  of  evidentiary\n\n                                4\n\nhearings1 rather than  the contrary presumption that  attends the\n\nfiling of  most motions    is  unavailing.   The language  of the\n\nfederal habeas  statute does not  require a court to  reverse the\n\nusual presumption.\n\n          When  a petition  is brought  under  section 2255,  the\n\npetitioner  bears  the burden  of  establishing the  need  for an\n\nevidentiary hearing.  See Mack v. United States, 635 F.2d 20, 26-\n                                               \n\n27 (1st Cir. 1980); United  States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952,  954\n                                             \n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 439  U.S. 834 (1978).   In determining\n                         \n\nwhether the  petitioner has carried  the devoir of  persuasion in\n\nthis respect,  the court must  take many of  petitioner's factual\n\naverments  as  true,  but  the  court need  not  give  weight  to\n\nconclusory   allegations,    self-interested   characterizations,\n\ndiscredited inventions, or  opprobrious epithets.  See  Mack, 635\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at 27; Otero-Rivera v. United States, 494 F.2d 900, 902 (1st\n                                         \n\nCir. 1974).   Moreover, when,  as in  this case,  a petition  for\n\nfederal habeas relief  is presented to the judge  who presided at\n\nthe petitioner's  trial, the  judge is at  liberty to  employ the\n\nknowledge  gleaned during previous  proceedings and make findings\n\nbased  thereon  without  convening an  additional  hearing.   See\n                                                                 \n\nDiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954-55.\n       \n\n                    \n\n     1The statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n          Unless the  motion and the  files and records\n          of  the  case  conclusively   show  that  the\n          prisoner is  entitled   to  no  relief,   the\n          court  shall .  . .  grant  a prompt  hearing\n          thereon . . . .\n\n28 U.S.C.   2255.\n\n                                5\n\n          We have  distilled these  principles into  a rule  that\n\nholds a hearing  to be unnecessary \"when  a   2255 motion  (1) is\n\ninadequate  on its  face, or  (2) although  facially  adequate is\n\nconclusively refuted  as to  the alleged facts  by the  files and\n\nrecords of the case.\"  Moran  v. Hogan, 494 F.2d 1220, 1222  (1st\n                                      \n\nCir. 1974).   In  other words,  a \"   2255 motion  may be  denied\n\nwithout a hearing  as to those allegations which,  if accepted as\n\ntrue, entitle  the  movant to  no relief,  or which  need not  be\n\naccepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts,\n\ncontradict  the record, or are `inherently incredible.'\"  Shraiar\n                                                                 \n\nv. United  States, 736 F.2d  817, 818 (1st Cir.  1984) (citations\n                 \n\nomitted);  see also  Rule  4(b),  Rules  Governing  Section  2255\n                   \n\nProceedings.\n\n          Against  this backdrop, it is readily apparent that the\n\ndistrict court did not err  in denying appellant's request for an\n\nevidentiary hearing.   Appellant brought his petition  before the\n\nvery judge who presided at his trial.  In doing so, he mounted no\n\nserious challenge on  the facts.  Rather, as  we elucidate below,\n                               \n\nhe sought to place a  particular gloss on, and draw a  particular\n\nset  of conclusions  from, essentially  undisputed  facts.   That\n\nundisputed facts may  plausibly be interpreted in  different ways\n\ndoes  not  entitle  an  interested  litigant  to  an  evidentiary\n\nhearing.   See,  e.g., United States  v. Garcia, 954  F.2d 12, 19\n                                               \n\n(1st  Cir.  1992).   Under  the  circumstances  reflected by  the\n\ninstant  record,  an  evidentiary hearing  would  have  served no\n\nuseful purpose.\n\n                                6\n\nIV.  THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE CLAIM\n\n          To  succeed in setting  aside a conviction  premised on\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel,  a petitioner  must establish\n\nboth  constitutionally deficient  performance  on his  attorney's\n\npart and concomitant prejudice, or, phrased another way, that the\n\nquality of legal  representation at his trial was  so inferior as\n\nto   be  objectively  unreasonable,  and  that  this  incompetent\n\nlawyering redounded to his substantial detriment.  See Strickland\n                                                                 \n\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689-94 (1984).\n             \n\n          Here,  appellant excoriates  counsel  for two  tactical\n\ndecisions   that  he   contends  were   outside   the  realm   of\n\nreasonableness.   We  need  not  reach the  second  stage of  the\n\nStrickland  inquiry in either  instance, for we  find appellant's\n          \n\ncriticisms of these lawyerly stratagems to be unwarranted.2\n\n                    \n\n     2There  is  some  uncertainty  surrounding  the standard  of\nappellate  review.  Before  Strickland, the rule  in this circuit\n                                      \nwas  that fact-based  findings  made  by a  district  judge on  a\nsection  2255  petition      including  petitions  that  asserted\nineffective  assistance claims    were to  be reviewed  for clear\nerror.   See DiCarlo,  575 F.2d  at 954-55.   This rule  obtained\n                    \nwhether  the findings  were made  with or without  an evidentiary\nhearing.   See  id.   This  rule may  or  may not  have  survived\n                   \nStrickland, a  habeas case  under 28 U.S.C.    2254,  wherein the\n          \nCourt observed that \"although district court findings are subject\nto  the  clearly erroneous  standard  of  Federal  Rule of  Civil\nProcedure 52(a), both the performance and prejudice components of\nthe ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of fact and law.\"\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 698.  Although we have not yet considered\n          \nthe  significance of  this statement  vis-a-vis  the standard  of\nappellate review  in section 2255 proceedings, at least one court\nhas read the quoted statement to suggest that, with the exception\nof historical facts,  district court findings  in a section  2255\nineffective  assistance case  should  be reviewed  de novo.   See\n                                                                 \nUnited States v.  Miller, 907 F.2d 994, 996-97  (10th Cir. 1990);\n                        \nsee also  Fields v.  Attorney General, 956  F.2d 1290,  1297 n.18\n                                     \n(4th Cir. 1992)  (same;   2254 proceeding).  There is, of course,\nanother  possible  interpretation  of  the  Court's  words,  more\n\n                                7\n\n                                A\n\n          At  trial,  appellant's  counsel  stipulated  that  The\n                                                                 \n\nDeerhunter could  be  exhibited  to the  jury  in  its  entirety.\n          \n\nAppellant  says that he consistently opposed this maneuver,3 that\n\nhis  counsel  knew  of his  opposition,  and  that  no reasonably\n\ncompetent  defense  attorney  would  have  entered  into  such  a\n\nstipulation.  We disagree.\n\n          In  an  affidavit  submitted  in  conjunction  with  an\n\nearlier motion, appellant's trial counsel explained his thinking.\n\nThe prosecution wished to introduce  a 15-minute excerpt from the\n\nfilm, bearing  directly on  the behavior  mimicked by  appellant.\n\nBased on  his  judgments concerning  relevance, probative  value,\n\nunfairly prejudicial impact, and how the judge would likely rule,\n\ncounsel  calculated that  he would  not  prevail on  a motion  to\n\nexclude the film clip.  In  an effort to cut anticipated  losses,\n\n                    \n\nconsonant  with  DiCarlo:    that,  while  the  district  court's\n                        \nunderlying findings  of fact are  reviewed only for  clear error,\nits ultimate  legal  conclusions may  be  reviewed more  or  less\nstrictly  according to the  degree that they  are fact-dominated.\nCf. In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir.\n                               \n1993) (elaborating standard for mixed questions of fact and law).\nWe  leave  this  vexing  question  for   another  day  as,  here,\nregardless of  which standard of  review obtains,  the result  is\nunaffected.\n\n     3While McGill has  never recanted his admission  that he was\nmimicking  a scene  from The  Deerhunter,  he has  for some  time\n                                        \nvehemently denied  that he was playing \"Russian  roulette.\"  This\nseems  to be  the  impetus  for his  personal  opposition to  the\nadmission of the  film into evidence.   It is true that  no money\nchanged hands  in appellant's version  of the scene, and  that he\nshot the inmate directly, rather than forcing the inmate to shoot\nhimself.     But   appellant's  distinction   is   of  no   legal\nsignificance, for the self-conscious  patterning of his  behavior\nafter that of  characters in the film  suffices to make  the film\nrelevant.\n\n                                8\n\nhe obtained  a stipulation from  the prosecution that  the entire\n\nthree-hour  movie would  be  shown, in  the expectation  that the\n\nimpact of the critical scene would be dissipated.\n\n          Counsel's  intuition that an objection to the film clip\n\nwould have failed  is supported by our current  assessment of the\n\nsituation.    His  intuition is  also  supported  by our  earlier\n\nconclusion,  albeit on \"plain  error\" review, that  the movie was\n\nrelevant to  the jury's deliberations.   See McGill, 952  F.2d at\n                                                   \n\n18-19.  Last, but far  from least, this intuition derives staunch\n\nsupport from  the opinion of  the trial judge,  who characterized\n\ncounsel's strategic choice as objectively reasonable.\n\n          We will  not belabor the point.  To avoid the shoals of\n\nineffective   assistance,  an   attorney's   judgment  need   not\n\nnecessarily  be  right,  so  long  as  it  is  reasonable.    See\n                                                                 \n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687-91.  Here, counsel made an unarguably\n          \n\nreasonable  choice.    In  acting  on it,  he  extracted  a  fair\n\nconcession  for   the   ensuing   stipulation,   compelling   the\n\nprosecution to show the entire film rather than zeroing in on the\n\nshorter,  more  powerful  excerpt.4    And,   finally,  counsel's\n\ndecision  not  to  abide by  the  wishes  of  his client  has  no\n\nnecessary bearing  on the  question  of professional  competence;\n\nindeed, in some instances, listening to the client rather than to\n\n                    \n\n     4We note that counsel's elucidation of his strategy comports\nwith his conduct for the duration  at the trial.  In his  closing\nstatement,  counsel dismissed the film as boring, irrelevant, and\noffensive,  and attempted to use the motion picture as a whole to\nhis advantage by picking up on  a piece of dialogue unrelated  to\nthe critical scene.\n\n                                9\n\nthe  dictates of  professional  judgment  may  itself  constitute\n\nincompetence.  See Bell v. Georgia, 554 F.2d 1360, 1361 (5th Cir.\n                                  \n\n1977).\n\n                                B\n\n          At  the trial,  defense  counsel  elected  to  make  an\n\nopening statement prior to presentation of the prosecution's case\n\nin  chief.  He  told the jury  that he would  produce \"a firearms\n\nexpert\" as a defense witness.  He did  not, however, explain what\n\nthe substance  of the  expert's testimony would  be.   As matters\n\nturned out,  counsel decided not  to call the expert.   Appellant\n\nsays  the breach of the attorney's forecast comprised ineffective\n\nassistance.  We think not.\n\n          Although  a failure to  produce a promised  witness may\n\nunder some circumstances  be deemed ineffective  assistance, see,\n                                                                \n\ne.g., Anderson v.  Butler, 858 F.2d 16,  19 (1st Cir.  1988), the\n                         \n\ndetermination  of inefficacy  is necessarily  fact-based.   \"[N]o\n\nparticular set  of rules can  be established to  define effective\n\nassistance, as hard-and-fast rules would  inevitably restrict the\n\nindependence  and latitude counsel  must have in  making tactical\n\nand strategic  decisions.\"  United  States v.  Natanel, 938  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n302, 310 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 986 (1992).\n                                      \n\n          In  this case, counsel's handling of the on-again, off-\n\nagain expert testimony  was not only defensible,  but impressive.\n\nCounsel  refrained  from  calling  the  expert  witness  for  two\n\nreasons.    First,   after  making  the  opening   statement,  he\n\ndiscovered that his previously retained  witness had feet of clay\n\n                                10\n\nand could  easily be impeached.   Second, and more  important, he\n\nsucceeded,  by   dint  of   skillful  cross-examination   of  the\n\nprosecution's firearms expert, in eliciting much the same opinion\n\nevidence that he  hoped to establish through his own expert.  The\n\nprosecution's expert was  led to concede that the  trigger of the\n\nmurder weapon was so sensitive that pulling it could have been an\n\n\"unconscious act\"    a  concession that defense  counsel used  to\n\ngood effect in his summation.\n\n          Knowing when to quit is often a hallmark of commendable\n\ncourtroom advocacy.   Thus, having  proved his point  through the\n\nprosecution's witness, defense  counsel can  scarcely be  faulted\n\nfor deciding  to leave  well enough  alone.  As  the trial  judge\n\nstated:  \"The decision not to call an easily impeachable witness,\n\nwhen  the testimony  sought  from the  witness  had already  been\n\nintroduced  from   another  expert,  was  a  reasonable  tactical\n\ndecision.\"  We find ourselves in full accord.\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\n\n          Because the record here  conclusively demonstrates that\n\nappellant is not  entitled to post-conviction relief,  we need go\n\nno further.   We rule (1) that appellant did not have an absolute\n\nright to an evidentiary hearing,  and (2) that the district court\n\ndid not err in finding  that the proficiency of appellant's legal\n\nrepresentation surpassed the constitutional minimum.\n\nAffirmed.\n        \n\n                                11\n",

After touring familiar terrain, we affirm the district court's denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Steven McGill worked as a prison guard at a state penitentiary in Cranston, Rhode Island.  On July 10, 1984, at about 3:30 p.m., McGill was conversing with Roger Alessio (an inmate) in a so-called \"reception area\" at the prison.  A second guard, Kenneth Kaplan, passed through the area en route to the kitchen and, following standard practice, handed his weaponry to McGill for safekeeping.  In Kaplan's absence, McGill began to mimic elements of a scene from a motion picture, The Deerhunter (Universal Studios 1978), depicting the abuse of prisoners of war by North Vietnamese soldiers.  In the course of this periculous psychodrama, McGill forced Alessio to remain seated while he, McGill, emptied the second guard's handgun of all but one bullet, spun the cylinder several times, flailed his arms wildly, and screamed, \"Mau!  Mau!\"  McGill proceeded to pull the trigger twice, first while aiming the weapon at his own head, and thereafter while aiming it at Alessio's head.  On the second pull of the trigger, the gun discharged, resulting in the inmate's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury convicted McGill of depriving another of his civil rights while acting under color of state law, with death resulting.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 242 (1988).  We affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, without prejudice, however, to appellant's right to litigate questions concerning trial counsel's effectiveness through an application for post-conviction relief.  See United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 17-19 (1st Cir.1991).  The district court subsequently rejected appellant's ineffective assistance claim without pausing to convene an evidentiary hearing.  The instant appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents two issues.  We deal first with the contention that the court below erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on appellant's application for post-conviction relief.  Once past that hurdle, we confront appellant's assertion that the court erred in declaring trial counsel's services acceptable notwithstanding that counsel (a) allowed The Deerhunter to be shown to the jury in its entirety, without objection, and (b) failed to produce a firearms expert as promised in the opening statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE NEED FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts are busy places.  Not surprisingly, then, evidentiary hearings on motions are the exception, not the rule.  We have repeatedly stated that, even in the criminal context, a defendant is not entitled as of right to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  See, e.g., United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1062 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. DeCologero, 821 F.2d 39, 44 (1st Cir.1987).  Thus, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden of demonstrating a need for special treatment.  See United States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1273-74 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most situations, motions can be \"heard\" effectively on the papers, with the parties submitting evidentiary proffers by means of affidavits, documentary exhibits, and the like.  See, e.g., Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1988);  DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44.   In borderline cases \"[t]he test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a criminal case should be substantive:  did the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or in dispute?\"   Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.   Applying this standard, the court below, after allowing the parties to supplement the record, see Rule 7, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, determined that there were \"no factual issues in dispute,\" and, consequently, refused to schedule an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant derides this ruling.  He claims that, although section 2255 petitions are admittedly motions, see, e.g., Rule 2, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, they are special, and the movant should be afforded an evidentiary hearing as a matter of course unless the government shows that none is necessary.  This thesis--which implies that something about section 2255 creates a presumption in favor of evidentiary hearings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> rather than the contrary presumption that attends the filing of most motions--is unavailing.  The language of the federal habeas statute does not require a court to reverse the usual presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a petition is brought under section 2255, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing the need for an evidentiary hearing.  See Mack v. United States, 635 F.2d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir.1980);  United States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 834, 99 S.Ct. 115, 58 L.Ed.2d 129 (1978).  In determining whether the petitioner has carried the devoir of persuasion in this respect, the court must take many of petitioner's factual averments as true, but the court need not give weight to conclusory allegations, self-interested characterizations, discredited inventions, or opprobrious epithets.  See Mack, 635 F.2d at 27;  Otero-Rivera v. United States, 494 F.2d 900, 902 (1st Cir.1974).  Moreover, when, as in this case, a petition for federal habeas relief is presented to the judge who presided at the petitioner's trial, the judge is at liberty to employ the knowledge gleaned during previous proceedings and make findings based thereon without convening an additional hearing.  See DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have distilled these principles into a rule that holds a hearing to be unnecessary \"when a Sec. 2255 motion (1) is inadequate on its face, or (2) although facially adequate is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records of the case.\"  Moran v. Hogan, 494 F.2d 1220, 1222 (1st Cir.1974).  In other words, a \"Sec. 2255 motion may be denied without a hearing as to those allegations which, if accepted as true, entitle the movant to no relief, or which need not be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are 'inherently incredible.' \"  Shraiar v. United States, 736 F.2d 817, 818 (1st Cir.1984) (citations omitted);  see also Rule 4(b), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it is readily apparent that the district court did not err in denying appellant's request for an evidentiary hearing.  Appellant brought his petition before the very judge who presided at his trial.  In doing so, he mounted no serious challenge on the facts.   Rather, as we elucidate below, he sought to place a particular gloss on, and draw a particular set of conclusions from, essentially undisputed facts.  That undisputed facts may plausibly be interpreted in different ways does not entitle an interested litigant to an evidentiary hearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1992).  Under the circumstances reflected by the instant record, an evidentiary hearing would have served no useful purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed in setting aside a conviction premised on ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must establish both constitutionally deficient performance on his attorney's part and concomitant prejudice, or, phrased another way, that the quality of legal representation at his trial was so inferior as to be objectively unreasonable, and that this incompetent lawyering redounded to his substantial detriment.  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, appellant excoriates counsel for two tactical decisions that he contends were outside the realm of reasonableness.  We need not reach the second stage of the Strickland inquiry in either instance, for we find appellant's criticisms of these lawyerly stratagems to be unwarranted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* At trial, appellant's counsel stipulated that The Deerhunter could be exhibited to the jury in its entirety.  Appellant says that he consistently opposed this maneuver,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that his counsel knew of his opposition, and that no reasonably competent defense attorney would have entered into such a stipulation.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an affidavit submitted in conjunction with an earlier motion, appellant's trial counsel explained his thinking.  The prosecution wished to introduce a 15-minute excerpt from the film, bearing directly on the behavior mimicked by appellant.  Based on his judgments concerning relevance, probative value, unfairly prejudicial impact, and how the judge would likely rule, counsel calculated that he would not prevail on a motion to exclude the film clip.  In an effort to cut anticipated losses, he obtained a stipulation from the prosecution that the entire three-hour movie would be shown, in the expectation that the impact of the critical scene would be dissipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel's intuition that an objection to the film clip would have failed is supported by our current assessment of the situation.  His intuition is also supported by our earlier conclusion, albeit on \"plain error\" review, that the movie was relevant to the jury's deliberations.  See McGill, 952 F.2d at 18-19.   Last, but far from least, this intuition derives staunch support from the opinion of the trial judge, who characterized counsel's strategic choice as objectively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not belabor the point.  To avoid the shoals of ineffective assistance, an attorney's judgment need not necessarily be right, so long as it is reasonable.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.   Here, counsel made an unarguably reasonable choice.  In acting on it, he extracted a fair concession for the ensuing stipulation, compelling the prosecution to show the entire film rather than zeroing in on the shorter, more powerful excerpt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  And, finally, counsel's decision not to abide by the wishes of his client has no necessary bearing on the question of professional competence;  indeed, in some instances, listening to the client rather than to the dictates of professional judgment may itself constitute incompetence.  See Bell v. Georgia, 554 F.2d 1360, 1361 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial, defense counsel elected to make an opening statement prior to presentation of the prosecution's case in chief.  He told the jury that he would produce \"a firearms expert\" as a defense witness.  He did not, however, explain what the substance of the expert's testimony would be.  As matters turned out, counsel decided not to call the expert.  Appellant says the breach of the attorney's forecast comprised ineffective assistance.  We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a failure to produce a promised witness may under some circumstances be deemed ineffective assistance, see, e.g., Anderson v. Butler, 858 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1988), the determination of inefficacy is necessarily fact-based.  \"[N]o particular set of rules can be established to define effective assistance, as hard-and-fast rules would inevitably restrict the independence and latitude counsel must have in making tactical and strategic decisions.\"  United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 310 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, counsel's handling of the on-again, off-again expert testimony was not only defensible, but impressive.  Counsel refrained from calling the expert witness for two reasons.  First, after making the opening statement, he discovered that his previously retained witness had feet of clay and could easily be impeached.  Second, and more important, he succeeded, by dint of skillful cross-examination of the prosecution's firearms expert, in eliciting much the same opinion evidence that he hoped to establish through his own expert.  The prosecution's expert was led to concede that the trigger of the murder weapon was so sensitive that pulling it could have been an \"unconscious act\"--a concession that defense counsel used to good effect in his summation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knowing when to quit is often a hallmark of commendable courtroom advocacy.  Thus, having proved his point through the prosecution's witness, defense counsel can scarcely be faulted for deciding to leave well enough alone.  As the trial judge stated:  \"The decision not to call an easily impeachable witness, when the testimony sought from the witness had already been introduced from another expert, was a reasonable tactical decision.\"   We find ourselves in full accord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the record here conclusively demonstrates that appellant is not entitled to post-conviction relief, we need go no further.  We rule (1) that appellant did not have an absolute right to an evidentiary hearing, and (2) that the district court did not err in finding that the proficiency of appellant's legal representation surpassed the constitutional minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall ... grant a prompt hearing thereon....</p>\n        <p>28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is some uncertainty surrounding the standard of appellate review.  Before Strickland, the rule in this circuit was that fact-based findings made by a district judge on a section 2255 petition--including petitions that asserted ineffective assistance claims--were to be reviewed for clear error.  See DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954-55.   This rule obtained whether the findings were made with or without an evidentiary hearing.  See id.   This rule may or may not have survived Strickland, a habeas case under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254, wherein the Court observed that \"although district court findings are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), both the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of fact and law.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. at 2070.   Although we have not yet considered the significance of this statement vis-a-vis the standard of appellate review in section 2255 proceedings, at least one court has read the quoted statement to suggest that, with the exception of historical facts, district court findings in a section 2255 ineffective assistance case should be reviewed de novo.  See United States v. Miller, 907 F.2d 994, 996-97 (10th Cir.1990);  see also Fields v. Attorney General, 956 F.2d 1290, 1297 n. 18 (4th Cir.1992) (same;  Sec. 2254 proceeding).  There is, of course, another possible interpretation of the Court's words, more consonant with DiCarlo:  that, while the district court's underlying findings of fact are reviewed only for clear error, its ultimate legal conclusions may be reviewed more or less strictly according to the degree that they are fact-dominated.  Cf. In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir.1993) (elaborating standard for mixed questions of fact and law).  We leave this vexing question for another day as, here, regardless of which standard of review obtains, the result is unaffected</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While McGill has never recanted his admission that he was mimicking a scene from The Deerhunter, he has for some time vehemently denied that he was playing \"Russian roulette.\"   This seems to be the impetus for his personal opposition to the admission of the film into evidence.  It is true that no money changed hands in appellant's version of the scene, and that he shot the inmate directly, rather than forcing the inmate to shoot himself.  But appellant's distinction is of no legal significance, for the self-conscious patterning of his behavior after that of characters in the film suffices to make the film relevant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note that counsel's elucidation of his strategy comports with his conduct for the duration at the trial.

After touring familiar terrain, we affirm the district court's denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant Steven McGill worked as a prison guard at a state penitentiary in Cranston, Rhode Island.  On July 10, 1984, at about 3:30 p.m., McGill was conversing with Roger Alessio (an inmate) in a so-called \"reception area\" at the prison.  A second guard, Kenneth Kaplan, passed through the area en route to the kitchen and, following standard practice, handed his weaponry to McGill for safekeeping.  In Kaplan's absence, McGill began to mimic elements of a scene from a motion picture, The Deerhunter (Universal Studios 1978), depicting the abuse of prisoners of war by North Vietnamese soldiers.  In the course of this periculous psychodrama, McGill forced Alessio to remain seated while he, McGill, emptied the second guard's handgun of all but one bullet, spun the cylinder several times, flailed his arms wildly, and screamed, \"Mau!  Mau!\"  McGill proceeded to pull the trigger twice, first while aiming the weapon at his own head, and thereafter while aiming it at Alessio's head.  On the second pull of the trigger, the gun discharged, resulting in the inmate's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury convicted McGill of depriving another of his civil rights while acting under color of state law, with death resulting.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 242 (1988).  We affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, without prejudice, however, to appellant's right to litigate questions concerning trial counsel's effectiveness through an application for post-conviction relief.  See United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574332\"><a href=\"/opinion/574332/united-states-v-steven-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 17-19 (1st Cir.1991).  The district court subsequently rejected appellant's ineffective assistance claim without pausing to convene an evidentiary hearing.  The instant appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ISSUES PRESENTED</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents two issues.  We deal first with the contention that the court below erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on appellant's application for post-conviction relief.  Once past that hurdle, we confront appellant's assertion that the court erred in declaring trial counsel's services acceptable notwithstanding that counsel (a) allowed The Deerhunter to be shown to the jury in its entirety, without objection, and (b) failed to produce a firearms expert as promised in the opening statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE NEED FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts are busy places.  Not surprisingly, then, evidentiary hearings on motions are the exception, not the rule.  We have repeatedly stated that, even in the criminal context, a defendant is not entitled as of right to an evidentiary hearing on a pretrial or posttrial motion.  See, e.g., United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1062 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Tardiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1286 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. DeCologero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489942\"><a href=\"/opinion/489942/united-states-v-anthony-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1987).  Thus, a party seeking an evidentiary hearing must carry a fairly heavy burden of demonstrating a need for special treatment.  See United States v. Panitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544607\"><a href=\"/opinion/544607/united-states-v-solomon-philip-panitz-united-states-of-america-v-andrew/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, 1273-74 (1st Cir.1990) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In most situations, motions can be \"heard\" effectively on the papers, with the parties submitting evidentiary proffers by means of affidavits, documentary exhibits, and the like.  See, e.g., Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515441\"><a href=\"/opinion/515441/salim-aoude-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 894 (1st Cir.1988);  DeCologero, 821 F.2d at 44.   In borderline cases \"[t]he test for granting an evidentiary hearing in a criminal case should be substantive:  did the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or in dispute?\"   Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1273.   Applying this standard, the court below, after allowing the parties to supplement the record, see Rule 7, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, determined that there were \"no factual issues in dispute,\" and, consequently, refused to schedule an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant derides this ruling.  He claims that, although section 2255 petitions are admittedly motions, see, e.g., Rule 2, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, they are special, and the movant should be afforded an evidentiary hearing as a matter of course unless the government shows that none is necessary.  This thesis--which implies that something about section 2255 creates a presumption in favor of evidentiary hearings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> rather than the contrary presumption that attends the filing of most motions--is unavailing.  The language of the federal habeas statute does not require a court to reverse the usual presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a petition is brought under section 2255, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing the need for an evidentiary hearing.  See Mack v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384539\"><a href=\"/opinion/384539/harold-omar-mack-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir.1980);  United States v. DiCarlo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355655\"><a href=\"/opinion/355655/united-states-v-joseph-j-c-dicarlo-and-ronald-c-mackenzie/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 954 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span> (1978).  In determining whether the petitioner has carried the devoir of persuasion in this respect, the court must take many of petitioner's factual averments as true, but the court need not give weight to conclusory allegations, self-interested characterizations, discredited inventions, or opprobrious epithets.  See Mack, 635 F.2d at 27;  Otero-Rivera v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318298\"><a href=\"/opinion/318298/anibal-otero-rivera-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 902 (1st Cir.1974).  Moreover, when, as in this case, a petition for federal habeas relief is presented to the judge who presided at the petitioner's trial, the judge is at liberty to employ the knowledge gleaned during previous proceedings and make findings based thereon without convening an additional hearing.  See DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954-55.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have distilled these principles into a rule that holds a hearing to be unnecessary \"when a Sec. 2255 motion (1) is inadequate on its face, or (2) although facially adequate is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records of the case.\"  Moran v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318386\"><a href=\"/opinion/318386/george-moran-v-marvin-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>, 1222 (1st Cir.1974).  In other words, a \"Sec. 2255 motion may be denied without a hearing as to those allegations which, if accepted as true, entitle the movant to no relief, or which need not be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are 'inherently incredible.' \"  Shraiar v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437229\"><a href=\"/opinion/437229/steven-a-shraiar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 818 (1st Cir.1984) (citations omitted);  see also Rule 4(b), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, it is readily apparent that the district court did not err in denying appellant's request for an evidentiary hearing.  Appellant brought his petition before the very judge who presided at his trial.  In doing so, he mounted no serious challenge on the facts.   Rather, as we elucidate below, he sought to place a particular gloss on, and draw a particular set of conclusions from, essentially undisputed facts.  That undisputed facts may plausibly be interpreted in different ways does not entitle an interested litigant to an evidentiary hearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1992).  Under the circumstances reflected by the instant record, an evidentiary hearing would have served no useful purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To succeed in setting aside a conviction premised on ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must establish both constitutionally deficient performance on his attorney's part and concomitant prejudice, or, phrased another way, that the quality of legal representation at his trial was so inferior as to be objectively unreasonable, and that this incompetent lawyering redounded to his substantial detriment.  See Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 689-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>, 2065, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, appellant excoriates counsel for two tactical decisions that he contends were outside the realm of reasonableness.  We need not reach the second stage of the Strickland inquiry in either instance, for we find appellant's criticisms of these lawyerly stratagems to be unwarranted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* At trial, appellant's counsel stipulated that The Deerhunter could be exhibited to the jury in its entirety.  Appellant says that he consistently opposed this maneuver,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that his counsel knew of his opposition, and that no reasonably competent defense attorney would have entered into such a stipulation.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an affidavit submitted in conjunction with an earlier motion, appellant's trial counsel explained his thinking.  The prosecution wished to introduce a 15-minute excerpt from the film, bearing directly on the behavior mimicked by appellant.  Based on his judgments concerning relevance, probative value, unfairly prejudicial impact, and how the judge would likely rule, counsel calculated that he would not prevail on a motion to exclude the film clip.  In an effort to cut anticipated losses, he obtained a stipulation from the prosecution that the entire three-hour movie would be shown, in the expectation that the impact of the critical scene would be dissipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel's intuition that an objection to the film clip would have failed is supported by our current assessment of the situation.  His intuition is also supported by our earlier conclusion, albeit on \"plain error\" review, that the movie was relevant to the jury's deliberations.  See McGill, 952 F.2d at 18-19.   Last, but far from least, this intuition derives staunch support from the opinion of the trial judge, who characterized counsel's strategic choice as objectively reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not belabor the point.  To avoid the shoals of ineffective assistance, an attorney's judgment need not necessarily be right, so long as it is reasonable.  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-91, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.   Here, counsel made an unarguably reasonable choice.  In acting on it, he extracted a fair concession for the ensuing stipulation, compelling the prosecution to show the entire film rather than zeroing in on the shorter, more powerful excerpt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  And, finally, counsel's decision not to abide by the wishes of his client has no necessary bearing on the question of professional competence;  indeed, in some instances, listening to the client rather than to the dictates of professional judgment may itself constitute incompetence.  See Bell v. Georgia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"345422\"><a href=\"/opinion/345422/barrington-b-bell-v-state-of-georgia-joseph-s-hopper-warden-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1360</span></a></span>, 1361 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial, defense counsel elected to make an opening statement prior to presentation of the prosecution's case in chief.  He told the jury that he would produce \"a firearms expert\" as a defense witness.  He did not, however, explain what the substance of the expert's testimony would be.  As matters turned out, counsel decided not to call the expert.  Appellant says the breach of the attorney's forecast comprised ineffective assistance.  We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a failure to produce a promised witness may under some circumstances be deemed ineffective assistance, see, e.g., Anderson v. Butler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512374\"><a href=\"/opinion/512374/bruce-anderson-v-norman-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1988), the determination of inefficacy is necessarily fact-based.  \"[N]o particular set of rules can be established to define effective assistance, as hard-and-fast rules would inevitably restrict the independence and latitude counsel must have in making tactical and strategic decisions.\"  United States v. Natanel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 310 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span> (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, counsel's handling of the on-again, off-again expert testimony was not only defensible, but impressive.  Counsel refrained from calling the expert witness for two reasons.  First, after making the opening statement, he discovered that his previously retained witness had feet of clay and could easily be impeached.  Second, and more important, he succeeded, by dint of skillful cross-examination of the prosecution's firearms expert, in eliciting much the same opinion evidence that he hoped to establish through his own expert.  The prosecution's expert was led to concede that the trigger of the murder weapon was so sensitive that pulling it could have been an \"unconscious act\"--a concession that defense counsel used to good effect in his summation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knowing when to quit is often a hallmark of commendable courtroom advocacy.  Thus, having proved his point through the prosecution's witness, defense counsel can scarcely be faulted for deciding to leave well enough alone.  As the trial judge stated:  \"The decision not to call an easily impeachable witness, when the testimony sought from the witness had already been introduced from another expert, was a reasonable tactical decision.\"   We find ourselves in full accord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the record here conclusively demonstrates that appellant is not entitled to post-conviction relief, we need go no further.  We rule (1) that appellant did not have an absolute right to an evidentiary hearing, and (2) that the district court did not err in finding that the proficiency of appellant's legal representation surpassed the constitutional minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall ... grant a prompt hearing thereon....</p>\n        <p>28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is some uncertainty surrounding the standard of appellate review.  Before Strickland, the rule in this circuit was that fact-based findings made by a district judge on a section 2255 petition--including petitions that asserted ineffective assistance claims--were to be reviewed for clear error.  See DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954-55.   This rule obtained whether the findings were made with or without an evidentiary hearing.  See id.   This rule may or may not have survived Strickland, a habeas case under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254, wherein the Court observed that \"although district court findings are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), both the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of fact and law.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. at 2070.   Although we have not yet considered the significance of this statement vis-a-vis the standard of appellate review in section 2255 proceedings, at least one court has read the quoted statement to suggest that, with the exception of historical facts, district court findings in a section 2255 ineffective assistance case should be reviewed de novo.

There is, of course, another possible interpretation of the Court's words, more consonant with DiCarlo:  that, while the district court's underlying findings of fact are reviewed only for clear error, its ultimate legal conclusions may be reviewed more or less strictly according to the degree that they are fact-dominated.  Cf. In re Extradition of Howard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1327-28 (1st Cir.1993) (elaborating standard for mixed questions of fact and law).  We leave this vexing question for another day as, here, regardless of which standard of review obtains, the result is unaffected</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While McGill has never recanted his admission that he was mimicking a scene from The Deerhunter, he has for some time vehemently denied that he was playing \"Russian roulette.\"   This seems to be the impetus for his personal opposition to the admission of the film into evidence.  It is true that no money changed hands in appellant's version of the scene, and that he shot the inmate directly, rather than forcing the inmate to shoot himself.  But appellant's distinction is of no legal significance, for the self-conscious patterning of his behavior after that of characters in the film suffices to make the film relevant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We note that counsel's elucidation of his strategy comports with his conduct for the duration at the trial.  In his closing statement, counsel dismissed the film as boring, irrelevant, and offensive, and attempted to use the motion picture as a whole to his advantage by picking up on a piece of dialogue unrelated to the critical scene</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
