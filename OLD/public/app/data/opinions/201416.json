Ronaldo Ribeiro-Dos Santos (\"Ribeiro\"), a\n\ncitizen of Brazil, entered the United States in April 2001 after\n\ntwo of his brothers were killed in Brazil.   In April 2002, the INS\n\nbegan removal proceedings against him, culminating in an order of\n\nremoval by an immigration judge, thereafter affirmed by the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals.     Ribeiro concedes removability but seeks\n\nreview in this court of the denial of his requests for political\n\nasylum and withholding of removal.\n\n          Ribeiro stated in his asylum application he believed his\n\nbrothers' murders were due to their support of a local political\n\ncandidate, Capitao Erley, who won his office in 2000; Ribeiro\n\nclaimed to have learned this from the gang members who were\n\nresponsible for his brothers' murders, and who had also threatened\n\nhim and his wife subsequent to his brothers' deaths.        At his\n\nhearing Ribeiro also introduced the death certificate of his\n\nbrother-in-law, who had been killed not long before the hearing.\n\n          Ribeiro's removal hearing was held on October 29, 2002.\n\nThe immigration judge denied Ribeiro's applications for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal, finding his account of events not credible\n\nand implausible.   The decision pointed to certain inconsistencies\n\nin Ribeiro's story and, on the basis of inferences drawn by the\n\nimmigration judge, suggested that criminal violence rather than\n\npolitical motives was the more likely explanation for the deaths of\n\nRibeiro's brothers.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f              On Ribeiro's appeal, the Board upheld the denials of\n\nasylum      and   withholding   on   a    different   ground.     Making   no\n\ndetermination as to Ribeiro's credibility, the Board found that\n\nRibeiro had failed to provide sufficient evidence supporting his\n\nclaim that his brothers had been killed for political involvement\n\nor that he was himself threatened on this account.              Accordingly,\n\nthe Board held that Ribeiro had failed to establish a well-founded\n\nfear   of    persecution   on   an   enumerated   ground--here,    political\n\nopinion.      See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000).\n\n              Because the Board has adopted its own ground for the\n\ndenial, we review its decision directly.              Compare Mukamusoni v.\n\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st Cir. 2004), with Disu v. Ashcroft,\n\n338 F.3d 13, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).          Our review on issues of law is de\n\nnovo in accordance with ordinary principles of administrative law,\n\nbut as to factual issues review is deferential and requires only\n\nthat the Board's decision accord with substantial evidence.                See\n\nGailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).            Here, where the\n\nBoard found that Ribeiro had not carried his burden of proof, we\n\nask whether a reasonable factfinder had to reach the opposite\n\nconclusion. Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              Ribeiro offered proof that his two brothers and brother-\n\nin-law had been killed in Brazil, but his claim that the killings\n\nwere politically motivated was scarcely explained; the murders\n\noccurred after a local election in which Ribeiro supported a\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcandidate, but he provided no further evidence that the murders or\n\nany threats received by him or his wife had anything to do with a\n\npolitical motive.\n\n          Indeed, Ribeiro admitted that his brothers' murders could\n\nhave been the result of a \"robbery gone bad,\" and when asked--on\n\ntwo occasions over the course of his hearing--why he believed that\n\nthe threats to his life were politically motivated, his only reply\n\nwas that he and his brothers had done nothing else to merit such\n\ntreatment.     Although his application suggested that his harassers\n\nhad professed a political motive, at the hearing Ribeiro made no\n\nmention of any political content when asked to recount the threats\n\nmade against him.\n\n             \"While an alien seeking asylum is not required to provide\n\ndirect proof of his persecutors' motives, he must provide some\n\nevidence of such motives.\"     Samayoa Cabrera v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d\n\n10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004).        \"The testimony of an applicant, if\n\ncredible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without\n\ncorroboration,\" 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.13(a) (2004), but in this instance\n\nthe   testimony    would   scarcely     warrant--let   alone   compel--a\n\nfactfinder to conclude that the murders were political or that\n\nRibeiro had any reasonable basis to fear political persecution.\n\n          Because the Board was justified in denying Ribeiro's\n\nasylum claim, it was also justified in denying his request for\n\nwithholding of removal, which requires the applicant to meet an\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\feven higher standard of proof.
