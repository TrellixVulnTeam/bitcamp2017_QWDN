This   case   arises   out   of   an\n\nincident that was tragic for everyone involved.            A few moments\n\nafter saying he wanted to die, Robert Mark Isom, age 33 and\n\nemotionally disturbed, was shot to death by police officers of the\n\nTown of Warren, Rhode Island on the morning of March 7, 1997.          Isom\n\nhad entered a liquor store with an axe and briefly held hostage two\n\nemployees before releasing one and inadvertently allowing the other\n\nto escape.    When officers entered the store, Isom ignored their\n\ncontinuous requests to put down the axe; fearing for the officers'\n\nsafety, one officer attempted to subdue Isom with pepper spray.\n\nIsom responded not by dropping to the ground, as the officer had\n\nhoped, but by raising the axe and running toward two officers.\n\nThose officers then shot Isom to death.\n\n            His mother, Jean Isom, sued the town, its police chief,\n\nseveral officers, and the medical examiner in federal district\n\ncourt, asserting claims of excessive use of force under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 and state law claims for wrongful death under R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n§ 10-7-1.    At the heart of the case is the claim that the decision\n\nto use the pepper spray was a colossal misjudgment, resulting in a\n\nneedless and wrongful death.\n\n            Although the defendants moved for summary judgment on the\n\nbasis of qualified immunity, for reasons not apparent on the\n\nrecord, the district court never decided the motion.            Rather, the\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fcase went to trial on April 21, 2003, and the jury heard three days\n\nof evidence.\n\n           At the close of the plaintiff's case, the defendants made\n\na motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n50(a).   The court orally granted the motion and subsequently wrote\n\na decision explaining its reasoning.    We affirm.\n\n           Many excessive force cases involving officers' judgment\n\ncalls are resolved on qualified immunity grounds, either on summary\n\njudgment or at trial.    See Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S. 177,\n\n185 (1995) (\"Qualified immunity specially protects public officials\n\nfrom the specter of damages liability for judgment calls made in a\n\nlegally uncertain environment.\"). But the defendants did not raise\n\nimmunity as an issue at the time of their Rule 50 motion, and so\n\nthey have waived that defense as a grounds for the motion.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           Our review of the grant of the Rule 50(a) motion is de\n\nnovo.    Espada v. Lugo, 312 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2002).   We review\n\nthe evidence, taking all inferences in favor of Isom, and ask\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could have decided that the defendants\n\nwere liable based on the evidence presented. See Acevedo-Garcia v.\n\nMonroig, No. 02-1139, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 24475, at *40 (1st Cir.\n\nDec. 5, 2003); Transamerica Premiere Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d\n\n925, 929 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                II.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           We describe the evidence adduced at trial in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.\n\n           On the morning of March 7, 1997, Robert Mark Isom entered\n\n1776 Liquors, a liquor store in Warren, Rhode Island.    Erin Alves\n\nand Beth Engell were working at the store, but no customers were\n\npresent. After walking around the store, Isom approached Alves and\n\nasked her if she was single and would like to go on a date.   Alves\n\nexplained that she had a boyfriend, and asked if she could help\n\nIsom find anything.     Isom did not respond, but simply left the\n\nstore.\n\n           Alves watched Isom through the store window as he opened\n\nthe trunk of a car and removed an object wrapped in newspaper.\n\nIsom came back into the store with the concealed item and placed it\n\non the store counter.   He asked Engell to lock the store's doors,\n\nbut she said that she did not have the keys.    Alves recalled that\n\nIsom \"was saying his life was worth shit and he had nothing to live\n\nfor.\"    Isom then asked Alves and Engell if they had a gun; they\n\nresponded that they did not.    Continuing to mutter that his life\n\nwas worthless, Isom pressed the concealed item against Engell's\n\nstomach, explaining that he did not want to have to hurt either\n\nAlves or Engell.    At some point, Alves activated a silent alarm\n\nbehind the counter.\n\n           Isom then unwrapped the concealed item -- it was an axe.\n\nHe began to play with the axe.     Alves started to cry and Engell\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fasked Isom if Alves could leave because she was pregnant.              Isom\n\nsaid yes, and Alves left the store.         Shortly thereafter, when Isom\n\nput his head down on the counter and continued to mutter, Engell\n\nran out of the store as well.\n\n            Engell encountered Police Sergeant Green, who asked her\n\nwhether the man inside was armed (the silent alarm had brought the\n\npolice to the store).        Engell replied that Isom was carrying an\n\naxe.     Green, by himself, entered the store with his gun drawn and\n\nstarted talking to Isom, who was standing in the middle of the\n\nstore.    Isom was initially silent, but eventually told the officer\n\nhis name and said, according to Green, that \"he was going to die\n\ntoday.\"      Isom then became non-responsive to Sergeant Green's\n\nfurther questions and \"just went blank.\"        He was holding the axe in\n\nhis right hand with a tight grip, and it was raised slightly up.\n\nSeveral     seconds   later,   Officer     Ouellette,   who    had   arrived\n\nseparately, entered the store and knelt down, with his gun drawn,\n\non Sergeant Green's right.          At about the same time, another\n\nofficer, Loiselle, entered the store and positioned himself at the\n\nrear exit.\n\n             Green    and   Ouellette     testified   that    they   started\n\n\"continuously\" \"pleading\" for Isom to drop the axe, but Isom\n\nremained in a daze and did not reply. At some point, two other\n\nofficers, Captain Barkett and Detective Clancy, entered the store.\n\nSergeant Green explained to Captain Barkett that he was \"trying to\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhandle it between [himself] and Mr. Isom.\" Captain Barkett did not\n\nreply.   Detective Clancy also began telling Isom to drop the axe.\n\n             After several minutes, Detective Clancy, who was in plain\n\nclothes, reached over and removed Sergeant Green's cannister of\n\npepper spray from his belt.         He testified that he was concerned\n\nthat, given Isom's non-responsiveness, the officers' safety was in\n\ndanger and he believed that spraying Isom with the pepper spray\n\nwould allow the officers to suppress Isom.         Detective Clancy then\n\nheld up the pepper spray to Captain Barkett, the commanding officer\n\non the scene, who \"nodded to [Clancy] in the affirmative nature.\"\n\nDetective Clancy yelled out \"ASR,\" an indication to the other\n\nofficers that he was going to use the spray; each of the officers\n\nhad been through several hours of training on the use of pepper\n\nspray in which this code-word had been explained.\n\n             From behind the store counter, Detective Clancy started\n\nto spray Isom with the pepper spray and yelled for Isom to put down\n\nthe   axe.     Clancy   explained   that    normally   the   spray   \"causes\n\ndebilitation . . . and you just want to succumb to [officers']\n\ncommands.\"     Still, the spray appeared to have no effect on Isom,\n\nwhich Clancy found \"remarkable.\"          Clancy testified that in \"[a]ll\n\nof the years that [he had] used the spray, it's always had an\n\n[e]ffect on individuals.\"     Officer Ouellette also said that he was\n\n\"caught off guard\" when the spray did not affect Isom.               Officer\n\nLoiselle agreed, explaining that the spray did not seem to have an\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\feffect on Isom, which was unusual: \"[t]ypically an individual\n\nexposed to [the spray] would have an involuntary closure of the\n\neyes, uncontrollable coughing, loss of coordination or stamina.\"\n\n           After the spray stopped, Isom turned toward Officer\n\nLoiselle and then suddenly lifted the axe and charged toward\n\nSergeant Green and Officer Ouellette.           When Isom was within ten\n\nfeet of Green and Ouellette, still running toward them with the axe\n\nraised, the two officers fired their guns at Isom.             Isom fell to\n\nthe floor and died shortly thereafter.\n\n                                      III.\n\nA.    Section 1983 Claim\n\n           Plaintiff's     §   1983   claim   alleges   that   the   officers\n\nviolated Isom's Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force in\n\nthe course of attempting to disarm him.           In order to prevail on\n\nthis claim, the plaintiffs must establish that the officers' use of\n\nthe    pepper    spray   was    objectively     unreasonable     under    the\n\ncircumstances.      See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989);\n\nJarrett v. Town of Yarmouth, 331 F.3d 140, 148 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           This inquiry requires the factfinder to consider the\n\nreasonableness of the officers' actions from the perspective of a\n\nreasonable officer on the scene, rather than through the lens of\n\nhindsight.      Graham, 490 U.S. at 396.      In doing so, the factfinder\n\nshould take into account \"the severity of the crime at issue,\n\nwhether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fofficers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or\n\nattempting to evade arrest by flight.\"           Id. at 396; Bastien v.\n\nGoddard, 279 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2002).          All of the attendant\n\ncircumstances must be considered.         See Graham, 490 U.S. at 396.\n\n           The police here encountered a situation fraught with\n\nhazard   for   themselves   and   for   Isom;   Isom   was   a   distraught,\n\nseemingly suicidal man, who had briefly held two hostages and was\n\nrefusing to comply with continuous officer requests that he put\n\ndown an axe.     In the presence of such danger, the plaintiffs could\n\nnot prevail at trial without providing some evidence that would\n\nbring into question the officers' judgment call to use pepper\n\nspray.\n\n           But    the   plaintiff   presented    no    evidence    directly\n\naddressing this point.      The closest that the plaintiff came was in\n\nthe testimony of Sergeant Green:\n\n     Q. And I believe you indicated that you would not have\n     used the pepper spray at that time on Mark Isom?\n     A. Yes, sir, I did.\n     Q. And what did you give for your reason for that?\n     A. It wouldn't -- I don't think it would be effective at\n     that point.   He still had an axe in his hand, so it\n     wouldn't be an option for me.\n     ...\n     Q. Why would you have not, according to your testimony,\n     have sprayed Mr. Isom at that time?\n     A. It wasn't an option for me, like I said before. He\n     had an axe and that by spraying him may not have helped\n     the situation at all.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Sergeant Green elaborated on his earlier\n\ntestimony about the pepper spray:\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f     Q. What did you feel your responsibility was in covering\n     Mr. Isom with your firearm from the time you were in the\n     store until the shots were actually fired? What was your\n     responsibility other than trying to convince him to\n     disarm?\n     A. To make sure that he wasn't going to go and hurt one\n     of us or hurt himself and try to contain him inside of\n     the building.\n     Q. And in order to do that job, was pepper spray an\n     option for you?\n     A. No, sir.\n     Q. And can you tell me and the judge and the Court why\n     pepper spray was never an option for you during that time\n     you were in the store?\n     A. I feared for my life, and I feared that he was going\n     to hurt one of us. And I was the primary officer on the\n     scene, and I had to focus on what was happening at hand.\n     Q. You testified that there was no warning by Officer\n     Clancy prior to the time he actually yelled ASR that he\n     was going to use the pepper spray. Did you feel that\n     pepper spray at that point in time was an option for\n     Officer Clancy?\n     A. Yes.\n          ...\n     Q. [W]hat did you expect Isom to do if he had been hit\n     by the pepper spray?\n     A. Probably become disoriented where we could actually\n     physically take him down.\n\n(emphasis added). Sergeant Green's testimony was not, as plaintiff\n\ncontends, that no objective police officer could have thought that\n\nthe use of pepper spray was warranted in the circumstances faced by\n\nDetective Clancy.   On the most favorable reading of the testimony\n\nfor the plaintiff, Sergeant Green's testimony establishes only that\n\nhe believed it would not have been reasonable for an officer in\n\nGreen's particular situation to use the pepper spray.       But, as\n\nSergeant   Green    himself   explained,   the   circumstances   and\n\nresponsibilities that he faced were quite different than those\n\nfaced by Detective Clancy.    As the   initial officer on the scene,\n\n                                 -9-\n\fGreen's primary responsibility was not necessarily to defuse the\n\nsituation so much as to prevent it from escalating.      Detective\n\nClancy, who arrived at the store after the other officers had\n\nestablished some control over the situation, was in a different\n\nsituation from Green, and thus had different tactical options\n\navailable to him in deciding what was the most appropriate action.\n\nIn fact, Sergeant Green acknowledged that use of the pepper spray\n\nwas \"an option\" for Detective Clancy.\n\n          Aside from Sergeant Green's testimony, the plaintiff did\n\nnot present any other evidence even addressing the reasonableness\n\nof the officers' actions.    No expert testified that, under the\n\ncircumstances faced by Detective Clancy, no reasonable officer\n\nwould have used pepper spray; in fact, the plaintiffs did not\n\nproduce any expert testimony at all.1      Nor did the plaintiff\n\nproduce any written policy or text stating that the use of pepper\n\nspray in circumstances such as those faced by Clancy was not\n\nreasonable. The plaintiff argues that such evidence was not needed\n\n-- that this is a matter which should have been left to the jury's\n\ncommon sense and that the plaintiffs were entitled to let the jury\n\nreach a decision.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Counsel for plaintiff apparently initially intended to\npresent several expert witnesses, but the district court disallowed\nthese witnesses in a pre-trial ruling. The basis for this ruling\nwas plaintiff's counsel's repeated failure to provide expert\ndisclosure statements pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 26.\nPlaintiff does not challenge that ruling on appeal.\n\n                               -10-\n\f            We agree with the district court that this argument\n\nfails.      For the jurors to have been given an opportunity to\n\nexercise their common sense on the ultimate question of whether no\n\nobjectively reasonable officer would have used pepper spray, there\n\nmust have been some basis in the evidence on which to ground that\n\ndetermination.      Even putting aside the evidence that Detective\n\nClancy was experienced in the use of pepper spray, believed it\n\nwould decrease     the   ultimate   risk   of   violence    from    Isom,   and\n\nrequested    and   received   permission   to   use   the   spray    from   the\n\ncommanding officer, no reasonable jury could have found in the\n\nplaintiff's favor. There was no evidence from which the jury could\n\nrationally draw the conclusion that the officers' actions were\n\nobjectively unreasonable.       At best, Sergeant Green said that he\n\nwould not have used the pepper spray, not that an objectively\n\nreasonable officer in Detective Clancy's position would not have.\n\nB.   Wrongful Death Claims\n\n            The court also dismissed plaintiff's state law wrongful\n\ndeath claims.      The Rhode Island statute requires that death be\n\ncaused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of another.                 See\n\nR.I. Gen. L. § 10-7-1.     In theory, the plaintiff in this case might\n\nhave established a breach of a duty of care by showing a violation\n\nof the Warren police department's use-of-force policy. That policy\n\nprovides, in relevant part, that:\n\n     2. Non-deadly force may be used by a police officer in\n     the performance of his duty:\n\n                                    -11-\n\f          a. when necessary to preserve the peace, prevent\n          commission of offenses, or prevent suicide or self-\n          infl[i]cted injury; or\n          b. when necessary to overcome resistance to arrests,\n          to conduct searches and seizures, and to prevent\n          escapes from custody; or\n          c. when in self-defense, or defense of another\n          against unlawful violence to his person or property.\n     ...\n     9. Chemical substances may be used when physical force\n     is necessary:\n          a. to protect an officer or other person from an\n          assault; or\n          b. to SUBDUE a person who resists arrest; or\n          c. to deter persons engaged in riotous conduct.\n     It is preferred that chemical substances not be used if\n     resistance is minor and not hazardous, or if physical\n     powers would reasonably achieve the same end.\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n          No breach of a duty of care can be based on this policy.\n\nThe policy gives officers significant discretion to exercise their\n\njudgment in using pepper spray; the officers were within that\n\ndiscretion when they decided to use pepper spray on Isom.   To the\n\nextent that the state law claim is based on common law notions of\n\nduty of care, our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto show that the officers acted in an objectively unreasonable\n\nfashion is sufficient to support dismissal.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          Judgment for the defendants is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

When officers entered the store, Isom ignored their continuous requests to put down the axe; fearing for the officers' safety, one officer attempted to subdue Isom with pepper spray.

Erin Alves and Beth Engell were working at the store, but no customers were present. After walking around the store, Isom approached Alves and asked her if she was single and would like to go on a date. Alves explained that she had a boyfriend, and asked if she could help Isom find anything. Isom did not respond, but simply left the store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alves watched Isom through the store window as he opened the trunk of a car and removed an object wrapped in newspaper. Isom came back into the store with the concealed item and placed it on the store counter. He asked Engell to lock the store's doors, but she said that she did not have the keys. Alves recalled that Isom \"was saying his life was worth shit and he had nothing to live for.\" Isom then asked Alves and Engell if they had a gun; they responded that they did not. Continuing to mutter that his life was worthless, Isom pressed the concealed item against Engell's stomach, explaining that he did not want to have to hurt either Alves or Engell. At some point, Alves activated a silent alarm behind the counter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isom then unwrapped the concealed item &#8212; it was an axe. He began to play with the axe. Alves started to cry and Engell asked Isom if Alves could leave because she was pregnant. Isom said yes, and Alves left the store. Shortly thereafter, when Isom put his head down on the counter and continued to mutter, Engell ran out of the store as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engell encountered Police Sergeant Green, who asked her whether the man inside was armed (the silent alarm had brought the police to the store). Engell replied that Isom was carrying an axe. Green, by himself, entered the store with his gun drawn and started talking to Isom, who was standing in the middle of the store. Isom was initially silent, but eventually told the officer his name and said, according to Green, that \"he was going to die today.\" Isom then became non-responsive to Sergeant Green's further questions and \"just went blank.\" He was holding the axe in his right hand with a tight grip, and it was raised slightly up. Several seconds later, Officer Ouellette, who had arrived separately, entered the store and knelt down, with his gun drawn, on Sergeant Green's right. At about the same time, another officer, Loiselle, entered the store and positioned himself at the rear exit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Green and Ouellette testified that they started \"continuously\" \"pleading\" for Isom to drop the axe, but Isom remained in a daze and did not reply. At some point, two other officers, Captain Barkett and Detective Clancy, entered the store. Sergeant Green explained to Captain Barkett that he was \"trying to handle it between [himself] and Mr. Isom.\" Captain Barkett did not reply. Detective Clancy also began telling Isom to drop the axe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several minutes, Detective Clancy, who was in plain clothes, reached over and removed Sergeant Green's cannister of pepper spray from his belt. He testified that he was concerned that, given Isom's non-responsiveness, the officers' safety was in danger and he believed that spraying Isom with the pepper spray would allow the officers to suppress Isom. Detective Clancy then held up the pepper spray to Captain Barkett, the commanding officer on the scene, who \"nodded to [Clancy] in the affirmative nature.\" Detective Clancy yelled out \"ASR,\" an indication to the other officers that he was going to use the spray; each of the officers had been through several hours of training on the use of pepper spray in which this code-word had been explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From behind the store counter, Detective Clancy started to spray Isom with the pepper spray and yelled for Isom to put down the axe. Clancy explained that normally the spray \"causes debilitation ... and you just want to succumb to [officers'] commands.\" Still, the spray appeared to have no effect on Isom, which Clancy found \"remarkable.\" Clancy testified that in \"[a]ll of the years that [he had] used the spray, it's always had an [e]ffect on individuals.\" Officer Ouellette also said that he was \"caught off guard\" when the spray did not affect Isom. Officer Loiselle agreed, explaining that the spray did not seem to have an effect on Isom, which was unusual: \"[t]ypically an individual exposed to [the spray] would have an involuntary closure of the eyes, uncontrollable coughing, loss of coordination or stamina.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the spray stopped, Isom turned toward Officer Loiselle and then suddenly lifted the axe and charged toward Sergeant Green and Officer Ouellette. When Isom was within ten feet of Green and Ouellette, still running toward them with the axe raised, the two officers fired their guns at Isom. Isom fell to the floor and died shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Section 1983 Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's &#167; 1983 claim alleges that the officers violated Isom's Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force in the course of attempting to disarm him. In order to prevail on this claim, the plaintiffs must establish that the officers' use of the pepper spray was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances. <i>See Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989); <i>Jarrett v. Town of Yarmouth,</i> 331 F.3d 140, 148 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inquiry requires the factfinder to consider the reasonableness of the officers' actions from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than through the lens of hindsight. <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865. In doing so, the factfinder should take into account \"the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" <i>Id.</i> at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865; <i>Bastien v. Goddard,</i> 279 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2002). All of the attendant circumstances must be considered. <i>See Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police here encountered a situation fraught with hazard for themselves and for Isom; Isom was a distraught, seemingly suicidal man, who had briefly held two hostages and was refusing to comply with continuous officer requests that he put down an axe. In the presence of such danger, the plaintiffs could not prevail at trial without providing some evidence that would bring into question the officers' judgment call to use pepper spray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the plaintiff presented no evidence directly addressing this point.

It wouldn't &#8212; I don't think it would be effective at that point.

What did you feel your responsibility was in covering Mr. Isom with your firearm from the time you were in the store until the shots were actually fired?

And in order to do that job, was pepper spray an option for you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

And can you tell me and the judge and the Court why pepper spray was never an option for you during that time you were in the store?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I feared for my life, and I feared that he was going to hurt one of us. And I was the primary officer on the scene, and I had to focus on what was happening at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. You testified that there was no warning by Officer Clancy prior to the time he actually yelled ASR that he was going to use the pepper spray. <i>Did you feel that pepper spray at that point in time was an option for Officer Clancy?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Yes.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. [W]hat did you expect Isom to do if he had been hit by the pepper spray?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Probably become disoriented where we could actually physically take him down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Sergeant Green's testimony was not, as plaintiff contends, that no objective police officer could have thought that the use of pepper spray was warranted in the circumstances faced by Detective Clancy. On the most favorable reading of the testimony for the plaintiff, Sergeant Green's testimony establishes only that he believed it would not have been reasonable for an officer <i>in Green's particular situation</i> to use the pepper spray. But, as Sergeant Green himself explained, the circumstances and responsibilities that he faced were quite different than those faced by Detective Clancy. As the initial officer on the scene, Green's primary responsibility was not necessarily to defuse the situation so much as to prevent it from escalating. Detective Clancy, who arrived at the store after the other officers had established some control over the situation, was in a different situation from Green, and thus had different tactical options available to him in deciding what was the most appropriate action. In fact, Sergeant Green acknowledged that use of the pepper spray was \"an option\" for Detective Clancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Sergeant Green's testimony, the plaintiff did not present any other evidence even addressing the reasonableness of the officers' actions. No expert testified that, under the circumstances faced by Detective Clancy, no reasonable officer would have used pepper spray; in fact, the plaintiffs did not produce any expert testimony at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Nor did the plaintiff produce any written policy or text stating that the use of pepper spray in circumstances such as those faced by Clancy was not reasonable. The plaintiff argues that such evidence was not needed &#8212; that this is a matter which should have been left to the jury's common sense and that the plaintiffs were entitled to let the jury reach a decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that this argument fails. For the jurors to have been given an opportunity to exercise their common sense on the ultimate question of whether no objectively reasonable officer would have used pepper spray, there must have been some basis in the evidence on which to ground that determination. Even putting aside the evidence that Detective Clancy was experienced in the use of pepper spray, believed it would decrease the ultimate risk of violence from Isom, and requested and received permission to use the spray from the commanding officer, no reasonable jury could have found in the plaintiff's favor. There was no evidence from which the jury could rationally draw the conclusion that the officers' actions were objectively unreasonable. At best, Sergeant Green said that <i>he</i> would not have used the pepper spray, not that an objectively reasonable officer in Detective Clancy's position would not have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Wrongful Death Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also dismissed plaintiff's state law wrongful death claims. The Rhode Island statute requires that death be caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of another. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. L. &#167; 10-7-1. In theory, the plaintiff in this case might have established a breach of a duty of care by showing a violation of the Warren police department's use-of-force policy. That policy provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Non-deadly force may be used by a police officer in the performance of his duty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. when necessary to preserve the peace, prevent commission of offenses, or prevent suicide or self-infl[i]cted injury; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. when necessary to overcome resistance to arrests, to conduct searches and seizures, and to prevent escapes from custody; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. when in self-defense, or defense of another against unlawful violence to his person or property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. Chemical substances may be used when physical force is necessary:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. to protect an officer or other person from an assault; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. to SUBDUE a person who resists arrest; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. to deter persons engaged in riotous conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is preferred that chemical substances not be used if resistance is minor and not hazardous, or if physical powers would reasonably achieve the same end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No breach of a duty of care can be based on this policy. The policy gives officers significant discretion to exercise their judgment in using pepper spray; the officers were within that discretion when they decided to use pepper spray on Isom. To the extent that the state law claim is based on common law notions of duty of care, our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to show that the officers acted in an objectively unreasonable fashion is sufficient to support dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment for the defendants is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counsel for plaintiff apparently initially intended to present several expert witnesses, but the district court disallowed these witnesses in a pre-trial ruling.

A few moments after saying he wanted to die, Robert Mark Isom, age 33 and emotionally disturbed, was shot to death by police officers of the Town of Warren, Rhode Island on the morning of March 7, 1997. Isom had entered a liquor store with an axe and briefly held hostage two employees before releasing one and inadvertently allowing the other to escape. When officers entered the store, Isom ignored their continuous requests to put down the axe; fearing for the officers' safety, one officer attempted to subdue Isom with pepper spray. Isom responded not by dropping to the ground, as the officer had hoped, but by raising the axe and running toward two officers.

Erin Alves and Beth Engell were working at the store, but no customers were present. After walking around the store, Isom approached Alves and asked her if she was single and would like to go on a date. Alves explained that she had a boyfriend, and asked if she could help Isom find anything. Isom did not respond, but simply left the store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alves watched Isom through the store window as he opened the trunk of a car and removed an object wrapped in newspaper. Isom came back into the store with the concealed item and placed it on the store counter. He asked Engell to lock the store's doors, but she said that she did not have the keys. Alves recalled that Isom \"was saying his life was worth shit and he had nothing to live for.\" Isom then asked Alves and Engell if they had a gun; they responded that they did not. Continuing to mutter that his life was worthless, Isom pressed the concealed item against Engell's stomach, explaining that he did not want to have to hurt either Alves or Engell. At some point, Alves activated a silent alarm behind the counter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isom then unwrapped the concealed item &#8212; it was an axe. He began to play with the axe. Alves started to cry and Engell asked Isom if Alves could leave because she was pregnant. Isom said yes, and Alves left the store. Shortly thereafter, when Isom put his head down on the counter and continued to mutter, Engell ran out of the store as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Engell encountered Police Sergeant Green, who asked her whether the man inside was armed (the silent alarm had brought the police to the store). Engell replied that Isom was carrying an axe. Green, by himself, entered the store with his gun drawn and started talking to Isom, who was standing in the middle of the store. Isom was initially silent, but eventually told the officer his name and said, according to Green, that \"he was going to die today.\" Isom then became non-responsive to Sergeant Green's further questions and \"just went blank.\" He was holding the axe in his right hand with a tight grip, and it was raised slightly up. Several seconds later, Officer Ouellette, who had arrived separately, entered the store and knelt down, with his gun drawn, on Sergeant Green's right. At about the same time, another officer, Loiselle, entered the store and positioned himself at the rear exit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Green and Ouellette testified that they started \"continuously\" \"pleading\" for Isom to drop the axe, but Isom remained in a daze and did not reply. At some point, two other officers, Captain Barkett and Detective Clancy, entered the store. Sergeant Green explained to Captain Barkett that he was \"trying to handle it between [himself] and Mr. Isom.\" Captain Barkett did not reply. Detective Clancy also began telling Isom to drop the axe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After several minutes, Detective Clancy, who was in plain clothes, reached over and removed Sergeant Green's cannister of pepper spray from his belt. He testified that he was concerned that, given Isom's non-responsiveness, the officers' safety was in danger and he believed that spraying Isom with the pepper spray would allow the officers to suppress Isom. Detective Clancy then held up the pepper spray to Captain Barkett, the commanding officer on the scene, who \"nodded to [Clancy] in the affirmative nature.\" Detective Clancy yelled out \"ASR,\" an indication to the other officers that he was going to use the spray; each of the officers had been through several hours of training on the use of pepper spray in which this code-word had been explained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From behind the store counter, Detective Clancy started to spray Isom with the pepper spray and yelled for Isom to put down the axe. Clancy explained that normally the spray \"causes debilitation ... and you just want to succumb to [officers'] commands.\" Still, the spray appeared to have no effect on Isom, which Clancy found \"remarkable.\" Clancy testified that in \"[a]ll of the years that [he had] used the spray, it's always had an [e]ffect on individuals.\" Officer Ouellette also said that he was \"caught off guard\" when the spray did not affect Isom. Officer Loiselle agreed, explaining that the spray did not seem to have an effect on Isom, which was unusual: \"[t]ypically an individual exposed to [the spray] would have an involuntary closure of the eyes, uncontrollable coughing, loss of coordination or stamina.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the spray stopped, Isom turned toward Officer Loiselle and then suddenly lifted the axe and charged toward Sergeant Green and Officer Ouellette. When Isom was within ten feet of Green and Ouellette, still running toward them with the axe raised, the two officers fired their guns at Isom. Isom fell to the floor and died shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Section 1983 Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's &#167; 1983 claim alleges that the officers violated Isom's Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force in the course of attempting to disarm him.

You testified that there was no warning by Officer Clancy prior to the time he actually yelled ASR that he was going to use the pepper spray. <i>Did you feel that pepper spray at that point in time was an option for Officer Clancy?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Yes.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

Probably become disoriented where we could actually physically take him down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Sergeant Green's testimony was not, as plaintiff contends, that no objective police officer could have thought that the use of pepper spray was warranted in the circumstances faced by Detective Clancy. On the most favorable reading of the testimony for the plaintiff, Sergeant Green's testimony establishes only that he believed it would not have been reasonable for an officer <i>in Green's particular situation</i> to use the pepper spray. But, as Sergeant Green himself explained, the circumstances and responsibilities that he faced were quite different than those faced by Detective Clancy. As the initial officer on the scene, Green's primary responsibility was not necessarily to defuse the situation so much as to prevent it from escalating. Detective Clancy, who arrived at the store after the other officers had established some control over the situation, was in a different situation from Green, and thus had different tactical options available to him in deciding what was the most appropriate action. In fact, Sergeant Green acknowledged that use of the pepper spray was \"an option\" for Detective Clancy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from Sergeant Green's testimony, the plaintiff did not present any other evidence even addressing the reasonableness of the officers' actions. No expert testified that, under the circumstances faced by Detective Clancy, no reasonable officer would have used pepper spray; in fact, the plaintiffs did not produce any expert testimony at all.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Nor did the plaintiff produce any written policy or text stating that the use of pepper spray in circumstances such as those faced by Clancy was not reasonable. The plaintiff argues that such evidence was not needed &#8212; that this is a matter which should have been left to the jury's common sense and that the plaintiffs were entitled to let the jury reach a decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that this argument fails. For the jurors to have been given an opportunity to exercise their common sense on the ultimate question of whether no objectively reasonable officer would have used pepper spray, there must have been some basis in the evidence on which to ground that determination. Even putting aside the evidence that Detective Clancy was experienced in the use of pepper spray, believed it would decrease the ultimate risk of violence from Isom, and requested and received permission to use the spray from the commanding officer, no reasonable jury could have found in the plaintiff's favor. There was no evidence from which the jury could rationally draw the conclusion that the officers' actions were objectively unreasonable. At best, Sergeant Green said that <i>he</i> would not have used the pepper spray, not that an objectively reasonable officer in Detective Clancy's position would not have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Wrongful Death Claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also dismissed plaintiff's state law wrongful death claims. The Rhode Island statute requires that death be caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of another. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. L. &#167; 10-7-1. In theory, the plaintiff in this case might have established a breach of a duty of care by showing a violation of the Warren police department's use-of-force policy. That policy provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Non-deadly force may be used by a police officer in the performance of his duty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. when necessary to preserve the peace, prevent commission of offenses, or prevent suicide or self-infl[i]cted injury; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. when necessary to overcome resistance to arrests, to conduct searches and seizures, and to prevent escapes from custody; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. when in self-defense, or defense of another against unlawful violence to his person or property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. Chemical substances may be used when physical force is necessary:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. to protect an officer or other person from an assault; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. to SUBDUE a person who resists arrest; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. to deter persons engaged in riotous conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is preferred that chemical substances not be used if resistance is minor and not hazardous, or if physical powers would reasonably achieve the same end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No breach of a duty of care can be based on this policy. The policy gives officers significant discretion to exercise their judgment in using pepper spray; the officers were within that discretion when they decided to use pepper spray on Isom. To the extent that the state law claim is based on common law notions of duty of care, our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to show that the officers acted in an objectively unreasonable fashion is sufficient to support dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment for the defendants is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Counsel for plaintiff apparently initially intended to present several expert witnesses, but the district court disallowed these witnesses in a pre-trial ruling.
