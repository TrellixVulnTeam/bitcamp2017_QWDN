Michael A.

Plaintiff appeals from district court orders\n\ngranting defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint and denying\n\nplaintiff's motion to reconsider the dismissal.1           Reviewing the\n\ndismissal of the complaint de novo in light of the record and the\n\nsubmissions on appeal, we see no error.        Plaintiff's complaint was\n\nproperly dismissed for failure to state any cognizable claim.\n\nThere was no abuse of discretion in the denial of plaintiff's\n\nmotion for reconsideration.\n\n           While plaintiff attempts to assert new claims and to\n\npresent   additional   documents,    because   these   matters   were   not\n\nbrought to the attention of the district court, they cannot be\n\nconsidered on appeal.    Evangelista v. Secretary of Health & Human\n\nServs., 826 F.2d 136, 144 (1st Cir. 1987).       To the extent plaintiff\n\nargues that he should be permitted to amend the complaint, he did\n\nnot file a motion to amend the complaint in the district court,\n\nand, in any event, has offered no reason to believe that an\n\namendment might cure the defects in the complaint.           Plaintiff's\n\nallegation of judicial bias also was not raised in the district\n\ncourt and is meritless in any event.\n\n           Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n     1\n      We do not discuss defendant's separate contention that the\nappeal fails because of plaintiff's flagrant failure to comply with\nthe procedural requirements of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure. A pro se party is obligated to comply with procedural\nrules. Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 890 (1st Cir. 1997).\nBecause plaintiff's appeal lacks substantive merit, we elect to\nproceed on that basis.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f",
