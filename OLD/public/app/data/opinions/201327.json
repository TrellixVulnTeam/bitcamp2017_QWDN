Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Torruella, Selya and Howard,\n\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Fredric J. Gross and Fredric J. Gross Law Firm on brief for\nappellant.\n     Allen N. David, Elizabeth A. Houlding and Peabody & Arnold LLP\non brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          November 10, 2004\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge. This is an appeal from a terse and\n\nuninformative order dismissing a nine-count civil complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.\n\nBecause it is impossible to tell what arguments the district court\n\nfound persuasive, we have canvassed the field.                  We conclude that\n\nthe complaint states one potentially actionable claim and another\n\nthat is not beyond hope of repair.                Consequently, we reverse the\n\norder of dismissal in part and remand for further proceedings.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n              Because this is an appeal from an order under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6), we take the facts as they are alleged in the\n\nplaintiff's complaint.1        SEC v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 508\n\n(1st       Cir.   1998).      We    ignore,       however,    \"bald    assertions,\n\nperiphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated conclusions, [and]\n\noutright vituperation.\" Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903\n\nF.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990).            Once the scene is set, we recount the\n\ntravel of the case.\n\n                                   A.    The Facts.\n\n              In July of 1997, plaintiff-appellant Joseph Rodi, a\n\nwould-be      law   student   who       resided   in   New   Jersey,   received   a\n\n\n\n       1\n      Although the parties submitted affidavits in the district\ncourt, we eschew any reliance on the factual averments contained\ntherein, with a few exceptions that we elucidate below. We explain\nwhy in Part II(A), infra.\n\n                                          -2-\n\frecruitment letter from Francis J. Larkin, dean of Southern New\n\nEngland School of Law (SNESL). The letter stated in pertinent part\n\nthat the accreditation committee of the American Bar Association\n\n(ABA) had voted to recommend SNESL for \"provisional accreditation,\"\n\na   status     that    would   be     granted    upon       ratification    of   the\n\nrecommendation by two other ABA bodies.                   The letter also stated\n\nthat   SNESL    was     \"highly     confident\"       of   receiving   the    needed\n\nratifications and that the future of the school \"has never been\n\nbrighter.\"     Because the plaintiff intended to take the New Jersey\n\nbar examination, the prospect of accreditation was critically\n\nimportant to him; New Jersey requires bar applicants to hold law\n\ndegrees from ABA-accredited institutions.\n\n             Larkin's letter ended with a pitch for enrollment.                  The\n\nsolicitation bore fruit; the plaintiff enrolled at SNESL that\n\nmonth.   He received a catalogue from SNESL containing, inter alia,\n\na statement (in the same type size and font as the surrounding\n\ntext) to the effect that:           \"The Law School makes no representation\n\nto any applicant or student that it will be approved by the\n\nAmerican     Bar      Association     prior     to    the    graduation     of   any\n\nmatriculating student.\"           The complaint alleges that, despite the\n\ncheery optimism of Larkin's letter, the dean knew full well that\n\nSNESL had identifiable deficiencies that would almost certainly\n\npreclude ABA accreditation.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            The ABA denied SNESL's application for accreditation in\n\nSeptember   of   1997.        As   a   result,   the    plaintiff     considered\n\ntransferring to an accredited law school for his second year of\n\nstudy.    Word of his ambivalence reached the dean's office.              David\n\nM. Prentiss, who was then the acting dean, wrote to the plaintiff\n\nin order to \"make sure\" that he was \"fully informed of the school's\n\ncurrent status regarding ABA accreditation.\"                   That communique\n\nstated in substance that the school had improved the four areas\n\nfound deficient by the ABA and that there should be \"no cause for\n\npessimism\" about the school achieving accreditation before the\n\nplaintiff's forecasted graduation date.\n\n            In reliance on these and other representations — all of\n\nwhich the complaint says were knowingly false — the plaintiff\n\nremained at SNESL.      He came to regret the choice:          according to the\n\ncomplaint, SNESL knew, but elected not to disclose, that the ABA\n\nwas highly critical of SNESL; that any faint hope of attaining\n\naccreditation depended upon a complete overhaul of the faculty,\n\nadministration, curriculum, and student body; and that the level of\n\nnon-compliance made the prospect of SNESL's near-term accreditation\n\nremote.     To   compound      this    mendacity,      the   school   frustrated\n\nstudents'    attempts    to    learn    about    the    true   status    of   the\n\naccreditation pavane.\n\n            In November of 1999 — during the plaintiff's third year\n\nof legal studies — the ABA denied SNESL's renewed application for\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\faccreditation.     SNESL failed to appeal to the ABA's House of\n\nDelegates as it previously had promised.                 Instead, the school\n\ncashiered half of its full-time faculty, thereby straying even\n\nfurther from ABA-mandated standards.\n\n            The plaintiff completed his studies in June of 2000.\n\nSNESL remained unaccredited.           Notwithstanding his diploma, the\n\nplaintiff   has   not   been   able    to   sit   for   the   New   Jersey   bar\n\nexamination.\n\n                        B.     Travel of the Case.\n\n            On July 18, 2002, the plaintiff sued SNESL, Larkin, and\n\nPrentiss in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nNew Jersey.    The district court dismissed that action for want of\n\nin personam jurisdiction on April 10, 2003.             Rodi v. S. New Engl.\n\nSch. of Law, 255 F. Supp. 2d 346, 351 (D.N.J. 2003).                On June 9,\n\n2003, the plaintiff, acting pro se, sued the same defendants in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nGrounding     jurisdiction     in   diversity     of    citizenship   and    the\n\nexistence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1332(a), his complaint incorporated copies of the Larkin and\n\nPrentiss letters and limned nine statements of claim.\n\n            We confine our discussion to the two claims that the\n\nplaintiff presses on appeal:          (i) that the defendants' statements\n\nconstituted actionable fraud or misrepresentation, and (ii) that\n\nSNESL's actions violated a consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fLaws ch. 93A, §§ 1-11.   The defendants filed a timely motion to\n\ndismiss, positing that the complaint, for a variety of reasons,\n\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.     As to\n\nthe fraudulent misrepresentation count, the defendants asseverated\n\nthat the \"misrepresentations\" were non-actionable statements of\n\nopinion; that the supposed fraud had not been alleged with the\n\nrequisite particularity; that, in all events, the plaintiff's\n\nprofessed reliance on those statements was unreasonable; and that\n\nthe statute of limitations had run.     With respect to the Chapter\n\n93A count, the defendants averred that the complaint failed to\n\nstate an actionable claim because the alleged misrepresentations\n\nwere insufficient to trigger the prophylaxis of the statute, and,\n\nmoreover, the complaint failed to allege that a demand letter had\n\nbeen sent before suit.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3).\n\n          The plaintiff, still acting pro se, filed an opposition\n\nto the motion to dismiss in which he made a point-by-point rebuttal\n\nof the defendants' asseverations.     As part of his opposition, he\n\ntendered five affidavits, two additional letters, and an array of\n\nother documents.   SNESL filed a reply and, not to be outdone,\n\nproffered a welter of documents (including copies of its catalogues\n\nfor the years in question).\n\n          The district court abjured oral argument and ruled on the\n\npapers. It entered a cryptic order, providing in its entirety that\n\nthe motion to dismiss should be allowed \"for substantially the\n\n\n                               -6-\n\freasons outlined in defendants' memorandum of law.\"    The plaintiff\n\npromptly moved for reconsideration, suggesting, among other things,\n\nthat if the district court \"found the complaint's allegations too\n\nscanty, it could have granted leave to amend.\"      The court denied\n\nthe motion without comment.    This counseled appeal ensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            We divide our discussion of the issues into several\n\nsegments.    First, we ascertain what materials are properly before\n\nus.   We then proceed count by count and theory by theory.     In so\n\ndoing, we omit any reference to the seven counts that the plaintiff\n\nhas elected not to defend on appeal.\n\n                     A.   Configuring the Record.\n\n            The threshold issue here involves a determination of what\n\nlegal standard the district court applied (or should have applied)\n\nin examining the pleadings before it.    The defendants styled their\n\nmotion as a motion to dismiss, but the parties then proffered\n\nexhibits containing information extraneous to the complaint.    That\n\npresents a quandary.\n\n            The Civil Rules provide that when \"matters outside the\n\npleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the\n\nmotion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of\n\nas provided in Rule 56.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).    The district\n\ncourt's order is silent as to whether it elected to convert the\n\nmotion to a motion for summary judgment.      Consequently, we must\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdecide   \"whether    the    court     actually   took   cognizance   of   [the\n\nsupplemental material], or invoked Rule 56, in arriving at its\n\ndecision.\"     Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d\n\n15, 19 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           The state of this record is tenebrous.                 We do know,\n\nhowever,     that   the    district     court    embraced   the   defendants'\n\nmemorandum of law — and that memorandum relied upon the Rule\n\n12(b)(6) standard, not the quite different Rule 56 standard.                In\n\nthe same vein, both sides have briefed the case on appeal as if\n\nRule 12(b)(6), rather than Rule 56, controls.               Under the unique\n\ncircumstances of this case, considerations of fundamental fairness\n\ncounsel in favor of following the parties' and the lower court's\n\nlead and testing the arguments on appeal under the jurisprudence of\n\nRule 12(b)(6).      We adopt that course.\n\n             Once that decision has been made, the standard of review\n\nbecomes straightforward.       Orders granting motions to dismiss under\n\nRule 12(b)(6) engender de novo review.               Mass. Sch. of Law at\n\nAndover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 40 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nIn ruling on whether a plaintiff has stated an actionable claim, an\n\ninquiring court, be it a trial or appellate court, must consider\n\nthe complaint, documents annexed to it, and other materials fairly\n\nincorporated within it.       In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324\n\nF.3d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2003); Cogan v. Phoenix Life Ins. Co., 310\n\nF.3d 238, 241 n.4 (1st Cir. 2002).                 This sometimes includes\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fdocuments referred to in the complaint but not annexed to it.                    See\n\nCoyne v. Cronin, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-2357,\n\nslip op. at 11]; Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d\n\n12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 840 F.2d\n\n1012, 1015 (1st Cir. 1988).          Finally, the jurisprudence of Rule\n\n12(b)(6) permits courts to consider matters that are susceptible to\n\njudicial notice.       Colonial Mortg. Bankers, 324 F.3d at 15-16;\n\nBoateng v. InterAmerican Univ., 210 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Giving force to these principles, we may consider on this\n\nappeal the facts alleged in the complaint, the Larkin and Prentiss\n\nletters (which were annexed to it), and any matters that may be\n\njudicially   noticed.      We     also   may     consider    SNESL's   1997-1998\n\ncatalogue, alleged by the plaintiff to comprise a part of the\n\ncontract between the parties, as a document fairly incorporated\n\ninto the complaint.      See Beddall, 137 F.3d at 17.            However, we may\n\nnot   consider    at    this    stage     the    array      of   affidavits      and\n\nmiscellaneous documents proffered by the parties.\n\n           Having identified the materials that are properly before\n\nus, we briefly address the question of affirmative defenses.                  On a\n\nRule 12(b)(6) motion, the court's inquiry sometimes may encompass\n\naffirmative defenses.          Everything depends on the record.              As a\n\ngeneral   rule,   a    properly    raised       affirmative      defense   can    be\n\nadjudicated on a motion to dismiss so long as (i) the facts\n\nestablishing the defense are definitively ascertainable from the\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fcomplaint and the other allowable sources of information, and (ii)\n\nthose facts suffice to establish the affirmative defense with\n\ncertitude.     Colonial Mortg. Bankers, 324 F.3d at 16.\n\n          Against this backdrop, we examine the bases on which the\n\ndistrict court could have predicated its decision.             We take each\n\ncount and each ground in turn.\n\n              B.    The Fraudulent Misrepresentation Count.\n\n          The defendants advance a motley of potential defenses to\n\nthe plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim.              We address\n\nthem sequentially.\n\n          1.       In General.   We start by testing the vitality of the\n\nclaim as a whole.      We will uphold a dismissal on this ground \"only\n\nif the plaintiff's factual averments hold out no hope of recovery\n\non any theory adumbrated in [his] complaint.\"          Id. at 15 (citing\n\nRogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999)).           Our task is not\n\nto decide whether the plaintiff ultimately will prevail but,\n\nrather,   whether      he   is   entitled   to   undertake    discovery   in\n\nfurtherance of the pleaded claim. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232,\n\n236 (1974).    In this process, the fact that the plaintiff filed the\n\ncomplaint pro se militates in favor of a liberal reading.                 See\n\nBoivin v. Black, 225 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that\n\n\"courts hold pro se pleadings to less demanding standards than\n\nthose drafted by lawyers\").\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           Sitting in diversity, we look to the substantive law of\n\nthe forum state (here, Massachusetts) to guide our analysis.\n\nCorreia v. Fitzgerald, 354 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).                Under\n\nMassachusetts law, a claim for misrepresentation entails a false\n\nstatement of material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act and\n\nreasonably relied upon by him to his detriment. Zimmerman v. Kent,\n\n575 N.E.2d 70, 74 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991).           The plaintiff's claim\n\npasses this screen.\n\n           As to Larkin, the complaint, read liberally, alleges the\n\nfollowing:   (i) Larkin knew that the plaintiff was a New Jersey\n\nresident who wanted to practice law there; (ii) he also knew that\n\nthe plaintiff could not sit for the New Jersey bar unless he\n\ngraduated from an accredited law school; (iii) he sent a letter to\n\nthe   plaintiff   in   New   Jersey    stating   that   SNESL   was   \"highly\n\nconfident\" of receiving accreditation, knowing that this statement\n\nwas materially false because SNESL had substantial deficiencies\n\nthat would make accreditation difficult if not impossible; and (iv)\n\nthe plaintiff, relying on Larkin's letter, enrolled at SNESL, paid\n\nsubstantial sums for tuition, and invested three years of his life\n\nin mastering its curriculum.       We think that these allegations, if\n\nproven,   would    make      out   a    viable    claim   for    fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation. See Kerr v. Shurtleff, 105 N.E. 871, 872 (Mass.\n\n1914) (holding that college committed fraudulent misrepresentation\n\nby falsely telling prospective student that it could \"make [him] a\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fD.M.D.\" when student enrolled and graduated but school lacked the\n\nauthority to grant the degree).\n\n          A similar analysis applies to the plaintiff's fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation claim against Prentiss.            Prentiss's statement\n\nthat there was \"no cause for pessimism\" about the prospect of near-\n\nterm accreditation is materially false if there was in fact cause\n\nfor pessimism due to the extent of the school's known shortcomings.\n\nThe plaintiff alleges that Prentiss knowingly made this false\n\nstatement in order to induce him to remain enrolled at SNESL and\n\nthat he (Rodi) took the bait and relied on it to his detriment.\n\n          As   pleaded,     SNESL   is   vicariously   liable   for   these\n\nfraudulent misrepresentations.       It is reasonable to infer from the\n\nallegations contained in the complaint that Larkin and Prentiss\n\nwere high-ranking employees of SNESL acting within the scope of\n\ntheir employment.      Consequently,       their   misrepresentations   are\n\nattributable   to   SNESL    on   respondeat   superior   grounds.      See\n\ngenerally Kavanagh v. Trs. of Boston Univ., 795 N.E.2d 1170, 1174\n\n(Mass. 2003) (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.04 (Tent.\n\nDraft No. 2, 2001)).        Accordingly, the complaint, on its face,\n\nstates a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against all three\n\ndefendants.\n\n          2. Matters of Opinion. The defendants' effort to short-\n\ncircuit this claim is multifaceted.         Their first counter is that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fthe cited statements were, at most, statements of opinion. That is\n\ntrue, in a sense, but it does not get the defendants very far.\n\n             A statement, though couched in terms of opinion, may\n\nconstitute a statement of fact if it may reasonably be understood\n\nby the reader or listener as implying the existence of facts that\n\njustify the statement (or, at least, the non-existence of any facts\n\nincompatible with it).         See McEneaney v. Chestnut Hill Realty\n\nCorp.,   650    N.E.2d   93,   96   (Mass.   App.   Ct.   1995);   see   also\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 539 (1977) (explaining that \"[a]\n\nstatement of opinion as to facts not disclosed [may] be interpreted\n\n. . . as an implied statement that the facts known to the maker are\n\nnot incompatible with his opinion\"); cf. Levinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-\n\nMart Stores, Inc., 127 F.3d 122, 127 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"A statement\n\ncouched as an opinion that presents or implies the existence of\n\nfacts which are capable of being proven true or false can be\n\nactionable.\").     Thus, it is an actionable misrepresentation for a\n\ncorporation falsely to tell investors that a specific project is \"a\n\ngreat success\" that is \"proceeding smoothly . . . and better than\n\nexpected\" in order to keep them from pulling the plug.         Stolzoff v.\n\nWaste Sys. Int'l, Inc., 792 N.E.2d 1031, 1036-37, 1042 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2003).     Similarly, it is an actionable misrepresentation for a\n\ncar dealer to tell a buyer that he \"believes\" a vehicle is in\n\n\"good\" condition when he knows that it has significant mechanical\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdefects.    Briggs v. Carol Cars, Inc., 553 N.E.2d 930, 933 (Mass.\n\n1990).\n\n            The    Restatement,    favorably        referenced       in   the\n\nMassachusetts cases, gives a stunningly appropriate example:\n\n            [W]hen an auditor who is known to have\n            examined the books of a corporation states\n            that it is in sound financial condition, he\n            may reasonably be understood to say that his\n            examination has been sufficient to permit him\n            to form an honest opinion and that what he has\n            found justifies his conclusion. The opinion\n            thus becomes in effect a short summary of\n            those facts. When he is reasonably understood\n            as conveying such a statement, he is subject\n            to liability if he . . . has not found facts\n            that justify the opinion, on the basis of his\n            misrepresentation of the implied facts.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 539, cmt. b.              The parallel is\n\napparent.     The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the ABA has\n\nformulated certain objective criteria that inform its decisions\n\nabout whether and when to accredit law schools.            It also alleges\n\nthat Larkin, knowing of these criteria, wrote a letter to the\n\nplaintiff implying that the school was reasonably capable of\n\nsatisfying them.    If Larkin did know of disqualifying and probably\n\nirremediable deficiencies (as the plaintiff has alleged), his\n\nstatement that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of accreditation was\n\nactionably misleading.     Prentiss's statement that there was \"no\n\ncause for    pessimism\"   about   the   fate   of   the   school's    renewed\n\naccreditation application is subject to much the same analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f              To be sure, knowing falsity is much easier to allege than\n\nto   prove.        Here,    however,   the   district     court      jettisoned   the\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation count at the pleading stage.                      Given\n\nthe liberal standards of Rule 12(b)(6), that dismissal cannot rest\n\non the \"opinion\" defense.\n\n              3.    Failure to Plead With Particularity.               For the most\n\npart, a civil complaint need only contain \"a short and plain\n\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\n\nrelief.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).                For that reason, \"[g]reat\n\nspecificity is ordinarily not required to survive a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion.\" Garita Hotel, 958 F.2d at 17. That proposition, however,\n\nis not universally applicable.               \"Cases alleging fraud — and for\n\nthis purpose, misrepresentation is considered a species of fraud —\n\nconstitute an exception to [it].\"             Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc.\n\nv.   Synopsys,      Inc.,    374   F.3d    23,   29    (1st   Cir.    2004).      That\n\nexception, codified in Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), requires that fraud be\n\nalleged with particularity. Id. This heightened pleading standard\n\nis satisfied by an averment \"of the who, what, where, and when of\n\nthe allegedly false or fraudulent representation.\"                      Id.; accord\n\nPowers v. Boston Cooper Corp., 926 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir. 1991);\n\nMcGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc., 633 F.2d 226, 228-29 & n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 1980).\n\n              In this instance, the defendants assert that the district\n\ncourt was warranted in dismissing the fraudulent misrepresentation\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fclaim for failure to abide by these strictures. In addressing that\n\nassertion, we note that the specificity requirement extends only to\n\nthe particulars of the allegedly misleading statement itself.                         See\n\nEducadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367 F.3d 61, 66\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).        The other elements of fraud, such as intent and\n\nknowledge, may be averred in general terms.                     See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n9(b).\n\n           After careful perscrutation, we deem this line of defense\n\nunavailing.       The     Larkin   and    Prentiss       letters       are    unarguably\n\nspecific   as     to    speaker,   content,       context,       and    time.        These\n\nstatements        are     sufficient        to         shield      the        fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation count from dismissal at the pleading stage. See,\n\ne.g., Powers, 926 F.2d at 111; see also Philippe v. Shape, Inc.,\n\n688 F. Supp. 783, 786-87 (D. Me. 1988) (holding that documents\n\naffixed to complaint that contained alleged misrepresentations\n\nsatisfied Rule 9(b)).\n\n           We     note,    however,      that    the     complaint       attributes     a\n\ngallimaufry     of     other   substantially          similar   statements       to   the\n\ndefendants.     We count no fewer than four such allegedly fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentations:        (i) that a SNESL employee had reported that\n\nthe 1997 application for accreditation came \"within an inch of ABA\n\napproval\"; (ii) that an admissions officer proclaimed that SNESL\n\n\"will be accredited\"; (iii) that SNESL claimed it had received a\n\nspecial    time      waiver    from   the       ABA    because     its       \"case    [for\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\faccreditation] was so strong\"; and (iv) that if accreditation were\n\nagain denied, SNESL would appeal directly to the ABA's governing\n\nbody.    None   of   these   four   statements    is   pleaded   with   the\n\nparticularity required under Rule 9(b).          Insofar as we can tell\n\nfrom the complaint, each such statement was made by an unidentified\n\nperson at an unnamed place and at an unspecified time.2                 Such\n\ngossamer allegations are patently inadequate under Rule 9(b).           See\n\nAlternative Sys. Concepts, 374 F.3d at 30; Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118\n\nF.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          When a claim sounding in fraud contains a hybrid of\n\nallegations, some of which satisfy the strictures of Rule 9(b) and\n\nsome of which do not, an inquiring court may sustain the claim on\n\nthe basis of those specific allegations that are properly pleaded.\n\nSee Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1105 (9th Cir.\n\n2003); Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 366\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).     So it is here.   For that reason, we take no view\n\neither as to whether the plaintiff, on remand, should be permitted\n\nto amend his complaint to add particulars anent the other four\n\nstatements or as to whether, absent an amendment, evidence of those\n\nstatements may be introduced at trial in support of the allegation\n\nthat the plaintiff reasonably relied on the Larkin and Prentiss\n\n\n     2\n      We acknowledge that the plaintiff has provided many of the\nmissing details concerning these statements in other filings, such\nas his affidavits and briefs. Nevertheless, those documents are\nnot eligible for consideration on this appeal.     See supra Part\nII(A).\n\n                                    -17-\n\fletters.    In the first instance, such matters, should they arise,\n\nare for the district court.\n\n            4.      Reasonable Reliance.      Reasonable reliance is, of\n\ncourse, an element of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim under\n\nMassachusetts law.       Zimmerman, 575 N.E.2d at 76.             The defendants\n\nstrive to persuade us that the disclaimer placed in the school's\n\ncatalogue — disclaiming any \"representation to any applicant or\n\nstudent    that     [SNESL]   will   be   approved   by     the    American   Bar\n\nAssociation prior to the graduation of any matriculating student\"\n\n— renders any reliance by the plaintiff on Larkin's and Prentiss's\n\nepistles unreasonable as a matter of law.            We are not convinced.\n\n            Under Massachusetts law, the reasonableness of a party's\n\nreliance ordinarily constitutes a question of fact for the jury.\n\nMass. Laborers' Health & Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 62 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 236, 242 (D. Mass. 1999); Cataldo Ambul. Serv., Inc. v.\n\nCity of Chelsea, 688 N.E.2d 959, 962 (Mass. 1998).                When, however,\n\nthe facts alleged in the complaint preclude a finding of reasonable\n\nreliance, a court may enter an order of dismissal under Rule\n\n12(b)(6).    See, e.g., Mass. Laborers' Health & Welfare Fund, 62 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 242; Saxon Theatre Corp. v. Sage, 200 N.E.2d 241, 244\n\n(Mass.     1964).      The    defendants    argue    that    the     disclaimer,\n\nincorporated by reference in the plaintiff's complaint, makes this\n\nsuch a case.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f           In mounting this argument, the defendants distort the\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation.              They insist that the plaintiff's\n\nasserted injury flows from a broken promise of accreditation (i.e.,\n\nthat he was promised accreditation that did not occur).                         Since the\n\ndisclaimer      flatly     contradicts         any    such        representation,      the\n\ndefendants      say,     reliance     on       that   promise        was      objectively\n\nunreasonable.\n\n             This argument erects, and then attacks, a straw man.                       As\n\nsaid, the plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants falsely\n\nimplied    that    SNESL     had    the        capacity      to     achieve     near-term\n\naccreditation.      This is a meaningful distinction.                  It is one thing\n\nfor an actor to demur when asked to guarantee a third party's\n\nactions. It is quite another for an actor to mislead a person into\n\nbelieving that the actor itself possesses means and abilities fully\n\nwithin its control.           Given this distinction, the defendants'\n\nreliance   on     the    disclaimer       is    misplaced:           inasmuch     as   the\n\ndisclaimer does not cover the alleged misrepresentations, it cannot\n\ndefeat them.      See Hitachi Credit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank, 166 F.3d\n\n614, 630-631 (4th Cir. 1999) (holding that a contracting party may\n\nrecover for fraud notwithstanding \"specific disclaimers that do not\n\ncover the allegedly fraudulent contract-inducing representations\").\n\n             It is, of course, arguable that the proof at summary\n\njudgment or at trial may show that the disclaimer does cover\n\nwhatever misrepresentations (if any) were actually made.                         But even\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fif the defendants' characterization of the plaintiff's fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation claim was on the mark, we could not affirm the\n\norder of dismissal on this ground.           We explain briefly.\n\n              Under Massachusetts law, \"a party may not contract out of\n\nfraud.\"    Turner v. Johnson & Johnson, 809 F.2d 90, 95 (1st Cir.\n\n1986).    With this in mind, Massachusetts courts consistently have\n\nheld   that     disclaimers   do   not    automatically   defeat   fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation claims. See, e.g., Bates v. Southgate, 31 N.E.2d\n\n551, 558 (Mass. 1941); Sound Techniques, Inc. v. Hoffman, 737\n\nN.E.2d 920, 924 (Mass. App. Ct. 2000); see also VMark Software,\n\nInc. v. EMC Corp., 642 N.E.2d 587, 594 n.11 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n              At the motion to dismiss stage, information such as the\n\nconspicuousness of the disclaimer and the parties' discussions\n\nconcerning it is largely undeveloped.            These details are relevant,\n\nas the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract will\n\nshed light upon the disclaimer's meaning and effect.               See Turner,\n\n809 F.2d at 96 (stating that when dealing with an ambiguous\n\ndisclaimer, \"the agreement is to some extent left undefined, and\n\nthe plaintiff's understanding of the agreement logically may be\n\ncolored    by    the   defendant's       prior   statements,   fraudulent   or\n\notherwise\").       On an empty record, we would have no principled\n\nchoice but to decline the defendants' invitation to hold, as a\n\nmatter of law, that there is no possible set of circumstances under\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fwhich the disclaimer might prove ineffective.            See V.S.H. Realty,\n\nInc. v. Texaco, Inc., 757 F.2d 411, 418 (1st Cir. 1985) (cautioning\n\nagainst   deciding    whether   an    exculpatory      clause   precludes     a\n\nmisrepresentation claim \"without development of a factual record\").\n\n            5.   Statute of Limitations.     The defendants have a final\n\nfallback position.      They assert that, even if the fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation claim is actionable, it is time-barred.                     We\n\nexplore this possibility.\n\n            To a limited extent, a statute of limitations defense can\n\nbe considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.             See, e.g., LaChapelle,\n\n142 F.3d at 509.        The key is whether the complaint and any\n\ndocuments that properly may be read in conjunction with it show\n\nbeyond doubt that the claim asserted is out of time.                Id.\n\n            Massachusetts law provides that an action in tort — of\n\nwhich   fraudulent   misrepresentation      is   a   species    —    \"shall   be\n\ncommenced only within three years next after the cause of action\n\naccrues.\"    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2A.          A claim for fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation does not begin to accrue until \"a plaintiff\n\nlearns or reasonably should have learned of the misrepresentation.\"\n\nKent v. Dupree, 429 N.E.2d 1041, 1043 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982); accord\n\nPatsos v. First Albany Corp., 741 N.E.2d 841, 846 (Mass. 2001);\n\nMcEneaney, 650 N.E.2d at 97. In this context, courts sometimes ask\n\nwhen sufficient indicia of trouble — storm warnings, so to speak —\n\nshould have been apparent to a reasonably prudent person.                 See,\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fe.g., Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 361 F.3d 44, 47-48 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); Young v. Lepone, 305 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            In the case at hand, the plaintiff's complaint alleges\n\nthat   he    learned   of   persistent   deficiencies   precluding     ABA\n\naccreditation at an unspecified date in November of 1999.            There\n\nare no facts alleged in the complaint that require an inference of\n\nan earlier accrual date.       As of that time, then, the plaintiff\n\nshould have figured out that the defendants' rodomontade about the\n\nschool's capabilities and the imminence of accreditation was quite\n\nlikely pie in the sky.      On that basis, the plaintiff should have\n\ncommenced his action no later than November of 2002 (the precise\n\ndate is inconsequential, for reasons that shortly will become\n\napparent).     Because this action was not docketed until June 9,\n\n2003, a cursory glance would appear to validate the defendants'\n\nassertion that the statute of limitations had run.          See, e.g.,\n\nJolicoeur v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law, 104 Fed. Appx. 745, 746-47\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (holding a similar action, filed by\n\none of the plaintiff's classmates on June 18, 2003, to be time-\n\nbarred).\n\n            Appearances sometimes are deceiving — and this is such an\n\ninstance.     Here, unlike in Jolicoeur, the plaintiff filed an\n\nantecedent suit in the District of New Jersey on July 18, 2002 —\n\nwell within the putative limitations period.        Although that case\n\nwas dismissed on April 10, 2003, the dismissal was not on the\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fmerits, but, rather, for want of personal jurisdiction over the\n\nnamed defendants (SNESL, Larkin, and Prentiss). Rodi, 255 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 351.\n\n            This history is significant because, under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, if an action is duly commenced within the limitations period\n\nand then dismissed for \"any matter of form,\" the plaintiff is\n\nentitled to \"commence a new action for the same cause within one\n\nyear after the dismissal.\"        Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 32.            The\n\nsavings statute applies, inter alia, to an action originally filed\n\nand dismissed in a court of another state or in a federal district\n\ncourt.    See Boutiette v. Dickinson, 768 N.E.2d 562, 563-64 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2002); Liberace v. Conway, 574 N.E.2d 1010, 1012 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1991).\n\n            We have no doubt that, for purposes of this savings\n\nstatute,     dismissals   for    want    of   personal    jurisdiction      are\n\nappropriately classified as dismissals arising out of matters of\n\nform.    Cf. Ciampa v. Beverly Airport Comm'n, 650 N.E.2d 816, 817\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1995) (holding that \"dismissal for bringing an\n\naction in the wrong court is 'a matter of form' within the meaning\n\nof   §   32\").    After   all,    as    the   Supreme    Judicial   Court    of\n\nMassachusetts wrote almost two centuries ago in describing an\n\nearlier version of the law, the legislature enacted the savings\n\nstatute to ensure that \"where [a] plaintiff has been defeated by\n\nsome matter not affecting the merits, some defect or informality,\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fwhich he can remedy or avoid by a new process,\" the statute of\n\nlimitations \"shall not prevent him from doing so.\"       Coffin v.\n\nCottle, 33 Mass. (16 Pick.) 383, 386 (1835) (emphasis supplied).\n\nA dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is the paradigmatic\n\nexample of a decision not on the merits that can be cured by new\n\nprocess in a different court.   See Teva Pharm., USA, Inc. v. FDA,\n\n182 F.3d 1003, 1008 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter. This action and the\n\nearlier New Jersey action are sisters under the skin; they involve\n\nthe same parties, the same events, the same nucleus of operative\n\nfacts, and the same causes of action.     By means of the savings\n\nstatute, the plaintiff had one year from the dismissal of his\n\ntimely New Jersey action — until April 10, 2004 — to file anew.   He\n\ninstituted the action sub judice on June 9, 2003.   His fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation claim is therefore timely.\n\n          In an effort to blunt the force of the savings statute,\n\nSNESL raises the red flag of waiver.    It asserts that because the\n\nplaintiff first set forth the savings statute argument in his\n\nopposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, he is not entitled\n\nto benefit from it.   SNESL's flag-waving overlooks, however, that\n\na court asked to dismiss a complaint on statute of limitations\n\ngrounds may examine not only the complaint but also such other\n\ndocuments as may appropriately be considered under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f12(b)(6).    See Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193, 197\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Here, the facts that the plaintiff relies on to show the\n\napplicability of the savings statute (e.g., the date that he filed\n\nthe original action, the nature of that action, the date it was\n\ndismissed, and the basis for the dismissal) are all susceptible to\n\njudicial notice.        See Fed. R. Evid. 201.               Those facts may,\n\ntherefore, be considered in assessing the force of the limitations\n\ndefense.    See Colonial Mortg. Bankers, 324 F.3d at 15-16; see also\n\nKowalski v. Gagne, 914 F.2d 299, 305 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is well-\n\naccepted    that     federal    courts   may    take       judicial   notice     of\n\nproceedings in other courts if those proceedings have relevance to\n\nthe matters at hand.\").\n\n            SNESL's citation to Granahan v. Commonwealth, 476 N.E.2d\n\n266 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985), does not alter this conclusion.                     In a\n\ndiversity case, procedure, unlike substance, is governed by federal\n\nlaw.   See Correia, 354 F.3d at 53 (\"Federal courts sitting in\n\ndiversity    apply    state    substantive     law   and    federal   procedural\n\nrules.\").    Under federal procedural precedents, there has been no\n\nwaiver:     the plaintiff presented developed argumentation on the\n\nsavings statute to the lower court, and thus preserved that issue\n\n\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\ffor appellate review.3     B & T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv.\n\nMut. Ins. Co., 382 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          To say more on this issue would be supererogatory.        At\n\nthis stage of the game, the statute of limitations affords no basis\n\nfor dismissal   of   the   plaintiff's   fraudulent   misrepresentation\n\nclaim.4\n\n                     C.    The Chapter 93A Claim.\n\n          The situation concerning the plaintiff's claim under the\n\nMassachusetts Consumer Protection Act is less clear-cut.        Before\n\nbringing suit under that statute, a plaintiff must mail to the\n\ndefendant a \"written demand for relief, identifying the claimant\n\nand reasonably describing the unfair or deceptive act or practice\n\nrelied upon.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(3).      This notification\n\n\n\n     3\n      In all events, Granahan is materially distinguishable. Here,\nthe plaintiff presented his savings statute argument to the nisi\nprius court. In contrast, Granahan formally raised his savings\nstatute contention for the first time in the appellate court. In\nlaunching that effort, Granahan relied solely on appellate\nargumentation, not \"pleadings, affidavits, or other documents\npresented to the motion judge.\"      476 N.E.2d at 268 n.5.     The\nAppeals Court refused to entertain the argument. Id. at 268. So\nunderstood, Granahan represents nothing more than the Massachusetts\nequivalent of the federal courts' familiar raise-or-waive rule.\nSee, e.g., Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union v.\nSuperline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (warning\nthat \"legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot\nbe broached for the first time on appeal\").\n     4\n      This holding depends, of course, on the plaintiff's\nallegation as to when he first learned of the persistent (and\nlikely insuperable) deficiencies that precluded ABA accreditation.\nShould the proof on this point unfold differently, the district\ncourt is free to reexamine the date of accrual.\n\n                                 -26-\n\fmust be furnished no fewer than thirty days prior to the filing of\n\nsuit.   Id.    The statutory notice requirement is not merely a\n\nprocedural    nicety,   but,   rather,   \"a   prerequisite   to   suit.\"\n\nEntrialgo v. Twin City Dodge, Inc., 333 N.E.2d 202, 204 (Mass.\n\n1975). Furthermore, \"as a special element\" of the cause of action,\n\nit must be alleged in the plaintiff's complaint.       Id.\n\n          In this instance, neither the plaintiff's complaint nor\n\nthe documents attached thereto mention any such notification. That\n\nis sufficient ground to justify dismissal of the Chapter 93A claim.\n\nSee, e.g., City of Boston v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 506 N.E.2d 106,\n\n109 (Mass. 1987); Spilios v. Cohen, 647 N.E.2d 1218, 1220-21 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1995); see also Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513,\n\n515 (1st Cir. 1988) (explaining that, in order to survive a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must \"set forth factual allegations,\n\neither direct or inferential, respecting each material element\n\nnecessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory\").\n\n          This ruling has no effect on the plaintiff's fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation claim. See York v. Sullivan, 338 N.E.2d 341, 346\n\n(Mass. 1975) (explaining that \"the [notice] requirement is a\n\nprerequisite to an action under [Chapter 93A, § 9], but nothing in\n\nthe statute makes it a prerequisite to any other remedy available\n\nto aggrieved consumers\").      Moreover, it may represent no more than\n\na temporary victory for the defendants.          A failure to allege\n\ncompliance with the statutory notice requirement is not necessarily\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fa death knell for a Chapter 93A claim.                   Massachusetts courts\n\ntypically have allowed plaintiffs to amend in order to cure this\n\nkind of modest pleading defect.          See, e.g., Jacobs v. Yamaha Motor\n\nCorp., 649 N.E.2d 758, 761 (Mass. 1995); Parker v. D'Avolio, 664\n\nN.E.2d 858, 861 n.4 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996).              Federal practice is no\n\nless permissive.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (stating that leave to\n\namend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires\").\n\n            Allowing an opportunity to amend is especially fitting\n\nhere.     Our reasons are fivefold.           First, the plaintiff filed the\n\ncomplaint pro se, and \"courts [should] endeavor, within reasonable\n\nlimits, to guard against the loss of pro se claims due to technical\n\ndefects.\"         Boivin,   225   F.3d   at    43.      Second,      a    fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, actionable at common law, often can form the\n\nbasis for a Chapter 93A claim.           See, e.g., Adams v. Liberty Mut.\n\nIns. Co., 799 N.E.2d 130, 140 n.19 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003); Levings\n\nv. Forbes & Wallace, Inc., 396 N.E.2d 149, 154 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1979); see also VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 595 (collecting\n\ncases).      So    here:    apart   from      the    question   of       notice,   the\n\nplaintiff's allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation state a\n\ncolorable claim for relief under Chapter 93A. Third, the plaintiff\n\nvouchsafed in his opposition to the motion to dismiss, and now\n\nreaffirms, that he did in fact furnish the statutorily required\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fnotice.5      Fourth, we do not know whether the district court even\n\nfocused on this defect (as we have said, the district court did not\n\nstate a particularized ground for dismissing this claim). Finally,\n\nthe plaintiff, even without knowing the precise basis for the\n\ndistrict court's order of dismissal, did seek leave to amend as\n\npart of his reconsideration request (an overture that the district\n\ncourt denied without any explanation).\n\n               The Supreme Court declared long ago that \"the purpose of\n\npleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" Conley\n\nv. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 48 (1957).            The view that the pleading of\n\ncases is a game in which every miscue should be fatal is antithetic\n\nto the spirit of the federal rules.                 Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 1\n\n(explaining that the federal rules designed to achieve, inter alia,\n\nthe \"just\" resolution of disputes).             Each case is sui generis.\n\nHere,      however,     the   circumstances   cry   out   for   affording   the\n\nplaintiff a fair opportunity to replead his Chapter 93A claim.\n\nAccordingly, we direct the district court, on remand, to grant the\n\nplaintiff that opportunity.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further. For the reasons elaborated above,\n\nwe reverse the district court's order insofar as it dismisses the\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation count. We affirm the order insofar as\n\n\n       5\n      The plaintiff actually submitted the putative notice to the\ndistrict court, and it is in the record on appeal. We take no view\nof its sufficiency vis-à-vis the statutory requirement.\n\n                                      -29-\n\fit dismisses the Chapter 93A count but direct that the plaintiff be\n\nafforded leave to amend that count.     The portion of the order\n\ndismissing the other seven counts in the complaint has not been\n\ncontested, and, accordingly, we leave that portion of the order\n\nintact.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. Two-thirds costs\n\nshall be taxed in favor of the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

SG Ltd.,</i> 265 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir.2001); <i>LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 142 F.3d 507, 508 (1st Cir. 1998). We ignore, however, \"bald assertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated conclusions, [and] outright vituperation.\" <i>Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez,</i> 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir.1990). Once the scene is set, we recount the travel of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Facts.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1997, plaintiff-appellant Joseph Rodi, a would-be law student who resided in New Jersey, received a recruitment letter from Francis J. Larkin, dean of Southern New England School of Law (SNESL). The letter stated in pertinent part that the accreditation committee of the American Bar Association (ABA) had voted to recommend SNESL for \"provisional accreditation,\" a status that would be granted upon ratification of the recommendation by two other ABA bodies. The letter also stated that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of receiving the needed ratifications and that the future of the school \"has never been brighter.\" Because the plaintiff intended to take the New Jersey bar examination, the prospect of accreditation was critically important to him; New Jersey requires bar applicants to hold law degrees from ABA-accredited institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larkin's letter ended with a pitch for enrollment. The solicitation bore fruit; the plaintiff enrolled at SNESL that month. He received a catalogue from SNESL containing, inter alia, a statement (in the same type size and font as the surrounding text) to the effect that: \"The Law School makes no representation to any applicant or student that it will be approved by the American Bar Association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student.\" The complaint alleges that, despite the cheery optimism of Larkin's letter, the dean knew full well that SNESL had identifiable deficiencies that would almost certainly preclude ABA accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABA denied SNESL's application for accreditation in September of 1997. As a result, the plaintiff considered transferring to an accredited law school for his second year of study. Word of his ambivalence reached the dean's office. David M. Prentiss, who was then the acting dean, wrote to the plaintiff in order to \"make sure\" that he was \"fully informed of the school's current status regarding ABA accreditation.\" That communique stated in substance that the school had improved the four areas found deficient by the ABA and that there should be \"no cause for pessimism\" about the school achieving accreditation before the plaintiff's forecasted graduation date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reliance on these and other representations &#8212; all of which the complaint says were knowingly false &#8212; the plaintiff remained at SNESL. He came to regret the choice: according to the complaint, SNESL knew, but elected not to disclose, that the ABA was highly critical of SNESL; that any faint hope of attaining accreditation depended upon a complete overhaul of the faculty, administration, curriculum, and student body; and that the level of non-compliance made the prospect of SNESL's near-term accreditation remote. To compound this mendacity, the school frustrated students' attempts to learn about the true status of the accreditation pavane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1999 &#8212; during the plaintiff's third year of legal studies &#8212; the ABA denied SNESL's renewed application for accreditation. SNESL failed to appeal to the ABA's House of Delegates as it previously had promised. Instead, the school cashiered half of its full-time faculty, thereby straying even further from ABA-mandated standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff completed his studies in June of 2000. SNESL remained unaccredited. Notwithstanding his diploma, the plaintiff has not been able to sit for the New Jersey bar examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, 2002, the plaintiff sued SNESL, Larkin, and Prentiss in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The district court dismissed that action for want of in personam jurisdiction on April 10, 2003. <i>Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> 255 F.Supp.2d 346, 351 (D.N.J.2003). On June 9, 2003, the plaintiff, acting pro se, sued the same defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Grounding jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), his complaint incorporated copies of the Larkin and Prentiss letters and limned nine statements of claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We confine our discussion to the two claims that the plaintiff presses on appeal: (i) that the defendants' statements constituted actionable fraud or misrepresentation, and (ii) that SNESL's actions violated a consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167;&#167; 1-11. The defendants filed a timely motion to dismiss, positing that the complaint, for a variety of reasons, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. As to the fraudulent misrepresentation count, the defendants asseverated that the \"misrepresentations\" were non-actionable statements of opinion; that the supposed fraud had not been alleged with the requisite particularity; that, in all events, the plaintiff's professed reliance on those statements was unreasonable; and that the statute of limitations had run. With respect to the Chapter 93A count, the defendants averred that the complaint failed to state an actionable claim because the alleged misrepresentations were insufficient to trigger the prophylaxis of the statute, and, moreover, the complaint failed to allege that a demand letter had been sent before suit. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, still acting pro se, filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss in which he made a point-by-point rebuttal of the defendants' asseverations. As part of his opposition, he tendered five affidavits, two additional letters, and an array of other documents. SNESL filed a reply and, not to be outdone, proffered a welter of documents (including copies of its catalogues for the years in question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court abjured oral argument and ruled on the papers. It entered a cryptic order, providing in its entirety that the motion to dismiss should be allowed \"for substantially the reasons outlined in defendants' memorandum of law.\" The plaintiff promptly moved for reconsideration, suggesting, among other things, that if the district court \"found the complaint's allegations too scanty, it could have granted leave to amend.\" The court denied the motion without comment. This counseled appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the issues into several segments. First, we ascertain what materials are properly before us. We then proceed count by count and theory by theory. In so doing, we omit any reference to the seven counts that the plaintiff has elected not to defend on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Configuring the Record.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold issue here involves a determination of what legal standard the district court applied (or should have applied) in examining the pleadings before it. The defendants styled their motion as a motion to dismiss, but the parties then proffered exhibits containing information extraneous to the complaint. That presents a quandary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Civil Rules provide that when \"matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). The district court's order is silent as to whether it elected to convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment. Consequently, we must decide \"whether the court actually took cognizance of [the supplemental material], or invoked Rule 56, in arriving at its decision.\" <i>Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank,</i> 958 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of this record is tenebrous. We do know, however, that the district court embraced the defendants' memorandum of law &#8212; and that memorandum relied upon the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, not the quite different Rule 56 standard. In the same vein, both sides have briefed the case on appeal as if Rule 12(b)(6), rather than Rule 56, controls. Under the unique circumstances of this case, considerations of fundamental fairness counsel in favor of following the parties' and the lower court's lead and testing the arguments on appeal under the jurisprudence of Rule 12(b)(6). We adopt that course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once that decision has been made, the standard of review becomes straightforward. Orders granting motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) engender de novo review. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 40 (1st Cir.1998). In ruling on whether a plaintiff has stated an actionable claim, an inquiring court, be it a trial or appellate court, must consider the complaint, documents annexed to it, and other materials fairly incorporated within it. <i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Cogan v. Phoenix Life Ins. Co.,</i> 310 F.3d 238, 241 n. 4 (1st Cir.2002). This sometimes includes documents referred to in the complaint but not annexed to it. <i>See Coyne v. Cronin,</i> 386 F.3d 280, 285-86 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd.,</i> 840 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir. 1988). Finally, the jurisprudence of Rule 12(b)(6) permits courts to consider matters that are susceptible to judicial notice. <i>Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 15-16; <i>Boateng v. InterAmerican Univ.,</i> 210 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving force to these principles, we may consider on this appeal the facts alleged in the complaint, the Larkin and Prentiss letters (which were annexed to it), and any matters that may be judicially noticed. We also may consider SNESL's 1997-1998 catalogue, alleged by the plaintiff to comprise a part of the contract between the parties, as a document fairly incorporated into the complaint. <i>See Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 17. However, we may not consider at this stage the array of affidavits and miscellaneous documents proffered by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having identified the materials that are properly before us, we briefly address the question of affirmative defenses. On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court's inquiry sometimes may encompass affirmative defenses. Everything depends on the record. As a general rule, a properly raised affirmative defense can be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss so long as (i) the facts establishing the defense are definitively ascertainable from the complaint and the other allowable sources of information, and (ii) those facts suffice to establish the affirmative defense with certitude. <i>Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we examine the bases on which the district court could have predicated its decision. We take each count and each ground in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Fraudulent Misrepresentation Count.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants advance a motley of potential defenses to the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim. We address them sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>In General.</i> We start by testing the vitality of the claim as a whole. We will uphold a dismissal on this ground \"only if the plaintiff's factual averments hold out no hope of recovery on any theory adumbrated in [his] complaint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15 (citing <i>Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.1999)). Our task is not to decide whether the plaintiff ultimately will prevail but, rather, whether he is entitled to undertake discovery in furtherance of the pleaded claim. <i>Scheuer v. Rhodes,</i> 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974). In this process, the fact that the plaintiff filed the complaint pro se militates in favor of a liberal reading. <i>See Boivin v. Black,</i> 225 F.3d 36, 43 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that \"courts hold pro se pleadings to less demanding standards than those drafted by lawyers\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sitting in diversity, we look to the substantive law of the forum state (here, Massachusetts) to guide our analysis. <i>Correia v. Fitzgerald,</i> 354 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.2003). Under Massachusetts law, a claim for misrepresentation entails a false statement of material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act and reasonably relied upon by him to his detriment. <i>Zimmerman v. Kent,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 72, 575 N.E.2d 70, 74 (1991). The plaintiff's claim passes this screen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Larkin, the complaint, read liberally, alleges the following: (i) Larkin knew that the plaintiff was a New Jersey resident who wanted to practice law there; (ii) he also knew that the plaintiff could not sit for the New Jersey bar unless he graduated from an accredited law school; (iii) he sent a letter to the plaintiff in New Jersey stating that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of receiving accreditation, knowing that this statement was materially false because SNESL had substantial deficiencies that would make accreditation difficult if not impossible; and (iv) the plaintiff, relying on Larkin's letter, enrolled at SNESL, paid substantial sums for tuition, and invested three years of his life in mastering its curriculum. We think that these allegations, if proven, would make out a viable claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. <i>See Kerr v. Shurtleff,</i> 218 Mass. 167, 105 N.E. 871, 872 (1914) (holding that college committed fraudulent misrepresentation by falsely telling prospective student that it could \"make [him] a D.M.D.\" when student enrolled and graduated but school lacked the authority to grant the degree).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar analysis applies to the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim against Prentiss. Prentiss's statement that there was \"no cause for pessimism\" about the prospect of near-term accreditation is materially false if there was in fact cause for pessimism due to the extent of the school's known shortcomings. The plaintiff alleges that Prentiss knowingly made this false statement in order to induce him to remain enrolled at SNESL and that he (Rodi) took the bait and relied on it to his detriment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As pleaded, SNESL is vicariously liable for these fraudulent misrepresentations. It is reasonable to infer from the allegations contained in the complaint that Larkin and Prentiss were high-ranking employees of SNESL acting within the scope of their employment. Consequently, their misrepresentations are attributable to SNESL on respondeat superior grounds. <i>See generally Kavanagh v. Trs. of Boston Univ.,</i> 440 Mass. 195, 795 N.E.2d 1170, 1174 (Mass.2003) (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency &#167; 2.04 (Tent. Draft No. 2, 2001)). Accordingly, the complaint, on its face, states a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against all three defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Matters of Opinion.</i> The defendants' effort to short-circuit this claim is multifaceted. Their first counter is that the cited statements were, at most, statements of opinion. That is true, in a sense, but it does not get the defendants very far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statement, though couched in terms of opinion, may constitute a statement of fact if it may reasonably be understood by the reader or listener as implying the existence of facts that justify the statement (or, at least, the non-existence of any facts incompatible with it). <i>See McEneaney v. Chestnut Hill Realty Corp.,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 573, 650 N.E.2d 93, 96 (1995); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 539 (1977) (explaining that \"[a] statement of opinion as to facts not disclosed [may] be interpreted ... as an implied statement that the facts known to the maker are not incompatible with his opinion\"); <i>cf. Levinsky's, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 127 F.3d 122, 127 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"A statement couched as an opinion that presents or implies the existence of facts which are capable of being proven true or false can be actionable.\"). Thus, it is an actionable misrepresentation for a corporation falsely to tell investors that a specific project is \"a great success\" that is \"proceeding smoothly ... and better than expected\" in order to keep them from pulling the plug. <i>Stolzoff v. Waste Sys. Int'l, Inc.,</i> 58 Mass.App.Ct. 747, 792 N.E.2d 1031, 1036-37, 1042 (2003). Similarly, it is an actionable misrepresentation for a car dealer to tell a buyer that he \"believes\" a vehicle is in \"good\" condition when he knows that it has significant mechanical defects. <i>Briggs v. Carol Cars, Inc.,</i> 407 Mass. 391, 553 N.E.2d 930, 933 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Restatement, favorably referenced in the Massachusetts cases, gives a stunningly appropriate example:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hen an auditor who is known to have examined the books of a corporation states that it is in sound financial condition, he may reasonably be understood to say that his examination has been sufficient to permit him to form an honest opinion and that what he has found justifies his conclusion. The opinion thus becomes in effect a short summary of those facts. When he is reasonably understood as conveying such a statement, he is subject to liability if he ... has not found facts that justify the opinion, on the basis of his misrepresentation of the implied facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 539, cmt. b. The parallel is apparent. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the ABA has formulated certain objective criteria that inform its decisions about whether and when to accredit law schools. It also alleges that Larkin, knowing of these criteria, wrote a letter to the plaintiff implying that the school was reasonably capable of satisfying them. If Larkin did know of disqualifying and probably irremediable deficiencies (as the plaintiff has alleged), his statement that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of accreditation was actionably misleading. Prentiss's statement that there was \"no cause for pessimism\" about the fate of the school's renewed accreditation application is subject to much the same analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, knowing falsity is much easier to allege than to prove. Here, however, the district court jettisoned the fraudulent misrepresentation count at the pleading stage. Given the liberal standards of Rule 12(b)(6), that dismissal cannot rest on the \"opinion\" defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Failure to Plead With Particularity.</i> For the most part, a civil complaint need only contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). For that reason, \"[g]reat specificity is ordinarily not required to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\" <i>Garita Hotel,</i> 958 F.2d at 17. That proposition, however, is not universally applicable. \"Cases alleging fraud &#8212; and for this purpose, misrepresentation is considered a species of fraud &#8212; constitute an exception to [it].\" <i>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.2004). That exception, codified in Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), requires that fraud be alleged with particularity. <i>Id.</i> This heightened pleading standard is satisfied by an averment \"of the who, what, where, and when of the allegedly false or fraudulent representation.\" <i>Id.; accord Powers v. Boston Cooper Corp.,</i> 926 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir.1991); <i>McGinty v. Beranger Volkswagen, Inc.,</i> 633 F.2d 226, 228-29 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the defendants assert that the district court was warranted in dismissing the fraudulent misrepresentation claim for failure to abide by these strictures. In addressing that assertion, we note that the specificity requirement extends only to the particulars of the allegedly misleading statement itself. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v. Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 367 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir.2004). The other elements of fraud, such as intent and knowledge, may be averred in general terms. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful perscrutation, we deem this line of defense unavailing. The Larkin and Prentiss letters are unarguably specific as to speaker, content, context, and time. These statements are sufficient to shield the fraudulent misrepresentation count from dismissal at the pleading stage. <i>See, e.g., Powers,</i> 926 F.2d at 111; <i>see also Philippe v. Shape, Inc.,</i> 688 F.Supp. 783, 786-87 (D.Me.1988) (holding that documents affixed to complaint that contained alleged misrepresentations satisfied Rule 9(b)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, however, that the complaint attributes a gallimaufry of other substantially similar statements to the defendants. We count no fewer than four such allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations: (i) that a SNESL employee had reported that the 1997 application for accreditation came \"within an inch of ABA approval\"; (ii) that an admissions officer proclaimed that SNESL \"will be accredited\"; (iii) that SNESL claimed it had received a special time waiver from the ABA because its \"case [for accreditation] was so strong\"; and (iv) that if accreditation were again denied, SNESL would appeal directly to the ABA's governing body. None of these four statements is pleaded with the particularity required under Rule 9(b). Insofar as we can tell from the complaint, each such statement was made by an unidentified person at an unnamed place and at an unspecified time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Such gossamer allegations are patently inadequate under Rule 9(b). <i>See Alternative Sys. Concepts,</i> 374 F.3d at 30; <i>Ahmed v. Rosenblatt,</i> 118 F.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a claim sounding in fraud contains a hybrid of allegations, some of which satisfy the strictures of Rule 9(b) and some of which do not, an inquiring court may sustain the claim on the basis of those specific allegations that are properly pleaded. <i>See Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA,</i> 317 F.3d 1097, 1105 (9th Cir.2003); <i>Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc.,</i> 24 F.3d 357, 366 (1st Cir.1994). So it is here. For that reason, we take no view either as to whether the plaintiff, on remand, should be permitted to amend his complaint to add particulars anent the other four statements or as to whether, absent an amendment, evidence of those statements may be introduced at trial in support of the allegation that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the Larkin and Prentiss letters. In the first instance, such matters, should they arise, are for the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Reasonable Reliance.</i> Reasonable reliance is, of course, an element of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim under Massachusetts law. <i>Zimmerman,</i> 575 N.E.2d at 76. The defendants strive to persuade us that the disclaimer placed in the school's catalogue &#8212; disclaiming any \"representation to any applicant or student that [SNESL] will be approved by the American Bar Association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student\" &#8212; renders any reliance by the plaintiff on Larkin's and Prentiss's epistles unreasonable <i>as a matter of law.</i> We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, the reasonableness of a party's reliance ordinarily constitutes a question of fact for the jury. <i>Mass. Laborers' Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d 236, 242 (D.Mass.1999); <i>Cataldo Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. City of Chelsea,</i> 426 Mass. 383, 688 N.E.2d 959, 962 (Mass. 1998). When, however, the facts alleged in the complaint preclude a finding of reasonable reliance, a court may enter an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>See, e.g., Mass. Laborers' Health &amp; Welfare Fund,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 242; <i>Saxon Theatre Corp. v. Sage,</i> 347 Mass. 662, 200 N.E.2d 241, 244 (1964). The defendants argue that the disclaimer, incorporated by reference in the plaintiff's complaint, makes this such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mounting this argument, the defendants distort the fraudulent misrepresentation. They insist that the plaintiff's asserted injury flows from a broken promise of accreditation (i.e., that he was promised accreditation that did not occur). Since the disclaimer flatly contradicts any such representation, the defendants say, reliance on that promise was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument erects, and then attacks, a straw man. As said, the plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants falsely implied that SNESL had the capacity to achieve near-term accreditation. This is a meaningful distinction. It is one thing for an actor to demur when asked to guarantee a third party's actions. It is quite another for an actor to mislead a person into believing that the actor itself possesses means and abilities fully within its control. Given this distinction, the defendants' reliance on the disclaimer is misplaced: inasmuch as the disclaimer does not cover the alleged misrepresentations, it cannot defeat them. <i>See Hitachi Credit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank,</i> 166 F.3d 614, 630-631 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that a contracting party may recover for fraud notwithstanding \"specific disclaimers that do not cover the allegedly fraudulent contract-inducing representations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, arguable that the proof at summary judgment or at trial may show that the disclaimer does cover whatever misrepresentations (if any) were actually made. But even if the defendants' characterization of the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim was on the mark, we could not affirm the order of dismissal on this ground. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, \"a party may not contract out of fraud.\" <i>Turner v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,</i> 809 F.2d 90, 95 (1st Cir.1986). With this in mind, Massachusetts courts consistently have held that disclaimers do not automatically defeat fraudulent misrepresentation claims. <i>See, e.g., Bates v. Southgate,</i> 308 Mass. 170, 31 N.E.2d 551, 558 (1941); <i>Sound Techniques, Inc. v. Hoffman,</i> 50 Mass.App.Ct. 425, 737 N.E.2d 920, 924 (2000); <i>see also VMark Software, Inc. v. EMC Corp.,</i> 37 Mass.App.Ct. 610, 642 N.E.2d 587, 594 n. 11 (1994) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the motion to dismiss stage, information such as the conspicuousness of the disclaimer and the parties' discussions concerning it is largely undeveloped. These details are relevant, as the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract will shed light upon the disclaimer's meaning and effect. <i>See Turner,</i> 809 F.2d at 96 (stating that when dealing with an ambiguous disclaimer, \"the agreement is to some extent left undefined, and the plaintiff's understanding of the agreement logically may be colored by the defendant's prior statements, fraudulent or otherwise\"). On an empty record, we would have no principled choice but to decline the defendants' invitation to hold, as a matter of law, that there is no possible set of circumstances under which the disclaimer might prove ineffective. <i>See V.S.H. Realty, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc.,</i> 757 F.2d 411, 418 (1st Cir.1985) (cautioning against deciding whether an exculpatory clause precludes a misrepresentation claim \"without development of a factual record\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>Statute of Limitations.</i> The defendants have a final fallback position. They assert that, even if the fraudulent misrepresentation claim is actionable, it is time-barred. We explore this possibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To a limited extent, a statute of limitations defense can be considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <i>See, e.g., LaChapelle,</i> 142 F.3d at 509. The key is whether the complaint and any documents that properly may be read in conjunction with it show beyond doubt that the claim asserted is out of time. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law provides that an action in tort &#8212; of which fraudulent misrepresentation is a species &#8212; \"shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 2A. A claim for fraudulent misrepresentation does not begin to accrue until \"a plaintiff learns or reasonably should have learned of the misrepresentation.\" <i>Kent v. Dupree,</i> 13 Mass.App.Ct. 44, 429 N.E.2d 1041, 1043 (1982); <i>accord Patsos v. First Albany Corp.,</i> 433 Mass. 323, 741 N.E.2d 841, 846 (2001); <i>McEneaney,</i> 650 N.E.2d at 97. In this context, courts sometimes ask when sufficient indicia of trouble &#8212; storm warnings, so to speak &#8212; should have been apparent to a reasonably prudent person. <i>See, e.g., Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 361 F.3d 44, 47-48 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Young v. Lepone,</i> 305 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the plaintiff's complaint alleges that he learned of persistent deficiencies precluding ABA accreditation at an unspecified date in November of 1999. There are no facts alleged in the complaint that require an inference of an earlier accrual date. As of that time, then, the plaintiff should have figured out that the defendants' rodomontade about the school's capabilities and the imminence of accreditation was quite likely pie in the sky. On that basis, the plaintiff should have commenced his action no later than November of 2002 (the precise date is inconsequential, for reasons that shortly will become apparent). Because this action was not docketed until June 9, 2003, a cursory glance would appear to validate the defendants' assertion that the statute of limitations had run. <i>See, e.g., Jolicoeur v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> 104 Fed. Appx. 745, 746-47 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam) (holding a similar action, filed by one of the plaintiff's classmates on June 18, 2003, to be time-barred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appearances sometimes are deceiving &#8212; and this is such an instance. Here, unlike in <i>Jolicoeur,</i> the plaintiff filed an antecedent suit in the District of New Jersey on July 18, 2002 &#8212; well within the putative limitations period. Although that case was dismissed on April 10, 2003, the dismissal was not on the merits, but, rather, for want of personal jurisdiction over the named defendants (SNESL, Larkin, and Prentiss). <i>Rodi,</i> 255 F.Supp.2d at 351.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This history is significant because, under Massachusetts law, if an action is duly commenced within the limitations period and then dismissed for \"any matter of form,\" the plaintiff is entitled to \"commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 32. The savings statute applies, inter alia, to an action originally filed and dismissed in a court of another state or in a federal district court. <i>See Boutiette v. Dickinson,</i> 54 Mass.App.Ct. 817, 768 N.E.2d 562, 563-64 (2002); <i>Liberace v. Conway,</i> 31 Mass.App.Ct. 40, 574 N.E.2d 1010, 1012 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no doubt that, for purposes of this savings statute, dismissals for want of personal jurisdiction are appropriately classified as dismissals arising out of matters of form. <i>Cf. Ciampa v. Beverly Airport Comm'n,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 974, 650 N.E.2d 816, 817 (1995) (holding that \"dismissal for bringing an action in the wrong court is `a matter of form' within the meaning of &#167; 32\"). After all, as the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts wrote almost two centuries ago in describing an earlier version of the law, the legislature enacted the savings statute to ensure that \"where [a] plaintiff has been defeated by some matter <i>not affecting the merits,</i> some defect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new process,\" the statute of limitations \"shall not prevent him from doing so.\" <i>Coffin v. Cottle,</i> 33 Mass. (16 Pick.) 383, 386 (1835) (emphasis supplied). A dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is the paradigmatic example of a decision not on the merits that can be cured by new process in a different court. <i>See Teva Pharm., USA, Inc. v. FDA,</i> 182 F.3d 1003, 1008 (D.C.Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. This action and the earlier New Jersey action are sisters under the skin; they involve the same parties, the same events, the same nucleus of operative facts, and the same causes of action. By means of the savings statute, the plaintiff had one year from the dismissal of his timely New Jersey action &#8212; until April 10, 2004 &#8212; to file anew. He instituted the action sub judice on June 9, 2003. His fraudulent misrepresentation claim is therefore timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of the savings statute, SNESL raises the red flag of waiver. It asserts that because the plaintiff first set forth the savings statute argument in his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, he is not entitled to benefit from it. SNESL's flag-waving overlooks, however, that a court asked to dismiss a complaint on statute of limitations grounds may examine not only the complaint but also such other documents as may appropriately be considered under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,</i> 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the facts that the plaintiff relies on to show the applicability of the savings statute (e.g., the date that he filed the original action, the nature of that action, the date it was dismissed, and the basis for the dismissal) are all susceptible to judicial notice. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201. Those facts may, therefore, be considered in assessing the force of the limitations defense. <i>See Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 15-16; <i>see also Kowalski v. Gagne,</i> 914 F.2d 299, 305 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is well-accepted that federal courts may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts if those proceedings have relevance to the matters at hand.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SNESL's citation to <i>Granahan v. Commonwealth,</i> 19 Mass.App.Ct. 617, 476 N.E.2d 266 (1985), does not alter this conclusion. In a diversity case, procedure, unlike substance, is governed by federal law. <i>See Correia,</i> 354 F.3d at 53 (\"Federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural rules.\"). Under federal procedural precedents, there has been no waiver: the plaintiff presented developed argumentation on the savings statute to the lower court, and thus preserved that issue for appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>B &amp; T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mut. Ins.

At this stage of the game, the statute of limitations affords no basis for dismissal of the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Chapter 93A Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation concerning the plaintiff's claim under the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act is less clear-cut. Before bringing suit under that statute, a plaintiff must mail to the defendant a \"written demand for relief, identifying the claimant and reasonably describing the unfair or deceptive act or practice relied upon.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(3). This notification must be furnished no fewer than thirty days prior to the filing of suit. <i>Id.</i> The statutory notice requirement is not merely a procedural nicety, but, rather, \"a prerequisite to suit.\" <i>Entrialgo v. Twin City Dodge, Inc.,</i> 368 Mass. 812, 333 N.E.2d 202, 204 (1975). Furthermore, \"as a special element\" of the cause of action, it must be alleged in the plaintiff's complaint. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, neither the plaintiff's complaint nor the documents attached thereto mention any such notification. That is sufficient ground to justify dismissal of the Chapter 93A claim. <i>See, e.g., City of Boston v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.,</i> 399 Mass. 569, 506 N.E.2d 106, 109 (Mass. 1987); <i>Spilios v. Cohen,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 338, 647 N.E.2d 1218, 1220-21 (1995); <i>see also Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that, in order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must \"set forth factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ruling has no effect on the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim. <i>See York v. Sullivan,</i> 369 Mass. 157, 338 N.E.2d 341, 346 (1975) (explaining that \"the [notice] requirement is a prerequisite to an action under [Chapter 93A, &#167; 9], but nothing in the statute makes it a prerequisite to any other remedy available to aggrieved consumers\"). Moreover, it may represent no more than a temporary victory for the defendants. A failure to allege compliance with the statutory notice requirement is not necessarily a death knell for a Chapter 93A claim. Massachusetts courts typically have allowed plaintiffs to amend in order to cure this kind of modest pleading defect. <i>See, e.g., Jacobs v. Yamaha Motor Corp.,</i> 420 Mass. 323, 649 N.E.2d 758, 761 (1995); <i>Parker v. D'Avolio,</i> 40 Mass.App.Ct. 394, 664 N.E.2d 858, 861 n. 4 (1996). Federal practice is no less permissive. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (stating that leave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allowing an opportunity to amend is especially fitting here. Our reasons are fivefold. First, the plaintiff filed the complaint pro se, and \"courts [should] endeavor, within reasonable limits, to guard against the loss of pro se claims due to technical defects.\" <i>Boivin,</i> 225 F.3d at 43. Second, a fraudulent misrepresentation, actionable at common law, often can form the basis for a Chapter 93A claim. <i>See, e.g., Adams v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 60 Mass.App.Ct. 55, 799 N.E.2d 130, 140 n. 19 (2003); <i>Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc.,</i> 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, 396 N.E.2d 149, 154 (1979); <i>see also VMark Software,</i> 642 N.E.2d at 595 (collecting cases). So here: apart from the question of notice, the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation state a colorable claim for relief under Chapter 93A. Third, the plaintiff vouchsafed in his opposition to the motion to dismiss, and now reaffirms, that he did in fact furnish the statutorily required notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Fourth, we do not know whether the district court even focused on this defect (as we have said, the district court did not state a particularized ground for dismissing this claim). Finally, the plaintiff, even without knowing the precise basis for the district court's order of dismissal, did seek leave to amend as part of his reconsideration request (an overture that the district court denied without any explanation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court declared long ago that \"the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 48, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). The view that the pleading of cases is a game in which every miscue should be fatal is antithetic to the spirit of the federal rules. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 (explaining that the federal rules designed to achieve, inter alia, the \"just\" resolution of disputes). Each case is sui generis. Here, however, the circumstances cry out for affording the plaintiff a fair opportunity to replead his Chapter 93A claim. Accordingly, we direct the district court, on remand, to grant the plaintiff that opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elaborated above, we reverse the district court's order insofar as it dismisses the fraudulent misrepresentation count. We affirm the order insofar as it dismisses the Chapter 93A count but direct that the plaintiff be afforded leave to amend that count. The portion of the order dismissing the other seven counts in the complaint has not been contested, and, accordingly, we leave that portion of the order intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In launching that effort, Granahan relied solely on appellate argumentation, not \"pleadings, affidavits, or other documents presented to the motion judge.\" 476 N.E.2d at 268 n. 5. The Appeals Court refused to entertain the argument. <i>Id.</i> at 268. So understood, <i>Granahan</i> represents nothing more than the Massachusetts equivalent of the federal courts' familiar raise-or-waive rule. <i>See, e.g., Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v.

Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (warning that \"legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This holding depends, of course, on the plaintiff's allegation as to when he first learned of the persistent (and likely insuperable) deficiencies that precluded ABA accreditation.

Once the scene is set, we recount the travel of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Facts.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July of 1997, plaintiff-appellant Joseph Rodi, a would-be law student who resided in New Jersey, received a recruitment letter from Francis J. Larkin, dean of Southern New England School of Law (SNESL). The letter stated in pertinent part that the accreditation committee of the American Bar Association (ABA) had voted to recommend SNESL for \"provisional accreditation,\" a status that would be granted upon ratification of the recommendation by two other ABA bodies. The letter also stated that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of receiving the needed ratifications and that the future of the school \"has never been brighter.\" Because the plaintiff intended to take the New Jersey bar examination, the prospect of accreditation was critically important to him; New Jersey requires bar applicants to hold law degrees from ABA-accredited institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larkin's letter ended with a pitch for enrollment. The solicitation bore fruit; the plaintiff enrolled at SNESL that month. He received a catalogue from SNESL containing, inter alia, a statement (in the same type size and font as the surrounding text) to the effect that: \"The Law School makes no representation to any applicant or student that it will be approved by the American Bar Association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student.\" The complaint alleges that, despite the cheery optimism of Larkin's letter, the dean knew full well that SNESL had identifiable deficiencies that would almost certainly preclude ABA accreditation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABA denied SNESL's application for accreditation in September of 1997. As a result, the plaintiff considered transferring to an accredited law school for his second year of study. Word of his ambivalence reached the dean's office. David M. Prentiss, who was then the acting dean, wrote to the plaintiff in order to \"make sure\" that he was \"fully informed of the school's current status regarding ABA accreditation.\" That communique stated in substance that the school had improved the four areas found deficient by the ABA and that there should be \"no cause for pessimism\" about the school achieving accreditation before the plaintiff's forecasted graduation date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reliance on these and other representations &#8212; all of which the complaint says were knowingly false &#8212; the plaintiff remained at SNESL. He came to regret the choice: according to the complaint, SNESL knew, but elected not to disclose, that the ABA was highly critical of SNESL; that any faint hope of attaining accreditation depended upon a complete overhaul of the faculty, administration, curriculum, and student body; and that the level of non-compliance made the prospect of SNESL's near-term accreditation remote. To compound this mendacity, the school frustrated students' attempts to learn about the true status of the accreditation pavane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1999 &#8212; during the plaintiff's third year of legal studies &#8212; the ABA denied SNESL's renewed application for accreditation. SNESL failed to appeal to the ABA's House of Delegates as it previously had promised. Instead, the school cashiered half of its full-time faculty, thereby straying even further from ABA-mandated standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff completed his studies in June of 2000. SNESL remained unaccredited. Notwithstanding his diploma, the plaintiff has not been able to sit for the New Jersey bar examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 18, 2002, the plaintiff sued SNESL, Larkin, and Prentiss in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The district court dismissed that action for want of in personam jurisdiction on April 10, 2003. <i>Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562484\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562484/rodi-v-southern-new-england-school-of-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 351 (D.N.J.2003). On June 9, 2003, the plaintiff, acting pro se, sued the same defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Grounding jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), his complaint incorporated copies of the Larkin and Prentiss letters and limned nine statements of claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We confine our discussion to the two claims that the plaintiff presses on appeal: (i) that the defendants' statements constituted actionable fraud or misrepresentation, and (ii) that SNESL's actions violated a consumer protection statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167;&#167; 1-11. The defendants filed a timely motion to dismiss, positing that the complaint, for a variety of reasons, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. As to the fraudulent misrepresentation count, the defendants asseverated that the \"misrepresentations\" were non-actionable statements of opinion; that the supposed fraud had not been alleged with the requisite particularity; that, in all events, the plaintiff's professed reliance on those statements was unreasonable; and that the statute of limitations had run. With respect to the Chapter 93A count, the defendants averred that the complaint failed to state an actionable claim because the alleged misrepresentations were insufficient to trigger the prophylaxis of the statute, and, moreover, the complaint failed to allege that a demand letter had been sent before suit. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff, still acting pro se, filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss in which he made a point-by-point rebuttal of the defendants' asseverations. As part of his opposition, he tendered five affidavits, two additional letters, and an array of other documents. SNESL filed a reply and, not to be outdone, proffered a welter of documents (including copies of its catalogues for the years in question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court abjured oral argument and ruled on the papers. It entered a cryptic order, providing in its entirety that the motion to dismiss should be allowed \"for substantially the reasons outlined in defendants' memorandum of law.\" The plaintiff promptly moved for reconsideration, suggesting, among other things, that if the district court \"found the complaint's allegations too scanty, it could have granted leave to amend.\" The court denied the motion without comment. This counseled appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our discussion of the issues into several segments. First, we ascertain what materials are properly before us. We then proceed count by count and theory by theory. In so doing, we omit any reference to the seven counts that the plaintiff has elected not to defend on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Configuring the Record.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold issue here involves a determination of what legal standard the district court applied (or should have applied) in examining the pleadings before it. The defendants styled their motion as a motion to dismiss, but the parties then proffered exhibits containing information extraneous to the complaint. That presents a quandary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Civil Rules provide that when \"matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). The district court's order is silent as to whether it elected to convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment. Consequently, we must decide \"whether the court actually took cognizance of [the supplemental material], or invoked Rule 56, in arriving at its decision.\" <i>Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of this record is tenebrous. We do know, however, that the district court embraced the defendants' memorandum of law &#8212; and that memorandum relied upon the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, not the quite different Rule 56 standard. In the same vein, both sides have briefed the case on appeal as if Rule 12(b)(6), rather than Rule 56, controls. Under the unique circumstances of this case, considerations of fundamental fairness counsel in favor of following the parties' and the lower court's lead and testing the arguments on appeal under the jurisprudence of Rule 12(b)(6). We adopt that course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once that decision has been made, the standard of review becomes straightforward. Orders granting motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) engender de novo review. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am.

In ruling on whether a plaintiff has stated an actionable claim, an inquiring court, be it a trial or appellate court, must consider the complaint, documents annexed to it, and other materials fairly incorporated within it. <i>In re Colonial Mortg.

Finally, the jurisprudence of Rule 12(b)(6) permits courts to consider matters that are susceptible to judicial notice. <i>Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 15-16; <i>Boateng v.

We also may consider SNESL's 1997-1998 catalogue, alleged by the plaintiff to comprise a part of the contract between the parties, as a document fairly incorporated into the complaint. <i>See Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 17.

The plaintiff's claim passes this screen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Larkin, the complaint, read liberally, alleges the following: (i) Larkin knew that the plaintiff was a New Jersey resident who wanted to practice law there; (ii) he also knew that the plaintiff could not sit for the New Jersey bar unless he graduated from an accredited law school; (iii) he sent a letter to the plaintiff in New Jersey stating that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of receiving accreditation, knowing that this statement was materially false because SNESL had substantial deficiencies that would make accreditation difficult if not impossible; and (iv) the plaintiff, relying on Larkin's letter, enrolled at SNESL, paid substantial sums for tuition, and invested three years of his life in mastering its curriculum. We think that these allegations, if proven, would make out a viable claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. <i>See Kerr v. Shurtleff,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></span>, 872 (1914) (holding that college committed fraudulent misrepresentation by falsely telling prospective student that it could \"make [him] a D.M.D.\" when student enrolled and graduated but school lacked the authority to grant the degree).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar analysis applies to the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim against Prentiss. Prentiss's statement that there was \"no cause for pessimism\" about the prospect of near-term accreditation is materially false if there was in fact cause for pessimism due to the extent of the school's known shortcomings. The plaintiff alleges that Prentiss knowingly made this false statement in order to induce him to remain enrolled at SNESL and that he (Rodi) took the bait and relied on it to his detriment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As pleaded, SNESL is vicariously liable for these fraudulent misrepresentations. It is reasonable to infer from the allegations contained in the complaint that Larkin and Prentiss were high-ranking employees of SNESL acting within the scope of their employment. Consequently, their misrepresentations are attributable to SNESL on respondeat superior grounds. <i>See generally Kavanagh v.

Chestnut Hill Realty Corp.,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 573, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span>, 96 (1995); <i>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts</i> &#167; 539 (1977) (explaining that \"[a] statement of opinion as to facts not disclosed [may] be interpreted ... as an implied statement that the facts known to the maker are not incompatible with his opinion\"); <i>cf.

Thus, it is an actionable misrepresentation for a corporation falsely to tell investors that a specific project is \"a great success\" that is \"proceeding smoothly ... and better than expected\" in order to keep them from pulling the plug. <i>Stolzoff v.

The parallel is apparent. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the ABA has formulated certain objective criteria that inform its decisions about whether and when to accredit law schools. It also alleges that Larkin, knowing of these criteria, wrote a letter to the plaintiff implying that the school was reasonably capable of satisfying them. If Larkin did know of disqualifying and probably irremediable deficiencies (as the plaintiff has alleged), his statement that SNESL was \"highly confident\" of accreditation was actionably misleading. Prentiss's statement that there was \"no cause for pessimism\" about the fate of the school's renewed accreditation application is subject to much the same analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, knowing falsity is much easier to allege than to prove. Here, however, the district court jettisoned the fraudulent misrepresentation count at the pleading stage. Given the liberal standards of Rule 12(b)(6), that dismissal cannot rest on the \"opinion\" defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Failure to Plead With Particularity.</i> For the most part, a civil complaint need only contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). For that reason, \"[g]reat specificity is ordinarily not required to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\" <i>Garita Hotel,</i> 958 F.2d at 17.

In addressing that assertion, we note that the specificity requirement extends only to the particulars of the allegedly misleading statement itself. <i>See Educadores Puertorrique&#241;os en Acci&#243;n v.

The Larkin and Prentiss letters are unarguably specific as to speaker, content, context, and time. These statements are sufficient to shield the fraudulent misrepresentation count from dismissal at the pleading stage. <i>See, e.g., Powers,</i> 926 F.2d at 111; <i>see also Philippe v.

We count no fewer than four such allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations: (i) that a SNESL employee had reported that the 1997 application for accreditation came \"within an inch of ABA approval\"; (ii) that an admissions officer proclaimed that SNESL \"will be accredited\"; (iii) that SNESL claimed it had received a special time waiver from the ABA because its \"case [for accreditation] was so strong\"; and (iv) that if accreditation were again denied, SNESL would appeal directly to the ABA's governing body. None of these four statements is pleaded with the particularity required under Rule 9(b). Insofar as we can tell from the complaint, each such statement was made by an unidentified person at an unnamed place and at an unspecified time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Such gossamer allegations are patently inadequate under Rule 9(b). <i>See Alternative Sys.

USA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780678\"><a href=\"/opinion/780678/todd-d-vess-a-minor-deborah-vess-his-guardian-ad-litem-individually-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span>, 1105 (9th Cir.2003); <i>Serabian v.

So it is here. For that reason, we take no view either as to whether the plaintiff, on remand, should be permitted to amend his complaint to add particulars anent the other four statements or as to whether, absent an amendment, evidence of those statements may be introduced at trial in support of the allegation that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the Larkin and Prentiss letters.

The defendants strive to persuade us that the disclaimer placed in the school's catalogue &#8212; disclaiming any \"representation to any applicant or student that [SNESL] will be approved by the American Bar Association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student\" &#8212; renders any reliance by the plaintiff on Larkin's and Prentiss's epistles unreasonable <i>as a matter of law.</i> We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, the reasonableness of a party's reliance ordinarily constitutes a question of fact for the jury. <i>Mass.

When, however, the facts alleged in the complaint preclude a finding of reasonable reliance, a court may enter an order of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>See, e.g., Mass. Laborers' Health &amp; Welfare Fund,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 242; <i>Saxon Theatre Corp. v.

The defendants argue that the disclaimer, incorporated by reference in the plaintiff's complaint, makes this such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mounting this argument, the defendants distort the fraudulent misrepresentation. They insist that the plaintiff's asserted injury flows from a broken promise of accreditation (i.e., that he was promised accreditation that did not occur). Since the disclaimer flatly contradicts any such representation, the defendants say, reliance on that promise was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument erects, and then attacks, a straw man. As said, the plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants falsely implied that SNESL had the capacity to achieve near-term accreditation. This is a meaningful distinction. It is one thing for an actor to demur when asked to guarantee a third party's actions. It is quite another for an actor to mislead a person into believing that the actor itself possesses means and abilities fully within its control. Given this distinction, the defendants' reliance on the disclaimer is misplaced: inasmuch as the disclaimer does not cover the alleged misrepresentations, it cannot defeat them. <i>See Hitachi Credit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761252\"><a href=\"/opinion/761252/hitachi-credit-america-corporation-v-signet-bank-formerly-known-as-signet/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 630-631 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that a contracting party may recover for fraud notwithstanding \"specific disclaimers that do not cover the allegedly fraudulent contract-inducing representations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, of course, arguable that the proof at summary judgment or at trial may show that the disclaimer does cover whatever misrepresentations (if any) were actually made. But even if the defendants' characterization of the plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim was on the mark, we could not affirm the order of dismissal on this ground. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, \"a party may not contract out of fraud.\" <i>Turner v.

In this context, courts sometimes ask when sufficient indicia of trouble &#8212; storm warnings, so to speak &#8212; should have been apparent to a reasonably prudent person. <i>See, e.g., Wolinetz v.

There are no facts alleged in the complaint that require an inference of an earlier accrual date. As of that time, then, the plaintiff should have figured out that the defendants' rodomontade about the school's capabilities and the imminence of accreditation was quite likely pie in the sky. On that basis, the plaintiff should have commenced his action no later than November of 2002 (the precise date is inconsequential, for reasons that shortly will become apparent). Because this action was not docketed until June 9, 2003, a cursory glance would appear to validate the defendants' assertion that the statute of limitations had run. <i>See, e.g., Jolicoeur v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> 104 Fed. Appx. 745, 746-47 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam) (holding a similar action, filed by one of the plaintiff's classmates on June 18, 2003, to be time-barred).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appearances sometimes are deceiving &#8212; and this is such an instance. Here, unlike in <i>Jolicoeur,</i> the plaintiff filed an antecedent suit in the District of New Jersey on July 18, 2002 &#8212; well within the putative limitations period. Although that case was dismissed on April 10, 2003, the dismissal was not on the merits, but, rather, for want of personal jurisdiction over the named defendants (SNESL, Larkin, and Prentiss). <i>Rodi,</i> 255 F.Supp.2d at 351.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This history is significant because, under Massachusetts law, if an action is duly commenced within the limitations period and then dismissed for \"any matter of form,\" the plaintiff is entitled to \"commence a new action for the same cause within one year after the dismissal.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 32. The savings statute applies, inter alia, to an action originally filed and dismissed in a court of another state or in a federal district court. <i>See Boutiette v. Dickinson,</i> 54 Mass.App.Ct. 817, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></span>, 563-64 (2002); <i>Liberace v.

Ciampa v. Beverly Airport Comm'n,</i> 38 Mass.App.Ct. 974, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></span>, 817 (1995) (holding that \"dismissal for bringing an action in the wrong court is `a matter of form' within the meaning of &#167; 32\"). After all, as the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts wrote almost two centuries ago in describing an earlier version of the law, the legislature enacted the savings statute to ensure that \"where [a] plaintiff has been defeated by some matter <i>not affecting the merits,</i> some defect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new process,\" the statute of limitations \"shall not prevent him from doing so.\" <i>Coffin v. Cottle,</i> 33 Mass. (16 Pick.) 383, 386 (1835) (emphasis supplied). A dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is the paradigmatic example of a decision not on the merits that can be cured by new process in a different court. <i>See Teva Pharm., USA, Inc. v. FDA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184916\"><a href=\"/opinion/184916/teva-pharmaceuticals-v-fda/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1008 (D.C.Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. This action and the earlier New Jersey action are sisters under the skin; they involve the same parties, the same events, the same nucleus of operative facts, and the same causes of action. By means of the savings statute, the plaintiff had one year from the dismissal of his timely New Jersey action &#8212; until April 10, 2004 &#8212; to file anew. He instituted the action sub judice on June 9, 2003. His fraudulent misrepresentation claim is therefore timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of the savings statute, SNESL raises the red flag of waiver. It asserts that because the plaintiff first set forth the savings statute argument in his opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, he is not entitled to benefit from it. SNESL's flag-waving overlooks, however, that a court asked to dismiss a complaint on statute of limitations grounds may examine not only the complaint but also such other documents as may appropriately be considered under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199346\"><a href=\"/opinion/199346/blackstone-realty-v-federal-deposit/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 197 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the facts that the plaintiff relies on to show the applicability of the savings statute (e.g., the date that he filed the original action, the nature of that action, the date it was dismissed, and the basis for the dismissal) are all susceptible to judicial notice. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201. Those facts may, therefore, be considered in assessing the force of the limitations defense. <i>See Colonial Mortg. Bankers,</i> 324 F.3d at 15-16; <i>see also Kowalski v.

In a diversity case, procedure, unlike substance, is governed by federal law. <i>See Correia,</i> 354 F.3d at 53 (\"Federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural rules.\"). Under federal procedural precedents, there has been no waiver: the plaintiff presented developed argumentation on the savings statute to the lower court, and thus preserved that issue for appellate review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>B &amp; T Masonry Constr.

Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(3). This notification must be furnished no fewer than thirty days prior to the filing of suit. <i>Id.</i> The statutory notice requirement is not merely a procedural nicety, but, rather, \"a prerequisite to suit.\" <i>Entrialgo v.

Moreover, it may represent no more than a temporary victory for the defendants. A failure to allege compliance with the statutory notice requirement is not necessarily a death knell for a Chapter 93A claim. Massachusetts courts typically have allowed plaintiffs to amend in order to cure this kind of modest pleading defect. <i>See, e.g., Jacobs v. Yamaha Motor Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">649</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></span>, 761 (1995); <i>Parker v.

Federal practice is no less permissive. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (stating that leave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allowing an opportunity to amend is especially fitting here. Our reasons are fivefold. First, the plaintiff filed the complaint pro se, and \"courts [should] endeavor, within reasonable limits, to guard against the loss of pro se claims due to technical defects.\" <i>Boivin,</i> 225 F.3d at 43. Second, a fraudulent misrepresentation, actionable at common law, often can form the basis for a Chapter 93A claim. <i>See, e.g., Adams v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 60 Mass.App.Ct. 55, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></span>, 140 n. 19 (2003); <i>Levings v.

So here: apart from the question of notice, the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation state a colorable claim for relief under Chapter 93A. Third, the plaintiff vouchsafed in his opposition to the motion to dismiss, and now reaffirms, that he did in fact furnish the statutorily required notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Fourth, we do not know whether the district court even focused on this defect (as we have said, the district court did not state a particularized ground for dismissing this claim). Finally, the plaintiff, even without knowing the precise basis for the district court's order of dismissal, did seek leave to amend as part of his reconsideration request (an overture that the district court denied without any explanation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court declared long ago that \"the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" <i>Conley v.

The view that the pleading of cases is a game in which every miscue should be fatal is antithetic to the spirit of the federal rules. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 (explaining that the federal rules designed to achieve, inter alia, the \"just\" resolution of disputes). Each case is sui generis. Here, however, the circumstances cry out for affording the plaintiff a fair opportunity to replead his Chapter 93A claim. Accordingly, we direct the district court, on remand, to grant the plaintiff that opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

The Appeals Court refused to entertain the argument. <i>Id.</i> at 268. So understood, <i>Granahan</i> represents nothing more than the Massachusetts equivalent of the federal courts' familiar raise-or-waive rule. <i>See, e.g., Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v.
