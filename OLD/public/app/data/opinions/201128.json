Van Dyke, by appointment of the court, with whom\nBerman & Simmons, P.A. was on brief for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            July 14, 2004\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     By a superceding indictment, a\n\nfederal grand jury charged Delon J. Adams with three crimes: one\n\ncount charged that as a felon he had unlawfully possessed a firearm\n\non March 18, 2002, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2000)\n\n(count I); the other two counts charged him with using and carrying\n\na firearm in relation to drug trafficking crimes committed on two\n\ndifferent dates, February 6 and 12, 2002, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (2000) (counts II and III).   Several motions to\n\nsuppress evidence were denied and a jury trial began on December 4,\n\n2002.\n\n          The parties stipulated to Adams’ prior felony conviction.\n\nAt trial, the government presented evidence that Adams had moved to\n\nMaine and in June 2001 married a woman named Laurie; and that in\n\nJune 2001 she had purchased a handgun (a Sturm Ruger pistol) and in\n\nOctober 2001 another (a Kel Tec).      Her attempted purchase of a\n\nthird gun, two days after the second, alerted the police who\n\nstopped Adams driving away with Laurie and who, under his seat,\n\nfound both previously purchased guns.\n\n          After this incident, Adams and Laurie separated and in\n\nFebruary 2002 Adams began to stay at least intermittently with a\n\nwoman named Amanda Whitmore and her boyfriend Christopher Wright at\n\ntheir apartment in Biddeford, Maine.    Two witnesses testified that\n\nAdams, 33 years old, sometimes slept in the bed of Amanda’s 15-\n\nyear-old sister, Chrissy, and that sometimes Adams and Chrissy\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fshared a bed.   Chrissy testified that Adams had slept in the same\n\nbed with her and, over a defense objection, that he had a sexual\n\nrelationship with her.\n\n          In February 2002, Adams began a set of robberies with\n\nWright, aimed at relieving drug dealers of cash or drugs.      The\n\nfirst robbery, of Jaime Morales, took place on February 6, 2002.\n\nWright testified that Adams had taken a gun into Morales’ motel\n\nroom, returned with marijuana and cash, and to Wright admitted\n\nhitting Morales with a pistol. Morales (and his girlfriend who was\n\npresent) confirmed this story, adding that the pistol had a laser\n\nsight (the Sturm Ruger had such a sight).\n\n          There was also testimony from several witnesses including\n\nWright that on February 12, 2002, Adams, armed with a gun, had\n\nrobbed money and drugs from James Frazier.   Wright and still other\n\nwitnesses testified to a third, similar robbery in February 2002 in\n\nwhich Adams took money but not drugs; this third incident was not\n\ncharged in the indictment, presumably because there were no drugs\n\nand therefore nothing in which to ground a federal charge.\n\n          On March 8, 2002, Wright was arrested for an unrelated\n\noffense and offered up Adams.   Based on Wright’s disclosures and\n\nother evidence, the police secured a warrant for the apartment\n\nwhere Adams had been staying from time to time with Wright, Amanda\n\nand Chrissy.    In the living room the police found the Kel Tec\n\npistol in a box, along with a plastic bag containing ammunition.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fIn Chrissy’s bedroom, they found a gun magazine on a television top\n\nand, under Chrissy’s bed, a lockbox containing both ammunition and\n\na Sturm Ruger with a laser sight.\n\n           At   trial,   Adams   himself   admitted   to   the   robberies\n\nincluding the theft of drugs from Morales but denied that he had at\n\nany time possessed the handgun.     His story, partly corroborated by\n\ntestimony from Adams’ girlfriend Sarah Blake, was that Laurie had\n\ngiven the two guns to Sarah rather than Adams, and that he had told\n\nher where to take them.    By this tactic, Adams’ asserted aim, naive\n\nif true, was to avoid possessing or appearing to possess a weapon.1\n\n           The jury convicted Adams of having had the Sturm Ruger in\n\nhis possession on March 18, 2002, when the police found it in the\n\napartment.   He was also convicted of using a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to the Morales robbery on February 6, 2002.         On the third\n\ncount, relating to the Frazier robbery on February 12, 2002, the\n\njury acquitted Adams. Adams was thereafter sentenced to 120 months\n\nfor firearms possession and 84 months (to be served consecutively)\n\nfor using the gun during the Morales drug robbery.               Adams now\n\nappeals.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Apparently hoping to counter testimony that the box with the\nSturm Ruger was under his bed in the apartment, Adams also\ntestified that he could not get at the gun because (according to\nAdams) Laurie alone had the key to the lockbox and (again according\nto Adams), the alternative means of entry--a type of combination\nlock--was broken.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            Adams’ first argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt committed error by allowing Chrissy to testify that she and\n\nAdams had a sexual relationship.        He points out that he, a 33-year-\n\nold   African   American     male,    was   said   to   have      an   interracial\n\nrelationship with a girl who was 15 at the time, and that a jury\n\nmight also have conceived that he was guilty of statutory rape.\n\nThe potential for prejudice, he says, substantially outweighed\n\nwhatever slight relevance the sexual relationship testimony might\n\nhave had.\n\n            Evidence   must    be     excluded     where    its    relevance    is\n\n\"substantially outweighed\" by its prejudicial effect, that is, by\n\nits tendency to encourage the jury to decide the case on improper\n\ngrounds.    See Fed. R. Evid. 403 and advisory committee note; Old\n\nChief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 180 (1997).                 Probative value\n\nand prejudicial effect are both matters of degree, United States v.\n\nLi, 206 F.3d 78, 84 (1st Cir. 2000), and whether the government has\n\nalternative means of effectively proving the same thing without the\n\nprejudicial evidence is also pertinent. See Old Chief, 519 U.S. at\n\n184; United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n            Trial   judges    enjoy    great     latitude    in     making   these\n\nbalancing decisions (often under time pressure) and are normally\n\noverturned only where their judgment is egregiously wrong.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 162 F.3d 135, 142 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fMany such decisions are simply close calls on which able judges may\n\ndiffer.    The trial judge had the advantage in being on the spot and\n\nhaving a better sense than the appellate court of the courtroom\n\ndynamics in the case.        See Udemba v. Nicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 15-16 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            Generalities      about   deference    carry   us    only      to   the\n\nstarting line.      Here, the government says that the evidence of the\n\nsexual relationship was relevant for two reasons.              The first is to\n\nsupport a link in the chain of evidence connecting Adams with the\n\nSturm Ruger so as to prove his possession of the weapon pursuant to\n\ncount I.    Because the gun was in a lockbox under Chrissy’s bed, the\n\nfact that Adams had a sexual relationship with Chrissy tended to\n\nincrease the likelihood that he spent time in that bed, supporting\n\nthe inference that he put the lockbox there and controlled it.\n\n            There is one glitch. Several witnesses testified without\n\nobjection    that    Adams    slept   in    Chrissy's   bed,    so   the    added\n\ninformation that they had a sexual relationship was of peculiarly\n\nlimited value.      The sexual relationship arguably made the same-bed\n\nstory more credible and perhaps increased the likelihood that he\n\nviewed the bed as his own, but these reinforcing inferences–-\n\nalthough making the evidence technically relevant--are hardly of\n\ngreat value.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f             The second argument for relevance, and apparently the one\n\nthat prompted the ruling admitting the evidence (although we can\n\naffirm the admission of evidence on any valid basis, see United\n\nStates v. Meserve, 271 F.3d 314, 327 (1st Cir. 2001)), requires\n\nmore background.     When Adams testified he gave a (in some measure)\n\nmore benign version of his encounter with Morales charged in count\n\nII.       Adams said that he had gone to beat up Morales because\n\nMorales, who worked in the same restaurant as Chrissy, had been\n\ntrying to give her drugs in order to seduce her and that he, Adams,\n\nhad been seeking to protect her.          Other defense cross-examination\n\nsought to support this supposed motive for the assault.\n\n             Arguing that the defense had sought to cast Adams as a\n\ngentleman-protector of the innocent, the government then sought\n\nleave to bring out through Wright (who had been cross-examined\n\nabout Adams’     aspersions   on   Morales)    that   Adams   had   a   sexual\n\nrelationship with Chrissy.         Thereafter, the government also got\n\nconfirming testimony as to the sexual relationship from Chrissy\n\nherself.     In both cases, the defense objected to the testimony but\n\ndid not seek a limiting instruction as to the use of the testimony.\n\n             Of course, the government was entitled to discredit\n\nAdams’ story since he was denying that he had gone with the\n\nintention of robbing Morales of drugs;2 but it is not clear why\n\n\n      2\n      Adams himself admitted taking drugs from Morales after the\nassault (in which Adams denied carrying or using a gun); but Adams’\nintent in advance to steal drugs, rather than taking them as an\n\n                                    -7-\n\fAdams’ sexual relationship with Chrissy would make it less likely\n\nthat he would be interested in attacking Morales as a would-be\n\nseducer.   Perhaps the evidence had a slight tendency to counter\n\nAdams’ insinuation that he had attacked Morales for high-minded\n\nmotives (he called himself her “guardian”) and so discredit further\n\nAdams’ denial of a plan to steal drugs.\n\n           Thus, we have two arguments for relevance; both may work\n\nand can be treated as cumulative justification, but in neither is\n\nthe added information necessary or even very useful.        As for\n\nprejudice, there was obviously some potential for prejudicing the\n\njury by telling them that Adams had seduced a 15-year-old girl, but\n\nit should not be overstated.     The jury already knew from other\n\ntestimony that Adams slept in Chrissy’s bed and that they had\n\nsometimes slept in the bed at the same time.     How much explicit\n\nconfirmation of the sexual relationship added may be open to\n\ndoubt.3\n\n\n\n\nafterthought, was useful to the government’s effort to show that\nthe gun was employed \"in relation to\" a drug crime, namely, the\nacquisition of drugs. See Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223,\n238 (1993) (declaring that \"in relation to\" requires that the\nfirearm \"have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug\ntrafficking crime\" and that mere coincidental \"presence or\ninvolvement\" is insufficient).\n     3\n      \"Where the prejudicial fact has already come before the jury\nthrough other proof, the cumulative impact of the proffered\nevidence may be so slight as not to warrant exclusion.\" 22 Wright\n& Graham, Federal Practice & Procedure § 5215 (1978 & Supp. 2004).\nSee, e.g., United States v. Sassanelli, 118 F.3d 495, 498 (6th Cir.\n1997).\n\n                                -8-\n\f            This is a perfect example of why district judges have\n\nlatitude.      Viewed in the cold light of post-trial reflection, the\n\njudges   on     this   panel      might   well     have    excluded    the   sexual\n\nrelationship evidence. But we have the advantage not only of ample\n\ntime to reflect but also of all of the trial testimony.                 It is much\n\neasier now to put together all the pieces, see the full strength of\n\nthe government’s case, and reflect on just how little the disputed\n\ntestimony added.        In this case, the trial judge’s call, although\n\ndebatable, was not an egregious error.\n\n              Even if we found a violation of Rule 403, we would regard\n\nany error as harmless because this evidentiary ruling could not\n\nhave affected the outcome.            See United States v. McCann, 366 F.3d\n\n46, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2004).              At least eight different witnesses\n\ntestified that they had seen Adams in possession of a gun, usually\n\none with a laser sight.           This made almost beside the point Adams’\n\nalready thin story that his wife and Sarah Blake alone controlled\n\nthe weapon while it resided in the lockbox under Chrissy’s bed.\n\nThe idea that the jury would ever have acquitted Adams on the\n\nfelon-in-possession charge is hard to take seriously.\n\n              As for Adams using the gun during the drug robbery of\n\nMorales, two witnesses (Morales and his girlfriend) testified to\n\nseeing   him    use    it   and   a   third     (Wright)   testified    to   Adams’\n\nadmission that he used it.            And a bullet, shown by expert evidence\n\nto have been earlier loaded in the Sturm Ruger, was found in the\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fmotel room–-supporting Morales’ claim that he had been hit with the\n\ngun by Adams.   Three separate witnesses, the bullet, and Adams’\n\nprior control of the gun made the conviction almost inevitable.\n\n          Adams relies heavily upon United States v. Aguilar-\n\nAranceta, 58 F.3d 796 (1st Cir. 1995), and Gov't of the Virgin\n\nIslands v. Archibald, 987 F.2d 180 (3d Cir. 1993).         Both decisions\n\nreversed district court convictions where prejudicial evidence of\n\nslight probative value was admitted.            But in both cases the\n\nincremental   prejudicial   effect   of   the   disputed    evidence   was\n\nstronger and in neither case does it appear that untainted evidence\n\nof guilt virtually assured a conviction.\n\n          Adams makes two further and quite separate claims on\n\nappeal. One is that the felon-in-possession statute that underpins\n\nhis conviction on count I is unconstitutional.         Adams says that\n\nbecause the statute applies only where the weapon traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce, he would have been safe in Maryland where the\n\ngun was manufactured and was convicted here only because of the\n\n“fortuity” that he lives in Maine.         This, he says, makes the\n\nstatute irrational under equal protection standards.\n\n          In accord with several other circuits, see United States\n\nv. Walker, 930 F.2d 789, 795 (10th Cir. 1991); United States v.\n\nWynde, 579 F.2d 1088, 1092-93 (8th Cir. 1978), we reject this\n\nargument. The statute is not keyed to the defendant’s residence in\n\none state rather than another; it applies wherever the gun traveled\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fin interstate commerce. Adams could also have been convicted if he\n\nlived in the state of manufacture so long as the gun had been\n\nshipped out of the state and then brought back in.     About all one\n\ncan say is that a felon who lives in a gun manufacturing state has\n\na better chance of avoiding violation.\n\n            Admittedly, odd results are possible: a felon who brought\n\na Sturm Ruger in Maryland and kept it there is not intrinsically\n\nless dangerous than Adams.     But travel of the gun in interstate\n\ncommerce was the jurisdictional hook available to Congress and the\n\nprohibition on felons having guns is rational. See Lewis v. United\n\nStates, 445 U.S. 55, 65-66 (1980) (discussing 18 U.S.C. App. §\n\n1202(a)).    That Congress left unremedied like problems beyond its\n\nready grasp does not make the statute irrational under equal\n\nprotection standards.    See Packer Corp. v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 110\n\n(1932) (Brandeis, J.); Dunagin v. City of Oxford, 718 F.2d 738, 753\n\n(5th Cir. 1983).\n\n            Adams’ other argument is that the fruits of the search of\n\nthe Whitmore-Wright apartment should have been suppressed for lack\n\nof probable cause for the warrant.       Wright’s statements to the\n\nofficer, recounted in the warrant affidavit, described Adams’ role\n\nin the set of robberies recounted above and identified just where\n\nAdams’ Sturm Ruger was hidden in the apartment. The affidavit also\n\nnoted Adams’ prior criminal record, a report by Laurie to the\n\npolice that the guns had been taken, and information tending to\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fconfirm Adams’ participation in drug dealings (a police report) and\n\na drug-related robbery (a witness interviewed by the officer).\n\n           This assemblage supplies several times over probable\n\ncause to believe that evidence of a felony (the gun) would be found\n\nin   the   apartment.   Adams’    attacks   on    details   and   small\n\ndiscrepancies are not worth discussion.          See United States v.\n\nSchaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 567 (1st Cir. 1996).           He has received\n\nvigorous and thorough assistance of counsel on this appeal, and no\n\njudge should begrudge the time needed to consider arguments by a\n\nman now serving a sentence of 204 months.   That does not mean that\n\nproportionate time is needed to explain why the weakest of the\n\narguments fails.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

By a superceding indictment, a\n\nfederal grand jury charged Delon J. Adams with three crimes: one\n\ncount charged that as a felon he had unlawfully possessed a firearm\n\non March 18, 2002, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2000)\n\n(count I); the other two counts charged him with using and carrying\n\na firearm in relation to drug trafficking crimes committed on two\n\ndifferent dates, February 6 and 12, 2002, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (2000) (counts II and III).   Several motions to\n\nsuppress evidence were denied and a jury trial began on December 4,\n\n2002.\n\n          The parties stipulated to Adams’ prior felony conviction.\n\nAt trial, the government presented evidence that Adams had moved to\n\nMaine and in June 2001 married a woman named Laurie; and that in\n\nJune 2001 she had purchased a handgun (a Sturm Ruger pistol) and in\n\nOctober 2001 another (a Kel Tec).      Her attempted purchase of a\n\nthird gun, two days after the second, alerted the police who\n\nstopped Adams driving away with Laurie and who, under his seat,\n\nfound both previously purchased guns.\n\n          After this incident, Adams and Laurie separated and in\n\nFebruary 2002 Adams began to stay at least intermittently with a\n\nwoman named Amanda Whitmore and her boyfriend Christopher Wright at\n\ntheir apartment in Biddeford, Maine.    Two witnesses testified that\n\nAdams, 33 years old, sometimes slept in the bed of Amanda’s 15-\n\nyear-old sister, Chrissy, and that sometimes Adams and Chrissy\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fshared a bed.   Chrissy testified that Adams had slept in the same\n\nbed with her and, over a defense objection, that he had a sexual\n\nrelationship with her.\n\n          In February 2002, Adams began a set of robberies with\n\nWright, aimed at relieving drug dealers of cash or drugs.      The\n\nfirst robbery, of Jaime Morales, took place on February 6, 2002.\n\nWright testified that Adams had taken a gun into Morales’ motel\n\nroom, returned with marijuana and cash, and to Wright admitted\n\nhitting Morales with a pistol. Morales (and his girlfriend who was\n\npresent) confirmed this story, adding that the pistol had a laser\n\nsight (the Sturm Ruger had such a sight).\n\n          There was also testimony from several witnesses including\n\nWright that on February 12, 2002, Adams, armed with a gun, had\n\nrobbed money and drugs from James Frazier.   Wright and still other\n\nwitnesses testified to a third, similar robbery in February 2002 in\n\nwhich Adams took money but not drugs; this third incident was not\n\ncharged in the indictment, presumably because there were no drugs\n\nand therefore nothing in which to ground a federal charge.\n\n          On March 8, 2002, Wright was arrested for an unrelated\n\noffense and offered up Adams.   Based on Wright’s disclosures and\n\nother evidence, the police secured a warrant for the apartment\n\nwhere Adams had been staying from time to time with Wright, Amanda\n\nand Chrissy.    In the living room the police found the Kel Tec\n\npistol in a box, along with a plastic bag containing ammunition.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fIn Chrissy’s bedroom, they found a gun magazine on a television top\n\nand, under Chrissy’s bed, a lockbox containing both ammunition and\n\na Sturm Ruger with a laser sight.\n\n           At   trial,   Adams   himself   admitted   to   the   robberies\n\nincluding the theft of drugs from Morales but denied that he had at\n\nany time possessed the handgun.     His story, partly corroborated by\n\ntestimony from Adams’ girlfriend Sarah Blake, was that Laurie had\n\ngiven the two guns to Sarah rather than Adams, and that he had told\n\nher where to take them.    By this tactic, Adams’ asserted aim, naive\n\nif true, was to avoid possessing or appearing to possess a weapon.1\n\n           The jury convicted Adams of having had the Sturm Ruger in\n\nhis possession on March 18, 2002, when the police found it in the\n\napartment.   He was also convicted of using a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to the Morales robbery on February 6, 2002.         On the third\n\ncount, relating to the Frazier robbery on February 12, 2002, the\n\njury acquitted Adams. Adams was thereafter sentenced to 120 months\n\nfor firearms possession and 84 months (to be served consecutively)\n\nfor using the gun during the Morales drug robbery.               Adams now\n\nappeals.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Apparently hoping to counter testimony that the box with the\nSturm Ruger was under his bed in the apartment, Adams also\ntestified that he could not get at the gun because (according to\nAdams) Laurie alone had the key to the lockbox and (again according\nto Adams), the alternative means of entry--a type of combination\nlock--was broken.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            Adams’ first argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt committed error by allowing Chrissy to testify that she and\n\nAdams had a sexual relationship.        He points out that he, a 33-year-\n\nold   African   American     male,    was   said   to   have      an   interracial\n\nrelationship with a girl who was 15 at the time, and that a jury\n\nmight also have conceived that he was guilty of statutory rape.\n\nThe potential for prejudice, he says, substantially outweighed\n\nwhatever slight relevance the sexual relationship testimony might\n\nhave had.\n\n            Evidence   must    be     excluded     where    its    relevance    is\n\n\"substantially outweighed\" by its prejudicial effect, that is, by\n\nits tendency to encourage the jury to decide the case on improper\n\ngrounds.

Here, the government says that the evidence of the\n\nsexual relationship was relevant for two reasons.              The first is to\n\nsupport a link in the chain of evidence connecting Adams with the\n\nSturm Ruger so as to prove his possession of the weapon pursuant to\n\ncount I.    Because the gun was in a lockbox under Chrissy’s bed, the\n\nfact that Adams had a sexual relationship with Chrissy tended to\n\nincrease the likelihood that he spent time in that bed, supporting\n\nthe inference that he put the lockbox there and controlled it.\n\n            There is one glitch. Several witnesses testified without\n\nobjection    that    Adams    slept   in    Chrissy's   bed,    so   the    added\n\ninformation that they had a sexual relationship was of peculiarly\n\nlimited value.      The sexual relationship arguably made the same-bed\n\nstory more credible and perhaps increased the likelihood that he\n\nviewed the bed as his own, but these reinforcing inferences–-\n\nalthough making the evidence technically relevant--are hardly of\n\ngreat value.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f             The second argument for relevance, and apparently the one\n\nthat prompted the ruling admitting the evidence (although we can\n\naffirm the admission of evidence on any valid basis, see United\n\nStates v. Meserve, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199680\"><a href=\"/opinion/199680/united-states-v-meserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (1st Cir. 2001)), requires\n\nmore background.     When Adams testified he gave a (in some measure)\n\nmore benign version of his encounter with Morales charged in count\n\nII.       Adams said that he had gone to beat up Morales because\n\nMorales, who worked in the same restaurant as Chrissy, had been\n\ntrying to give her drugs in order to seduce her and that he, Adams,\n\nhad been seeking to protect her.          Other defense cross-examination\n\nsought to support this supposed motive for the assault.\n\n             Arguing that the defense had sought to cast Adams as a\n\ngentleman-protector of the innocent, the government then sought\n\nleave to bring out through Wright (who had been cross-examined\n\nabout Adams’     aspersions   on   Morales)    that   Adams   had   a   sexual\n\nrelationship with Chrissy.         Thereafter, the government also got\n\nconfirming testimony as to the sexual relationship from Chrissy\n\nherself.     In both cases, the defense objected to the testimony but\n\ndid not seek a limiting instruction as to the use of the testimony.\n\n             Of course, the government was entitled to discredit\n\nAdams’ story since he was denying that he had gone with the\n\nintention of robbing Morales of drugs;2 but it is not clear why\n\n\n      2\n      Adams himself admitted taking drugs from Morales after the\nassault (in which Adams denied carrying or using a gun); but Adams’\nintent in advance to steal drugs, rather than taking them as an\n\n                                    -7-\n\fAdams’ sexual relationship with Chrissy would make it less likely\n\nthat he would be interested in attacking Morales as a would-be\n\nseducer.   Perhaps the evidence had a slight tendency to counter\n\nAdams’ insinuation that he had attacked Morales for high-minded\n\nmotives (he called himself her “guardian”) and so discredit further\n\nAdams’ denial of a plan to steal drugs.\n\n           Thus, we have two arguments for relevance; both may work\n\nand can be treated as cumulative justification, but in neither is\n\nthe added information necessary or even very useful.        As for\n\nprejudice, there was obviously some potential for prejudicing the\n\njury by telling them that Adams had seduced a 15-year-old girl, but\n\nit should not be overstated.     The jury already knew from other\n\ntestimony that Adams slept in Chrissy’s bed and that they had\n\nsometimes slept in the bed at the same time.     How much explicit\n\nconfirmation of the sexual relationship added may be open to\n\ndoubt.3\n\n\n\n\nafterthought, was useful to the government’s effort to show that\nthe gun was employed \"in relation to\" a drug crime, namely, the\nacquisition of drugs.

Viewed in the cold light of post-trial reflection, the\n\njudges   on     this   panel      might   well     have    excluded    the   sexual\n\nrelationship evidence. But we have the advantage not only of ample\n\ntime to reflect but also of all of the trial testimony.                 It is much\n\neasier now to put together all the pieces, see the full strength of\n\nthe government’s case, and reflect on just how little the disputed\n\ntestimony added.        In this case, the trial judge’s call, although\n\ndebatable, was not an egregious error.\n\n              Even if we found a violation of Rule 403, we would regard\n\nany error as harmless because this evidentiary ruling could not\n\nhave affected the outcome.            See United States v. McCann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200991\"><a href=\"/opinion/200991/united-states-v-mccann/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55-56 (1st Cir. 2004).              At least eight different witnesses\n\ntestified that they had seen Adams in possession of a gun, usually\n\none with a laser sight.           This made almost beside the point Adams’\n\nalready thin story that his wife and Sarah Blake alone controlled\n\nthe weapon while it resided in the lockbox under Chrissy’s bed.\n\nThe idea that the jury would ever have acquitted Adams on the\n\nfelon-in-possession charge is hard to take seriously.\n\n              As for Adams using the gun during the drug robbery of\n\nMorales, two witnesses (Morales and his girlfriend) testified to\n\nseeing   him    use    it   and   a   third     (Wright)   testified    to   Adams’\n\nadmission that he used it.

Three separate witnesses, the bullet, and Adams’\n\nprior control of the gun made the conviction almost inevitable.\n\n          Adams relies heavily upon United States v. Aguilar-\n\nAranceta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698646\"><a href=\"/opinion/698646/united-states-v-esperanza-aguilar-aranceta/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1995), and Gov't of the Virgin\n\nIslands v.

Both decisions\n\nreversed district court convictions where prejudicial evidence of\n\nslight probative value was admitted.            But in both cases the\n\nincremental   prejudicial   effect   of   the   disputed    evidence   was\n\nstronger and in neither case does it appear that untainted evidence\n\nof guilt virtually assured a conviction.\n\n          Adams makes two further and quite separate claims on\n\nappeal. One is that the felon-in-possession statute that underpins\n\nhis conviction on count I is unconstitutional.         Adams says that\n\nbecause the statute applies only where the weapon traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce, he would have been safe in Maryland where the\n\ngun was manufactured and was convicted here only because of the\n\n“fortuity” that he lives in Maine.         This, he says, makes the\n\nstatute irrational under equal protection standards.\n\n          In accord with several other circuits, see United States\n\nv.

The statute is not keyed to the defendant’s residence in\n\none state rather than another; it applies wherever the gun traveled\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fin interstate commerce. Adams could also have been convicted if he\n\nlived in the state of manufacture so long as the gun had been\n\nshipped out of the state and then brought back in.     About all one\n\ncan say is that a felon who lives in a gun manufacturing state has\n\na better chance of avoiding violation.\n\n            Admittedly, odd results are possible: a felon who brought\n\na Sturm Ruger in Maryland and kept it there is not intrinsically\n\nless dangerous than Adams.     But travel of the gun in interstate\n\ncommerce was the jurisdictional hook available to Congress and the\n\nprohibition on felons having guns is rational. See Lewis v.

Wright’s statements to the\n\nofficer, recounted in the warrant affidavit, described Adams’ role\n\nin the set of robberies recounted above and identified just where\n\nAdams’ Sturm Ruger was hidden in the apartment.
