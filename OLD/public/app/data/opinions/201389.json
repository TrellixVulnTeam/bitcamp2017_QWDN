Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     George F. Gormley and Christie M. Charles on brief for the\nappellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Virginia M.\nVander Jagt, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                       December 23, 2004\n\f              Per Curiam.      Following the conviction of defendant-\n\nappellant Joel Padilla for being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the district court sentenced him to\n\nimprisonment and a term of supervised release.                On appeal, Padilla\n\nadvances three claims, one of which has merit and, under existing\n\ncircuit precedent, justifies modification of his sentence.                    The\n\nother   two    claims   lack   merit.         We   consider   the   three   claims\n\nsequentially.\n\n                        Denial of Motion to Dismiss\n\n              Padilla contends that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to dismiss on Commerce Clause grounds.                That motion was\n\nbased on his reading of the decisions in United States v. Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. 549 (1995), and United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203\n\n(5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 907 (2002).                   We are not\n\nfree to revisit the Lopez claim because this court already has\n\nrejected it in prior cases.         See, e.g., United States v. Colon\n\nOsorio, 360 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              We also reject Padilla's claim that Emerson provides a\n\nbasis for dismissal on Commerce Clause grounds.                 In doing so, we\n\nadopt the rationale of the court that spawned the Emerson decision.\n\nSee United States v. Darrington, 351 F.3d 632, 634 (5th Cir. 2003)\n\n(rejecting Emerson challenge in the context of a section 922(g)(1)\n\nprosecution), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 2429 (2004).\n\n                    Refusal to Give Jury Instruction\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            Padilla      claims      that    the      district      court    abused   its\n\ndiscretion      when    it    declined      to    give   a    requested     instruction\n\naddressing whether the gun he possessed — which lacked a firing pin\n\nassembly and magazine — was a \"firearm\" within the meaning of the\n\nstatute of conviction.           See 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (defining the\n\nterm).    We discern no abuse of discretion.\n\n            The short of the matter is that the law amply justifies\n\nthe instruction actually given by the lower court.                           See, e.g.,\n\nUnited    States    v.    Brown,     117    F.3d       353,   355    (7th    Cir.   1997)\n\n(construing the corresponding sentencing guideline definition and\n\ncollecting cases).           Padilla has cited no relevant legal authority\n\nin support of a contrary position.\n\n                    Delegation of Sentencing Authority\n\n            On appeal, Padilla asserts for the first time that the\n\ndistrict court erred when it allowed the probation officer to\n\ndetermine the number of drug tests he must undergo during his\n\nsupervised release term.              The government confesses error; it\n\nconcedes     that      this    was   an     improper      delegation        of   judicial\n\nauthority.      See United States v. Meléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93,\n\n103, 106 (1st Cir. 2003) (construing 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d)).                             It\n\nnonetheless suggests that we need not correct the unpreserved error\n\nbecause    it   neither       constitutes         a   miscarriage     of    justice   nor\n\nseriously affects the integrity of the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f            This argument is foreclosed by our decision in Meléndez-\n\nSantana, in which a panel of this court corrected the same kind of\n\nunpreserved error without conducting the usual plain error review.\n\nSee id. at 106 (vacating drug testing condition and remanding for\n\nresentencing because 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) \"requires courts to\n\ndetermine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed\"); see\n\nalso   Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (explaining that in a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted\n\npanels are bound by prior panel decisions); United States v. Wogan,\n\n938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991) (same).           The fact that there\n\nwere multiple     errors   in   Meléndez-Santana,     making   resentencing\n\nnecessary in any event, is not sufficient to distinguish that\n\ndecision.\n\n            In the alternative, the government invites us to limit\n\nthe number of drug tests to the minimum (three) required by 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(d).     To this end, it cites our recent decisions in\n\nUnited States v. Tulloch, 380 F.3d 8, 10 & n.1 (1st Cir. 2004) (per\n\ncuriam), and United States v. Lewandowski, 372 F.3d 470, 471 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam). Those decisions are inapposite here, and,\n\nthus, we decline the invitation.\n\n            In   Lewandowski,    we   construed   a   supervised   release\n\ncondition mandating \"at least\" three drug tests to require only\n\nthree tests.     See id.   There, however, the district court had not\n\nexpressly delegated to the probation officer the power to decide\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fwhether to administer more tests.             Id.    We nonetheless adopted a\n\nlimiting construction in order to resolve an ambiguity in the\n\ncourt's order and ensure that it could not be interpreted to\n\ncontain an implied delegation of such authority.                Id.\n\n            Tulloch    is    distinguishable        for   a   different   reason.\n\nThere, we directed the district court to amend one defendant's\n\nsupervised release condition, which mandated only a single drug\n\ntest, to conform to the statutory requirement that no fewer than\n\nthree tests be performed.           See Tulloch, 380 F.3d at 10 n.1.          With\n\nregard to the other defendant, we instructed the court to conform\n\nits written judgment to its previously announced oral judgment\n\n(which set the number of drug tests at three).                See id.     The case\n\nat hand does not share the central characteristics of either\n\nLewandowski or Tulloch.\n\n            Of course, Padilla has not objected to the government's\n\nsuggestion    that    we    adopt   a   limiting     construction     here,   and,\n\nconceivably, that might represent a reasonable and efficient way to\n\ncorrect an express misdelegation of this kind.                But that judgment\n\nshould be made on the ground, as it were, by the sentencing court.\n\nOn   this   record,   which    indicates      that    Padilla    regularly    used\n\nmarijuana for some period of time prior to his arrest for the\n\noffense of conviction, we prefer to let the sentencing court decide\n\nhow to rectify the error.           Accordingly, we vacate the challenged\n\ncondition and remand to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fIf it so chooses, the court may amend its sentencing judgment to\n\nrequire three drug tests or, after holding a new hearing at which\n\nPadilla would have the right to appear with counsel, may specify\n\nsome higher maximum number of drug tests.\n\n          We vacate the sentence to the extent it improperly\n\ndelegates the district court's authority to determine the maximum\n\nnumber of drug tests required during the appellant's supervised\n\nrelease term.   We remand to the district court for further action\n\nconsistent with this opinion. In all other respects, we affirm the\n\nconviction and sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                  — Concurring Opinions Follow —\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge and SELYA, Circuit Judge,\n\nconcurring in the judgment.           We agree that United States v.\n\nMeléndez-Santana,   353   F.3d   93    (1st   Cir.   2003),   controls   the\n\ndisposition of this case and that, under its principal holding, an\n\nimproper delegation of the authority to set certain drug-testing\n\nconditions occurred.      See id. at 106.        We do not question the\n\nsoundness of that holding.          We write separately, however, to\n\nexpress our discomfiture with the approach that the Meléndez-\n\nSantana panel took in determining what consequences attended the\n\ndelegation error.\n\n          Although the Meléndez-Santana panel gave lip service to\n\nplain error review, it vacated the challenged portion of the\n\njudgment upon the finding of error simpliciter, without undertaking\n\nany further analysis.     See id.     In so doing, the panel effectively\n\ntreated the trial court's mistake as one of \"the limited class of\n\nstructural errors\" that warrant correction regardless of other\n\nconsiderations.   United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 632 (2002)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          In our view, that approach — which portends automatic\n\nreversal of every delegation error — is incorrect.            A finding of\n\nstructural error assumes the existence of a \"defect affecting the\n\nframework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an\n\nerror in the trial process itself.\"           Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\n\nU.S. 279, 310 (1991); see also United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fF.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).        And some (perhaps most) structural\n\nerrors deserve careful, individualized attention.                  The Supreme\n\nCourt recently stated that, even with respect to preserved errors,\n\nonly \"certain structural errors undermining the fairness of a\n\ncriminal proceeding as a whole . . . require[] reversal without\n\nregard to the mistake's effect on the proceeding.\"               United States\n\nv. Dominguez Benitez, 124 S. Ct. 2333, 2339 (2004) (emphasis\n\nsupplied).    As   that    passage      indicates,      the   sub-category     of\n\n\"automatic   reversal\"    errors     has     been    reserved    for   the   most\n\npervasive and debilitating constitutional deprivations, such as a\n\ntotal withholding of the right to counsel at trial, a denial of the\n\nright to self-representation at trial, and the specter of a biased\n\njudge presiding over a case.         See Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10\n\n(collecting cases).      Such errors affect \"[t]he entire conduct of\n\nthe trial from beginning to end.\"            Id. at 309.\n\n          In contrast, a delegation error of the kind at issue here\n\n(and in Meléndez-Santana) affects only a single aspect (drug\n\ntesting on supervised release) of a single phase (sentencing) of a\n\ncriminal proceeding.      Such a bevue, although serious, simply does\n\nnot belong in the select company of structural errors. Cf. Cotton,\n\n535 U.S. at 632-33 (finding that, in the context of sentencing, a\n\nparticular Apprendi error did not sink to the level of a structural\n\ndefect); Perez-Ruiz,      353   F.3d    at    17    (similar).     Because   the\n\ndelegation error neither infects the criminal proceeding as a whole\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fnor implicates its fundamental fairness, such an error is non-\n\nstructural.   This means that, even when preserved, relief for such\n\nan error must be \"tied in some way to prejudicial effect, and the\n\nstandard phrased as 'error that affects substantial rights,' used\n\nin [Criminal] Rule 52, has previously been taken to mean error with\n\na prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\"\n\nDominguez Benitez, 124 S. Ct. at 2339.\n\n          Here, as in Meléndez-Santana, the defendant failed to\n\nobject at the time of sentencing to the improper delegation of\n\njudicial authority.   Hence, this non-structural error arguably was\n\nwaived and, if so, it cannot be resurrected on appeal.   See United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"A party\n\nwaives a right when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons\n\nit.\").   Even were we to take the view most favorable to the\n\ndefendant and assume that his procedural default at sentencing was\n\nthe result of oversight or inadvertence, the delegation error would\n\nhave to be regarded as forfeited and, as such, would engender plain\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\ferror review.1         See id.; United States v. Vazquez-Molina, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-2655, slip op. at 7-8].\n\n               The plain error standard of review presents a formidable\n\nbarrier to a defaulting party.          To survive plain error review, a\n\nlitigant must demonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was\n\nclear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"              United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001); accord United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).              The Meléndez-Santana\n\npanel opted for automatic reversal and abjured any application of\n\nthis       four-part    algorithm.   Thus    we   are   constrained   by   that\n\nprecedent to forgo its application here.                See United States v.\n\nWogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that in a\n\nmulti-panel circuit, newly constituted panels are bound by prior\n\npanel decisions).2\n\n\n\n       1\n      Even if the unpreserved delegation error were structural (a\nproposition that we reject), plain error review would still apply.\nSee Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466 (1997) (holding\nthat Criminal Rule 52(b), requiring the application of plain error\nanalysis to forfeited claims, governs direct appeals from criminal\njudgments premised upon unpreserved structural errors); United\nStates v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal, 355 F.3d 40, 47 n.5 (1st Cir.\n2004) (relying on Johnson in noting that \"[e]ven if this were a\nstructural error, [the defendant] would still not be entitled to\n'automatic reversal' because he failed to preserve his objection\").\n       2\n      While the Wogan rule admits of a few modest exceptions, see\nWilliams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995),\nnone applies here.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            In sum, we deem ourselves bound, on the authority of\n\nMeléndez-Santana, to join in the opinion vacating the challenged\n\ndrug-testing order.       Were we at liberty to undertake full-blown\n\nplain error review, however, we doubt very much that Padilla could\n\nprevail; the drug-testing order here at issue appears neither to\n\naffect   the   defendant's     substantial      rights    nor   to   impugn    the\n\nintegrity of the proceedings below.3               Because this is so and\n\nbecause we believe, with all due respect, that Meléndez-Santana is\n\nwrongly decided both with regard to its treatment of the delegation\n\nerror as structural and with regard to its conclusion that such\n\nerrors warrant automatic reversal, we write separately.\n\n            We add, moreover, that the problem we have encountered\n\nhere is likely to be a recurrent one.             Equally as important, the\n\nquestion of which errors are structural and which are not is one of\n\ngreat    salience   in   the   criminal    law.      We    would     welcome    an\n\nopportunity to have the full court address this issue and we urge\n\nthe government to give serious consideration to filing a petition\n\nfor en banc review.      Unless and until this aspect of the Meléndez-\n\nSantana decision is corrected, however, we must concur in the\n\njudgment   automatically       vacating   the    challenged     condition      and\n\nremanding for resentencing.\n\n                — Second concurring opinion follows —\n\n\n     3\n      On much the same basis, we doubt that the discerned error in\nMeléndez-Santana could have withstood full-blown application of the\ntest for plain error.\n\n                                    -11-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, concurring. Although I believe\n\nthat Meléndez-Santana was correctly decided, I write separately to\n\naddress some of my brethren's discomfiture about the structural\n\nerror rationale and plain error review in that case.\n\n            As we noted in Meléndez-Santana, \"Article III of the\n\nConstitution      vests   responsibility        for    resolving      cases   and\n\ncontroversies with the courts. . . . [T]his responsibility requires\n\n'both the appearance and the reality of control by Article III\n\njudges over the interpretation, declaration, and application of\n\nfederal law' to maintain 'the essential, constitutional role of the\n\njudiciary.'\"      353 F.3d at 101 (citing Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic\n\nof Am., Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc., 725 F.2d 537, 544 (9th Cir.\n\n1984)(Kennedy, J.)).          An \"improvident delegation\" of judicial\n\nauthority   to    a   probation   officer       can   erode    the    judiciary's\n\n\"essential role\"; thus, separation of powers forbids courts from\n\ndelegating their Article III responsibilities.                Id.   Although this\n\n\"general principle does not . . . prohibit courts from using\n\nnonjudicial officers to support judicial functions,\" courts must\n\n\"retain[] and exercise[] ultimate responsibility.\"                  Id. (internal\n\ncitations omitted). We therefore held that the court improvidently\n\ndelegated   its    judicial    function    in    Meléndez-Santana       because,\n\ninstead of simply charging the probation officer with managing the\n\nadministrative details of defendant's drug treatment, the court\n\ndelegated its judicial function of deciding whether defendant had\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fto undergo treatment.         Id. at 101-02.      We also held that given the\n\nclear Congressional mandate of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d), the court\n\nplainly erred in delegating to the probation officer the discretion\n\nto order an unlimited number of drug tests. That statute \"requires\n\ncourts   to    determine      the   maximum    number    of   drug    tests      to   be\n\nperformed beyond the statutory minimum of three, with probation\n\nofficers permitted to decide the number of tests to be performed\n\nwithin the range established by the court.\"                  Id. at 106.\n\n              Although   my    brethren       agree   with    Meléndez-Santana's\n\nprincipal     holding    --    that   the     district    court      in   that    case\n\nimproperly delegated its authority to set certain drug testing\n\nconditions -- they are chagrined by the court's approach. That is,\n\nthey fault the court for finding \"structural error\" and for giving\n\n\"lip service to plain error review . . . without undertaking any\n\nfurther analysis.\"\n\n              However, if my brethren agree with Meléndez-Santana's\n\nholding -- that Section 3583 clearly imposes on the courts the duty\n\nto determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed --\n\nthen the statutory grant to the court must be read as exclusive\n\nbecause \"the imposition of a sentence, including any terms of\n\nprobation or supervised release, is a core judicial function.\"\n\nUnited States v. Johnson, 48 F.3d 806, 808 (4th Cir. 1995); see\n\nalso Ex parte United States, 242 U.S. 27, 41 (1916) (imposition of\n\npunishment is a judicial function); Whitehead v. United States, 155\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fF.2d 460, 462 (6th Cir. 1946) (\"[f]ixing the terms and conditions\n\nof probation is a judicial act which may not be delegated\"), cert.\n\ndenied, 329 U.S. 747 (1946).   Unlike my brethren, I believe that\n\ndelegating core sentencing decisions, like the one at issue here,\n\ninfects the criminal proceeding as a whole and implicates its\n\nfundamental fairness.   See, e.g., United States v. Mohammad, 53\n\nF.3d 1426, 1439 (7th Cir. 1995) (stating that the delegation of a\n\n\"serious sentencing decision from a judicial officer to another\n\ndeprives the defendant of a substantial right\" and constitutes a\n\n\"serious structural defect\" affecting the integrity of judicial\n\nproceedings).   In the context of determining the manner in which\n\nrestitution is to be paid, for example, a majority of our sister\n\ncourts have prohibited the delegation of core judicial functions to\n\nprobation officers.   See United States v. Porter, 41 F.3d 68 (2nd\n\nCir. 1994) (sentencing court cannot delegate decisions as to the\n\nscheduling and size of restitution installment payments); United\n\nStates v. Graham, 72 F.3d 352, 357 (3d Cir. 1995) (district court\n\n\"improperly delegated to the probation officer the determination of\n\nthe timing of the restitution installment payments\"); United States\n\nv. Johnson, 48 F.3d 806, 809 (4th Cir. 1995) (\"making decisions\n\nabout the amount of restitution . . . is a judicial function and\n\ntherefore is non-delegable\"); United States v. Albro, 32 F.3d 173\n\n(5th Cir. 1994) (although a court is free to receive and consider\n\nrecommendations from probation officer, the court itself must\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fdesignate the timing and amount of payments); United States v. Gio,\n\n7 F.3d 1279, 1292-93 (7th Cir. 1993) (district court may not, after\n\nfixing the amount of restitution, delegate ultimate authority for\n\ndetermining amounts of installments to probation officer); United\n\nStates v. McGlothlin, 249 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir. 2001) (district\n\ncourt must set the manner of payments and length of time over which\n\nrestitution payments shall be made); United States v. Overholt, 307\n\nF.3d 1231, 1255 (10th Cir. 2002) (delegation to the Bureau of\n\nPrisons and probation officer authority to set payment schedule of\n\nrestitution is \"improper and constitutes plain error\").\n\n             Under the same analysis, and contrary to my brethren's\n\nviews,   I   believe   that   similar   \"improvident   delegation\"   of   a\n\nsentencing decision is plainly erroneous per se. That is, allowing\n\na federal court to delegate its Article III responsibilities,\n\nespecially core sentencing decisions like the one at issue here,\n\nboth affects a \"defendant's substantial rights\" and \"seriously\n\nimpairs the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\" See, e.g., United States v. Pandiello, 184 F.3d 682,\n\n688 (7th Cir. 1999) (permitting a judge to delegate authority over\n\na \"core sentencing decision . . . deprives the defendant of a\n\nsubstantial right and constitutes a serious structural defect\n\naffecting the integrity of the judicial proceedings\") (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); Albro, 32 F.3d at 174 n. 1 (concluding\n\nthat \"the unauthorized delegation of sentencing authority from an\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fArticle III judicial officer to a non-Article III official affects\n\nsubstantial rights and constitutes plain error\" in the context of\n\nrestitution payments);   Overholt, 307 F.3d at 1255 (holding that\n\ndelegation to probation officer \"is improper and constitutes plain\n\nerror\").\n\n           In sum, I believe that Meléndez-Santana was correctly\n\ndecided.   Delegating core sentencing functions, such as the one at\n\nissue here, erodes the judiciary's role under Article III and, as\n\nsuch, constitutes plain error by violating defendant's substantial\n\nrights and affecting the reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f",

On appeal, Padilla advances three claims, one of which has merit and, under existing circuit precedent, justifies modification of his sentence. The other two claims lack merit. We consider the three claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Denial of Motion to Dismiss</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Padilla contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on Commerce Clause grounds. That motion was based on his reading of the decisions in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <i>United States v. Emerson,</i> 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir.2001), <i>cert. denied,</i> 536 U.S. 907, 122 S.Ct. 2362, 153 L.Ed.2d 184 (2002). We are not free to revisit the <i>Lopez</i> claim because this court already has rejected it in prior cases. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Colon Osorio,</i> 360 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Padilla's claim that <i>Emerson</i> provides a basis for dismissal on Commerce Clause grounds. In doing so, we adopt the rationale of the court that spawned the <i>Emerson</i> decision. <i>See United States v. Darrington,</i> 351 F.3d 632, 634 (5th Cir.2003) (rejecting <i>Emerson</i> challenge in the context of a section 922(g)(1) prosecution), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2429, 158 L.Ed.2d 994 (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Refusal to Give Jury Instruction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Padilla claims that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to give a requested instruction addressing whether the gun he possessed &#8212; which lacked a firing pin assembly and magazine &#8212; was a \"firearm\" within the meaning of the statute of conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3) (defining the term). We discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of the matter is that the law amply justifies the instruction actually given by the lower court. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Brown,</i> 117 F.3d 353, 355 (7th Cir.1997) (construing the corresponding sentencing guideline definition and collecting cases). Padilla has cited no relevant legal authority in support of a contrary position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Delegation of Sentencing Authority</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Padilla asserts for the first time that the district court erred when it allowed the probation officer to determine the number of drug tests he must undergo during his supervised release term. The government confesses error; it concedes that this was an improper delegation of judicial authority. <i>See United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93, 103, 106 (1st Cir.2003) (construing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)). It nonetheless suggests that we need not correct the unpreserved error because it neither constitutes a miscarriage of justice nor seriously affects the integrity of the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> in which a panel of this court corrected the same kind of unpreserved error without conducting the usual plain error review. <i>See id.</i> at 106 (vacating drug testing condition and remanding for resentencing because 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) \"requires courts to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed\"); <i>see also Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that in a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels are bound by prior panel decisions); <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991) (same). The fact that there were multiple errors in <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> making resentencing necessary in any event, is not sufficient to distinguish that decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the government invites us to limit the number of drug tests to the minimum (three) required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d). To this end, it cites our recent decisions in <i>United States v. Tulloch,</i> 380 F.3d 8, 10 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam), and <i>United States v. Lewandowski,</i> 372 F.3d 470, 471 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam). Those decisions are inapposite here, and, thus, we decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Lewandowski,</i> we construed a supervised release condition mandating \"at least\" three drug tests to require only three tests. <i>See id.</i> There, however, the district court had not expressly delegated to the probation officer the power to decide whether to administer more tests. <i>Id.</i> We nonetheless adopted a limiting construction in order to resolve an ambiguity in the court's order and ensure that it could not be interpreted to contain an implied delegation of such authority. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Tulloch</i> is distinguishable for a different reason. There, we directed the district court to amend one defendant's supervised release condition, which mandated only a single drug test, to conform to the statutory requirement that no fewer than three tests be performed. <i>See Tulloch,</i> 380 F.3d at 10 n. 1. With regard to the other defendant, we instructed the court to conform its written judgment to its previously announced oral judgment (which set the number of drug tests at three). <i>See id.</i> The case at hand does not share the central characteristics of either <i>Lewandowski</i> or <i>Tulloch.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, Padilla has not objected to the government's suggestion that we adopt a limiting construction here, and, conceivably, that might represent a reasonable and efficient way to correct an express misdelegation of this kind. But that judgment should be made on the ground, as it were, by the sentencing court. On this record, which indicates that Padilla regularly used marijuana for some period of time prior to his arrest for the offense of conviction, we prefer to let the sentencing court decide how to rectify the error. Accordingly, we vacate the challenged condition and remand to the district court for further proceedings. If it so chooses, the court may amend its sentencing judgment to require three drug tests or, after holding a new hearing at which Padilla would have the right to appear with counsel, may specify some higher maximum number of drug tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>We vacate the sentence to the extent it improperly delegates the district court's authority to determine the maximum number of drug tests required during the appellant's supervised release term. We remand to the district court for further action consistent with this opinion. In all other respects, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LEVIN H. CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge and SELYA, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that <i>United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir.2003), controls the disposition of this case and that, under its principal holding, an improper delegation of the authority to set certain drug-testing conditions occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 106. We do not question the soundness of that holding. We write separately, however, to express our discomfiture with the approach that the <i>Melendez-Santana</i> panel took in determining what consequences attended the delegation error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the <i>Melendez-Santana</i> panel gave lip service to plain error review, it vacated the challenged portion of the judgment upon the finding of error simpliciter, without undertaking any further analysis. <i>See id.</i> In so doing, the panel effectively treated the trial court's mistake as one of \"the limited class of structural errors\" that warrant correction regardless of other considerations. <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 632, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, that approach &#8212; which portends automatic reversal of every delegation error &#8212; is incorrect. A finding of structural error assumes the existence of a \"defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\" <i>Arizona v. Fulminante,</i> 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991); <i>see also United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2003). And some (perhaps most) structural errors deserve careful, individualized attention. The Supreme Court recently stated that, even with respect to <i>preserved</i> errors, only \"certain structural errors undermining the fairness of a criminal proceeding <i>as a whole</i> ... require[] reversal without regard to the mistake's effect on the proceeding.\" <i>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2339, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (emphasis supplied). As that passage indicates, the sub-category of \"automatic reversal\" errors has been reserved for the most pervasive and debilitating constitutional deprivations, such as a total withholding of the right to counsel at trial, a denial of the right to self-representation at trial, and the specter of a biased judge presiding over a case. <i>See Fulminante,</i> 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. 1246 (collecting cases). Such errors affect \"[t]he entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end.\" <i>Id.</i> at 309, 111 S.Ct. 1246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, a delegation error of the kind at issue here (and in <i>Melendez-Santana</i>) affects only a single aspect (drug testing on supervised release) of a single phase (sentencing) of a criminal proceeding. Such a bevue, although serious, simply does not belong in the select company of structural errors. <i>Cf. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. at 632-33, 122 S.Ct. 1781 (finding that, in the context of sentencing, a particular <i>Apprendi</i> error did not sink to the level of a structural defect); <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 17 (similar). Because the delegation error neither infects the criminal proceeding as a whole nor implicates its fundamental fairness, such an error is non-structural. This means that, even when preserved, relief for such an error must be \"tied in some way to prejudicial effect, and the standard phrased as `error that affects substantial rights,' used in [Criminal] Rule 52, has previously been taken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\" Dominguez Benitez, 124 S.Ct. at 2339.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> the defendant failed to object at the time of sentencing to the improper delegation of judicial authority. Hence, this non-structural error arguably was waived and, if so, it cannot be resurrected on appeal. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002) (\"A party waives a right when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it.\"). Even were we to take the view most favorable to the defendant and assume that his procedural default at sentencing was the result of oversight or inadvertence, the delegation error would have to be regarded as forfeited and, as such, would engender plain error review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See id.; United States v. Vazquez-Molina,</i> 389 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir.2004)..</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain error standard of review presents a formidable barrier to a defaulting party. To survive plain error review, a litigant must demonstrate \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001); <i>accord United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The <i>Melendez-Santana</i> panel opted for automatic reversal and abjured any application of this four-part algorithm. Thus we are constrained by that precedent to forgo its application here. <i>See United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that in a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels are bound by prior panel decisions).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we deem ourselves bound, on the authority of <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> to join in the opinion vacating the challenged drug-testing order. Were we at liberty to undertake full-blown plain error review, however, we doubt very much that Padilla could prevail; the drug-testing order here at issue appears neither to affect the defendant's substantial rights nor to impugn the integrity of the proceedings below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because this is so and because we believe, with all due respect, that <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> is wrongly decided both with regard to its treatment of the delegation error as structural and with regard to its conclusion that such errors warrant automatic reversal, we write separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the problem we have encountered here is likely to be a recurrent one. Equally as important, the question of which errors are structural and which are not is one of great salience in the criminal law. We would welcome an opportunity to have the full court address this issue and we urge the government to give serious consideration to filing a petition for en banc review. Unless and until this aspect of the <i>Melendez-Santana</i> decision is corrected, however, we must concur in the judgment automatically vacating the challenged condition and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Even if the unpreserved delegation error were structural (a proposition that we reject), plain error review would still apply<i>See Johnson v.

[T]his responsibility requires `both the appearance and the reality of control by Article III judges over the interpretation, declaration, and application of federal law' to maintain `the essential, constitutional role of the judiciary.'\" 353 F.3d at 101 (citing <i>Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic of Am., Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc.,</i> 725 F.2d 537, 544 (9th Cir.1984)(Kennedy, J.)). An \"improvident delegation\" of judicial authority to a probation officer can erode the judiciary's \"essential role\"; thus, separation of powers forbids courts from delegating their Article III responsibilities. <i>Id.</i> Although this \"general principle does not ... prohibit courts from using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions,\" courts must \"retain[ ] and exercise [] ultimate responsibility.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). We therefore held that the court improvidently delegated its judicial function in <i>Melendez-Santana</i> because, instead of simply charging the probation officer with managing the administrative details of defendant's drug treatment, the court delegated its judicial function of deciding whether defendant had to undergo treatment. <i>Id.</i> at 101-02. We also held that given the clear Congressional mandate of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), the court plainly erred in delegating to the probation officer the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests. That statute \"requires courts to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the statutory minimum of three, with probation officers permitted to decide the number of tests to be performed within the range established by the court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although my brethren agree with <i>Melendez-Santana's</i> principal holding &#8212; that the district court in that case improperly delegated its authority to set certain drug testing conditions &#8212; they are chagrined by the court's approach. That is, they fault the court for finding \"structural error\" and for giving \"lip service to plain error review ... without undertaking any further analysis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if my brethren agree with <i>Melendez-Santana's</i> holding &#8212; that Section 3583 clearly imposes on the courts the duty to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed &#8212; then the statutory grant to the court must be read as exclusive because \"the imposition of a sentence, including any terms of probation or supervised release, is a core judicial function.\" <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 48 F.3d 806, 808 (4th Cir.1995); <i>see also Ex parte United States,</i> 242 U.S. 27, 41, 37 S.Ct. 72, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916) (imposition of punishment is a judicial function); <i>Whitehead v. United States,</i> 155 F.2d 460, 462 (6th Cir.1946) (\"[f]ixing the terms and conditions of probation is a judicial act which may not be delegated\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 329 U.S. 747, 67 S.Ct. 66, 91 L.Ed. 644 (1946). Unlike my brethren, I believe that delegating core sentencing decisions, like the one at issue here, infects the criminal proceeding as a whole and implicates its fundamental fairness. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mohammad,</i> 53 F.3d 1426, 1439 (7th Cir.1995) (stating that the delegation of a \"serious sentencing decision from a judicial officer to another deprives the defendant of a substantial right\" and constitutes a \"serious structural defect\" affecting the integrity of judicial proceedings). In the context of determining the manner in which restitution is to be paid, for example, a majority of our sister courts have prohibited the delegation of core judicial functions to probation officers. <i>See United States v. Porter,</i> 41 F.3d 68 (2nd Cir.1994) (sentencing court cannot delegate decisions as to the scheduling and size of restitution installment payments); <i>United States v. Graham,</i> 72 F.3d 352, 357 (3d Cir.1995) (district court \"improperly delegated to the probation officer the determination of the timing of the restitution installment payments\"); <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 48 F.3d 806, 809 (4th Cir.1995) (\"making decisions about the amount of restitution ... is a judicial function and therefore is non-delegable\"); <i>United States v. Albro,</i> 32 F.3d 173 (5th Cir.1994) (although a court is free to receive and consider recommendations from probation officer, the court itself must designate the timing and amount of payments); <i>United States v. Gio,</i> 7 F.3d 1279, 1292-93 (7th Cir.1993) (district court may not, after fixing the amount of restitution, delegate ultimate authority for determining amounts of installments to probation officer); <i>United States v. McGlothlin,</i> 249 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2001) (district court must set the manner of payments and length of time over which restitution payments shall be made); <i>United States v. Overholt,</i> 307 F.3d 1231, 1255 (10th Cir.2002) (delegation to the Bureau of Prisons and probation officer authority to set payment schedule of restitution is \"improper and constitutes plain error\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the same analysis, and contrary to my brethren's views, I believe that similar \"improvident delegation\" of a sentencing decision is plainly erroneous <i>per se.</i> That is, allowing a federal court to delegate its Article III responsibilities, especially core sentencing decisions like the one at issue here, both affects a \"defendant's substantial rights\" and \"seriously impairs the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Pandiello,</i> 184 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir.1999) (permitting a judge to delegate authority over a \"core sentencing decision... deprives the defendant of a substantial right and constitutes a serious structural defect affecting the integrity of the judicial proceedings\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Albro,</i> 32 F.3d at 174 n. 1 (concluding that \"the unauthorized delegation of sentencing authority from an Article III judicial officer to a non-Article III official affects substantial rights and constitutes plain error\" in the context of restitution payments); <i>Overholt,</i> 307 F.3d at 1255 (holding that delegation to probation officer \"is improper and constitutes plain error\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I believe that <i>Melendez-Santana</i> was correctly decided. Delegating core sentencing functions, such as the one at issue here, erodes the judiciary's role under Article III and, as such, constitutes plain error by violating defendant's substantial rights and affecting the reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

There, we directed the district court to amend one defendant's supervised release condition, which mandated only a single drug test, to conform to the statutory requirement that no fewer than three tests be performed. <i>See Tulloch,</i> 380 F.3d at 10 n. 1. With regard to the other defendant, we instructed the court to conform its written judgment to its previously announced oral judgment (which set the number of drug tests at three). <i>See id.</i> The case at hand does not share the central characteristics of either <i>Lewandowski</i> or <i>Tulloch.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, Padilla has not objected to the government's suggestion that we adopt a limiting construction here, and, conceivably, that might represent a reasonable and efficient way to correct an express misdelegation of this kind. But that judgment should be made on the ground, as it were, by the sentencing court. On this record, which indicates that Padilla regularly used marijuana for some period of time prior to his arrest for the offense of conviction, we prefer to let the sentencing court decide how to rectify the error. Accordingly, we vacate the challenged condition and remand to the district court for further proceedings. If it so chooses, the court may amend its sentencing judgment to require three drug tests or, after holding a new hearing at which Padilla would have the right to appear with counsel, may specify some higher maximum number of drug tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>We vacate the sentence to the extent it improperly delegates the district court's authority to determine the maximum number of drug tests required during the appellant's supervised release term.

And some (perhaps most) structural errors deserve careful, individualized attention. The Supreme Court recently stated that, even with respect to <i>preserved</i> errors, only \"certain structural errors undermining the fairness of a criminal proceeding <i>as a whole</i> ... require[] reversal without regard to the mistake's effect on the proceeding.\" <i>United States v.

As that passage indicates, the sub-category of \"automatic reversal\" errors has been reserved for the most pervasive and debilitating constitutional deprivations, such as a total withholding of the right to counsel at trial, a denial of the right to self-representation at trial, and the specter of a biased judge presiding over a case. <i>See Fulminante,</i> 499 U.S. at 309-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such a bevue, although serious, simply does not belong in the select company of structural errors. <i>Cf.

Because the delegation error neither infects the criminal proceeding as a whole nor implicates its fundamental fairness, such an error is non-structural. This means that, even when preserved, relief for such an error must be \"tied in some way to prejudicial effect, and the standard phrased as `error that affects substantial rights,' used in [Criminal] Rule 52, has previously been taken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\" Dominguez Benitez, 124 S.Ct. at 2339.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> the defendant failed to object at the time of sentencing to the improper delegation of judicial authority. Hence, this non-structural error arguably was waived and, if so, it cannot be resurrected on appeal. <i>See United States v.

[T]his responsibility requires `both the appearance and the reality of control by Article III judges over the interpretation, declaration, and application of federal law' to maintain `the essential, constitutional role of the judiciary.'\" 353 F.3d at 101 (citing <i>Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic of Am., Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429819\"><a href=\"/opinion/429819/pacemaker-diagnostic-clinic-of-america-inc-a-corporation-plaintiff-/\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 544 (9th Cir.1984)(Kennedy, J.)). An \"improvident delegation\" of judicial authority to a probation officer can erode the judiciary's \"essential role\"; thus, separation of powers forbids courts from delegating their Article III responsibilities. <i>Id.</i> Although this \"general principle does not ... prohibit courts from using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions,\" courts must \"retain[ ] and exercise [] ultimate responsibility.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted). We therefore held that the court improvidently delegated its judicial function in <i>Melendez-Santana</i> because, instead of simply charging the probation officer with managing the administrative details of defendant's drug treatment, the court delegated its judicial function of deciding whether defendant had to undergo treatment. <i>Id.</i> at 101-02. We also held that given the clear Congressional mandate of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), the court plainly erred in delegating to the probation officer the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests. That statute \"requires courts to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the statutory minimum of three, with probation officers permitted to decide the number of tests to be performed within the range established by the court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 106.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although my brethren agree with <i>Melendez-Santana's</i> principal holding &#8212; that the district court in that case improperly delegated its authority to set certain drug testing conditions &#8212; they are chagrined by the court's approach. That is, they fault the court for finding \"structural error\" and for giving \"lip service to plain error review ... without undertaking any further analysis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, if my brethren agree with <i>Melendez-Santana's</i> holding &#8212; that Section 3583 clearly imposes on the courts the duty to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed &#8212; then the statutory grant to the court must be read as exclusive because \"the imposition of a sentence, including any terms of probation or supervised release, is a core judicial function.\" <i>United States v.

Unlike my brethren, I believe that delegating core sentencing decisions, like the one at issue here, infects the criminal proceeding as a whole and implicates its fundamental fairness. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

In the context of determining the manner in which restitution is to be paid, for example, a majority of our sister courts have prohibited the delegation of core judicial functions to probation officers. <i>See United States v.
