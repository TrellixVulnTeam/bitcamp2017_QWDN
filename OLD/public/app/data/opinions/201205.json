Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Dawn E.

Jimmy Taveras challenges the\n\ndistrict court's revocation of his supervised release without\n\ngiving him the opportunity to confront the complaining witness\n\nwhose account of an alleged violation of state law was the basis of\n\nthe court's revocation decision.      Instead, the court relied on\n\nTaveras's probation officer to present a hearsay account of the\n\nalleged violation.    Concluding that the reliance by the district\n\ncourt on this second-hand account violated Taveras's confrontation\n\nrights under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure, we vacate the revocation of his supervised release.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          We draw our recitation of the facts from the district\n\ncourt record.   On November 2, 1998, Taveras pleaded guilty to one\n\ncount of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 846 and\n\ndistribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 841.     He was\n\nsentenced to thirty-seven months of imprisonment and four years of\n\nsupervised release.     The sentencing court imposed a number of\n\nconditions of supervised release, including a prohibition on his\n\npossession of a firearm and a requirement that Taveras \"not commit\n\nanother federal, state, or local crime.\"\n\n          Approximately three weeks after he was released from this\n\nfirst period of incarceration, Taveras was arrested again and was\n\ncharged with witness tampering for verbally assaulting a government\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fwitness who had testified against a Massachusetts gang with whom\n\nTaveras was     allegedly   associated.     On   October   18,   2000,   the\n\ndistrict court revoked Taveras's supervised release and sentenced\n\nhim to twelve months and one day of imprisonment and thirty-six\n\nmonths of supervised release.       He was released from this second\n\nperiod of incarceration on June 23, 2001, and was arrested again\n\nApril 25, 2003, this time by the Lawrence, Massachusetts police for\n\nassault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm without a\n\nlicense.      Although the state charges were eventually dismissed\n\nbecause the complaining witness refused to testify, the district\n\ncourt held supervised release revocation proceedings based on this\n\narrest at the request of Taveras's probation officer, Carmen\n\nWallace, on July 29, 2003 and August 8, 2003.1\n\n             Claiming that the complaining witness could not be found\n\nto testify, the Government announced its intention to rely on\n\nprobation officer Wallace to provide a hearsay account of the\n\nalleged assault.     Taveras moved for dismissal of the proceedings\n\njust before Wallace testified, arguing that the Government violated\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.22 (because the government had not given him a\n\n\n     1\n      The court suspended the proceedings on July 29 to allow the\ncourt and the parties to research the definition of \"assault with\na deadly weapon\" and \"possession of a firearm\" under Massachusetts\nlaw.\n     2\n         Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a) states:\n\n     After a witness other than the defendant has testified on\n     direct examination, the court, on motion of a party who\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcopy of the statement of the complaining witness in its possession)\n\nand Rule 32.13 (by not making the complaining witness available for\n\ncross-examination).    The    district   court   overruled   the   first\n\nobjection, noting that Rule 26.2 only applies to witnesses and\n\nstating that the complaining witness was not going to be a witness.\n\nIt overruled the second objection as well, observing that Taveras\n\nwas free to call the complaining witness to the witness stand if he\n\nwanted to examine her but that Rule 32.1 did not require the\n\nGovernment to call a witness simply so that Taveras could cross-\n\nexamine her.\n\n          Wallace took the stand and recounted two conversations\n\nthat she had with the complaining witness, a woman who identified\n\nherself as Elsa Pabon.       The first communication was a ten to\n\nfifteen minute telephone conversation that occurred on the morning\n\nof April 16, 2003.    Pabon told her that Taveras, whom she knew\n\n\n\n\n     did not call the witness, must order an attorney for the\n     government or the defendant and the defendant's attorney\n     to produce, for the examination and use of the moving\n     party, any statement of the witness that is in their\n     possession and that relates to the subject matter of the\n     witness's testimony.\n     3\n      Taveras mis-spoke during the hearing, claiming that Rule\n32.1(a)(2)(D) entitled him to confront adverse witnesses.      That\nprovision, which establishes the defendant's rights at a supervised\nrelease revocation hearing, was moved to 32.1(b)(2)(C) in 2002 and\ncurrently reads: \"The person is entitled to . . . an opportunity to\nappear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless\nthe court determines that the interest of justice does not require\nthe witness to appear.\"\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fbecause he was dating her cousin, had pulled up next to her car on\n\nthe previous evening and had pointed a black semi-automatic handgun\n\nat her.       She said that he was upset that Pabon's sister had broken\n\nup with Taveras's brother and told Pabon to \"tell [her] sister's\n\nboyfriend this is what [he has] for him\" as he pointed the gun at\n\nher.       She said that she felt threatened by Taveras and was in fear\n\nfor her safety.        Wallace said that Pabon was highly emotional and\n\nthat Pabon said that she had been trying to reach Wallace all\n\nmorning because she knew that Wallace was Taveras's probation\n\nofficer. Wallace encouraged Pabon to contact the police, and Pabon\n\ndid so after the end of this phone conversation.\n\n               The second conversation occurred when Wallace visited\n\nPabon and her mother at Pabon's home on April 28, 2003.             Pabon told\n\nWallace that she was very afraid of Taveras and his family and\n\nfriends because she knew what they were capable of doing.              She had\n\nreceived phone calls from Taveras's brother and Taveras's lawyer on\n\nthe day that he was arrested, asking why she was pursuing the\n\nmatter.       Although Wallace tried to get a written statement from\n\nPabon, she refused to give one, saying that Wallace could not\n\nguarantee her safety or the safety of her children.4\n\n               After   Wallace   visited    her   house,   Pabon   submitted   a\n\nwritten statement to the local prosecutor, saying that the whole\n\n\n\n       4\n      When asked how many children Pabon has, Wallace responded: \"I\nbelieve she has two or three. I'm not too sure.\"\n\n                                      -5-\n\fmatter was a big misunderstanding and that she did not want to\n\npursue any charges against Taveras. Having lost their witness, the\n\nCommonwealth dropped its charges. Although Wallace went to Pabon's\n\nhouse to bring her to the federal revocation proceedings, she saw\n\nthat Pabon's name had been removed from the mailbox and a neighbor\n\nsaid that she did not believe that Pabon lived there any longer.\n\n           The   Government   rested      after   Wallace    presented   this\n\naccount.   Taveras did not present any witnesses.            However, during\n\nhis closing argument, he repeated his objection to the court's\n\nconsideration of Wallace's hearsay testimony.\n\n           Noting that Taveras failed to object to Wallace's hearsay\n\ntestimony while she was on the stand and that the testimony was\n\nadmissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay\n\nrule, the court considered Wallace's testimony for the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted in Pabon's account of her confrontation with\n\nTaveras.   It found Pabon's story, as delivered by Wallace, to be\n\ncredible, and found that Taveras had committed the charged crimes\n\nof assault and assault with a dangerous weapon.              It then revoked\n\nhis   supervised   release    and   sentenced     him   to    18   months   of\n\nimprisonment and an additional 12 months of supervised release.5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      Generally, supervised release revocation proceedings follow\na two-step process.     The court first determines whether the\ndefendant violated his or her conditions of release and then it\nconsiders whether that violation merits revocation. See 18 U.S.C.\nยง 3583(e).\n\n                                    -6-\n\f                                      II.\n\n               As noted, Taveras supported his claim to cross-examine\n\nPabon     by    invoking   Rule   32.1(b)(2)(C),   which    provides   that   a\n\ndefendant is entitled at a revocation hearing to, inter alia, \"an\n\nopportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse\n\nwitness unless the court determines that the interest of justice\n\ndoes not require the witness to appear.\"                   Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32.1(b)(2)(C).        The district court admitted Wallace's hearsay\n\ntestimony, rejecting Taveras's Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) cross-examination\n\nclaim.         Despite the district court's observation that Taveras\n\nfailed to object to Wallace's hearsay testimony while she was on\n\nthe stand, Taveras's objections before and after her testimony\n\ndemonstrate that he did not forfeit this claim below. Accordingly,\n\nwe review Taveras's argument that the district court should not\n\nhave admitted the hearsay testimony for abuse of discretion, United\n\nStates v. Tom, 330 F.3d 83, 92 (1st Cir. 2003), rather than plain\n\nerror.6\n\n               In conducting this review, we find some of the history of\n\nRule 32.1 relevant to Taveras's claim of error.                 The Advisory\n\n\n     6\n      On appeal, Taveras frames his argument in terms of the\nrequirements of constitutional due process rather than the\nrequirements of Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C). The grounding of Rule 32.1 in\nconstitutional due process (as we explain in the text above) makes\nour consideration of the rule appropriate on appeal despite the\nlabels used by Taveras. Moreover, we have a strong preference for\navoiding constitutional grounds when another ground of decision is\navailable. See, e.g., Santoni v. Potter, 369 F.3d 594, 598 n.5\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -7-\n\fCommittee    Notes   accompanying    the    1979    addition     and      the   2002\n\namendments to Rule 32.1 reveal that the procedural protections\n\nestablished by Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) were designed to track the due\n\nprocess rights established for parolees in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408\n\nU.S. 471 (1972).     See United States v. Correa-Torres, 326 F.3d 18,\n\n22-23 (1st Cir. 2003) (applying Morrissey and Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1\n\nin the supervised release context).         The Morrissey Court held that\n\nwhile   \"the   revocation    of   parole    is    not    part   of    a   criminal\n\nprosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in\n\nsuch a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations,\" defendants\n\nat these proceedings are still entitled to basic due process\n\nprotections.    408 U.S. at 480.      One of these rights is \"the right\n\nto confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing\n\nofficer     specifically     finds   good        cause    for    not      allowing\n\nconfrontation).\"     Id. at 489.\n\n            Citing Morrissey and its progeny, the Rules Advisory\n\nCommittee stated in its 2002 Committee Note that Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C)\n\n\"recognize[s] that the court should apply a balancing test at the\n\n[revocation]    hearing     itself   when    considering        the    releasee's\n\nasserted right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The court is to\n\nbalance the person's interest in the constitutionally guaranteed\n\nright to confrontation against the government's good cause for\n\ndenying it.\"    An important element of the good cause analysis is\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthe reliability of the evidence that the Government seeks to\n\nintroduce.7\n\n                 In an effort to establish the reliability of Wallace's\n\nhearsay testimony, the Government argued that the court could\n\naccept it         under   the    excited    utterance/spontaneous     declaration\n\nexception to the hearsay rule.              Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 815\n\n(1990) (\"Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where\n\nthe evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\").\n\nThat exception allows the admission of a statement relating to a\n\nstartling event or condition made while the declarant was under the\n\nstress of excitement caused by the event or condition.                 See United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 834 F.2d 218, 227-28 (1st Cir. 1987); Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 803(2).         \"The rationale underlying the 'excited utterance'\n\nexception is that excitement suspends the declarant's powers of\n\nreflection and fabrication, consequently minimizing the possibility\n\nthat       the   utterance      will   be   influenced   by   self   interest   and\n\ntherefore rendered unreliable.\"               United States v. Alexander, 331\n\nF.3d 116, 122 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see also United States v. Joy, 192 F.3d 761, 766\n\n(7th Cir. 1999) (\"This exception is premised on the belief that a\n\n\n\n       7\n      The Government's burden in producing the witness for cross-\nexamination is also frequently cited as part of the \"good cause\"\nanalysis. See, e.g., United States v. Zentgraf, 20 F.3d 903, 909\n(8th Cir. 1994). Since we conclude that the hearsay testimony was\nwholly unreliable and prejudicial, we need not consider the\ngovernment's burden of producing the witness in this case.\n\n                                            -9-\n\fperson is unlikely to fabricate lies (which presumably takes some\n\ndeliberate reflection) while his mind is preoccupied with the\n\nstress of an exciting event.\").         The time lapse in most excited\n\nutterance cases is usually a few seconds, see, e.g., United States\n\nv. Vazquez, 857 F.2d 857, 864 (1st Cir. 1988), or a few minutes,\n\nsee, e.g., Bailey, 834 F.2d at 228.         In extreme circumstances, we\n\nhave even accepted a delay of a few hours, see United States v.\n\nCruz, 156 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1998) (accepting testimony from a\n\nwoman   four   hours   after   the   shocking   incident   based    on   the\n\nassumption that she was still suffering trauma after she was beaten\n\nby the defendant).\n\n           The   delay   here    extended     well   beyond   the   limits\n\nestablished by our excited utterance precedents.              The alleged\n\nassault occurred on the night of April 15, but Pabon did not call\n\nWallace until the next morning. Furthermore, while Wallace did not\n\ntestify to the precise time that Pabon called, she did say that the\n\nwitness had been trying to reach her all morning, suggesting that\n\nthe two talked late in the morning.         Thus, the extended delay in\n\nthis case was long enough to allow Pabon to reflect on the alleged\n\nevents of the previous night and possibly to fabricate or alter the\n\nstory that she related to Wallace. Wallace's hearsay testimony did\n\nnot meet the requirements of the excited utterance exception to the\n\nhearsay rule.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Furthermore,        the   hearsay    testimony    presented     at   the\n\nrevocation hearing lacked other indicia of reliability.                   Pabon's\n\nstatement was neither written nor sworn, see United States v.\n\nComito, 177 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"Unsworn verbal\n\nallegations are, in general, the least reliable type of hearsay .\n\n. . .\"), and the Government failed to provide any corroborating\n\nevidence to support Pabon's accusation that Taveras pointed a gun\n\nat her.     Cf. United States v. Pratt, 52 F.3d 671, 675 (7th Cir.\n\n1995)   (accepting     a    police     officer's    hearsay     testimony    at    a\n\nsupervised release revocation hearing that was corroborated by\n\nwritten    reports    and    statements     of    the   victims,   surveillance\n\nphotographs,    and    other     physical       evidence);    United   States     v.\n\nKindred, 918 F.2d 485, 486-87 (5th Cir. 1990) (accepting hearsay\n\ntestimony    regarding      a   drug     test   when    the   defendant   neither\n\ncontested the allegations of drug use nor the accuracy of the\n\nurinalysis); United States v. McCallum, 677 F.2d 1024, 1026-27 (4th\n\nCir. 1982) (accepting written report from a defendant's caseworker\n\nat a revocation hearing that was partially corroborated by the\n\ndefendant's admissions).         Moreover, the Government did not provide\n\nany   background     details     about    Pabon    or   her   relationship       with\n\nTaveras.     This exchange between Taveras and Wallace at trial\n\nunderscores these deficiencies:\n\n            Q: You don't have any background history with\n            Elsa Pabon; do you?\n            A: No, I do not.\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f            Q: All right. Do you know whether she's got a\n            criminal history?\n            A: I do not.\n            Q: Do you know whether she has a habit of\n            lying?\n            A: I do not.\n            Q: And you also don't know whether there's any\n            history between her and the Taveras family,\n            any reason for her to lie about these charges?\n            A: I do not.\n\nWallace's involvement with Pabon was limited to a fifteen minute\n\nphone conversation and a short personal interview in which Pabon\n\nsaid that she did not wish to pursue charges against Taveras.\n\n            Given      the   unreliable     nature   of     Wallace's    hearsay\n\ntestimony, we conclude that the \"interest of justice\" did not\n\njustify    the    district    court's     decision   to   override      Taveras's\n\nqualified right to confrontation and that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion by admitting the hearsay testimony. Wallace's testimony\n\nwas the only evidence presented in support of the Government's\n\ncase,     and    the   prejudice   to     Taveras    from    the   absence     of\n\nconfrontation is unmistakable.            Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) mandates the\n\nexclusion of such unsupported hearsay under these circumstances.\n\nWithout the hearsay testimony, there was no case; therefore, we\n\nmust vacate the district court's judgment.8\n\n            Vacated.\n\n\n     8\n      Our disposition of this case does not require us to consider\nthe applicability of Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004)\nto supervised release revocation proceedings (an argument made by\nappellant for the first time at oral argument), nor does it require\nus to consider Taveras's argument that the government failed to\nprove all the necessary elements of an assault as that crime is\ndefined under Massachusetts law.\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

Instead, the court relied on Taveras's probation officer to present a hearsay account of the alleged violation. Concluding that the reliance by the district court on this second-hand account violated Taveras's confrontation rights under Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, we vacate the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw our recitation of the facts from the district court record. On November 2, 1998, Taveras pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 and distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841. He was sentenced to thirty-seven months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. The sentencing court imposed a number of conditions of supervised release, including a prohibition on his possession of a firearm and a requirement that Taveras \"not commit another federal, state, or local crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately three weeks after he was released from this first period of incarceration, Taveras was arrested again and was charged with witness tampering for verbally assaulting a government witness who had testified against a Massachusetts gang with whom Taveras was allegedly associated. On October 18, 2000, the district court revoked Taveras's supervised release and sentenced him to twelve months and one day of imprisonment and thirty-six months of supervised release. He was released from this second period of incarceration on June 23, 2001, and was arrested again April 25, 2003, this time by the Lawrence, Massachusetts police for assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm without a license. Although the state charges were eventually dismissed because the complaining witness refused to testify, the district court held supervised release revocation proceedings based on this arrest at the request of Taveras's probation officer, Carmen Wallace, on July 29, 2003 and August 8, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claiming that the complaining witness could not be found to testify, the Government announced its intention to rely on probation officer Wallace to provide a hearsay account of the alleged assault. Taveras moved for dismissal of the proceedings just before Wallace testified, arguing that the Government violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> (because the government had not given him a copy of the statement of the complaining witness in its possession) and Rule 32.1<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (by not making the complaining witness available for cross-examination). The district court overruled the first objection, noting that Rule 26.2 only applies to witnesses and stating that the complaining witness was not going to be a witness. It overruled the second objection as well, observing that Taveras was free to call the complaining witness to the witness stand if he wanted to examine her but that Rule 32.1 did not require the Government to call a witness simply so that Taveras could cross-examine her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wallace took the stand and recounted two conversations that she had with the complaining witness, a woman who identified herself as Elsa Pabon. The first communication was a ten to fifteen minute telephone conversation that occurred on the morning of April 16, 2003. Pabon told her that Taveras, whom she knew because he was dating her cousin, had pulled up next to her car on the previous evening and had pointed a black semi-automatic handgun at her. She said that he was upset that Pabon's sister had broken up with Taveras's brother and told Pabon to \"tell [her] sister's boyfriend this is what [he has] for him\" as he pointed the gun at her. She said that she felt threatened by Taveras and was in fear for her safety. Wallace said that Pabon was highly emotional and that Pabon said that she had been trying to reach Wallace all morning because she knew that Wallace was Taveras's probation officer. Wallace encouraged Pabon to contact the police, and Pabon did so after the end of this phone conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second conversation occurred when Wallace visited Pabon and her mother at Pabon's home on April 28, 2003. Pabon told Wallace that she was very afraid of Taveras and his family and friends because she knew what they were capable of doing. She had received phone calls from Taveras's brother and Taveras's lawyer on the day that he was arrested, asking why she was pursuing the matter. Although Wallace tried to get a written statement from Pabon, she refused to give one, saying that Wallace could not guarantee her safety or the safety of her children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Wallace visited her house, Pabon submitted a written statement to the local prosecutor, saying that the whole matter was a big misunderstanding and that she did not want to pursue any charges against Taveras. Having lost their witness, the Commonwealth dropped its charges. Although Wallace went to Pabon's house to bring her to the federal revocation proceedings, she saw that Pabon's name had been removed from the mailbox and a neighbor said that she did not believe that Pabon lived there any longer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government rested after Wallace presented this account. Taveras did not present any witnesses. However, during his closing argument, he repeated his objection to the court's consideration of Wallace's hearsay testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that Taveras failed to object to Wallace's hearsay testimony while she was on the stand and that the testimony was admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, the court considered Wallace's testimony for the truth of the matter asserted in Pabon's account of her confrontation with Taveras. It found Pabon's story, as delivered by Wallace, to be credible, and found that Taveras had committed the charged crimes of assault and assault with a dangerous weapon. It then revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months of imprisonment and an additional 12 months of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, Taveras supported his claim to cross-examine Pabon by invoking Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C), which provides that a defendant is entitled at a revocation hearing to, <i>inter alia,</i> \"an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(C). The district court admitted Wallace's hearsay testimony, rejecting Taveras's Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) cross-examination claim. Despite the district court's observation that Taveras failed to object to Wallace's hearsay testimony while she was on the stand, Taveras's objections before and after her testimony demonstrate that he did not forfeit this claim below. Accordingly, we review Taveras's argument that the district court should not have admitted the hearsay testimony for abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 92 (1st Cir.2003), rather than plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conducting this review, we find some of the history of Rule 32.1 relevant to Taveras's claim of error. The Advisory Committee Notes accompanying the 1979 addition and the 2002 amendments to Rule 32.1 reveal that the procedural protections established by Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) were designed to track the due process rights established for parolees in <i>Morrissey v. Brewer,</i> 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). <i>See United States v. Correa-Torres,</i> 326 F.3d 18, 22-23 (1st Cir.2003) (applying <i>Morrissey</i> and Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1 in the supervised release context). The <i>Morrissey</i> Court held that while \"the revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations,\" defendants at these proceedings are still entitled to basic due process protections. 408 U.S. at 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593. One of these rights is \"the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation).\" <i>Id.</i> at 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing <i>Morrissey</i> and its progeny, the Rules Advisory Committee stated in its 2002 Committee Note that Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) \"recognize[s] that the court should apply a balancing test at the [revocation] hearing itself when considering the releasee's asserted right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The court is to balance the person's interest in the constitutionally guaranteed right to confrontation against the government's good cause for denying it.\" An important element of the good cause analysis is the reliability of the evidence that the Government seeks to introduce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to establish the reliability of Wallace's hearsay testimony, the Government argued that the court could accept it under the excited utterance/spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule. <i>Idaho v. Wright,</i> 497 U.S. 805, 815, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) (\"Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"). That exception allows the admission of a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. <i>See United States v. Bailey,</i> 834 F.2d 218, 227-28 (1st Cir.1987); Fed.R.Evid. 803(2). \"The rationale underlying the `excited utterance' exception is that excitement suspends the declarant's powers of reflection and fabrication, consequently minimizing the possibility that the utterance will be influenced by self interest and therefore rendered unreliable.\" <i>United States v. Alexander,</i> 331 F.3d 116, 122 (D.C.Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also United States v. Joy,</i> 192 F.3d 761, 766 (7th Cir.1999) (\"This exception is premised on the belief that a person is unlikely to fabricate lies (which presumably takes some deliberate reflection) while his mind is preoccupied with the stress of an exciting event.\"). The time lapse in most excited utterance cases is usually a few seconds, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Vazquez,</i> 857 F.2d 857, 864 (1st Cir.1988), or a few minutes, <i>see, e.g., Bailey,</i> 834 F.2d at 228. In extreme circumstances, we have even accepted a delay of a few hours, <i>see United States v. Cruz,</i> 156 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir.1998) (accepting testimony from a woman four hours after the shocking incident based on the assumption that she was still suffering trauma after she was beaten by the defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The delay here extended well beyond the limits established by our excited utterance precedents. The alleged assault occurred on the night of April 15, but Pabon did not call Wallace until the next morning. Furthermore, while Wallace did not testify to the precise time that Pabon called, she did say that the witness had been trying to reach her all morning, suggesting that the two talked late in the morning. Thus, the extended delay in this case was long enough to allow Pabon to reflect on the alleged events of the previous night and possibly to fabricate or alter the story that she related to Wallace. Wallace's hearsay testimony did not meet the requirements of the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the hearsay testimony presented at the revocation hearing lacked other indicia of reliability. Pabon's statement was neither written nor sworn, <i>see United States v. Comito,</i> 177 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.1999) (\"Unsworn verbal allegations are, in general, the least reliable type of hearsay....\"), and the Government failed to provide <i>any</i> corroborating evidence to support Pabon's accusation that Taveras pointed a gun at her. <i>Cf. United States v. Pratt,</i> 52 F.3d 671, 675 (7th Cir.1995) (accepting a police officer's hearsay testimony at a supervised release revocation hearing that was corroborated by written reports and statements of the victims, surveillance photographs, and other physical evidence); <i>United States v. Kindred,</i> 918 F.2d 485, 486-87 (5th Cir.1990) (accepting hearsay testimony regarding a drug test when the defendant neither contested the allegations of drug use nor the accuracy of the urinalysis); <i>United States v. McCallum,</i> 677 F.2d 1024, 1026-27 (4th Cir.1982) (accepting written report from a defendant's caseworker at a revocation hearing that was partially corroborated by the defendant's admissions). Moreover, the Government did not provide any background details about Pabon or her relationship with Taveras. This exchange between Taveras and Wallace at trial underscores these deficiencies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: You don't have any background history with Elsa Pabon; do you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No, I do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: All right.

Wallace's testimony was the only evidence presented in support of the Government's case, and the prejudice to Taveras from the absence of confrontation is unmistakable. Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) mandates the exclusion of such unsupported hearsay under these circumstances. Without the hearsay testimony, there was no case; therefore, we must vacate the district court's judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court suspended the proceedings on July 29 to allow the court and the parties to research the definition of \"assault with a deadly weapon\" and \"possession of a firearm\" under Massachusetts law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2(a) states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an attorney for the government or the defendant and the defendant's attorney to produce, for the examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is in their possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness's testimony.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Taveras misspoke during the hearing, claiming that Rule 32.1(a)(2)(D) entitled him to confront adverse witnesses. That provision, which establishes the defendant's rights at a supervised release revocation hearing, was moved to 32.1(b)(2)(C) in 2002 and currently reads: \"The person is entitled to ... an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> When asked how many children Pabon has, Wallace responded: \"I believe she has two or three.

The grounding of Rule 32.1 in constitutional due process (as we explain in the text above) makes our consideration of the rule appropriate on appeal despite the labels used by Taveras. Moreover, we have a strong preference for avoiding constitutional grounds when another ground of decision is available<i>See, e.g., Santoni v.

Zentgraf,</i> 20 F.3d 906, 909 (8th Cir.1994). Since we conclude that the hearsay testimony was wholly unreliable and prejudicial, we need not consider the government's burden of producing the witness in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Our disposition of this case does not require us to consider the applicability of<i>Crawford v.

On November 2, 1998, Taveras pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 and distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841.

On October 18, 2000, the district court revoked Taveras's supervised release and sentenced him to twelve months and one day of imprisonment and thirty-six months of supervised release. He was released from this second period of incarceration on June 23, 2001, and was arrested again April 25, 2003, this time by the Lawrence, Massachusetts police for assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm without a license. Although the state charges were eventually dismissed because the complaining witness refused to testify, the district court held supervised release revocation proceedings based on this arrest at the request of Taveras's probation officer, Carmen Wallace, on July 29, 2003 and August 8, 2003.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claiming that the complaining witness could not be found to testify, the Government announced its intention to rely on probation officer Wallace to provide a hearsay account of the alleged assault.

The first communication was a ten to fifteen minute telephone conversation that occurred on the morning of April 16, 2003. Pabon told her that Taveras, whom she knew because he was dating her cousin, had pulled up next to her car on the previous evening and had pointed a black semi-automatic handgun at her. She said that he was upset that Pabon's sister had broken up with Taveras's brother and told Pabon to \"tell [her] sister's boyfriend this is what [he has] for him\" as he pointed the gun at her. She said that she felt threatened by Taveras and was in fear for her safety. Wallace said that Pabon was highly emotional and that Pabon said that she had been trying to reach Wallace all morning because she knew that Wallace was Taveras's probation officer. Wallace encouraged Pabon to contact the police, and Pabon did so after the end of this phone conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second conversation occurred when Wallace visited Pabon and her mother at Pabon's home on April 28, 2003. Pabon told Wallace that she was very afraid of Taveras and his family and friends because she knew what they were capable of doing. She had received phone calls from Taveras's brother and Taveras's lawyer on the day that he was arrested, asking why she was pursuing the matter. Although Wallace tried to get a written statement from Pabon, she refused to give one, saying that Wallace could not guarantee her safety or the safety of her children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Wallace visited her house, Pabon submitted a written statement to the local prosecutor, saying that the whole matter was a big misunderstanding and that she did not want to pursue any charges against Taveras. Having lost their witness, the Commonwealth dropped its charges. Although Wallace went to Pabon's house to bring her to the federal revocation proceedings, she saw that Pabon's name had been removed from the mailbox and a neighbor said that she did not believe that Pabon lived there any longer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government rested after Wallace presented this account. Taveras did not present any witnesses. However, during his closing argument, he repeated his objection to the court's consideration of Wallace's hearsay testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that Taveras failed to object to Wallace's hearsay testimony while she was on the stand and that the testimony was admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, the court considered Wallace's testimony for the truth of the matter asserted in Pabon's account of her confrontation with Taveras. It found Pabon's story, as delivered by Wallace, to be credible, and found that Taveras had committed the charged crimes of assault and assault with a dangerous weapon. It then revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 18 months of imprisonment and an additional 12 months of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, Taveras supported his claim to cross-examine Pabon by invoking Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C), which provides that a defendant is entitled at a revocation hearing to, <i>inter alia,</i> \"an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(C). The district court admitted Wallace's hearsay testimony, rejecting Taveras's Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) cross-examination claim. Despite the district court's observation that Taveras failed to object to Wallace's hearsay testimony while she was on the stand, Taveras's objections before and after her testimony demonstrate that he did not forfeit this claim below. Accordingly, we review Taveras's argument that the district court should not have admitted the hearsay testimony for abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. Tom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782082\"><a href=\"/opinion/782082/united-states-v-luis-tom-aka-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2003), rather than plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conducting this review, we find some of the history of Rule 32.1 relevant to Taveras's claim of error. The Advisory Committee Notes accompanying the 1979 addition and the 2002 amendments to Rule 32.1 reveal that the procedural protections established by Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) were designed to track the due process rights established for parolees in <i>Morrissey v.

The <i>Morrissey</i> Court held that while \"the revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations,\" defendants at these proceedings are still entitled to basic due process protections. 408 U.S. at 480, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108606\"><a href=\"/opinion/108606/morrissey-v-brewer/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court is to balance the person's interest in the constitutionally guaranteed right to confrontation against the government's good cause for denying it.\" An important element of the good cause analysis is the reliability of the evidence that the Government seeks to introduce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to establish the reliability of Wallace's hearsay testimony, the Government argued that the court could accept it under the excited utterance/spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule. <i>Idaho v. Wright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112488\"><a href=\"/opinion/112488/idaho-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 815, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112488\"><a href=\"/opinion/112488/idaho-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span> (1990) (\"Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"). That exception allows the admission of a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. <i>See United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498116\"><a href=\"/opinion/498116/united-states-v-audrey-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 227-28 (1st Cir.1987); Fed.R.Evid. 803(2). \"The rationale underlying the `excited utterance' exception is that excitement suspends the declarant's powers of reflection and fabrication, consequently minimizing the possibility that the utterance will be influenced by self interest and therefore rendered unreliable.\" <i>United States v.

The time lapse in most excited utterance cases is usually a few seconds, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Vazquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511959\"><a href=\"/opinion/511959/united-states-v-jesus-vazquez-united-states-of-america-v-esteban-pizarro/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span>, 864 (1st Cir.1988), or a few minutes, <i>see, e.g., Bailey,</i> 834 F.2d at 228. In extreme circumstances, we have even accepted a delay of a few hours, <i>see United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198094\"><a href=\"/opinion/198094/united-states-v-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1998) (accepting testimony from a woman four hours after the shocking incident based on the assumption that she was still suffering trauma after she was beaten by the defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The delay here extended well beyond the limits established by our excited utterance precedents. The alleged assault occurred on the night of April 15, but Pabon did not call Wallace until the next morning. Furthermore, while Wallace did not testify to the precise time that Pabon called, she did say that the witness had been trying to reach her all morning, suggesting that the two talked late in the morning. Thus, the extended delay in this case was long enough to allow Pabon to reflect on the alleged events of the previous night and possibly to fabricate or alter the story that she related to Wallace. Wallace's hearsay testimony did not meet the requirements of the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the hearsay testimony presented at the revocation hearing lacked other indicia of reliability. Pabon's statement was neither written nor sworn, <i>see United States v. Comito,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span>, 1171 (9th Cir.1999) (\"Unsworn verbal allegations are, in general, the least reliable type of hearsay....\"), and the Government failed to provide <i>any</i> corroborating evidence to support Pabon's accusation that Taveras pointed a gun at her. <i>Cf. United States v. Pratt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"694340\"><a href=\"/opinion/694340/united-states-v-anthony-pratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 675 (7th Cir.1995) (accepting a police officer's hearsay testimony at a supervised release revocation hearing that was corroborated by written reports and statements of the victims, surveillance photographs, and other physical evidence); <i>United States v.

Moreover, the Government did not provide any background details about Pabon or her relationship with Taveras. This exchange between Taveras and Wallace at trial underscores these deficiencies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: You don't have any background history with Elsa Pabon; do you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: No, I do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: All right.

Wallace's testimony was the only evidence presented in support of the Government's case, and the prejudice to Taveras from the absence of confrontation is unmistakable. Rule 32.1(b)(2)(C) mandates the exclusion of such unsupported hearsay under these circumstances. Without the hearsay testimony, there was no case; therefore, we must vacate the district court's judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court suspended the proceedings on July 29 to allow the court and the parties to research the definition of \"assault with a deadly weapon\" and \"possession of a firearm\" under Massachusetts law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2(a) states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an attorney for the government or the defendant and the defendant's attorney to produce, for the examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is in their possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness's testimony.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Taveras misspoke during the hearing, claiming that Rule 32.1(a)(2)(D) entitled him to confront adverse witnesses. That provision, which establishes the defendant's rights at a supervised release revocation hearing, was moved to 32.1(b)(2)(C) in 2002 and currently reads: \"The person is entitled to ... an opportunity to appear, present evidence, and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> When asked how many children Pabon has, Wallace responded: \"I believe she has two or three.

The grounding of Rule 32.1 in constitutional due process (as we explain in the text above) makes our consideration of the rule appropriate on appeal despite the labels used by Taveras. Moreover, we have a strong preference for avoiding constitutional grounds when another ground of decision is available<i>See, e.g., Santoni v.
