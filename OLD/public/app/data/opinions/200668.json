Plaintiff-appellant Nydia\n\nEstades   Negroni     (\"Estades\")       brought     an   action    against     the\n\nAssociates    Corp.   of    North     America    (\"Associates     Corporation\"),\n\nAssociates Financial Services (\"Associates\"), Associates First\n\nCapital     Corp.,    and    Associates       Corporation    of    Puerto      Rico\n\n(collectively    \"defendants\"),         alleging    unlawful      discrimination\n\nbecause of her age and disability in contravention of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634\n\n(2003), the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12182-12189 (2003), and several provisions of Puerto Rico law.\n\nThe district     court      granted    summary    judgment   in   favor   of    the\n\ndefendants; Estades now appeals.          After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                                I.    Background1\n\n            Estades was hired by Associates in 1986.               Between 1989\n\nand 1990, she became aware of financial irregularities regarding\n\nloans carried out by some of her co-workers in Associates' Arecibo\n\nI branch.     In 1992, Estades reported the irregularities to Juan\n\nIrizarry, Group Assistant Vice President at Associates, through his\n\nsecretary, Haydeé López.        As a result of Estades's allegations of\n\nfraud, several audits were performed that resulted in the firing of\n\nseveral of her co-workers, including her supervisors, in 1993.\n\n\n1\n  We largely reproduce the facts as stated in the district court's\nopinion, Estades Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am., 208 F. Supp.\n2d 144, 145 (D.P.R. 2002), but present them in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff. Rosenberg v. City of Everett, 328 F.3d\n12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            After she reported the irregularities, Estades alleges\n\nshe experienced a \"pattern of discrimination.\"                According to\n\nEstades's   brief,   \"her   supervisors     were   bothered   by   Estades's\n\nwhistle-blowing activities.\"       Estades contends that, as a result,\n\nher workload was increased to the point of being \"excessive.\"\n\nEstades also claims that she requested her workload be reduced to\n\nits original level or that an assistant be hired; her employer\n\nrefused both requests. She also alleges that the director of human\n\nresources, at least one of her supervisors, and several of her co-\n\nworkers at Associates made \"age motivated remarks.\"2\n\n            In   March   1996,   Estades   experienced   chest     pains   and\n\nvisited a doctor, who diagnosed her with severe depression.                On\n\nMarch 21, 1996, Estades, following her doctor's recommendation,\n\nreported to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\").            The SIF examined\n\nEstades and found her to be disabled; she was placed on leave to\n\nreceive medical treatment.\n\n            On April 9, 1996, Estades requested short-term disability\n\nbenefits under Associates' employee benefits policy (the \"Policy\").\n\nThe Policy was administered by Associates Corporation and managed\n\nby Prudential Healthcare Group (\"Prudential\").           Estades received\n\n\n\n2\n   Estades's brief extensively cites to her own deposition and\nthose of Irizarry and Wilfredo Ortiz Guerra in cataloguing the\nallegedly ageist remarks made by her supervisors and co-workers.\nMost of the references in her brief are to depositions that were\nconducted entirely in Spanish and for which no certified\ntranslation is in the record.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fshort-term disability benefits for the maximum period possible,\n\nfrom March 1996 to September 1996.\n\n               On May 2, 1996, Carmen Hernández, a social worker with\n\nthe SIF, interviewed Estades in connection with her request for\n\ntreatment.       SIF referred Estades to Dr. Pablo Pérez Torredo, a\n\npsychiatrist, for evaluation.             On June 18, 1996, Dr. Pérez Torredo\n\nissued   his     final   psychiatric       report,     diagnosing    Estades   with\n\nadaptive disorder with mixed emotional symptoms and recommending\n\nthat she receive additional psychotherapeutic treatment.\n\n               On August 23, 1996, Associates notified Estades that her\n\nshort-term disability benefits would expire on September 27, 1996.\n\nAssociates further informed Estades of her right to apply for\n\nlong-term disability benefits (\"LTD\") and recommended that she also\n\napply for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (\"SSDI\") to\n\nsupplement her income.\n\n               On September 25, 1996, Estades applied for LTD.               In her\n\napplication, Estades certified that her emotional state did not\n\nallow    her    to   concentrate     on    and    perform    her   job   functions.\n\nFurthermore, she stated that the date for her return to work was\n\nnot available, and that she did not expect to return to any other\n\noccupation.\n\n               In a letter dated January 7, 1997, Prudential denied\n\nEstades's      request   for   LTD   based       on   lack   of   medical   evidence\n\nsupporting her claim that her condition kept her from performing\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fher duties     as   Branch   Operations     Manager.     The   denial   letter\n\ninformed her of her right to appeal the denial of LTD.                  Estades\n\nappealed Prudential's decision in a letter dated February 25, 1997.\n\n          On March 19, 1997, Estades's employment with Associates\n\nwas terminated with an effective date of February 28, 1997, because\n\nher short-term disability benefits had expired, her application for\n\nLTD had been denied, and she had not reported to work.                       On\n\nApril 15, 1997, Prudential reconsidered its denial of LTD and\n\napproved Estades's request retroactively to September 18, 1996.\n\nEstades was reinstated in her employment with Associates with LTD\n\nstatus.   As part of her LTD benefits, Estades was entitled to\n\nreceive 60 percent of her salary while undergoing treatment.                 On\n\nMay 2, 1997, Estades sent a letter to Associates stating her desire\n\nto return to work on June 1, 1997.\n\n          Prudential informed Estades that if her recovery was\n\ndelayed she could be required to apply for SSDI.            She applied, and\n\non July 7, 1997, she was granted SSDI retroactively to September\n\n1996, and the Social Security Administration found that, under its\n\nrules, she had become disabled on March 20, 1996.\n\n          On    April   29,   1998,    Aetna    US    Healthcare   (\"Aetna\"),\n\nAssociates' new health insurance carrier, sent Estades a letter\n\nstating that, based on the medical information in their possession,\n\nher claim for LTD had been approved.                 Aetna further informed\n\nEstades that, under a plan provision, she was required to file for\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fSSDI benefits and to provide them with proof of application.              The\n\nletter further informed Estades that failure to comply would result\n\nin suspension and termination of benefits.\n\n            Rather than comply with Aetna's request, Estades told\n\nAetna to ask Prudential for a copy of her SSDI award letter.\n\nEstades stated that she refused to provide Aetna with a copy of the\n\nletter because \"they had been so bad to her.\"\n\n            On June 2, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a second letter\n\nrequesting that she inform the company of the status of her SSDI\n\napplication.       On August 11, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a letter\n\ninforming her that her LTD benefits were terminated effective\n\nJuly 31, 1998, because Aetna had not received from Estades any\n\nproof that she had at least applied for SSDI.                  Aetna further\n\ninformed Estades that she was entitled to petition for a review of\n\nthat decision within sixty days.        She appealed, but the appeal was\n\ndenied on October 1, 1998, because Aetna had not received a copy of\n\nher SSDI award letter.     After October 1, 1998, Estades did not make\n\nany further efforts to obtain LTD.             Estades has not contacted\n\nAssociates regarding her availability or desire to return to work\n\nsince her LTD was terminated in August 1998.\n\n            Estades is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment and\n\nhas   not   made   any   attempt   to   find   another   job    because   her\n\npsychiatrist has told her she is still unable to work.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          On June 5, 1998, Estades filed a complaint against\n\ndefendants alleging that they violated the ADEA and the ADA, and\n\nraising supplemental law claims under Puerto Rico Law.3\n\n          The defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.\n\nThe motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that\n\nthe court grant the motion for summary judgment. Estades filed her\n\nobjections to the report and recommendation.\n\n          On May 30, 2002, the district court issued an opinion and\n\norder adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and\n\ndismissing Estades's causes of action under the ADEA and the ADA.\n\nThe district court dismissed the supplemental state law claims\n\nwithout prejudice because no federal claims to ground original\n\njurisdiction remained before the Court.     Estades now appeals the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment and dismissal of her\n\nstate claims.\n\n                          II.   Analysis\n\n          Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (2003).         We review a grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable\n\n\n\n3\n   Plaintiff filed her complaint before Aetna terminated her LTD\nbenefits.\n\n                                -7-\n\fto Estades.      Rosenberg, 328 F.3d at 17.      We may affirm the district\n\ncourt's decision on any grounds supported by the record. Rodríguez\n\nv. Smithkline Beecham, 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            A.    Age Discrimination Claim\n\n            Estades argues that the district court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment on the ADEA claim because she presented direct\n\nevidence of age discrimination. In the alternative, Estades claims\n\nsummary judgment should not have been granted with regard to the\n\nprima facie case because a genuine issue of material fact exists\n\nregarding whether she was actually or constructively discharged.\n\n            The ADEA makes it \"unlawful for an employer . . . to\n\ndischarge any individual . . . because of such individual's age.\"\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (2003).      In an ADEA case, the plaintiff bears\n\nthe burden of proving he would not have been discharged \"but for\n\nhis age.\"     Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).      \"To survive summary judgment, the employee must first\n\neither present direct evidence of discrimination or make out a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination\" under the familiar McDonnell\n\nDouglas burden-shifting paradigm.           Bramble v. American Postal\n\nWorkers Union, Providence Local, 135 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nsee also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05\n\n(1973).\n\n            In    the    discrimination   context,     the   \"term     'direct\n\nevidence'     normally    contemplates    only    those   statements    by   a\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fdecisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear\n\nsquarely on the contested employment decision.\"               Vesprini v. Shaw\n\nContract Flooring Servs., 315 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).             Estades's brief purports\n\nto present many ageist statements made by the head of human\n\nresources, her supervisors, and co-workers, which we must evaluate\n\nto   determine    if    she   has     presented    direct    evidence      of   age\n\ndiscrimination.        Cf. Wennik v. PolyGram Group Distrib., 304 F.3d\n\n123, 132-33 (1st Cir. 2002) (evaluating interviewer's comment,\n\n\"When I get over 55, there's no way you'll find me in this\n\nbusiness,\" to determine whether it constituted direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination).        The record contains a certified translation of\n\nEstades's own deposition, where she refers to comments made by\n\nJesús Navarro and Enoch Toro, two of her former supervisors, as\n\nwell as comments by Aurora Medina, Associates' Director of Human\n\nResources at the time.         Estades's brief cites extensively to the\n\ndeposition testimony of Irizarry, which it labels as being of\n\n\"particular importance,\" and also to that of Wilfredo Ortiz Guerra,\n\nManager of Associates.          The record on appeal does not contain\n\ncertified   translations        of    the     relevant    portions    of    either\n\nIrizarry's or Ortiz's testimony.              As we have made clear before,\n\n\"this   Court    may    not   consider      non-English   documents     unless    a\n\ntranslation is provided.\"            Ramos-Báez v. Bossolo-López, 240 F.3d\n\n92, 94 (1st Cir. 2001); see also 1st Cir. R. 30(d) (\"The court will\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fnot   receive   documents   not   in     the    English     language   unless\n\ntranslations    are   furnished.\").        Thus,   we      must   ignore   the\n\nuntranslated evidence, which constitutes the bulk of the comments\n\nEstades relies on in making her case, and resolve the case as\n\nthough the evidence did not exist.             See López-Carrasquillo v.\n\nRubianes, 230 F.3d 409, 413 (1st Cir. 2000) (refusing to consider\n\na deposition excerpt \"part of the record on summary judgment\" where\n\nexcerpt was in Spanish and no translation was provided).4                  Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(noting that \"meaningful appellate review\" is unavailable when\n\nsignificant parts of the record are in a foreign language and\n\naddressing the translation issue in the criminal context).\n\n          Without     the   untranslated       evidence,     Estades   cannot\n\nestablish a case of discrimination based on direct evidence.               Most\n\nof the direct evidence she presents on appeal is drawn from the\n\nuntranslated material. If we consider the English language record,\n\nthe only evidence of ageism is Estades's own deposition testimony\n\nabout comments made to her by her former direct supervisors,\n\nNavarro and Toro, and by Medina.5        Given that stray comments are\n\n\n\n4\n   There is no indication that the district court considered the\nuntranslated evidence in reaching its conclusion.\n5\n  Specifically, Estades testified in her deposition that when she\ncomplained to Medina about her workload, Medina replied \"'Oh,\nyou're already too old, Nydia.'\" Estades stated that Medina made\nthat comment to her \"several times\" but that Estades never\ncomplained to anyone at Associates about the comments.\n\n                                  -10-\n\finsufficient to meet a plaintiff's burden in a discrimination case\n\nand the lack of any evidence linking the translated remarks to the\n\nadverse employment decision, we can easily affirm the grant of\n\nsummary   judgments   with   respect    to   the   direct   evidence   of\n\ndiscrimination.6   See, e.g., Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb\n\nCo., 95 F.3d 86, 96 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"direct evidence does not\n\ninclude stray remarks in the workplace, particularly those made by\n\nnondecisionmakers or statements made by decisionmakers unrelated to\n\nthe decisional process itself\").\n\n          Estades fares no better under the McDonnell Douglas\n\nburden shifting framework.    Even if we assume that Estades met her\n\nburden of presenting a prima facie case of discrimination,7 the\n\n\n6\n  Although the alleged comments by Medina may suggest some linkage\nbetween ageism and the adverse employment decision given her\nposition as head of human resources, they do not alone rise to the\nlevel of a \"smoking gun.\" Smith v. F.W. Morse & Co., Inc., 76 F.3d\n413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996) (equating direct evidence to a smoking\ngun, giving as an example \"an admission by the employer that it\nexplicitly took actual or anticipated pregnancy into account in\nreaching an employment decision\").      Medina's comments were in\nresponse to Estades's complaints about having too much work, and do\nnot amount to an admission by the ultimate decisionmaker that\nEstades's age resulted in her termination.\n7\n    We assume arguendo that Estades was terminated, and thus\nsuffered an adverse employment action. The district court's grant\nof summary judgment was predicated on the lack of an adverse\nemployment action, which would indeed prove fatal to Estades's\ncase, which    was   based  primarily   on  direct   evidence of\ndiscrimination, and, in the alternative, on a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. See, e.g., Patten v. Wal-Mart Stores E., Inc., 300\nF.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2002) (indicating that where a plaintiff is\npresenting a case of discrimination based on direct evidence he\n\"need prove only that the discriminatory action was a motivating\nfactor in an adverse employment decision\") (emphasis added);\n\n                                 -11-\n\fburden     shifts    to   Associates        to    articulate        a     legitimate,\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for the termination.                      Texas Dep't of\n\nCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1981).                     Associates\n\npresented evidence that Estades's termination was due to her own\n\nknowing non-compliance with Aetna's procedural requirement that she\n\nsend the SSDI award letter.        Once Aetna terminated Estades's LTD\n\nbenefits and she failed to report to work, she was no longer an\n\nemployee of       Associates.     It   is     entirely    legitimate           and   non-\n\ndiscriminatory to terminate an employee for failing to comply with\n\nan insurance carrier's procedural requirements for receipt of LTD\n\nbenefits    and    subsequently   failing        to   report   to       work    or   even\n\ncontacting the employer.\n\n            The burden thus shifts back to Estades to prove that\n\nAssociates' proffered reason is mere pretext for discrimination.\n\nId. at 253.       This final burden in the McDonnell Douglas framework\n\n\"merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the\n\nplaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination.\"\n\nTexas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256\n\n(1981); Thomas v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 144 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   Thus, evidence constituting a prima facie case along with\n\n\nGonzález v. El Día, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 68 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002)\n(noting that in order to establish a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination under the ADEA, the plaintiff must show, among other\nthings, that \"the employer subjected her to an adverse employment\naction (e.g., an actual or constructive discharge)\") (emphasis\nadded). We affirm the grant of summary judgment on other grounds,\nhowever.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fevidence of pretext can defeat summary judgment \"provided that the\n\nevidence is adequate to enable a rational factfinder reasonably to\n\ninfer that unlawful discrimination was a determinative factor in\n\nthe adverse employment action.\"                Rodríguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart\n\nStores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 22 n.5 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            In   order     to    meet   her    burden   of    demonstrating       that\n\nAssociates' \"proffered reason for the dismissal was pretextual and\n\nthat the true reason was an age-based animus,\" Estades must present\n\n\"evidence . . . of such strength and quality as to permit a\n\nreasonable finding that the . . . [termination] was obviously or\n\nmanifestly unsupported.\"           Ruiz v. Posadas De San Juan Assocs., 124\n\nF.3d 243,    248    (1st    Cir.    1997)     (internal      quotation    marks   and\n\ncitation omitted).         Evidence of pretext includes \"[e]vidence of\n\nbiased comments.\"     Rivera-Rodríguez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,\n\n265 F.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir. 2001).              Although the translated evidence\n\nincludes Estades's own testimony about Medina's repeated comments\n\nregarding her age, these comments are insufficient to generate a\n\nfactual   dispute    as     to    whether      the   asserted    reason    for     her\n\ntermination -- her failure to provide the evidence of her SSDI\n\naward letter and her refusal to return to work or contact her\n\nemployer -- was a pretext for age discrimination.\n\n            We thus affirm the grant of summary judgment on the age\n\ndiscrimination claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f           B.   Failure to Accommodate Claim\n\n           Estades also claims that Associates violated the ADA in\n\nrefusing   to   grant    the    accommodations      she    requested,    namely\n\nreduction of her workload or provision of an assistant.8                The ADA\n\nprohibits discrimination against \"a qualified individual with a\n\ndisability because of the disability of such individual in regard\n\nto . . . terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12112(a).      An employer violates the ADA if it \"knows of a\n\ndisability yet fails to make reasonable accommodations.\"                Higgins\n\nv. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     To    survive       summary   judgment     on    her   \"reasonable\n\naccommodation claim, [Estades] must produce enough evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to find that (1) [s]he is disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the ADA, (2) [s]he was able to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation,\n\nand (3) [Associates], despite knowing of [Estades]'s disability,\n\ndid not reasonably accommodate it.\"          Rocafort v. IBM Corp., 334\n\nF.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2003).       We focus our attention on the third\n\nprong: whether Associates knew of Estades's disability yet failed\n\nto accommodate her.9\n\n\n8\n   Neither Estades's complaint nor her briefs before this Court\npresent any claim that she was discharged because of her\ndisability. Rather, she focuses on the issue of accommodation.\n9\n   Estades also discusses her qualification to perform the job.\nThe district court states that \"Estades failed to proffer\nsufficient evidence that she could perform her duties with or\n\n                                     -14-\n\f             Before     she    was     diagnosed        with   depression,     Estades\n\nrequested a reduced workload or the aid of an assistant.                      Under the\n\nADA, requests for accommodation must be express and must be linked\n\nto a disability. See Cruz Carrillo v. AMR Eagle, Inc., 148 F. Supp.\n\n2d    142,   146    (D.P.R.        2001).     An    employer     need   not    provide\n\naccommodations where it does not know an employee has a disability.\n\nSee Reed v. Lepage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (\"The employer has no duty to divine the need for a special\n\naccommodation where the employee merely makes a mundane request for\n\na change at the workplace.\"); see also EEOC, Enforcement Guidance:\n\nReasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act, FEP (BNA) 405: 7601, at 7605-06 (March 1,\n\n1999) (\"before addressing the merits of the accommodation request,\n\nthe   employer      needs     to    determine      if   the    individual's    medical\n\ncondition meets the ADA definition of \"disability,\" a prerequisite\n\nfor the individual to be entitled to a reasonable accommodation\"),\n\navailable          at    http://www.eeoc.gov/docs/accommodation.html.\n\nAssociates did not know Estades was disabled when she requested the\n\naccommodation -- she had not yet been diagnosed with a disability\n\n\n\nwithout any reasonable accommodations as required by the ADA,\" but\nmakes no further comment on this prong. Estades Negroni, 208 F.\nSupp. 2d at 148.     Because we find Estades failed to present\nsufficient evidence on the third prong, we need not address whether\nshe could perform her duties.      Cf. Rocafort, 334 F.3d, at *9\n(\"assum[ing], without deciding,\" that defendant met his burden with\nregard to the first two prongs where plaintiff failed to meet\nburden on the third prong).\n\n                                            -15-\n\fat   the   time   she   sought    a    reduced      workload    or   an   assistant.\n\nAlthough Estades argues that her depression was evident when she\n\nrequested the accommodation, the record does not support this\n\nclaim.     Finally,     there    is    no   evidence     that    the    request   was\n\nexpressly repeated after Estades was diagnosed with a mental\n\ndisability.\n\n            We uphold the grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim\n\nbecause Associates was unaware of Estades's disability when it\n\ndenied her requested accommodation.\n\n            C.    State Law Claims\n\n            The    district      court      acted    \"well     within     its   broad\n\ndiscretion\" in refusing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and\n\ndismissing without prejudice the state law claims because no\n\nfederal claims remained.         Lares Group, II v. Tobin, 221 F.3d 41, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                III.     Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment is affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\f",

Between 1989 and 1990, she became aware of financial irregularities regarding loans carried out by some of her co-workers in Associates' Arecibo I branch. In 1992, Estades reported the irregularities to Juan Irizarry, Group Assistant Vice President at Associates, through his secretary, Hayde&#233; L&#243;pez. As a result of Estades's allegations of fraud, several audits were performed that resulted in the firing of several of her co-workers, including her supervisors, in 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After she reported the irregularities, Estades alleges she experienced a \"pattern of discrimination.\" According to Estades's brief, \"her supervisors were bothered by Estades's whistle-blowing activities.\" Estades contends that, as a result, her workload was increased to the point of being \"excessive.\" Estades also claims that she requested her workload be reduced to its original level or that an assistant be hired; her employer refused both requests. She also alleges that the director of human resources, at least one of her supervisors, and several of her co-workers at Associates made \"age motivated remarks.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Estades experienced chest pains and visited a doctor, who diagnosed her with severe depression. On March 21, 1996, Estades, following her doctor's recommendation, reported to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\"). The SIF examined Estades and found her to be disabled; she was placed on leave to receive medical treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1996, Estades requested short-term disability benefits under Associates' employee benefits policy (the \"Policy\"). The Policy was administered by Associates Corporation and managed by Prudential Healthcare Group (\"Prudential\"). Estades received short-term disability benefits for the maximum period possible, from March 1996 to September 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1996, Carmen Hern&#225;ndez, a social worker with the SIF, interviewed Estades in connection with her request for treatment. SIF referred Estades to Dr. Pablo P&#233;rez Torredo, a psychiatrist, for evaluation. On June 18, 1996, Dr. P&#233;rez Torredo issued his final psychiatric report, diagnosing Estades with adaptive disorder with mixed emotional symptoms and recommending that she receive additional psychotherapeutic treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1996, Associates notified Estades that her short-term disability benefits would expire on September 27, 1996. Associates further informed Estades of her right to apply for long-term disability benefits (\"LTD\") and recommended that she also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits (\"SSDI\") to supplement her income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 25, 1996, Estades applied for LTD. In her application, Estades certified that her emotional state did not allow her to concentrate on and perform her job functions. Furthermore, she stated that the date for her return to work was not available, and that she did not expect to return to any other occupation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated January 7, 1997, Prudential denied Estades's request for LTD based on lack of medical evidence supporting her claim that her condition kept her from performing her duties as Branch Operations Manager. The denial letter informed her of her right to appeal the denial of LTD. Estades appealed Prudential's decision in a letter dated February 25, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 19, 1997, Estades's employment with Associates was terminated with an effective date of February 28, 1997, because her short-term disability benefits had expired, her application for LTD had been denied, and she had not reported to work. On April 15, 1997, Prudential reconsidered its denial of LTD and approved Estades's request retroactively to September 18, 1996. Estades was reinstated in her employment with Associates with LTD status. As part of her LTD benefits, Estades was entitled to receive 60 percent of her salary while undergoing treatment. On May 2, 1997, Estades sent a letter to Associates stating her desire to return to work on June 1, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential informed Estades that if her recovery was delayed she could be required to apply for SSDI. She applied, and on July 7, 1997, she was granted SSDI retroactively to September 1996, and the Social Security Administration found that, under its rules, she had become disabled on March 20, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 1998, Aetna U.S. Healthcare (\"Aetna\"), Associates' new health insurance carrier, sent Estades a letter stating that, based on the medical information in their possession, her claim for LTD had been approved. Aetna further informed Estades that, under a plan provision, she was required to file for SSDI benefits and to provide them with proof of application. The letter further informed Estades that failure to comply would result in suspension and termination of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than comply with Aetna's request, Estades told Aetna to ask Prudential for a copy of her SSDI award letter. Estades stated that she refused to provide Aetna with a copy of the letter because \"they had been so bad to her.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 2, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a second letter requesting that she inform the company of the status of her SSDI application. On August 11, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a letter informing her that her LTD benefits were terminated effective July 31, 1998, because Aetna had not received from Estades any proof that she had at least applied for SSDI. Aetna further informed Estades that she was entitled to petition for a review of that decision within sixty days. She appealed, but the appeal was denied on October 1, 1998, because Aetna had not received a copy of her SSDI award letter. After October 1, 1998, Estades did not make any further efforts to obtain LTD. Estades has not contacted Associates regarding her availability or desire to return to work since her LTD was terminated in August 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment and has not made any attempt to find another job because her psychiatrist has told her she is still unable to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1998, Estades filed a complaint against defendants alleging that they violated the ADEA and the ADA, and raising supplemental law claims under Puerto Rico Law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the court grant the motion for summary judgment. Estades filed her objections to the report and recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2002, the district court issued an opinion and order adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and dismissing Estades's causes of action under the ADEA and the ADA. The district court dismissed the supplemental state law claims without prejudice because no federal claims to ground original jurisdiction remained before the Court. Estades now appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment and dismissal of her state claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (2003). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to Estades. <i>Rosenberg,</i> 328 F.3d at 17. We may affirm the district court's decision on any grounds supported by the record. <i>Rodr&#237;guez v. Smithkline Beecham,</i> 224 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Age Discrimination Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the ADEA claim because she presented direct evidence of age discrimination. In the alternative, Estades claims summary judgment should not have been granted with regard to the prima facie case because a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether she was actually or constructively discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADEA makes it \"unlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual... because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a)(1) (2003). In an ADEA case, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving he would not have been discharged \"but for his age.\" <i>Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc.,</i> 109 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1997). In <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003), decided after the district court order in this case, the Supreme Court held that \"direct evidence\" is not required to prove employment discrimination in a mixed-motive case. Accordingly, we must consider both \"direct evidence,\" <i>see Vesprini v. Shaw Contract Flooring Servs.,</i> 315 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"the term `direct evidence' normally contemplates only those statements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear squarely on the contested employment decision\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and circumstantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades's brief purports to present many ageist statements made by the head of human resources, her supervisors, and co-workers, which we must evaluate to determine if she has presented sufficient evidence of age discrimination. <i>Cf. Wennik v. Polygram Group Distrib.,</i> 304 F.3d 123, 132-33 (1st Cir.2002) (evaluating interviewer's comment, \"When I get over 55, there's no way you'll find me in this business,\" to determine whether it constituted direct evidence of discrimination). The record contains a certified translation of Estades's own deposition, where she refers to comments made by Jes&#250;s Navarro and Enoch Toro, two of her former supervisors, as well as comments by Aurora Medina, Associates' Director of Human Resources at the time. Estades's brief cites extensively to the deposition testimony of Irizarry, which it labels as being of \"particular importance,\" and also to that of Wilfredo Ortiz Guerra, Manager of Associates. The record on appeal does not contain certified translations of the relevant portions of either Irizarry's or Ortiz's testimony. As we have made clear before, \"this Court may not consider non-English documents unless a translation is provided.\" <i>Ramos-B&#225;ez v. Bossolo-L&#243;pez,</i> 240 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also</i> 1st Cir. R. 30(d) (\"The court will not receive documents not in the English language unless translations are furnished.\"). Thus, we must ignore the untranslated evidence, which constitutes the bulk of the comments Estades relies on in making her case, and resolve the case as though the evidence did not exist. <i>See L&#243;pez-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes,</i> 230 F.3d 409, 413 (1st Cir.2000) (refusing to consider a deposition excerpt \"part of the record on summary judgment\" where excerpt was in Spanish and no translation was provided).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf. United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"meaningful appellate review\" is unavailable when significant parts of the record are in a foreign language and addressing the translation issue in the criminal context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without the untranslated evidence, Estades cannot establish a mixed-motive case of discrimination. Most of the evidence she presents on appeal is drawn from the untranslated material. If we consider the English language record, the only evidence of ageism is Estades's own deposition testimony about comments made to her by her former direct supervisors, Navarro and Toro, and by Medina.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given that stray comments are insufficient to meet a plaintiff's burden in a discrimination case and the lack of any evidence linking the translated remarks to the adverse employment decision, we can easily affirm the grant of summary judgment with respect to the direct evidence of discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Cf. Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> 95 F.3d 86, 96 (1st Cir.1996) (\"direct evidence does not include stray remarks in the workplace, particularly those made by nondecisionmakers or statements made by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades fares no better under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden shifting framework. Even if we assume that Estades met her burden of presenting a prima facie case of discrimination,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the burden shifts to Associates to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination. <i>Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Associates presented evidence that Estades's termination was due to her own knowing non-compliance with Aetna's procedural requirement that she send the SSDI award letter. Once Aetna terminated Estades's LTD benefits and she failed to report to work, she was no longer an employee of Associates. It is entirely legitimate and non-discriminatory to terminate an employee for failing to comply with an insurance carrier's procedural requirements for receipt of LTD benefits and subsequently failing to report to work or even contacting the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden thus shifts back to Estades to prove that Associates' proffered reason is mere pretext for discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089.

An employer violates the ADA if it \"knows of a disability yet fails to make reasonable accommodations.\" <i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 264 (1st Cir.1999). To survive summary judgment on her \"reasonable accommodation claim, [Estades] must produce enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find that (1)[s]he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2)[s]he was able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) [Associates], despite knowing of [Estades]'s disability, did not reasonably accommodate it.\" <i>Rocafort v. IBM Corp.,</i> 334 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir.2003).

An employer need not provide accommodations where it does not know an employee has a disability. <i>See Reed v.

Associates did not know Estades was disabled when she requested the accommodation &#8212; she had not yet been diagnosed with a disability at the time she sought a reduced workload or an assistant. Although Estades argues that her depression was evident when she requested the accommodation, the record does not support this claim.

Between 1989 and 1990, she became aware of financial irregularities regarding loans carried out by some of her co-workers in Associates' Arecibo I branch. In 1992, Estades reported the irregularities to Juan Irizarry, Group Assistant Vice President at Associates, through his secretary, Hayde&#233; L&#243;pez. As a result of Estades's allegations of fraud, several audits were performed that resulted in the firing of several of her co-workers, including her supervisors, in 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After she reported the irregularities, Estades alleges she experienced a \"pattern of discrimination.\" According to Estades's brief, \"her supervisors were bothered by Estades's whistle-blowing activities.\" Estades contends that, as a result, her workload was increased to the point of being \"excessive.\" Estades also claims that she requested her workload be reduced to its original level or that an assistant be hired; her employer refused both requests. She also alleges that the director of human resources, at least one of her supervisors, and several of her co-workers at Associates made \"age motivated remarks.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Estades experienced chest pains and visited a doctor, who diagnosed her with severe depression. On March 21, 1996, Estades, following her doctor's recommendation, reported to the State Insurance Fund (\"SIF\"). The SIF examined Estades and found her to be disabled; she was placed on leave to receive medical treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 9, 1996, Estades requested short-term disability benefits under Associates' employee benefits policy (the \"Policy\"). The Policy was administered by Associates Corporation and managed by Prudential Healthcare Group (\"Prudential\"). Estades received short-term disability benefits for the maximum period possible, from March 1996 to September 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 2, 1996, Carmen Hern&#225;ndez, a social worker with the SIF, interviewed Estades in connection with her request for treatment. SIF referred Estades to Dr. Pablo P&#233;rez Torredo, a psychiatrist, for evaluation. On June 18, 1996, Dr. P&#233;rez Torredo issued his final psychiatric report, diagnosing Estades with adaptive disorder with mixed emotional symptoms and recommending that she receive additional psychotherapeutic treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 23, 1996, Associates notified Estades that her short-term disability benefits would expire on September 27, 1996.

In her application, Estades certified that her emotional state did not allow her to concentrate on and perform her job functions. Furthermore, she stated that the date for her return to work was not available, and that she did not expect to return to any other occupation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter dated January 7, 1997, Prudential denied Estades's request for LTD based on lack of medical evidence supporting her claim that her condition kept her from performing her duties as Branch Operations Manager.

On April 15, 1997, Prudential reconsidered its denial of LTD and approved Estades's request retroactively to September 18, 1996. Estades was reinstated in her employment with Associates with LTD status. As part of her LTD benefits, Estades was entitled to receive 60 percent of her salary while undergoing treatment. On May 2, 1997, Estades sent a letter to Associates stating her desire to return to work on June 1, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prudential informed Estades that if her recovery was delayed she could be required to apply for SSDI.

Aetna further informed Estades that, under a plan provision, she was required to file for SSDI benefits and to provide them with proof of application. The letter further informed Estades that failure to comply would result in suspension and termination of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than comply with Aetna's request, Estades told Aetna to ask Prudential for a copy of her SSDI award letter.

On August 11, 1998, Aetna sent Estades a letter informing her that her LTD benefits were terminated effective July 31, 1998, because Aetna had not received from Estades any proof that she had at least applied for SSDI. Aetna further informed Estades that she was entitled to petition for a review of that decision within sixty days. She appealed, but the appeal was denied on October 1, 1998, because Aetna had not received a copy of her SSDI award letter. After October 1, 1998, Estades did not make any further efforts to obtain LTD. Estades has not contacted Associates regarding her availability or desire to return to work since her LTD was terminated in August 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment and has not made any attempt to find another job because her psychiatrist has told her she is still unable to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1998, Estades filed a complaint against defendants alleging that they violated the ADEA and the ADA, and raising supplemental law claims under Puerto Rico Law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.

The record contains a certified translation of Estades's own deposition, where she refers to comments made by Jes&#250;s Navarro and Enoch Toro, two of her former supervisors, as well as comments by Aurora Medina, Associates' Director of Human Resources at the time. Estades's brief cites extensively to the deposition testimony of Irizarry, which it labels as being of \"particular importance,\" and also to that of Wilfredo Ortiz Guerra, Manager of Associates. The record on appeal does not contain certified translations of the relevant portions of either Irizarry's or Ortiz's testimony.

Thus, we must ignore the untranslated evidence, which constitutes the bulk of the comments Estades relies on in making her case, and resolve the case as though the evidence did not exist. <i>See L&#243;pez-Carrasquillo v.

Once Aetna terminated Estades's LTD benefits and she failed to report to work, she was no longer an employee of Associates.

Although the translated evidence includes Estades's own testimony about Medina's repeated comments regarding her age, these comments are insufficient to generate a factual dispute as to whether the asserted reason for her termination &#8212; her failure to provide the evidence of her SSDI award letter and her refusal to return to work or contact her employer &#8212; was a pretext for age discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus affirm the grant of summary judgment on the age discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Failure to Accommodate Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estades also claims that Associates violated the ADA in refusing to grant the accommodations she requested, namely reduction of her workload or provision of an assistant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The ADA prohibits discrimination against \"a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to ... terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).
