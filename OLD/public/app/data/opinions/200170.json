Brandt, Jr., Trustee\n\nfor Healthco International, Inc. (\"Trustee\"), appeals a decision of\n\nthe Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit (\"BAP\") that\n\ngranted administrative priority to costs awarded to appellees after\n\nthey successfully defended a post-petition lawsuit brought against\n\nthem by the Trustee.     Finding no error of law, we affirm.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n     Healthco International, Inc., filed a voluntary bankruptcy\n\npetition in June 1993.    The Chapter 11 bankruptcy was converted to\n\na Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in September 1993, and the\n\nTrustee was appointed shortly thereafter.\n\n     In June 1995, the Trustee brought a lawsuit against several\n\ndefendants involved in the pre-bankruptcy leveraged buyout of\n\nHealthco, alleging that the buyout was a fraudulent transaction.\n\nSeveral defendants settled with the Trustee, but defendants Lazard\n\nFreres, Gemini Partners, and Hicks, Muse & Co. did not.        After a\n\nlengthy jury trial, the defendants prevailed in the district court.\n\nThe Trustee appealed the district court judgment to this court and\n\nwe affirmed.   See Brandt v. Wand Partners, 242 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n     As prevailing parties, the defendants, now appellees, sought\n\nto have the costs of litigation, exclusive of attorney's fees, paid\n\nby the bankrupt's estate.    Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) and 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1920, the district court awarded them costs for items such\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fas court filing fees, transcription and witness fees, and copying.\n\nLazard Freres was awarded $62,283.62; Gemini Partners, $89,511.40;\n\nand Hicks, Muse & Co., $129,367.70.\n\n     The appellees then corresponded with the Trustee, seeking\n\npayment of these court-awarded costs.                When the Trustee did not\n\nrespond, the appellees moved the bankruptcy court to grant the cost\n\nawards     priority     status     pursuant     to     the    Bankruptcy     Code,\n\nspecifically 11 U.S.C. §§ 507(a)(1) & 503(b).1\n\n     On May 22, 2001, the bankruptcy court declined appellees'\n\nrequests,     holding   that     their    claims     for   costs   were   general,\n\nunsecured claims that were not entitled to priority payment.\n\nAppellees appealed to the BAP, which reversed the decision of the\n\nbankruptcy court on February 1, 2002, holding that appellees'\n\nclaims were entitled to administrative priority.\n\n     Because only issues of statutory interpretation are raised, we\n\nreview the decision of the bankruptcy court de novo.                See Brandt v.\n\nRepco Printers & Lithographics, Inc., (In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.),\n\n132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 1997).             Although the BAP has reviewed\n\nthe bankruptcy court decision, \"we exhibit no particular deference\n\nto the conclusions of that tribunal.\" Id.\n\n                                 II.   Discussion\n\n     The distribution framework for claims against a bankrupt\n\nestate under Chapter 7 is established in Section 726(a) of the\n\n\n     1\n         All references to the Bankruptcy Code indicate Title 11.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fBankruptcy        Code,   which    requires    that   payments   first   be   made\n\npursuant to Section 507. Section 507(a)(1), in turn, dictates that\n\nthe     highest    priority   is    afforded    to    \"administrative    expenses\n\nallowed under section 503(b) of this title, and any fees and\n\ncharges assessed against the estate under chapter 123 of title\n\n28.\"2\n\n        Chapter 123 of Title 28 encompasses §§ 1911 to 1932, which\n\ncover a variety of court-related costs, such as filing and docket\n\nfees, service fees, witness fees, and trustee fees in bankruptcy\n\ncases.       Section 1920, the basis for appellees' costs awards,\n\nspecifies several categories of litigation-related fees that may be\n\ncharged as costs.\n\n        The Trustee claims that it was error to grant priority to the\n\ncosts awarded to appellees under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 even though they\n\nfall within the plain language of Section 507(a)(1). The Trustee\n\nargues that Section 503 creates an ambiguity that obfuscates the\n\nmeaning of Section 507(a)(1). He questions why Chapter 123 of Title\n\n28 would be referenced in Section 507(a)(1) rather than in Section\n\n503(b), interpreting Section 503(b) to be a \"complete enumeration\"\n\nof the types of claims that constitute administrative expenses.\n\nThe Trustee submits that the Section 507(a)(1) language must have\n\n\n        2\n      Section 503 is entitled \"Allowance of administrative\nexpenses.\"   Subsection (a) is an enabling provision allowing\nentities to file requests for payments of administrative expenses,\nwhile subsection (b) details a series of allowable administrative\nexpenses. 11 U.S.C. § 503.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fbeen intended to require that any claim for prioritization of\n\nexpenses, when founded in Chapter 123 of Title 28, would have to\n\nhave been incurred in the process of establishing one of the\n\nadministrative expenses permitted in Section 503(b).3\n\n     The plain language of Section 507(a)(1), however, requires us\n\nto   reject   the    Trustee's   construction      and    to   conclude    that\n\nappellees' claims for costs are entitled to priority status. There\n\nis no indication in the statute that the word \"and\" is intended to\n\nmean that     fees   under   Chapter    123   receive    priority    only when\n\nincurred in furtherance of a Section 503(b) administrative expense.\n\nMoreover, Section 503(b) does not, as the Trustee contends, provide\n\na complete enumeration of allowable costs and fees.                 Those items\n\nlisted in Section 503(b) are prefaced by the word \"including,\"\n\nwhich the Bankruptcy Code explains is not meant to have limiting\n\neffect.   See 11 U.S.C. § 102(3) (stating that the word \"including\"\n\nin the Bankruptcy Code is not to be construed as a limitation);\n\nsee, e.g., Vermejo Park Corp. v. Kaiser Coal Corp. (In re Kaiser\n\nSteel Corp.), 998 F.2d 783, 788 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that the\n\nword \"including\" after \"party in interest\" in Section 1109(b) of\n\n\n\n     3\n      In oral argument, the Trustee noted that Section 503(b)(6)\nreferences certain Title 28 costs, specifically mileage and fees\npayable under Chapter 119.     He discussed the illogic of citing\nthese Title 28 costs in Section 503, while citing other Title 28\ncosts, namely those within Chapter 123, directly in Section\n507(a)(1).   Although listing the two sets of Title 28 fees in\ndifferent locations may not be the most logical statutory drafting,\nthey are in fact treated the same, as both receive priority status.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthe Bankruptcy Code indicates that the list of examples is not\n\nexhaustive of possible parties in interest).\n\n      The Trustee suggests that applying the statute in accord with\n\nits   plain    language        would   discourage    bankruptcy      trustees      from\n\nlitigating any objections to claims for fear that the opposing\n\nparty's resulting costs would be given priority.                       The limited\n\nnature of the costs, however, awarded only to the prevailing party\n\nfor expressly delineated expenses, would not logically deter a\n\ntrustee      from     bringing      non-frivolous     objections       to    claims.\n\nMoreover, relying on the plain language of the provision, allowing\n\na   finite    class       of   specifically     designated   costs    to    be    given\n\npriority, does not thwart the general policy that Bankruptcy Code\n\npriority designations are to be construed narrowly in order to\n\nhonor the \"traditional presumption favoring ratable distribution\n\namong all holders of unsecured claims.\" See Woburn Assocs. v. Kahn\n\n(In re Hemingway Transp., Inc.), 954 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(reiterating        the    policy   of   counseling    strict   construction         of\n\npriority payment provisions in order to honor this presumption).\n\n      Finally, the Trustee relies upon In re Hemingway.                          There,\n\nhowever, we confronted the question of whether attorney's fees,\n\narising out of a pre-petition contract, should be given priority\n\nstatus as an administrative expense under Section 503.                       We held\n\nthat the fees did not meet the standard test for prioritization\n\nformulated in Cramer v. Mammoth Mart, Inc. (In re Mammoth Mart,\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fInc.), 536 F.2d 950 (1st Cir. 1976), that \"a request for priority\n\npayment of an administrative expense pursuant to Bankruptcy Code §\n\n503(a) may qualify if (1) the right to payment arose from a\n\npostpetition transaction with the debtor estate, rather than from\n\na     prepetition    transaction      with      the   debtor,    and     (2)      the\n\nconsideration supporting the right to payment was beneficial to the\n\nestate of the debtor.\"        In re Hemingway, 954 F.2d at 5 (citing In\n\nre Mammoth Mart, 536 F.2d at 954).             We noted that the fee award did\n\nnot    stem   from      post-petition    activity      with    the     trustee    in\n\nbankruptcy, but from a pre-petition lease indemnification agreement\n\nwith the      debtor,    suggesting     that    the   result   might    have     been\n\ndifferent if the claim had been for post-petition attorney's fees.\n\nSee id. at 5 n.4.        In the present case, we are confronted not with\n\na request that pre-petition attorney's fees be designated an\n\nadministrative expense and given priority under Section 503, but\n\nrather a request that court-awarded costs arising from post-\n\npetition litigation be given priority, as expressly provided by\n\nSection 507(a)(1).4\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      We note that the holdings of In re Hemingway and In re\nMammoth Mart have been questioned by other courts as unduly\nconfining in classifying attorney's fees as deriving from pre-\npetition conduct. See, e.g., In re Beyond Words Corp., 193 B.R.\n540 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 1996) (holding that attorney's fees arising\nfrom trustee's post-petition litigated claim against a third party\nshould be qualified as administrative expenses and given priority\neven though the claim was based on a pre-petition contract). That\nissue is not, however, before us here.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f     We note that in a case more closely on point, a bankruptcy\n\ncourt gave priority to court costs arising out of a post-petition\n\nlawsuit brought by a trustee.    See In re G.I.C. Gov't Secs., Inc.,\n\n121 B.R. 647 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1990).            In awarding the costs\n\npriority under Section 503, the court interpreted Reading Co. v.\n\nBrown, 391 U.S. 471 (1968), as holding that \"parties subjected to\n\nloss and expense as a result of the administration of a bankruptcy\n\nestate are entitled to be made whole as a matter of fundamental\n\nfairness and should be allowed an administrative claim to implement\n\nthat result.\" In re G.I.C. Gov't Secs., 121 B.R. at 649.         Although\n\nstatutory   language   compels   the    result   here,   its   mandate   is\n\nconsistent with this overriding policy of bankruptcy law.5\n\n     Affirmed and remanded to the bankruptcy court for proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Because we hold that appellees are entitled to their costs\nunder the plain language of Section 507(a)(1), we need not consider\ntheir arguments that they are entitled to costs as an\nadministrative expense independently under Section 503(b) or\npursuant to the \"fundamental fairness\" exception.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

Several defendants settled with the Trustee, but defendants Lazard Freres, Gemini Partners, and Hicks, Muse &amp; Co. did not. After a lengthy jury trial, the defendants prevailed in the district court. The Trustee appealed the district court judgment to this court and we affirmed. <i>See Brandt v.

Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920, the district court awarded them costs for items such as court filing fees, transcription and witness fees, and copying. Lazard Freres was awarded $62,283.62; Gemini Partners, $89,511.40; and Hicks, Muse &amp; Co., $129,367.70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees then corresponded with the Trustee, seeking payment of these court-awarded costs.

Section 507(a)(1), in turn, dictates that the highest priority is afforded to \"administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b) of this title, and any fees and charges assessed against the estate under chapter 123 of title 28.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapter 123 of Title 28 encompasses &#167;&#167; 1911 to 1932, which cover a variety of court-related costs, such as filing and docket fees, service fees, witness fees, and trustee fees in bankruptcy cases. Section 1920, the basis for appellees' costs awards, specifies several categories of litigation-related fees that may be charged as costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trustee claims that it was error to grant priority to the costs awarded to appellees under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920 even though they fall within the plain language of Section 507(a)(1). The Trustee argues that Section 503 creates an ambiguity that obfuscates the meaning of Section 507(a)(1). He questions why Chapter 123 of Title 28 would be referenced in Section 507(a)(1) rather than in Section 503(b), interpreting Section 503(b) to be a \"complete enumeration\" of the types of claims that constitute administrative expenses. The Trustee submits that the Section 507(a)(1) language must have been intended to require that <i>any</i> claim for prioritization of expenses, when founded in Chapter 123 of Title 28, would have to have been incurred in the process of establishing one of the administrative expenses permitted in Section 503(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of Section 507(a)(1), however, requires us to reject the Trustee's construction and to conclude that appellees' claims for costs are entitled to priority status. There is no indication in the statute that the word \"and\" is intended to mean that fees under Chapter 123 receive priority <i>only when</i> incurred in furtherance of a Section 503(b) administrative expense. Moreover, Section 503(b) does not, as the Trustee contends, provide a complete enumeration of allowable costs and fees. Those items listed in Section 503(b) are prefaced by the word \"including,\" which the Bankruptcy Code explains is not meant to have limiting effect. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 102(3) (stating that the word \"including\" in the Bankruptcy Code is not to be construed as a limitation); <i>see, e.g., Vermejo Park Corp. v. Kaiser Coal Corp.</i> (<i>In re Kaiser Steel Corp.</i>), 998 F.2d 783, 788 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that the word \"including\" after \"party in interest\" in Section 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code indicates that the list of examples is not exhaustive of possible parties in interest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trustee suggests that applying the statute in accord with its plain language would discourage bankruptcy trustees from litigating any objections to claims for fear that the opposing party's resulting costs would be given priority. The limited nature of the costs, however, awarded only to the prevailing party for expressly delineated expenses, would not logically deter a trustee from bringing non-frivolous objections to claims. Moreover, relying on the plain language of the provision, allowing a finite class of specifically designated costs to be given priority, does not thwart the general policy that Bankruptcy Code priority designations are to be construed narrowly in order to honor the \"traditional presumption favoring ratable distribution among all holders of unsecured claims.\" <i>See Woburn Assocs. v. Kahn</i> (<i>In re Hemingway Transp., Inc.</i>), 954 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992) (reiterating the policy of counseling strict construction of priority payment provisions in order to honor this presumption).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Trustee relies upon <i>In re Hemingway.</i> There, however, we confronted the question of whether attorney's fees, arising out of a <i>pre-petition contract,</i> should be given priority status as an administrative expense under Section 503. We held that the fees did not meet the standard test for prioritization formulated in <i>Cramer v. Mammoth Mart, Inc.</i> (<i>In re Mammoth Mart, Inc.</i>), 536 F.2d 950 (1st Cir.1976), that \"a request for priority payment of an administrative expense pursuant to Bankruptcy Code &#167; 503(a) may qualify if (1) the right to payment arose from a post-petition transaction with the debtor estate, rather than from a pre-petition transaction with the debtor, and (2) the consideration supporting the right to payment was beneficial to the estate of the debtor.\" <i>In re Hemingway,</i> 954 F.2d at 5 (citing <i>In re Mammoth Mart,</i> 536 F.2d at 954). We noted that the fee award did not stem from post-petition activity with the trustee in bankruptcy, but from a pre-petition lease indemnification agreement with the debtor, suggesting that the result might have been different if the claim had been for post-petition attorney's fees. <i>See id.</i> at 5 n. 4. In the present case, we are confronted not with a request that pre-petition attorney's fees be designated an administrative expense and given priority under Section 503, but rather a request that court-awarded costs arising from post-petition litigation be given priority, as expressly provided by Section 507(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that in a case more closely on point, a bankruptcy court gave priority to court costs arising out of a post-petition lawsuit brought by a trustee. <i>See In re G.I.C. Gov't Secs., Inc.,</i> 121 B.R. 647 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1990). In awarding the costs priority under Section 503, the court interpreted <i>Reading Co. v. Brown,</i> 391 U.S. 471, 88 S.Ct. 1759, 20 L.Ed.2d 751 (1968), as holding that \"parties subjected to loss and expense as a result of the administration of a bankruptcy estate are entitled to be made whole as a matter of fundamental fairness and should be allowed an administrative claim to implement that result.\" <i>In re G.I.C.

Brandt, Jr., Trustee for Healthco International, Inc. (\"Trustee\"), appeals a decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit (\"BAP\") that granted administrative priority to costs awarded to appellees after they successfully defended a post-petition lawsuit brought against them by the Trustee. Finding no error of law, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Healthco International, Inc., filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition in June 1993. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in September 1993, and the Trustee was appointed shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1995, the Trustee brought a lawsuit against several defendants involved in the pre-bankruptcy leveraged buyout of Healthco, alleging that the buyout was a fraudulent transaction. Several defendants settled with the Trustee, but defendants Lazard Freres, Gemini Partners, and Hicks, Muse &amp; Co. did not. After a lengthy jury trial, the defendants prevailed in the district court. The Trustee appealed the district court judgment to this court and we affirmed. <i>See Brandt v. Wand Partners,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199295\"><a href=\"/opinion/199295/brandt-v-wand-partners/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As prevailing parties, the defendants, now appellees, sought to have the costs of litigation, exclusive of attorney's fees, paid by the bankrupt's estate. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920, the district court awarded them costs for items such as court filing fees, transcription and witness fees, and copying. Lazard Freres was awarded $62,283.62; Gemini Partners, $89,511.40; and Hicks, Muse &amp; Co., $129,367.70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees then corresponded with the Trustee, seeking payment of these court-awarded costs. When the Trustee did not respond, the appellees moved the bankruptcy court to grant the cost awards priority status pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, specifically 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 507(a)(1) &amp; 503(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 22, 2001, the bankruptcy court declined appellees' requests, holding that their claims for costs were general, unsecured claims that were not entitled to priority payment. Appellees appealed to the BAP, which reversed the decision of the bankruptcy court on February 1, 2002, holding that appellees' claims were entitled to administrative priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because only issues of statutory interpretation are raised, we review the decision of the bankruptcy court <i>de novo. See Brandt v. Repco Printers &amp; Lithographics, Inc.,</i> (<i>In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197717\"><a href=\"/opinion/197717/healthco-v-repco-printers/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.1997). Although the BAP has reviewed the bankruptcy court decision, \"we exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of that tribunal.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distribution framework for claims against a bankrupt estate under Chapter 7 is established in Section 726(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires that payments first be made pursuant to Section 507. Section 507(a)(1), in turn, dictates that the highest priority is afforded to \"administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b) of this title, and any fees and charges assessed against the estate under chapter 123 of title 28.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapter 123 of Title 28 encompasses &#167;&#167; 1911 to 1932, which cover a variety of court-related costs, such as filing and docket fees, service fees, witness fees, and trustee fees in bankruptcy cases. Section 1920, the basis for appellees' costs awards, specifies several categories of litigation-related fees that may be charged as costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trustee claims that it was error to grant priority to the costs awarded to appellees under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1920 even though they fall within the plain language of Section 507(a)(1). The Trustee argues that Section 503 creates an ambiguity that obfuscates the meaning of Section 507(a)(1). He questions why Chapter 123 of Title 28 would be referenced in Section 507(a)(1) rather than in Section 503(b), interpreting Section 503(b) to be a \"complete enumeration\" of the types of claims that constitute administrative expenses. The Trustee submits that the Section 507(a)(1) language must have been intended to require that <i>any</i> claim for prioritization of expenses, when founded in Chapter 123 of Title 28, would have to have been incurred in the process of establishing one of the administrative expenses permitted in Section 503(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain language of Section 507(a)(1), however, requires us to reject the Trustee's construction and to conclude that appellees' claims for costs are entitled to priority status. There is no indication in the statute that the word \"and\" is intended to mean that fees under Chapter 123 receive priority <i>only when</i> incurred in furtherance of a Section 503(b) administrative expense. Moreover, Section 503(b) does not, as the Trustee contends, provide a complete enumeration of allowable costs and fees. Those items listed in Section 503(b) are prefaced by the word \"including,\" which the Bankruptcy Code explains is not meant to have limiting effect. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 102(3) (stating that the word \"including\" in the Bankruptcy Code is not to be construed as a limitation); <i>see, e.g., Vermejo Park Corp. v. Kaiser Coal Corp.</i> (<i>In re Kaiser Steel Corp.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611038\"><a href=\"/opinion/611038/in-re-kaiser-steel-corporation-debtor-vermejo-park-corporation-vermejo/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span>, 788 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that the word \"including\" after \"party in interest\" in Section 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code indicates that the list of examples is not exhaustive of possible parties in interest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trustee suggests that applying the statute in accord with its plain language would discourage bankruptcy trustees from litigating any objections to claims for fear that the opposing party's resulting costs would be given priority. The limited nature of the costs, however, awarded only to the prevailing party for expressly delineated expenses, would not logically deter a trustee from bringing non-frivolous objections to claims.
