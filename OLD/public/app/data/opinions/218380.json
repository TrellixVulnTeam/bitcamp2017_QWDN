The government now appeals the grant of\n\nthe   motion    to    suppress      and   the    denial     of   its    motion   for\n\nreconsideration.       We reverse and remand with instructions to deny\n\nthe motion to suppress.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n            In August 2007, Special Agent Odette D. Tavares of the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation entered a Spanish-language chat\n\nroom posing as a twelve-year-old Puerto Rican girl.                    She was part\n\nof a covert online investigation aimed at identifying individuals\n\nattempting     to    engage    in     sexual    relations    with      minors.    An\n\nindividual later identified as Crespo approached Tavares in the\n\nchat room and asked if Tavares had \"MSN,\" referring to an instant\n\nmessaging    program.         Tavares     replied   affirmatively,        and    they\n\ncontinued to chat through MSN's \"instant messenger.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f              During this first conversation and others that followed\n\nover the course of approximately the next eight months, Crespo\n\nrepeatedly communicated with Tavares about matters of a sexual\n\nnature despite being informed that she was only twelve years old\n\nand in seventh grade.         During the majority of Crespo's chat\n\nsessions with Tavares, he displayed his bare erect penis to Tavares\n\nat some point.     Crespo also repeatedly asked Tavares to meet with\n\nhim and discussed the sexual activities that would take place if\n\nthey met.     He said, among other things, that (1) he would perform\n\noral sex on Tavares, (2) he and Tavares could watch pornographic\n\nfilms before having sex, (3) the pair would have sex, (4) he would\n\nteach Tavares how to kiss and how to bathe him, and (5) she could\n\nmodel a g-string for him.           Crespo also displayed two photos of\n\nhimself to Tavares and repeatedly asked her to send him photos of\n\nherself.\n\n              In addition, Crespo mentioned or suggested at various\n\npoints that he had engaged in sexual activities with minors before.\n\nDuring one chat, he noted that he had had sex with a fourteen-year-\n\nold   girl.      During   another    conversation,   in   the   context   of\n\nencouraging Tavares to shave her genital area, he told her that he\n\nknew of an individual who shaved her genital area as of the age of\n\neleven.\n\n              Based on information learned as a result of the chats\n\nwith Crespo, information received from the Puerto Rico Telephone\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fCompany, and information gleaned from motor vehicle checks, Tavares\n\nsubmitted    an    affidavit    in   support    of    a   search     warrant.     A\n\nmagistrate   judge    issued    a    search    warrant    for   a    residence   in\n\nMayagüez, Puerto Rico. The warrant authorized agents to search the\n\nresidence    for    evidence,    fruits,      and     instrumentalities     of    a\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1470 (transfer of obscene material to a\n\nminor) and 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) (coercion or enticement of a minor).\n\nThe warrant incorporated \"Attachment B\" of Tavares's affidavit,\n\nwhich   listed,     among   other    items     that    could    be   seized,     the\n\nfollowing:\n\n            2.     Records,   documents,    correspondence\n            (limited to electronic communications), notes\n            and/or any other materials relating to\n            correspondence or contact between [Crespo] and\n            [Tavares], including but not limited to\n            electronic mail, chat logs, and electronic\n            messages.\n\n            3.     Records,    documents,   correspondence\n            (including but not limited to electronic\n            communications), notes, and/or any other\n            materials   relating   to  correspondence   or\n            contact between [Crespo] and individuals\n            purporting to be minors, or any attempt by\n            [Crespo] to induce any minor to engage in\n            illegal sexual[] activity, including but not\n            limited to electronic mail, chat logs, and\n            electronic messages.\n\n            . . . .\n\n            10.    Any magnetic, electronic or optical\n            storage device capable of storing data, such\n            as floppy disks, hard disks, tapes, CD-ROMs,\n            CD-R[s], CD-RWs, DVDs, optical disks, printer\n            or memory buffers, smart cards, PC cards,\n            memory   calculators,   electronic   dialers,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            electronic notebooks, cellular telephones, and\n            personal digital assistants[.]\n\n            . . . .\n\n            12.    Any computer equipment used to encode\n            or store data . . . .\n\nThe main text of Tavares's affidavit referred to child pornography\n\nwhen   it   described   the   parameters   of   the   potential   search   as\n\nincluding, among other things, \"any and all chat logs, child\n\npornography, child erotica, information pertaining to the sexual\n\ninterest in children, [and] images depicting sexual contact between\n\nadults and minors.\" \"Attachment B\" authorized agents to search for\n\n\"[c]orrespondence . . . which refers to . . . child pornography\"\n\nand \"sex toys to include but not limited to pornographic videos.\"\n\n            When Tavares executed the search warrant, she seized,\n\namong other things, a computer system, an external hard drive, and\n\na number of CDs.      The government forensically analyzed the seized\n\nitems and discovered child pornography. The record is not clear as\n\nto exactly where and how each item of child pornography was\n\ndiscovered, or which items were photographs as opposed to videos.1\n\nAccording to Crespo's appellate brief, however, some of the child\n\npornography was found on the external digital media.                At oral\n\nargument, Crespo's counsel explained that child pornography images\n\nwere found on both the computer Crespo used for his chats and on\n\n\n1\n   The magistrate judge did not conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbecause she concluded that the defendant's motion to suppress did\nnot require one.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe external hard drive.          Crespo's counsel also mentioned, in\n\nresponding    to   a   question   about     the    location    of    the     child\n\npornography, that there was a video that was found on the external\n\nhard drive and also on a CD.\n\n          Crespo       was   ultimately     charged   with     (1)    knowingly\n\npossessing both still images and movie files of actual minors\n\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252, and (2) attempting to transfer obscene matters to someone\n\nwho was apparently under the age of sixteen, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1470.      Following his indictment, Crespo filed a motion\n\nto suppress the child pornography evidence on the ground that the\n\nsearch warrant was impermissibly general and authorized government\n\nagents to search for items without probable cause to believe those\n\nitems would be present.2\n\n          A   magistrate      judge   recommended     that    the    court    deny\n\nCrespo's motion to suppress, concluding that there was probable\n\ncause to search for child pornography.            The magistrate judge also\n\nnoted that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, see\n\nUnited States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), applied, and that the\n\ndoctrine of inevitable discovery, see Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431\n\n(1984), might apply.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   As the government noted in its response in opposition to the\nmotion to suppress, Crespo failed to state specifically which items\nhe sought to suppress.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            The    district    court     rejected     the    magistrate's\n\nrecommendation, concluding that Tavares's affidavit did not provide\n\nprobable cause to believe that Crespo's digital media would contain\n\nchild pornography. The district court also concluded that the good\n\nfaith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply. Addressing\n\nthe magistrate's inevitable discovery argument, the district court\n\nnoted that it believed that the plain view doctrine would be a more\n\nappropriate framework than the inevitable discovery doctrine, and\n\nconcluded that the government ultimately could not prevail under\n\nthe plain view doctrine. In a later order denying the government's\n\nmotion    for   reconsideration,   the   district   court   clarified   its\n\nreasoning on this point.      According to the second order, because\n\nthere was no probable cause to search for child pornography, the\n\nlaw enforcement officers who conducted a forensic examination of\n\nCrespo's digital media were not conducting a lawful search, and\n\nthus were not entitled to avail themselves of the plain view\n\nexception to the warrant requirement.       The government now appeals.\n\n                        II.   Standard of Review\n\n            In assessing a district court's decision to grant a\n\nmotion to suppress, \"[w]e review 'the court's findings of fact for\n\nclear error and the application of the law to those facts de\n\nnovo.'\"    United States v. Siciliano, 578 F.3d 61, 67 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (quoting United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 12\n\n(1st Cir. 2008)).\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f                            III.    Discussion\n\n            The government makes three alternative arguments:            (1)\n\nprobable cause supported the warrant's authorization to search\n\nCrespo's   computer   for   child   pornography,   (2)   suppression     was\n\ninappropriate given the good faith doctrine because the agents\n\nacted in objectively reasonable reliance on the warrant, and (3)\n\nthe child pornography evidence should not be suppressed because it\n\nwas discovered in plain view during a lawful search.                   Crespo\n\nresponds, first, that there was no probable cause to seize and\n\nsearch all of Crespo's digital media in order to look for child\n\npornography because Tavares's affidavit did not allege any nexus\n\nbetween Crespo's behavior and possession of child pornography and\n\nbecause the warrant application was overly broad.           In addition,\n\nCrespo contends that the good faith exception is inapplicable\n\nbecause    Tavares,   who   executed   the   warrant,    could   not    have\n\nreasonably believed that there was probable cause to search for\n\nchild pornography.     Finally, Crespo argues that the plain view\n\nexception does not apply because the government had no probable\n\ncause to search the external hard drive or CDs at all.\n\n            We need not decide whether there was probable cause to\n\nsearch any of Crespo's digital media for child pornography because\n\nwe resolve this appeal based on the inevitable discovery doctrine.3\n\n\n3\n   The government did not expressly advance an argument under the\ninevitable discovery doctrine on appeal, and it is unclear whether\nit did so below.    However, the magistrate judge addressed the\n\n                                    -8-\n\fUnder the inevitable discovery doctrine, \"evidence that 'would\n\ninevitably have been discovered without reference to the police\n\nerror or misconduct' may be admitted at trial.\"                 United States v.\n\nHughes, No. 09-1646, 2011 WL 1332061, at *11 (1st Cir. Apr. 8,\n\n2011) (quoting Williams, 467 U.S. at 448).                   \"Such evidence is\n\nadmissible 'so long as (i) the lawful means of its discovery are\n\nindependent      and   would      necessarily     have   been     employed,    (ii)\n\ndiscovery      by   that    means    is   in    fact   inevitable,     and    (iii)\n\napplication of the doctrine in a particular case will not sully the\n\nprophylaxis of the Fourth Amendment.'\"              Id. (quoting United States\n\nv. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 978 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n            In addressing the first prong of the inevitable discovery\n\nstandard, we divide our analysis in order to explain why agents\n\ncould   have    lawfully     searched     (1)    Crespo's    computer,   (2)    the\n\nexternal hard drive, and (3) the CDs, provided they were searching\n\nthose   digital     media   for     certain     categories   of   evidence.     As\n\nexplained below, these searches would have been lawful because\n\n\n\ninevitable discovery doctrine, and Crespo therefore had the\nopportunity to argue that it was inapplicable.     The inevitable\ndiscovery doctrine we employ here is similar in reasoning to the\ngovernment's plain view argument, and it is clear that whether or\nnot computer files fall under the plain view doctrine, \"the\nindependent source and inevitable discovery doctrines apply to the\ncontents of the files.\" United States v. Stabile, 633 F.3d 219,\n237 (3d Cir. 2011).    We may exercise some latitude as to our\ngrounds of decision where related doctrines are at issue. See,\ne.g., United States v. Sánchez, 612 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010)\n(utilizing plain view doctrine rather than community caretaker\ndoctrine).\n\n                                          -9-\n\fthere was probable cause to believe that at least some of the\n\nevidence listed in the warrant application's \"Attachment B\" would\n\nhave been found on these digital media.             Probable cause exists\n\nwhen, \"given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit[,]\n\n. . . there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\n\ncrime will be found in a particular place.\"               United States v.\n\nHicks, 575 F.3d 130, 136 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v.\n\nFeliz, 182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Illinois v. Gates,\n\n462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983))) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n           There   was   certainly    probable    cause   to   believe   that\n\n\"records, documents, [and electronic] correspondence . . . relating\n\nto correspondence or contact between\" Crespo and Tavares -- the\n\nsecond category of evidence in \"Attachment B\" -- would be found on\n\nCrespo's   computer,     because   the      affidavit   included   extensive\n\ndocumentation of online chats between Crespo and Tavares.                This\n\nconclusion is not disputed.          Thus, agents' search of Crespo's\n\ncomputer for this evidence would have been lawful.\n\n           The matter of the external hard drive is slightly more\n\ncomplicated because, according to Crespo's counsel's statements at\n\noral argument, the hard drive had not been accessed in four years\n\nat the time of the search.     Even crediting this statement as true,\n\nhowever, there was still probable cause to believe that evidence of\n\nsimilar interactions with other minors or purported minors -- the\n\nthird category of evidence listed in \"Attachment B\" -- would be on\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe external hard drive.       This is so because Crespo had told\n\nTavares that he had had sex with a fourteen-year-old girl and\n\nmentioned knowing someone who had shaved her genital area as of the\n\nage of eleven.     Furthermore, Crespo cannot argue that records of\n\nthese conversations would not constitute evidence of the crime\n\ncharged because such records, if found, could be used to prove\n\nCrespo's intent.     See United States v. Wolford, 386 F. App'x 479,\n\n484 (5th Cir. 2010) (chat transcripts with anonymous parties found\n\non defendant's computer admissible during trial for enticement of\n\na minor to show motive and intent); United States v. Chase, 367 F.\n\nApp'x 979, 982 (11th Cir. 2010) (transcript of chat in which\n\ndefendant described molestation of a child admissible to show\n\nintent to entice a minor); United States v. McDarrah, 351 F. App'x\n\n558, 563 (2d Cir. 2009) (\"other act\" evidence admissible during\n\ntrial for attempted enticement because it was relevant to knowledge\n\nand intent and could be used to show that conduct was not a mistake\n\nor accident).    Thus, the warrant here also properly authorized\n\nagents to search the external hard drive for, at the very least,\n\nevidence   related   to   Crespo's   contacts   with   other   minors   or\n\npurported minors.    Similarly, even assuming that the searched CDs\n\nhad also not been accessed for a number of years, there was\n\nprobable cause to believe that, at the very least, evidence of\n\nthese older communications would be on the CDs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            Regarding the second prong, we conclude that in the\n\ncourse   of    searching     Crespo's    computer     for   evidence    of    his\n\ninteractions with Tavares and searching the external hard drive and\n\nCDs for evidence of similar interactions with other individuals,\n\ngovernment    agents    would   have    inevitably    discovered   the       child\n\npornography.     When searching digital media for \"chats\" and other\n\nevidence of enticement, government agents cannot simply search\n\ncertain folders or types of files for keywords.4            First, like paper\n\nfiles, digital files may be mislabeled.          See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Highbarger, 380 F. App'x 127, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) (\"Suspects can\n\neasily hide information by mislabeling files, and, therefore, law\n\nenforcement officials are not required to accept a suspect's\n\ndesignation of what is contained in a particular file.\"); United\n\nStates v. Williams, 592 F.3d 511, 522 (4th Cir. 2010) (\"Surely, the\n\nowner of a computer, who is engaged in criminal conduct on that\n\ncomputer,     will     not   label      his   files    to    indicate        their\n\ncriminality.\"); United States v. Hill, 459 F.3d 966, 978 (9th Cir.\n\n2006) (\"Forcing police to limit their searches to files that the\n\nsuspect has labeled in a particular way would be much like saying\n\npolice may not seize a plastic bag containing a powdery white\n\nsubstance if it is labeled 'flour' or 'talcum powder.'\" (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1090 (C.D. Cal.\n\n\n4\n   Although there may be limitations on how government agents may\nsearch digital media in a case like this one, we need not address\nthose limitations here.\n\n                                       -12-\n\f2004))). The suffixes or extensions of file names, which generally\n\nindicate file types, may be manipulated to disguise the true file\n\ntypes.    See Hill, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 1090 (\"Criminals will do all\n\nthey can to conceal contraband, including the simple expedient of\n\nchanging the names and extensions of files to disguise their\n\ncontent from the casual observer.\"); United States v. Harding, 273\n\nF. Supp. 2d 411, 424 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"Files containing graphical\n\nimages may be assigned file extensions, including 'TXT', that\n\ntypically are assigned to text files. Files containing text may be\n\nassigned file extensions, including 'JPG' or 'GIF', that typically\n\nare given to graphical image files.\"); United States v. Gray, 78 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 524, 529 (E.D.

We reverse and remand with instructions to deny\n\nthe motion to suppress.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n            In August 2007, Special Agent Odette D. Tavares of the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation entered a Spanish-language chat\n\nroom posing as a twelve-year-old Puerto Rican girl.                    She was part\n\nof a covert online investigation aimed at identifying individuals\n\nattempting     to    engage    in     sexual    relations    with      minors.    An\n\nindividual later identified as Crespo approached Tavares in the\n\nchat room and asked if Tavares had \"MSN,\" referring to an instant\n\nmessaging    program.         Tavares     replied   affirmatively,        and    they\n\ncontinued to chat through MSN's \"instant messenger.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f              During this first conversation and others that followed\n\nover the course of approximately the next eight months, Crespo\n\nrepeatedly communicated with Tavares about matters of a sexual\n\nnature despite being informed that she was only twelve years old\n\nand in seventh grade.         During the majority of Crespo's chat\n\nsessions with Tavares, he displayed his bare erect penis to Tavares\n\nat some point.     Crespo also repeatedly asked Tavares to meet with\n\nhim and discussed the sexual activities that would take place if\n\nthey met.     He said, among other things, that (1) he would perform\n\noral sex on Tavares, (2) he and Tavares could watch pornographic\n\nfilms before having sex, (3) the pair would have sex, (4) he would\n\nteach Tavares how to kiss and how to bathe him, and (5) she could\n\nmodel a g-string for him.           Crespo also displayed two photos of\n\nhimself to Tavares and repeatedly asked her to send him photos of\n\nherself.\n\n              In addition, Crespo mentioned or suggested at various\n\npoints that he had engaged in sexual activities with minors before.\n\nDuring one chat, he noted that he had had sex with a fourteen-year-\n\nold   girl.      During   another    conversation,   in   the   context   of\n\nencouraging Tavares to shave her genital area, he told her that he\n\nknew of an individual who shaved her genital area as of the age of\n\neleven.\n\n              Based on information learned as a result of the chats\n\nwith Crespo, information received from the Puerto Rico Telephone\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fCompany, and information gleaned from motor vehicle checks, Tavares\n\nsubmitted    an    affidavit    in   support    of    a   search     warrant.     A\n\nmagistrate   judge    issued    a    search    warrant    for   a    residence   in\n\nMayagüez, Puerto Rico. The warrant authorized agents to search the\n\nresidence    for    evidence,    fruits,      and     instrumentalities     of    a\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1470 (transfer of obscene material to a\n\nminor) and 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) (coercion or enticement of a minor).\n\nThe warrant incorporated \"Attachment B\" of Tavares's affidavit,\n\nwhich   listed,     among   other    items     that    could    be   seized,     the\n\nfollowing:\n\n            2.     Records,   documents,    correspondence\n            (limited to electronic communications), notes\n            and/or any other materials relating to\n            correspondence or contact between [Crespo] and\n            [Tavares], including but not limited to\n            electronic mail, chat logs, and electronic\n            messages.\n\n            3.

Any computer equipment used to encode\n            or store data . . . .\n\nThe main text of Tavares's affidavit referred to child pornography\n\nwhen   it   described   the   parameters   of   the   potential   search   as\n\nincluding, among other things, \"any and all chat logs, child\n\npornography, child erotica, information pertaining to the sexual\n\ninterest in children, [and] images depicting sexual contact between\n\nadults and minors.\" \"Attachment B\" authorized agents to search for\n\n\"[c]orrespondence . . . which refers to . . . child pornography\"\n\nand \"sex toys to include but not limited to pornographic videos.\"\n\n            When Tavares executed the search warrant, she seized,\n\namong other things, a computer system, an external hard drive, and\n\na number of CDs.      The government forensically analyzed the seized\n\nitems and discovered child pornography. The record is not clear as\n\nto exactly where and how each item of child pornography was\n\ndiscovered, or which items were photographs as opposed to videos.1\n\nAccording to Crespo's appellate brief, however, some of the child\n\npornography was found on the external digital media.                At oral\n\nargument, Crespo's counsel explained that child pornography images\n\nwere found on both the computer Crespo used for his chats and on\n\n\n1\n   The magistrate judge did not conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbecause she concluded that the defendant's motion to suppress did\nnot require one.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe external hard drive.          Crespo's counsel also mentioned, in\n\nresponding    to   a   question   about     the    location    of    the     child\n\npornography, that there was a video that was found on the external\n\nhard drive and also on a CD.\n\n          Crespo       was   ultimately     charged   with     (1)    knowingly\n\npossessing both still images and movie files of actual minors\n\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252, and (2) attempting to transfer obscene matters to someone\n\nwho was apparently under the age of sixteen, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1470.      Following his indictment, Crespo filed a motion\n\nto suppress the child pornography evidence on the ground that the\n\nsearch warrant was impermissibly general and authorized government\n\nagents to search for items without probable cause to believe those\n\nitems would be present.2\n\n          A   magistrate      judge   recommended     that    the    court    deny\n\nCrespo's motion to suppress, concluding that there was probable\n\ncause to search for child pornography.            The magistrate judge also\n\nnoted that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, see\n\nUnited States v.

The district court also concluded that the good\n\nfaith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply. Addressing\n\nthe magistrate's inevitable discovery argument, the district court\n\nnoted that it believed that the plain view doctrine would be a more\n\nappropriate framework than the inevitable discovery doctrine, and\n\nconcluded that the government ultimately could not prevail under\n\nthe plain view doctrine. In a later order denying the government's\n\nmotion    for   reconsideration,   the   district   court   clarified   its\n\nreasoning on this point.      According to the second order, because\n\nthere was no probable cause to search for child pornography, the\n\nlaw enforcement officers who conducted a forensic examination of\n\nCrespo's digital media were not conducting a lawful search, and\n\nthus were not entitled to avail themselves of the plain view\n\nexception to the warrant requirement.

Discussion\n\n            The government makes three alternative arguments:            (1)\n\nprobable cause supported the warrant's authorization to search\n\nCrespo's   computer   for   child   pornography,   (2)   suppression     was\n\ninappropriate given the good faith doctrine because the agents\n\nacted in objectively reasonable reliance on the warrant, and (3)\n\nthe child pornography evidence should not be suppressed because it\n\nwas discovered in plain view during a lawful search.                   Crespo\n\nresponds, first, that there was no probable cause to seize and\n\nsearch all of Crespo's digital media in order to look for child\n\npornography because Tavares's affidavit did not allege any nexus\n\nbetween Crespo's behavior and possession of child pornography and\n\nbecause the warrant application was overly broad.           In addition,\n\nCrespo contends that the good faith exception is inapplicable\n\nbecause    Tavares,   who   executed   the   warrant,    could   not    have\n\nreasonably believed that there was probable cause to search for\n\nchild pornography.     Finally, Crespo argues that the plain view\n\nexception does not apply because the government had no probable\n\ncause to search the external hard drive or CDs at all.\n\n            We need not decide whether there was probable cause to\n\nsearch any of Crespo's digital media for child pornography because\n\nwe resolve this appeal based on the inevitable discovery doctrine.3\n\n\n3\n   The government did not expressly advance an argument under the\ninevitable discovery doctrine on appeal, and it is unclear whether\nit did so below.

Thus, agents' search of Crespo's\n\ncomputer for this evidence would have been lawful.\n\n           The matter of the external hard drive is slightly more\n\ncomplicated because, according to Crespo's counsel's statements at\n\noral argument, the hard drive had not been accessed in four years\n\nat the time of the search.     Even crediting this statement as true,\n\nhowever, there was still probable cause to believe that evidence of\n\nsimilar interactions with other minors or purported minors -- the\n\nthird category of evidence listed in \"Attachment B\" -- would be on\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe external hard drive.       This is so because Crespo had told\n\nTavares that he had had sex with a fourteen-year-old girl and\n\nmentioned knowing someone who had shaved her genital area as of the\n\nage of eleven.     Furthermore, Crespo cannot argue that records of\n\nthese conversations would not constitute evidence of the crime\n\ncharged because such records, if found, could be used to prove\n\nCrespo's intent.     See United States v. Wolford, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Chase, 367 F.\n\nApp'x 979, 982 (11th Cir. 2010) (transcript of chat in which\n\ndefendant described molestation of a child admissible to show\n\nintent to entice a minor); United States v.

Thus, the warrant here also properly authorized\n\nagents to search the external hard drive for, at the very least,\n\nevidence   related   to   Crespo's   contacts   with   other   minors   or\n\npurported minors.    Similarly, even assuming that the searched CDs\n\nhad also not been accessed for a number of years, there was\n\nprobable cause to believe that, at the very least, evidence of\n\nthese older communications would be on the CDs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            Regarding the second prong, we conclude that in the\n\ncourse   of    searching     Crespo's    computer     for   evidence    of    his\n\ninteractions with Tavares and searching the external hard drive and\n\nCDs for evidence of similar interactions with other individuals,\n\ngovernment    agents    would   have    inevitably    discovered   the       child\n\npornography.     When searching digital media for \"chats\" and other\n\nevidence of enticement, government agents cannot simply search\n\ncertain folders or types of files for keywords.4            First, like paper\n\nfiles, digital files may be mislabeled.
