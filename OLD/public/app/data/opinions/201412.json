Pro se inmate James Ware appeals a district\n\ncourt order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant prison\n\nofficials    based   on     Ware's   failure   to   exhaust    administrative\n\nremedies as required by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).           We affirm, adding only the following\n\ncomments.1\n\n             First, Ware has not shown that the district court erred\n\nin   failing    to   find    that    defendants     waived    the   exhaustion\n\nrequirement.     Defendants raised a failure-to-exhaust defense in\n\ntheir answer and in a renewed motion for summary judgment.                Ware\n\ndid not assert any prejudice, nor do we perceive any, as he was on\n\nnotice of the exhaustion requirement and had ample time to oppose\n\nthe renewed summary judgment motion.           Thus, the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in considering the defendants' failure-to-\n\nexhaust defense.      See Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 98 F.3d 664,\n\n668 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that decision on waiver of affirmative\n\ndefense normally is within district court's discretion).\n\n             Also, Ware has not shown that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that Ware had not exhausted his administrative remedies\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court's earlier grant of partial summary\njudgment for defendants is not properly before us, as Ware does not\npresent any developed argumentation regarding that earlier\ndecision. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990) (noting that failure to present argument on issue waives\nchallenge to it).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fwith respect to the three grievances at issue.
