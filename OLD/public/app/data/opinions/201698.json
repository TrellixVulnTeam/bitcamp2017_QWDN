Pina\n\nchallenges his jury convictions for being a felon in possession of\n\na firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), for possession of\n\ncocaine base with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and for possession of a firearm in furtherance\n\nof    a   drug   trafficking      crime,    in   violation    of    18    U.S.C.     §\n\n924(c)(1)(A).      Based upon the following, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n                                           I.\n\n             Although    Pina     raises    multiple   issues      on    appeal,    we\n\ndiscuss only one:        did the district court abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting the opinion testimony of the government’s drug expert\n\nwitness, Brockton Police Sergeant Kevin O’Connell?1                      See United\n\nStates v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1995)(the trial court\n\nhas   discretion    to    admit    or   reject    expert     testimony     and     its\n\ndetermination is reviewable only for an abuse of that discretion).2\n\n\n\n                                        II.\n\n             O’Connell testified that “the crack cocaine and other\n\nitems found” at the apartment, such as scales, packages of cash,\n\n\n1\n    All other issues are plainly meritless and, therefore, are\naffirmed without discussion.\n2\n   Pina does not challenge O’Connell’s expert qualifications. Nor\ndoes he challenge the admission into evidence under Fed. R. Evid.\n702 by the district court of each of the specific items discussed\nby O’Connell in his expert testimony.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fand Glad sandwich baggies, “were consistent with distribution.”\n\nR2 at 75.3     Pina claims that O’Connell’s testimony was irrelevant\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 401, prejudicial and non-probative under Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403, and beyond the scope of Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n              Pina contends that, as these items have many innocent\n\nuses, their presence does not make his involvement with drug\n\ntrafficking more likely.         Therefore, because the presence of these\n\nitems    is   also    “not    inconsistent    with”      the   personal    use    or\n\npossession     of    drugs,   this    testimony    is    neither    relevant     nor\n\nprobative to the jury.\n\n              Pina claims that although such specific phraseology,\n\n“consistent with” drug trafficking, has been examined many times by\n\nthis    circuit     in   general     terms,   it   has   never     been   squarely\n\naddressed.     But see United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 960 (1stt\n\nCir. 1989) (where drug expert’s opinion that drug packaging was\n\n“consistent with” distribution was deemed probative and relevant as\n\nto defendant’s intent).         Pina argues, however, that in this close\n\ncircumstantial case, the jury verdict would in all likelihood have\n\nbeen different, had O’Connell’s expert testimony been excluded.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Citations to the record are in the following format: R [volume\nnumber] at [page number].\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                                   III.\n\n          The government contends that the record reads differently\n\nthan Pina suggests.    We agree.\n\n          Among   other    things,    O’Connell   testified   on   direct\n\nexamination in this manner:\n\n          Q.   Based on the items that you’ve described\n\n          previously as having seen, have you formed an\n\n          opinion, with respect to the crack cocaine and\n\n          the other items found, whether or not that\n\n          crack cocaine is – and the other items is\n\n          consistent with the intent to distribute crack\n\n          cocaine?\n\n          [Defense Counsel]:     Objection.\n\n          THE COURT:      Sustained as to the form of the\n\n          question.\n\n          Q.   Have you formed an opinion with respect to\n\n          those items as to whether it’s consistent with\n\n          distribution versus personal possession?\n\n          A.   I have.\n\n          Q.   And, what is that opinion?\n\n          A.   It is consistent with distribution.\n\nR2 at 74-75.\n\n          The original question posed by the government to the drug\n\nexpert was, based upon the drugs and other items seized from the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fapartment, “do you have an opinion as to whether or not these items\n\nare consistent with an intent to distribute crack cocaine?”                      R2 at\n\n74-75.     Objection was made by defense counsel.              R2 at 75.         That\n\nobjection was sustained by the district court.                Id.\n\n            The    question     was   then     properly      rephrased      by    the\n\ngovernment to eliminate any reference or speculation as to the\n\ndefendant’s intent.       R2 at 75.     The drug expert was asked whether\n\nor not he had formed an opinion with respect to whether or not\n\nthose items were “consistent with drug distribution versus personal\n\npossession.”      Id.    He answered in the affirmative.            Id.    The drug\n\nexpert was then asked to give his opinion.             Id.   It was his opinion\n\nthat the items found in the apartment, (the crack cocaine [R2 at\n\n65-69], the scales [R2 at 70-72], the baggies [R2 at 69-70] and the\n\npackages    of    cash   [R2   at   72-74]),    were   consistent         with   drug\n\ntrafficking.      R2 at 75.\n\n            It is clear from a reading of the entire record that\n\nO’Connell did not testify that all the items, such as the scales,\n\nwere inconsistent with personal possession.               Nor did he offer an\n\nopinion on Pina’s intent with respect to the crack cocaine.                        He\n\nmerely gave his opinion, based upon his training and experience,\n\nthat the drugs and collection of items found in Pina’s apartment\n\nwere, in the aggregate, consistent with the distribution of crack\n\ncocaine as opposed to mere possession.           See Ladd, 885 F.2d at 960;\n\nsee also Valle, 72 F.3d at 216 (expert testimony is appropriate\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fprovided the expert is not offering his or her opinion on the\n\ndefendant’s specific intent but only laying out critical facts upon\n\nwhich a jury can determine the defendant’s intent).\n\n            O’Connell, after defense counsel’s sustained objection,\n\ntestified properly in accordance with the rules of evidence.   This\n\nends the case on appeal.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
