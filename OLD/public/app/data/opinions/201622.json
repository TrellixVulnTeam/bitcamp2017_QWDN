Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                    Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                  and DiClerico, Jr., District Judge.*\n\n\n\n     Nelson Robles Díaz for appellants.\n     Francisco A. Besosa, with whom Lourdes I. Morera-Ladón, Adsuar\nMuñiz Goyco & Besosa, P.S.C., Michael E. Baughman, and Dechert,\nLLP, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             June 3, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    This appeal began as a challenge\n\nto the merits of a grant of summary judgment in the underlying\n\nbreach of contract case.   At oral argument, we shifted the focus of\n\nthe appeal by inquiring sua sponte into the possibility that the\n\nparties were not completely diverse and that the district court\n\ntherefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case.        We\n\nordered supplemental briefing regarding the citizenship of appellee\n\nManny, Moe & Jack Corp., Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Pep Boys PR\"), and\n\nthen, while retaining appellate jurisdiction, remanded for an\n\nevidentiary hearing on the same subject.       With the benefit of\n\nextensive fact-finding by the district court, we now conclude that\n\nPep Boys PR has its principal place of business in, and is thus a\n\ncitizen of, Puerto Rico.   Because the appellants are also citizens\n\nof Puerto Rico, the parties are not diverse.     We therefore vacate\n\nthe judgment and, given the absence of federal subject matter\n\njurisdiction, remand to the district court with instructions to\n\nremand the case to the court from which it was improvidently\n\nremoved.   We also clarify our law regarding the principal place of\n\nbusiness determination.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           On March 15, 2002, appellants Energy Tech Corp. (\"ETC\")\n\nand Tomas Díaz Rodríguez sued automotive supply retailer Pep Boys\n\nPR and its parent company, Pep Boys Corp. (\"Pep Boys\"), in the\n\nCourt of First Instance of Puerto Rico, Bayamón Superior Division.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fThe complaint alleged (1) that Pep Boys PR was liable for breaching\n\na contract under which it was to serve as the exclusive Puerto Rico\n\nseller of an ETC product called Super FuelMax and (2) that Pep Boys\n\nhad tortiously interfered in the relationship between ETC and Pep\n\nBoys PR by inducing Pep Boys PR to break the contract.\n\n           The appellees removed the case to federal court on April\n\n9, 2002.   The notice of removal asserted that\n\n      [d]efendants . . . were incorporated in states other than\n      Puerto Rico (Pennsylvania and Delaware), and have their\n      principal   places    of   business   in    Philadelphia,\n      Pennsylvania.   This action, therefore, may be removed\n      from the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to\n      this District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(b).\n\nThe   appellants   did   not   challenge   the   existence   of   diversity\n\njurisdiction at this juncture, and the appellees answered the\n\ncomplaint on May 8, 2002.\n\n           On February 28, 2003, the appellees filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment; on March 11, 2003, the appellants filed a motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment.        Based on the recommendation of a\n\nmagistrate judge, the district court granted the appellees' motion\n\nfor summary judgment, denied the appellants' motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment, and filed an order dismissing the suit with\n\nprejudice.   See Díaz-Rodríguez v. Pep Boys Corp., No. 02-10536\n\n(D.P.R. Mar. 29, 2004).    The appellants filed a notice of appeal on\n\nApril 28, 2004.\n\n           The briefs filed by the parties before oral argument were\n\ndirected entirely to the merits of the district court's grant of\n\n                                   -3-\n\fsummary judgment.     Those arguments are predicated, however, on the\n\nexistence of subject matter jurisdiction.         We cannot consider the\n\nmerits of the district court's ruling on appeal if it did not have\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate the issues before it in the first\n\ninstance.     See, e.g., Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico, 352 F.3d\n\n490, 495 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"Because federal courts are powerless to\n\nact in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an\n\nunflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to\n\npursue them on our own initiative.\").\n\n             The only conceivable basis for federal jurisdiction in\n\nthis case is diversity of citizenship.             28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).\n\n\"Diversity    jurisdiction    exists     only   when   there    is   complete\n\ndiversity, that is, when no plaintiff is a citizen of the same\n\nstate as any defendant.\"      Gabriel v. Preble, 396 F.3d 10, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    For diversity purposes, a corporation is a citizen of\n\nboth the state where it is incorporated and \"the State where it has\n\nits principal place of business.\"         Id. § 1332(c)(1).      As used in\n\nthe diversity statute, the term \"state\" includes Puerto Rico.             Id.\n\n§ 1332(e).\n\n            Neither   party   questioned    the   existence     of   complete\n\ndiversity during the district court proceedings.               Nevertheless,\n\nconcerned about the possibility that ETC and Pep Boys PR were non-\n\ndiverse, we raised the jurisdictional issue sua sponte at oral\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\farguments and ordered supplemental briefing.1               Cf. In re Perry, 391\n\nF.3d       282,    284-85    (1st   Cir.   2004)    (requesting,     sua   sponte,\n\nsupplemental briefing on a jurisdictional issue).                   For the first\n\ntime in their supplemental brief, the appellants took the position\n\nthat Pep Boys PR has its principal place of business in Puerto\n\nRico, where all of its retail stores are located, and therefore\n\nthat it is not diverse from the appellants, who are citizens of\n\nPuerto Rico.          The appellees disagreed, maintaining that Pep Boys\n\nPR's principal place of business is in Philadelphia, where almost\n\nall of its officers are located and its corporate support functions\n\nare based.2\n\n                  Viewing   the   supplemental     briefs   as   inconclusive,   we\n\nretained appellate jurisdiction while remanding to the district\n\ncourt to hold an evidentiary hearing as to the locus of Pep Boys\n\nPR's principal place of business.                The district court complied,\n\nholding a hearing and making extensive findings of fact.                   We now\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Pep Boys PR is the only party whose citizenship is in\nquestion; it is undisputed that the parties are otherwise diverse.\n       2\n      The district court supportably found that all but one of Pep\nBoys PR's directors and officers are located in Philadelphia and\nthat many of the decisions regarding Pep Boys PR's operations are\nmade in Philadelphia. Pep Boys PR also had one officer located in\nPuerto Rico. When this suit was removed to federal court in 2002,\nthe officer in Puerto Rico was the Divisional Vice President, who\nsupervised the day-to-day operations of Pep Boys PR's stores.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fdetermine Pep Boys PR's principal place of business de novo based\n\non the district court's factual findings.3\n\n                                     II.\n\n          We   have     identified   three      tests    for   determining    a\n\ncorporation's principal place of business:\n\n     One is the \"nerve center\" test which searches for the\n     location from where the activities of the corporation are\n     controlled and directed.    The two other tests are the\n     \"center of corporate activity\" test, i.e., where the\n     corporation's day-to-day management takes place; and the\n     \"locus of the operations of the corporation\" test, i.e.,\n     where the bulk of the corporation's actual physical\n     operations are located.\n\nTopp v. CompAir Inc., 814 F.2d 830, 834 (1st Cir. 1987) (internal\n\ncitations omitted); see also de Walker v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 569\n\nF.2d 1169, 1171-72 (1st Cir. 1978).\n\n          While   the    tests   that      we   have    identified   are   \"not\n\nnecessarily inconsistent,\" Topp, 814 F.2d at 834, their differing\n\nemphases mean that, in some cases, they will point to different\n\nlocations as the principal place of business.               For example, Pep\n\nBoys PR is essentially controlled from Philadelphia but all of its\n\nretail stores are located in Puerto Rico.              The nerve center test\n\nmight point to Philadelphia as Pep Boys PR's principal place of\n\n     3\n      On reflection, the better practice might have been to ask the\ndistrict court to make the legal determination in the first\ninstance. See Taber Partners, I v. Merit Builders, Inc., 987 F.2d\n57, 60 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"A district court's determination of\ncitizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is a mixed\nquestion of law and fact.\").\n\n                                     -6-\n\fbusiness, see id. at 837-38 (listing eight factors to consider in\n\napplying the nerve center test) while the locus of operations test\n\nmight point to Puerto Rico, where all of the corporation's physical\n\nassets are located.       This result would be inconsistent with the\n\nrule that a corporation can have only one principal place of\n\nbusiness.    See Capitol Indem. Corp. v. Russellville Steel Co., 367\n\nF.3d 831, 835 (8th Cir. 2004).           We must thus determine which test\n\ncontrols in this case.\n\n            First Circuit precedent offers only limited guidance on\n\nhow to determine a corporation's principal place of business when\n\nthe three tests point to different locations.             Our cases indicate\n\nthat the nerve center test governs in the context of a corporation\n\nwith \"complex and farflung activities\" or a corporation without\n\nphysical operations (e.g., a holding company).             Topp, 814 F.2d at\n\n834.      This   rule   implies   that    if   a   corporation    has   physical\n\noperations and is not \"farflung,\" one of the other tests -- the\n\ncenter of corporate activity or the locus of operations -- must\n\ngovern.     See PayPhone LLC v. Brooks Fiber Communications of R.I.,\n\n126 F. Supp. 2d 175, 182-83 (D.R.I. 2001).\n\n            Pep Boys PR has physical operations and is not a complex\n\nor far flung corporation.         Therefore, the nerve center test does\n\nnot control and we must look instead to the center of corporate\n\nactivity test or the locus of operations test.                   We have never\n\nexplained, however, a basis for choosing between these two tests.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fSee Savis, Inc. v. Warner Lambert, Inc., 967 F. Supp. 632, 637\n\n(D.P.R. 1997) (noting a lack of case law on point).\n\n             Given our recognition of the nerve center and locus of\n\noperations tests, the center of corporate activity test is largely\n\nredundant.     In some cases, it involves \"an analysis and result\n\nsimilar to the one employed . . . under the rubric of the nerve\n\ncenter test.\"       Topp, 814 F.2d at 834 n.3; see also Taber Partners,\n\n987   F.2d    at    63     &    n.8.     In     other   cases,   it   is   largely\n\nindistinguishable from the locus of operations test.                  See Savis,\n\n967 F. Supp. at 637 (noting that no other circuit has recognized\n\nthe center of corporate activity and locus of operations tests as\n\ndistinct).     There does not appear to be any context in which the\n\ncenter of corporate activity test supplies an analysis different\n\nfrom that available under one of the other two tests.\n\n             Our    case       law   confirms    this   redundancy.        We   have\n\nexplicitly alluded to the center of corporate activity test in only\n\nfour cases.        In two of those cases, we concluded that all three\n\ntests would point to the same location as the principal place of\n\nbusiness.     See Rodriguez v. S K & F Co., 833 F.2d 8, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (per curiam); de Walker, 569 F.2d at 1172.                 In the other two\n\ncases, which involved corporations without physical operations and\n\nwhich, therefore, did not lend themselves to application of the\n\nlocus of operations test, we concluded that the nerve center and\n\ncenter of corporate activity test would point to the same principal\n\n                                         -8-\n\fplace of business.     See Taber Partners, 987 F.2d at 63 & n.8; Topp,\n\n814 F.2d at 834 n.3.\n\n           In summary, the case law reveals that our references to\n\nthe center of corporate activity test have always been dicta --\n\nthat is, comments \"made while delivering a judicial opinion, but\n\n. . . unnecessary to the decision in the case.\"                    Black's Law\n\nDictionary (8th ed. 2004) (defining obiter dictum).               Indeed, even\n\nthe case which initially referred to the center of corporate\n\nactivity test did not treat that test as determinative.                    See de\n\nWalker,   569   F.2d   at    1173    (holding    that   the   district   court's\n\ndiversity determination was erroneous because \"plaintiff did not\n\nestablish that [the defendant corporation's] 'nerve center' or any\n\nsubstantial     part   of    its    operations   was    outside   Puerto    Rico\"\n\n(emphasis added)).          Moreover, it appears that our dicta in this\n\narea has been more confusing than helpful.              See Caribbean Mushroom\n\nCo. v. Gov't Dev. Bank, 980 F. Supp. 620, 626 (D.P.R. 1997)\n\n(\"Despite setting up a variety of distinct tests . . . the\n\njurisprudence from this circuit provides little guidance as to when\n\neach test should apply, leading many courts facing the issue to\n\napply each and every available test in order to avoid having to\n\nchoose which test to apply.\").\n\n           Unlike a holding, which binds newly constituted panels in\n\na multi-panel circuit, see Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d\n\n344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004), dicta \"is not binding on future panels.\"\n\n                                        -9-\n\fKosereis v. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d 207, 213 (1st Cir. 2003); see\n\nalso Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d\n\n453, 459 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Dictum constitutes neither the law of\n\nthe case nor the stuff of binding precedent.\").            In other words,\n\nalthough a newly constituted panel ordinarily may not disregard the\n\ndecision of a previous panel, principles of stare decisis do not\n\npreclude us from disclaiming dicta in a prior decision. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003).         We do\n\nso here with regard to the center of corporate activity test.             In\n\nthe future, district courts required to determine a corporation's\n\nprincipal   place   of   business   should   not   apply   the   center   of\n\ncorporate activity test. Instead, they should use either the nerve\n\ncenter test or the locus of operations test, depending on the\n\ncharacteristics of the corporation.\n\n            It is well settled in this circuit that the nerve center\n\ntest applies only to farflung corporations or corporations without\n\nphysical operations.     See Topp, 814 F.2d at 834.        We now add that\n\nthe principal place of business of a corporation that has the bulk\n\nof its physical operations in one state is to be determined under\n\nthe locus of operations test, even if the corporation's executive\n\noffices are in another state.       This holding is consistent with the\n\napproach adopted by district courts in the First Circuit in recent\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fyears.4        See,   e.g.,   Payphone    LLC,   126   F.   Supp.   2d   at   183\n\n(determining a telephone company's principal place of business\n\naccording to the location of its facilities and equipment, even\n\nthough corporate activity was centered elsewhere); Savis, 967 F.\n\nSupp. at 638 (concluding that \"[w]here a corporation is engaged in\n\na single enterprise, substantially all of whose operations occur in\n\none state, even though policy and administrative decisions are made\n\nelsewhere, the state of operations is the corporation's principal\n\nplace     of     business\"     (quoting     Santana     Salgado     v.   DuPont\n\nPharmaceutical, Inc., 664 F.Supp. 644, 645 (D.P.R. 1987)).                    More\n\nimportantly, it is consistent with the policies underlying 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332, the statute creating diversity jurisdiction.                      A\n\nprimary purpose of diversity jurisdiction is to shield foreign\n\nparties from the prejudice they might face as outsiders in state\n\ncourt.    \"Thus, the principal place of business should be the place\n\n\n     4\n      The framework we set forth here also has much in common with\nthe sensible \"total activity\" test adopted by a number of our\nsister circuits. See Savis, 967 F. Supp. at 637 n.8 (collecting\ncases). Under the total activity test,\n\n        (1) when considering a corporation whose operations are\n        far flung, the sole nerve center of that corporation is\n        more significant in determining principal place of\n        business; (2) when a corporation has its sole operation\n        in one state and executive offices in another, the place\n        of activity is regarded as more significant; but (3) when\n        the activity of a corporation is passive and the \"brain\"\n        of the corporation is in another state, the situs of the\n        corporation's \"brain\" is given greater significance.\n\nJ.A. Olson Co. v. City of Winona, 818 F.2d 401, 411 (5th Cir. 1987)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n                                     -11-\n\fwhere the corporation conducts the most activity that is visible\n\nand impacts the public, so that it is least likely to suffer from\n\nprejudice against outsiders.\"       Indus. Tectonics, Inc. v. Aero\n\nAlloy, 912 F.2d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\n          We   have   described   the    locus   of   operations    test   as\n\n\"search[ing] for the location of the corporation's actual physical\n\noperations.\" Taber Partners, 987 F.2d at 61. The district court's\n\nsupportable findings of fact in this case clearly indicate that Pep\n\nBoys PR's actual physical operations are located in Puerto Rico.\n\nPep Boys PR is a retailer dealing in automotive supplies.             All of\n\nits physical assets, including its 27 stores and its inventory, are\n\nlocated in Puerto Rico, as are its 1,214 employees.           Pep Boys PR\n\ndoes not operate, own, or lease stores in any other jurisdiction.\n\nThe corporation owns the equipment used in its Puerto Rico stores\n\nand owns or leases approximately fifty trucks to provide service to\n\nits commercial clients there.       In 2002, the year this suit was\n\nremoved to federal court, Pep Boys PR had a total gross income of\n\n$56 million, all generated by sales in Puerto Rico.                In short,\n\nPuerto Rico is clearly the locus of Pep Boys PR's operations.\n\n          It is true that many of Pep Boys PR's administrative and\n\nexecutive functions are based outside of Puerto Rico. The district\n\ncourt found that all but one of the members of Pep Boys PR's Board\n\nof Directors work in Philadelphia. Major policy decisions are made\n\nin Philadelphia, and the merchandise, advertising,          distribution,\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\ffinance, and human resources departments are located there.   These\n\nare the types of factors that would be relevant under the nerve\n\ncenter test.   See Topp, 814 F.2d at 837-38.   As we have discussed,\n\nhowever, the nerve center test does not dictate the principal place\n\nof business of a corporation that, like Pep Boys PR, has all of its\n\nextensive physical operations in one state and its administrative\n\nand executive functions in another state.    Rather, consistent with\n\nthe policies underlying 28 U.S.C. § 1332, the locus of operations\n\ntest is determinative in this context.\n\n          The conclusion that Pep Boys PR's principal place of\n\nbusiness is in Puerto Rico has substantial implications in this\n\ncase.   Pep Boys PR is a citizen of Puerto Rico.      See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1332(c)(1) (\"[A] corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of\n\nany State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where\n\nit has its principal place of business.\").     It is undisputed that\n\nthe appellants were and are also citizens of Puerto Rico.      Thus,\n\nthe parties are not diverse.      There being no other basis for\n\nfederal jurisdiction, we are compelled to vacate the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment on the ground that it lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction, see Am.

Consequently, such courts must \"monitor\ntheir jurisdictional boundaries vigilantly.\"      Id. at 139.

At oral argument, we shifted the focus of the appeal by inquiring <i>sua sponte</i> into the possibility that the parties were not completely diverse and that the district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case. We ordered supplemental briefing regarding the citizenship of appellee Manny, Moe &amp; Jack Corp., Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Pep Boys PR\"), and then, while retaining appellate jurisdiction, remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the same subject. With the benefit of extensive fact-finding by the district court, we now conclude that Pep Boys PR has its principal place of business in, and is thus a citizen of, Puerto Rico. Because the appellants are also citizens of Puerto Rico, the parties are not diverse. We therefore vacate the judgment and, given the absence of federal subject matter jurisdiction, remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the court from which it was improvidently removed. We also clarify our law regarding the principal place of business determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 2002, appellants Energy Tech Corp. (\"ETC\") and Tomas Diaz Rodriguez sued automotive supply retailer Pep Boys PR and its parent company, Pep Boys Corp. (\"Pep Boys\"), in the Court of First Instance of Puerto Rico, Bayam&#243;n Superior Division. The complaint alleged (1) that Pep Boys PR was liable for breaching a contract under which it was to serve as the exclusive Puerto Rico seller of an ETC product called Super FuelMax and (2) that Pep Boys had tortiously interfered in the relationship between ETC and Pep Boys PR by inducing Pep Boys PR to break the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees removed the case to federal court on April 9, 2002.

This action, therefore, may be removed from the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to this District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants did not challenge the existence of diversity jurisdiction at this juncture, and the appellees answered the complaint on May 8, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 28, 2003, the appellees filed a motion for summary judgment; on March 11, 2003, the appellants filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Based on the recommendation of a magistrate judge, the district court granted the appellees' motion for summary judgment, denied the appellants' motion for partial summary judgment, and filed an order dismissing the suit with prejudice. <i>See D&#237;az-Rodr&#237;guez v. Pep Boys Corp.,</i> No. 02-10536 (D.P.R. Mar. 29, 2004). The appellants filed a notice of appeal on April 28, 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The briefs filed by the parties before oral argument were directed entirely to the merits of the district court's grant of summary judgment. Those arguments are predicated, however, on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. We cannot consider the merits of the district court's ruling on appeal if it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues before it in the first instance. <i>See, e.g., Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 495 (1st Cir.2003) (\"Because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction, we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to pursue them on our own initiative.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only conceivable basis for federal jurisdiction in this case is diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a). \"Diversity jurisdiction exists only when there is <i>complete</i> diversity, that is, when no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant.\" <i>Gabriel v. Preble,</i> 396 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.2005). For diversity purposes, a corporation is a citizen of both the state where it is incorporated and \"the State where it has its principal place of business.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1332(c)(1). As used in the diversity statute, the term \"state\" includes Puerto Rico. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1332(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party questioned the existence of complete diversity during the district court proceedings. Nevertheless, concerned about the possibility that ETC and Pep Boys PR were non-diverse, we raised the jurisdictional issue <i>sua sponte</i> at oral arguments and ordered supplemental briefing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Cf. In re Perry,</i> 391 F.3d 282, 284-85 (1st Cir.2004) (requesting, <i>sua sponte,</i> supplemental briefing on a jurisdictional issue). For the first time in their supplemental brief, the appellants took the position that Pep Boys PR has its principal place of business in Puerto Rico, where all of its retail stores are located, and therefore that it is not diverse from the appellants, who are citizens of Puerto Rico. The appellees disagreed, maintaining that Pep Boys PR's principal place of business is in Philadelphia, where almost all of its officers are located and its corporate support functions are based.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the supplemental briefs as inconclusive, we retained appellate jurisdiction while remanding to the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing as to the locus of Pep Boys PR's principal place of business. The district court complied, holding a hearing and making extensive findings of fact. We now determine Pep Boys PR's principal place of business <i>de novo</i> based on the district court's factual findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have identified three tests for determining a corporation's principal place of business:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One is the \"nerve center\" test which searches for the location from where the activities of the corporation are controlled and directed. The two other tests are the \"center of corporate activity\" test, i.e., where the corporation's day-to-day management takes place; and the \"locus of the operations of the corporation\" test, i.e., where the bulk of the corporation's actual physical operations are located.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Topp v. CompAir Inc.,</i> 814 F.2d 830, 834 (1st Cir.1987) (internal citations omitted); <i>see also de Walker v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 569 F.2d 1169, 1171-72 (1st Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the tests that we have identified are \"not necessarily inconsistent,\" <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834, their differing emphases mean that, in some cases, they will point to different locations as the principal place of business. For example, Pep Boys PR is essentially controlled from Philadelphia but all of its retail stores are located in Puerto Rico. The nerve center test might point to Philadelphia as Pep Boys PR's principal place of business, <i>see id.</i> at 837-38 (listing eight factors to consider in applying the nerve center test) while the locus of operations test might point to Puerto Rico, where all of the corporation's physical assets are located. This result would be inconsistent with the rule that a corporation can have only one principal place of business. <i>See Capitol Indem.</i> <i>Corp. v. Russellville Steel Co.,</i> 367 F.3d 831, 835 (8th Cir.2004). We must thus determine which test controls in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First Circuit precedent offers only limited guidance on how to determine a corporation's principal place of business when the three tests point to different locations. Our cases indicate that the nerve center test governs in the context of a corporation with \"complex and farflung activities\" or a corporation without physical operations (<i>e.g.,</i> a holding company). <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834. This rule implies that if a corporation has physical operations and is not \"farflung,\" one of the other tests&#8212;the center of corporate activity or the locus of operations&#8212;must govern. <i>See PayPhone LLC v. Brooks Fiber Communications of R.I.,</i> 126 F.Supp.2d 175, 182-83 (D.R.I.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pep Boys PR has physical operations and is not a complex or far flung corporation. Therefore, the nerve center test does not control and we must look instead to the center of corporate activity test or the locus of operations test. We have never explained, however, a basis for choosing between these two tests. <i>See Savis, Inc. v. Warner Lambert, Inc.,</i> 967 F.Supp. 632, 637 (D.P.R.1997) (noting a lack of case law on point).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our recognition of the nerve center and locus of operations tests, the center of corporate activity test is largely redundant. In some cases, it involves \"an analysis and result similar to the one employed ... under the rubric of the nerve center test.\" <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834 n. 3; <i>see also Taber Partners,</i> 987 F.2d at 63 &amp; n. 8. In other cases, it is largely indistinguishable from the locus of operations test. <i>See Savis,</i> 967 F.Supp. at 637 (noting that no other circuit has recognized the center of corporate activity and locus of operations tests as distinct). There does not appear to be any context in which the center of corporate activity test supplies an analysis different from that available under one of the other two tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law confirms this redundancy. We have explicitly alluded to the center of corporate activity test in only four cases. In two of those cases, we concluded that all three tests would point to the same location as the principal place of business. <i>See Rodriguez v. S K &amp; F Co.,</i> 833 F.2d 8, 9 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam); <i>de Walker,</i> 569 F.2d at 1172. In the other two cases, which involved corporations without physical operations and which, therefore, did not lend themselves to application of the locus of operations test, we concluded that the nerve center and center of corporate activity test would point to the same principal place of business. <i>See Taber Partners,</i> 987 F.2d at 63 &amp; n. 8; <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the case law reveals that our references to the center of corporate activity test have always been dicta&#8212;that is, comments \"made while delivering a judicial opinion, but ... unnecessary to the decision in the case.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> (8th ed.2004) (defining obiter dictum). Indeed, even the case which initially referred to the center of corporate activity test did not treat that test as determinative. <i>See de Walker,</i> 569 F.2d at 1173 (holding that the district court's diversity determination was erroneous because \"plaintiff did not establish that [the defendant corporation's] <i>`nerve center' or any substantial part of its operations</i> was outside Puerto Rico\" (emphasis added)). Moreover, it appears that our dicta in this area has been more confusing than helpful. <i>See Caribbean Mushroom Co. v. Gov't Dev. Bank,</i> 980 F.Supp. 620, 626 (D.P.R. 1997) (\"Despite setting up a variety of distinct tests ... the jurisprudence from this circuit provides little guidance as to when each test should apply, leading many courts facing the issue to apply each and every available test in order to avoid having to choose which test to apply.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike a holding, which binds newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit, <i>see Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004), dicta \"is not binding on future panels.\" <i>Kosereis v. Rhode Island,</i> 331 F.3d 207, 213 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>see also Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc.,</i> 972 F.2d 453, 459 (1st Cir.1992) (\"Dictum constitutes neither the law of the case nor the stuff of binding precedent.\"). In other words, although a newly constituted panel ordinarily may not disregard the decision of a previous panel, principles of <i>stare decisis</i> do not preclude us from disclaiming dicta in a prior decision. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003). We do so here with regard to the center of corporate activity test. In the future, district courts required to determine a corporation's principal place of business should not apply the center of corporate activity test. Instead, they should use either the nerve center test or the locus of operations test, depending on the characteristics of the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled in this circuit that the nerve center test applies only to farflung corporations or corporations without physical operations. <i>See Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834. We now add that the principal place of business of a corporation that has the bulk of its physical operations in one state is to be determined under the locus of operations test, even if the corporation's executive offices are in another state. This holding is consistent with the approach adopted by district courts in the First Circuit in recent years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See, e.g., Payphone LLC,</i> 126 F.Supp.2d at 183 (determining a telephone company's principal place of business according to the location of its facilities and equipment, even though corporate activity was centered elsewhere); <i>Savis,</i> 967 F.Supp. at 638 (concluding that \"[w]here a corporation is engaged in a single enterprise, substantially all of whose operations occur in one state, even though policy and administrative decisions are made elsewhere, the state of operations is the corporation's principal place of business\") (quoting <i>Santana Salgado v. DuPont Pharmaceutical, Inc.,</i> 664 F.Supp. 644, 645 (D.P.R.1987)). More importantly, it is consistent with the policies underlying 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. A primary purpose of diversity jurisdiction is to shield foreign parties from the prejudice they might face as outsiders in state court. \"Thus, the principal place of business should be the place where the corporation conducts the most activity that is visible and impacts the public, so that it is least likely to suffer from prejudice against outsiders.\" <i>Indus. Tectonics, Inc. v. Aero Alloy,</i> 912 F.2d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have described the locus of operations test as \"search[ing] for the location of the corporation's actual physical operations.\" <i>Taber Partners,</i> 987 F.2d at 61. The district court's supportable findings of fact in this case clearly indicate that Pep Boys PR's actual physical operations are located in Puerto Rico. Pep Boys PR is a retailer dealing in automotive supplies. All of its physical assets, including its 27 stores and its inventory, are located in Puerto Rico, as are its 1,214 employees. Pep Boys PR does not operate, own, or lease stores in any other jurisdiction. The corporation owns the equipment used in its Puerto Rico stores and owns or leases approximately fifty trucks to provide service to its commercial clients there. In 2002, the year this suit was removed to federal court, Pep Boys PR had a total gross income of $56 million, all generated by sales in Puerto Rico. In short, Puerto Rico is clearly the locus of Pep Boys PR's operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that many of Pep Boys PR's administrative and executive functions are based outside of Puerto Rico. The district court found that all but one of the members of Pep Boys PR's Board of Directors work in Philadelphia. Major policy decisions are made in Philadelphia, and the merchandise, advertising, distribution, finance, and human resources departments are located there. These are the types of factors that would be relevant under the nerve center test. <i>See Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 837-38. As we have discussed, however, the nerve center test does not dictate the principal place of business of a corporation that, like Pep Boys PR, has all of its extensive physical operations in one state and its administrative and executive functions in another state. Rather, consistent with the policies underlying 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the locus of operations test is determinative in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion that Pep Boys PR's principal place of business is in Puerto Rico has substantial implications in this case. Pep Boys PR is a citizen of Puerto Rico. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(c)(1) (\"[A] corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\"). It is undisputed that the appellants were and are also citizens of Puerto Rico. Thus, the parties are not diverse. There being no other basis for federal jurisdiction, we are compelled to vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, <i>see Am. Fiber &amp; Finishing, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group, LP,</i> 362 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that \"diversity jurisdiction is ... not a matter subject to the exercise of judicial discretion\"), and to remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the court from which it was improvidently removed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pep Boys PR is the only party whose citizenship is in question; it is undisputed that the parties are otherwise diverse</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court supportably found that all but one of Pep Boys PR's directors and officers are located in Philadelphia and that many of the decisions regarding Pep Boys PR's operations are made in Philadelphia. Pep Boys PR also had one officer located in Puerto Rico. When this suit was removed to federal court in 2002, the officer in Puerto Rico was the Divisional Vice President, who supervised the day-to-day operations of Pep Boys PR's stores</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> On reflection, the better practice might have been to ask the district court to make the legal determination in the first instance<i>See Taber Partners, I v. Merit Builders, Inc.,</i> 987 F.2d 57, 60 (1st Cir.1993) (\"A district court's determination of citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction is a mixed question of law and fact.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The framework we set forth here also has much in common with the sensible \"total activity\" test adopted by a number of our sister circuits<i>See Savis,</i> 967 F.Supp. at 637 n. 8 (collecting cases). Under the total activity test,</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) when considering a corporation whose operations are far flung, the sole nerve center of that corporation is more significant in determining principal place of business; (2) when a corporation has its sole operation in one state and executive offices in another, the place of activity is regarded as more significant; but (3) when the activity of a corporation is passive and the \"brain\" of the corporation is in another state, the situs of the corporation's \"brain\" is given greater significance.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>J.A.

At oral argument, we shifted the focus of the appeal by inquiring <i>sua sponte</i> into the possibility that the parties were not completely diverse and that the district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction in this case. We ordered supplemental briefing regarding the citizenship of appellee Manny, Moe &amp; Jack Corp., Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Pep Boys PR\"), and then, while retaining appellate jurisdiction, remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the same subject. With the benefit of extensive fact-finding by the district court, we now conclude that Pep Boys PR has its principal place of business in, and is thus a citizen of, Puerto Rico. Because the appellants are also citizens of Puerto Rico, the parties are not diverse. We therefore vacate the judgment and, given the absence of federal subject matter jurisdiction, remand to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the court from which it was improvidently removed.

(\"Pep Boys\"), in the Court of First Instance of Puerto Rico, Bayam&#243;n Superior Division. The complaint alleged (1) that Pep Boys PR was liable for breaching a contract under which it was to serve as the exclusive Puerto Rico seller of an ETC product called Super FuelMax and (2) that Pep Boys had tortiously interfered in the relationship between ETC and Pep Boys PR by inducing Pep Boys PR to break the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees removed the case to federal court on April 9, 2002.

Based on the recommendation of a magistrate judge, the district court granted the appellees' motion for summary judgment, denied the appellants' motion for partial summary judgment, and filed an order dismissing the suit with prejudice. <i>See D&#237;az-Rodr&#237;guez v.

Those arguments are predicated, however, on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. We cannot consider the merits of the district court's ruling on appeal if it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues before it in the first instance. <i>See, e.g., Espinal-Dominguez v.

For diversity purposes, a corporation is a citizen of both the state where it is incorporated and \"the State where it has its principal place of business.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1332(c)(1).

For the first time in their supplemental brief, the appellants took the position that Pep Boys PR has its principal place of business in Puerto Rico, where all of its retail stores are located, and therefore that it is not diverse from the appellants, who are citizens of Puerto Rico. The appellees disagreed, maintaining that Pep Boys PR's principal place of business is in Philadelphia, where almost all of its officers are located and its corporate support functions are based.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the supplemental briefs as inconclusive, we retained appellate jurisdiction while remanding to the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing as to the locus of Pep Boys PR's principal place of business.

For example, Pep Boys PR is essentially controlled from Philadelphia but all of its retail stores are located in Puerto Rico. The nerve center test might point to Philadelphia as Pep Boys PR's principal place of business, <i>see id.</i> at 837-38 (listing eight factors to consider in applying the nerve center test) while the locus of operations test might point to Puerto Rico, where all of the corporation's physical assets are located. This result would be inconsistent with the rule that a corporation can have only one principal place of business. <i>See Capitol Indem.</i> <i>Corp. v. Russellville Steel Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786120\"><a href=\"/opinion/786120/capitol-indemnity-corporation-v-russellville-steel-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 835 (8th Cir.2004).

Our cases indicate that the nerve center test governs in the context of a corporation with \"complex and farflung activities\" or a corporation without physical operations (<i>e.g.,</i> a holding company). <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834. This rule implies that if a corporation has physical operations and is not \"farflung,\" one of the other tests&#8212;the center of corporate activity or the locus of operations&#8212;must govern. <i>See PayPhone LLC v.

Therefore, the nerve center test does not control and we must look instead to the center of corporate activity test or the locus of operations test. We have never explained, however, a basis for choosing between these two tests. <i>See Savis, Inc. v. Warner Lambert, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1467652\"><a href=\"/opinion/1467652/savis-inc-v-warner-lambert-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In some cases, it involves \"an analysis and result similar to the one employed ... under the rubric of the nerve center test.\" <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834 n. 3; <i>see also Taber Partners,</i> 987 F.2d at 63 &amp; n. 8. In other cases, it is largely indistinguishable from the locus of operations test. <i>See Savis,</i> 967 F.Supp. at 637 (noting that no other circuit has recognized the center of corporate activity and locus of operations tests as distinct). There does not appear to be any context in which the center of corporate activity test supplies an analysis different from that available under one of the other two tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case law confirms this redundancy. We have explicitly alluded to the center of corporate activity test in only four cases.

In the other two cases, which involved corporations without physical operations and which, therefore, did not lend themselves to application of the locus of operations test, we concluded that the nerve center and center of corporate activity test would point to the same principal place of business. <i>See Taber Partners,</i> 987 F.2d at 63 &amp; n. 8; <i>Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, the case law reveals that our references to the center of corporate activity test have always been dicta&#8212;that is, comments \"made while delivering a judicial opinion, but ... unnecessary to the decision in the case.\" <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> (8th ed.2004) (defining obiter dictum). Indeed, even the case which initially referred to the center of corporate activity test did not treat that test as determinative. <i>See de Walker,</i> 569 F.2d at 1173 (holding that the district court's diversity determination was erroneous because \"plaintiff did not establish that [the defendant corporation's] <i>`nerve center' or any substantial part of its operations</i> was outside Puerto Rico\" (emphasis added)). Moreover, it appears that our dicta in this area has been more confusing than helpful. <i>See Caribbean Mushroom Co. v. Gov't Dev.

In other words, although a newly constituted panel ordinarily may not disregard the decision of a previous panel, principles of <i>stare decisis</i> do not preclude us from disclaiming dicta in a prior decision. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

We do so here with regard to the center of corporate activity test. In the future, district courts required to determine a corporation's principal place of business should not apply the center of corporate activity test. Instead, they should use either the nerve center test or the locus of operations test, depending on the characteristics of the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled in this circuit that the nerve center test applies only to farflung corporations or corporations without physical operations. <i>See Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 834. We now add that the principal place of business of a corporation that has the bulk of its physical operations in one state is to be determined under the locus of operations test, even if the corporation's executive offices are in another state. This holding is consistent with the approach adopted by district courts in the First Circuit in recent years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See, e.g., Payphone LLC,</i> 126 F.Supp.2d at 183 (determining a telephone company's principal place of business according to the location of its facilities and equipment, even though corporate activity was centered elsewhere); <i>Savis,</i> 967 F.Supp. at 638 (concluding that \"[w]here a corporation is engaged in a single enterprise, substantially all of whose operations occur in one state, even though policy and administrative decisions are made elsewhere, the state of operations is the corporation's principal place of business\") (quoting <i>Santana Salgado v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 645 (D.P.R.1987)). More importantly, it is consistent with the policies underlying 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the statute creating diversity jurisdiction. A primary purpose of diversity jurisdiction is to shield foreign parties from the prejudice they might face as outsiders in state court. \"Thus, the principal place of business should be the place where the corporation conducts the most activity that is visible and impacts the public, so that it is least likely to suffer from prejudice against outsiders.\" <i>Indus.

The district court's supportable findings of fact in this case clearly indicate that Pep Boys PR's actual physical operations are located in Puerto Rico. Pep Boys PR is a retailer dealing in automotive supplies. All of its physical assets, including its 27 stores and its inventory, are located in Puerto Rico, as are its 1,214 employees. Pep Boys PR does not operate, own, or lease stores in any other jurisdiction. The corporation owns the equipment used in its Puerto Rico stores and owns or leases approximately fifty trucks to provide service to its commercial clients there. In 2002, the year this suit was removed to federal court, Pep Boys PR had a total gross income of $56 million, all generated by sales in Puerto Rico. In short, Puerto Rico is clearly the locus of Pep Boys PR's operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that many of Pep Boys PR's administrative and executive functions are based outside of Puerto Rico. The district court found that all but one of the members of Pep Boys PR's Board of Directors work in Philadelphia. Major policy decisions are made in Philadelphia, and the merchandise, advertising, distribution, finance, and human resources departments are located there. These are the types of factors that would be relevant under the nerve center test. <i>See Topp,</i> 814 F.2d at 837-38. As we have discussed, however, the nerve center test does not dictate the principal place of business of a corporation that, like Pep Boys PR, has all of its extensive physical operations in one state and its administrative and executive functions in another state. Rather, consistent with the policies underlying 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, the locus of operations test is determinative in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion that Pep Boys PR's principal place of business is in Puerto Rico has substantial implications in this case. Pep Boys PR is a citizen of Puerto Rico. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(c)(1) (\"[A] corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.\"). It is undisputed that the appellants were and are also citizens of Puerto Rico. Thus, the parties are not diverse. There being no other basis for federal jurisdiction, we are compelled to vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, <i>see Am.

Under the total activity test,</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(1) when considering a corporation whose operations are far flung, the sole nerve center of that corporation is more significant in determining principal place of business; (2) when a corporation has its sole operation in one state and executive offices in another, the place of activity is regarded as more significant; but (3) when the activity of a corporation is passive and the \"brain\" of the corporation is in another state, the situs of the corporation's \"brain\" is given greater significance.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>J.A.

Still, it was the appellees who removed the case. And, moreover, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Consequently, such courts must \"monitor their jurisdictional boundaries vigilantly.\" <i>Id.</i> at 139. It follows that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court by acquiescence or oversight. <i>See United States v.
