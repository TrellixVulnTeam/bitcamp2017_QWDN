R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2188\n\n                             FRIEDRICH LU,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                 WILLARD J.

Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Friedrich Lu on brief pro se.\n     Daryl J.

After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties' submissions, we affirm. The district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion when it dismissed this case\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). Appellant refused to comply\n\nwith the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Local Rules, and\n\nthe orders of two district judges.   Under these circumstances,\n\nthe district court was well within its discretion to impose a\n\nmonetary sanction on appellant, and then to dismiss the case\n\nwhen appellant refused to pay the sanction.\n\n          Appellant's \"Informative Motion and Suggestion of\n\nRecusal,\" which we treat as a motion to reconsider the court's\n\norder dated November 21, 2003, is denied.\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\f",
