TIG Insurance Company brought suit seeking\n\na declaratory judgment that the policy it issued to Wembley USA,\n\nInc., with Burrillville Racing Association, Inc., as an additional\n\ninsured, did not provide coverage for Burrillville’s new building\n\nwhich was damaged by fire during construction.              TIG asserted that\n\na clause in the policy, providing a time limit for coverage of new\n\nbuildings during construction, barred coverage. The district court\n\naccepted the magistrate judge’s recommendation and summary judgment\n\nwas   granted   in    TIG’s      favor.      The   defendants,    Wembley   and\n\nBurrillville, appeal that decision.           We affirm essentially for the\n\nreasons    given     by   the    magistrate    judge   in   his   report    and\n\nrecommendation dated August 13, 2002.\n\n\n\nI.    Background\n\n            Burrillville operates Lincoln Park, which is located on\n\nLouisquisset Pike in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and offers greyhound\n\nracing along with other activities.           Wembley is the parent company\n\nof Burrillville. The Louisquisset Pike premises are listed in the\n\nschedule of locations in the declarations section of the TIG\n\npolicy.\n\n            Burrillville began construction on a new paddock building\n\nat the Park in December of 2000.             Burrillville did not give TIG\n\nnotice that the building was being constructed, although TIG issued\n\nan endorsement in December of 2000 in which the old paddock\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fbuilding was deleted from coverage.                 On March 13, 2001, a fire\n\ndamaged the new paddock building while it was under construction.\n\n             The applicable policy is titled \"K & K Sports, Leisure\n\nand Entertainment, Building and Personal Property Coverage,\" which\n\nis   part    of    a    larger    package   of    commercial   insurance   Wembley\n\npurchased from TIG.         The policy period was for one year, from July\n\n1, 2000, to July 1, 2001.              The policy covered certain premises\n\nlisted      in    the    common    policy     declarations     with   a   limit   of\n\n$155,188,494.00 for buildings under the \"Blanket B\" coverage.\n\nWembley paid a premium of $205,075.00 for the commercial property\n\npart of the insurance package.              On December 6, 2000, TIG issued an\n\nendorsement that increased the maximum limit for one loss, lowered\n\nthe \"Blanket B\" and \"Blanket BPP\" limits, and deleted the \"old\n\npaddock building and contents.\"               As a result of those amendments,\n\nTIG returned $176.00 of the premium paid by Wembley.\n\n                 Section A of the policy states:         \"We will pay for direct\n\nphysical loss to Covered Property at the premises described in the\n\nDeclarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss,\n\nexcept as otherwise excluded or limited.\"1                   Section A.1 defines\n\n\"Covered Property\" to include \"[n]ew buildings and structures while\n\nbeing built, and when completed, on the premises described in the\n\nDeclarations.\" § A.1.a.5.c. Section A.2 which describes \"Property\n\n\n\n      1\n      There is no dispute that fire was a covered cause of loss\nwithin the meaning of the policy.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fNot Covered\" does not include new buildings under construction.\n\nSection A.5, \"Newly Acquired Property Extension of Coverage,\"\n\nallows an insured to extend its coverage to new buildings while\n\nthey are being built and also provides that TIG \"will cover new\n\nBuildings being built at described premises for 60 days after\n\nconstruction begins, or when reported to us, or when the policy\n\nends, whichever occurs first.\"2\n\n             TIG denied coverage for the fire-damaged building under\n\nsection A.5 of the policy.           It is undisputed that the damaged\n\nbuilding     was   located   on     premises   described   in    the   policy\n\ndeclaration and that a listed limit of insurance is shown on the\n\ndeclarations page for buildings coverage.          It is also undisputed\n\nthat the damaged building had been under construction for more than\n\nsixty days at the time of the fire and that the construction had\n\nnot   been   reported   to   TIG.     The   district   court    accepted   the\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommendation and granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of TIG based on the sixty-day limit provided in section A.5.\n\n\n\n      2\n      Section A.5 does not explain the process for extending\ncoverage to new buildings while they are being built.      At oral\nargument, counsel for TIG represented that if, after the insured\nnotified TIG of a new building being built, TIG approved the\nextension of coverage, an additional premium would be assessed to\ncover the extension.    Because Wembley and Burrillville did not\nnotify TIG of the new building being built, the extension process\nis not at issue here. It is noteworthy, however, that contrary to\nthe argument of defendants’ counsel that the premium would not be\nreduced when buildings were deleted from coverage, it appears that\nTIG refunded part of the premium when the old paddock building was\ndeleted from coverage in December of 2000.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fII.   Discussion\n\n          Wembley and Burrillville challenge the district court’s\n\ninterpretation of the policy language.        The material facts are\n\nundisputed, as they were below. The appeal presents a purely legal\n\nissue as to the meaning of the coverage section of the building\n\npolicy, and therefore, the district court decision is subject to de\n\nnovo review.   See Lexington Ins. Co. v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co., 338\n\nF.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Under Rhode Island law, disputed terms in an insurance\n\npolicy are interpreted according to their plain and ordinary\n\nmeaning to determine \"what the ordinary reader and purchaser would\n\nunderstand them to mean.\"    Zarrella v. Minn. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,\n\n824 A.2d 1249, 1259 (R.I. 2003).       In assessing disputed language,\n\nthe policy is considered in its entirety.        Am. Commerce Ins. v.\n\nPorto, 811 A.2d 1185, 1192 (R.I. 2002).       The literal language of\n\nthe policy governs its meaning unless the disputed terms are\n\nambiguous, in which case the policy is strictly construed against\n\nthe insurer.    Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gay, 786 A.2d 383, 386\n\n(R.I. 2001).\n\n          Wembley   and   Burrillville     contend   that   the   damaged\n\nbuilding meets all of the requirements for coverage under section\n\nA.1.5 because it was a structure \"while being built,\" which was\n\nlocated at a premises described in the policy declarations, with an\n\napplicable limit of insurance, and was not included in section A.2.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fBased on those provisions, Wembley and Burrillville argue that the\n\ndamaged building had \"permanent\" coverage under the policy and did\n\nnot need the \"temporary\" coverage provided in section A.5.     They\n\nalso argue that section A.5 applies to \"newly acquired property,\"\n\nbut not to new buildings under construction.         Alternatively,\n\nWembley and Burrillville assert that the policy provisions are\n\nambiguous and should be construed in their favor.\n\n             The interpretation urged by Wembley and Burrillville\n\nignores the qualifying language in section A that coverage is\n\nprovided as described \"except as otherwise excluded or limited.\"3\n\nTaking the building policy coverage section as a whole, it provides\n\ncoverage for \"structures while being built,\" section A.1.a.5.c, for\n\n\"sixty days after construction begins,\" section A.5.d.4    As such,\n\nsection A.5.d neither takes away what section A.1.a.5.c provides\n\nnor offers an alternative basis for coverage.5   Instead, the plain\n\nmeaning of    section A.5.d, taken within the broader context of the\n\n\n\n     3\n      The defendants also argue that the high coverage limit\ncoupled with the \"blanket\" coverage language in the declarations,\nwould suggest to an ordinary insured that the policy would cover\nall buildings built on the listed premises. That interpretation,\nhowever, is directly contrary to the plain language of the policy\nand is therefore unreasonable.\n     4\n      The additional limitations in section A.5.d are not pertinent\nto this case and therefore are not included in the analysis.\n     5\n      Section A.2, \"Property Not Covered,\" does not affect the\ninterpretation of the disputed provisions because new buildings\nunder construction are covered property, as provided in section\nA.1.a.5.c.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpolicy, limits the time that coverage is provided for new buildings\n\nwhile they are being built to a maximum of sixty days after the\n\ncommencement of construction.\n\n           The heading of section A.5, \"Newly Acquired Property\n\nExtension of Coverage,\" does not create confusion as to whether the\n\ntime   limit   would      apply       to    new    buildings      under       construction.\n\nImmediately under that heading, the policy states that the coverage\n\nmay be extended both to \"new buildings while being built on the\n\ndescribed premises\" and \"[b]uildings you acquire or lease at\n\nlocations, other than the described premises, . . . .\"                                Section\n\nA.5.d specifically states that \"new buildings being built\" are\n\ncovered within the limits provided.                  It is clear from the language\n\nof   section   A.5    that      it    applies      to     both   new    buildings       under\n\nconstruction at listed premises and buildings acquired by the\n\ninsured at other premises.\n\n             Disputed insurance policy language is ambiguous \"only\n\nwhen it is reasonably and clearly susceptible of more than one\n\ninterpretation.\"         Zarrella, 824 A.2d at 1259 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).          The court \"will not engage in mental or verbal\n\ngymnastics     to   hurdle       over      the    plain    meaning      of    the    policy’s\n\nlanguage.\"     Am. Commerce Ins. Co., 811 A.2d at 1193.                             Given the\n\nplain meaning       of    the    time      limitation       in   section       A.5.d.,    the\n\ninterpretation       that       the   section       offers       only    an    alternative\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\ftemporary basis for coverage is not reasonable.      Therefore, no\n\nambiguity exists in the disputed policy language.\n\n\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n            The plain meaning of section A.5.d. limits coverage for\n\nbuildings under construction to a maximum of sixty days from the\n\ncommencement of construction.     Because the damaged building had\n\nbeen under construction for more than sixty days at the time of the\n\nfire without notice to TIG, section A.5.d unambiguously precludes\n\ncoverage.    Accordingly, the district court’s decision granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of TIG is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

Gay, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1469226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1469226/pawtucket-mut-ins-co-v-gay/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386\n\n(R.I. 2001).\n\n          Wembley   and   Burrillville     contend   that   the   damaged\n\nbuilding meets all of the requirements for coverage under section\n\nA.1.5 because it was a structure \"while being built,\" which was\n\nlocated at a premises described in the policy declarations, with an\n\napplicable limit of insurance, and was not included in section A.2.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fBased on those provisions, Wembley and Burrillville argue that the\n\ndamaged building had \"permanent\" coverage under the policy and did\n\nnot need the \"temporary\" coverage provided in section A.5.     They\n\nalso argue that section A.5 applies to \"newly acquired property,\"\n\nbut not to new buildings under construction.         Alternatively,\n\nWembley and Burrillville assert that the policy provisions are\n\nambiguous and should be construed in their favor.\n\n             The interpretation urged by Wembley and Burrillville\n\nignores the qualifying language in section A that coverage is\n\nprovided as described \"except as otherwise excluded or limited.\"3\n\nTaking the building policy coverage section as a whole, it provides\n\ncoverage for \"structures while being built,\" section A.1.a.5.c, for\n\n\"sixty days after construction begins,\" section A.5.d.4    As such,\n\nsection A.5.d neither takes away what section A.1.a.5.c provides\n\nnor offers an alternative basis for coverage.5   Instead, the plain\n\nmeaning of    section A.5.d, taken within the broader context of the\n\n\n\n     3\n      The defendants also argue that the high coverage limit\ncoupled with the \"blanket\" coverage language in the declarations,\nwould suggest to an ordinary insured that the policy would cover\nall buildings built on the listed premises. That interpretation,\nhowever, is directly contrary to the plain language of the policy\nand is therefore unreasonable.\n     4\n      The additional limitations in section A.5.d are not pertinent\nto this case and therefore are not included in the analysis.\n     5\n      Section A.2, \"Property Not Covered,\" does not affect the\ninterpretation of the disputed provisions because new buildings\nunder construction are covered property, as provided in section\nA.1.a.5.c.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpolicy, limits the time that coverage is provided for new buildings\n\nwhile they are being built to a maximum of sixty days after the\n\ncommencement of construction.\n\n           The heading of section A.5, \"Newly Acquired Property\n\nExtension of Coverage,\" does not create confusion as to whether the\n\ntime   limit   would      apply       to    new    buildings      under       construction.\n\nImmediately under that heading, the policy states that the coverage\n\nmay be extended both to \"new buildings while being built on the\n\ndescribed premises\" and \"[b]uildings you acquire or lease at\n\nlocations, other than the described premises, . . . .\"                                Section\n\nA.5.d specifically states that \"new buildings being built\" are\n\ncovered within the limits provided.                  It is clear from the language\n\nof   section   A.5    that      it    applies      to     both   new    buildings       under\n\nconstruction at listed premises and buildings acquired by the\n\ninsured at other premises.\n\n             Disputed insurance policy language is ambiguous \"only\n\nwhen it is reasonably and clearly susceptible of more than one\n\ninterpretation.\"         Zarrella, 824 A.2d at 1259 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).          The court \"will not engage in mental or verbal\n\ngymnastics     to   hurdle       over      the    plain    meaning      of    the    policy’s\n\nlanguage.\"     Am. Commerce Ins. Co., 811 A.2d at 1193.                             Given the\n\nplain meaning       of    the    time      limitation       in   section       A.5.d.,    the\n\ninterpretation       that       the   section       offers       only    an    alternative\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\ftemporary basis for coverage is not reasonable.      Therefore, no\n\nambiguity exists in the disputed policy language.\n\n\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n            The plain meaning of section A.5.d. limits coverage for\n\nbuildings under construction to a maximum of sixty days from the\n\ncommencement of construction.     Because the damaged building had\n\nbeen under construction for more than sixty days at the time of the\n\nfire without notice to TIG, section A.5.d unambiguously precludes\n\ncoverage.    Accordingly, the district court’s decision granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of TIG is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f</pre>",
