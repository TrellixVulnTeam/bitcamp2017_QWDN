Vieques Air Link, Inc. (“VAL”) seeks review\n\nof the decision of the Department of Labor’s Administrative Review\n\nBoard (the “ARB”) affirming an award against the airline in favor\n\nof a former VAL pilot, Ángel Negrón.         Following an evidentiary\n\nhearing, an administrative law judge for the Department ruled that\n\nVAL had violated Section 519 of the Wendell H. Ford Investment and\n\nReform Act for the 21st Century, colloquially known as “AIR 21,” by\n\nretaliating against Negrón for reporting the airline’s violations\n\nof federal air safety standards, see 49 U.S.C. § 42121(a), and\n\nentered an award in his favor.           Because substantial evidence\n\nsupported this ruling, we affirm the ARB’s decision and deny VAL’s\n\npetition for review.\n\n\n\n                                   I.\n\n          We    review   the   ARB’s    decision   under    the    standard\n\nprescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act.          See 49 U.S.C. §\n\n42121(b)(4)(A).    “Therefore, our task is to determine whether the\n\naction ‘was consonant with the agency’s statutory powers, reasoned,\n\nand   supported    by    substantial    evidence    in     the    record.’”\n\nConservation Law Found. v. Evans, 360 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D)) (bracketing omitted); see also\n\nClean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Inc. v. Herman, 146 F.3d 12, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).    VAL seeks review of the decision solely on the ground\n\nthat it was unsupported by substantial evidence–-a “benchmark []\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fnotoriously difficult to overcome on appellate review.”           Bath Iron\n\nWorks Corp. v. Dep’t of Labor, 336 F.3d 51, 56 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             “Substantial evidence is ‘such relevant evidence as a\n\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.’”\n\nClean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 21 (quoting Richardson v. Perales, 402\n\nU.S. 389, 401 (1971)); see also, e.g., BSP Trans, Inc. v. Dep’t of\n\nLabor, 160 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).            Although this quantum\n\nmeasures “more than a scintilla, it certainly does not approach the\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard normally found in civil\n\ncases.”   Bath Iron Works, 336 F.3d at 56 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Furthermore, we “accept the findings and inferences\n\ndrawn   by    the   ALJ,   whatever   they   may   be,   unless   they   are\n\nirrational,” and respect his or her “prerogative in the first\n\ninstance to . . . make credibility assessments . . . .”                  Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Barker v. Dep’t of\n\nLabor, 138 F.3d 431, 434 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n                                      II.\n\n             We see substantial evidence in the administrative record\n\nto support the following relevant findings of fact made by the ALJ,\n\nwhich were adopted in their entirety by the ARB.            VAL initially\n\nsuspended Negrón for two days, effective March 1, 2002, following\n\nhis argument that day with Johnny Ramos-Melendez, the supervisor of\n\nthe VAL counter at Isla Grande Airport in San Juan.          Ramos became\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fupset with Negrón when he started using a scale at the counter to\n\nverify passengers’ weights that Ramos had already entered on the\n\nflight manifest.            In response, Ramos physically interposed himself\n\nbetween Negrón and the scale; Negrón threatened to call the FAA and\n\nthe local police.\n\n            Ramos       used    the    phone    at    the     counter   to    call   VAL’s\n\ndirector    of    operations,         Francisco       Cruz,    about    the   situation.\n\nAlthough Cruz asked to speak to Negrón, he was on his cell phone\n\nwith the police at that point, so he did not pick up the counter\n\nphone to talk to Cruz.               Cruz then told Ramos to have a different\n\npilot make Negrón’s scheduled flight because of his agitated\n\ncondition.       Although there were passengers in the waiting area\n\nduring the brouhaha, they remained about fifteen feet away and\n\ntherefore did not see anything out of the ordinary.\n\n            Later that day, Negrón called Cruz and gave his own\n\nversion    of    the    incident,       with    which     Cruz     later   said   he   was\n\n“satisfied.”           In    fact,    less     than   a     week   earlier,    Cruz    had\n\nreprimanded Ramos for inaccurately recording passengers’ weights on\n\na manifest.       Nevertheless, Cruz told Negrón that he was suspended\n\nwithout pay for the balance of the two days remaining in his shift\n\ndue to the fact that he and Ramos had argued in the presence of\n\npassengers.       Ramos, for his part, testified that Cruz later told\n\nhim that he would receive a paid suspension and, furthermore, that\n\nNegrón was “too strict in his work” and would be “removed from the\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fcompany.”1      Although Cruz denied making this statement, the ALJ\n\ncredited       Ramos’s version of the meeting, and the ARB in turn\n\naccepted the ALJ’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.\n\n             Negrón sent VAL a letter on March 20, 2002, objecting to\n\nhis suspension and stating his intention to make a report to the\n\nFAA about the March 1 incident and “other irregularities.”                   In\n\nfact, Negrón had alerted the FAA to that incident the day it\n\noccurred.      On March 22, 2002, the FAA conducted an inspection of\n\nVAL’s Isla Grande operations.         VAL’s president, Osvaldo Gonzalez,\n\ntestified that he knew the inspection came about as a result of\n\nNegrón’s complaint to the FAA.\n\n             That evening, VAL’s chief pilot, Jimmy Adams, called\n\nNegrón at home to tell him that VAL had a letter waiting for him.\n\nThe letter, signed by Gonzalez and dated March 22, 2002, advised\n\nNegrón that he had been suspended without pay for fifteen days for\n\nthe March 1 incident and for his conduct at a March 19, 2002,\n\nmeeting between VAL’s pilots and its management.                Gonzalez had\n\ncalled   the    meeting   to   give   Negrón   and   his   fellow   pilots   an\n\nopportunity to air their grievances, but testified that he became\n\nupset at Negrón’s criticism of the abilities of VAL’s management.\n\nAt the meeting itself, however, Gonzalez had openly praised Negrón\n\nfor his comments.\n\n\n\n     1\n      VAL’s vice president later intervened and increased Ramos’s\npunishment to a suspension without pay.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Gonzalez acknowledged that the fifteen-day suspension\n\namounted, at least in part, to a second disciplinary action taken\n\nin response to the same March 1 incident. Although Gonzalez denied\n\nknowing    when   he    handed    down   the     suspension   that   Negrón   had\n\ncomplained to the FAA, the         ALJ did not find this denial credible\n\nbecause of inconsistencies in Gonzalez’s testimony on this point.\n\nAgain,    the   ARB    accepted   the    ALJ’s    credibility   determination.\n\nNegrón wrote to Gonzalez on March 23, 2002, objecting to the\n\nsuspension on a number of grounds, including that it closely\n\nfollowed the FAA’s inspection of VAL’s operations for violations of\n\nthe kind Negrón had previously reported.               Gonzalez reviewed the\n\nletter, but it failed to sway him.\n\n            By late April, Negrón began to believe that Cruz was\n\nsingling him out by regularly conducting interviews with his\n\npassengers after his flights had landed.2 Negrón communicated this\n\nsuspicion to Cruz through an April 29, 2002, letter.                 The letter\n\nalso noted that, during a meeting earlier that month between an FAA\n\ninspector and a number of VAL employees held to reacquaint them\n\nwith proper weight procedures and other safety standards, the\n\ninspector had commended Negrón for reporting irregularities at VAL.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Cruz had also threatened Negrón with disciplinary action for\nallegedly failing to follow appropriate procedures on an April 10,\n2002, flight. Negrón insisted that he acted properly, and it does\nnot appear that anything came of Cruz’s threat.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f            Ten days later, VAL notified Negrón that, effective June\n\n4, 2002, he was to report at the beginning of each workday to the\n\nairline’s terminal in Vieques, rather than its terminal in Fajardo,\n\non Isla Grande, as he had been.   The memorandum informing Negrón of\n\nhis reassignment explained that he would pilot VAL’s first flight\n\nout of Vieques to Fajardo at 6 a.m.     Upon receiving this news from\n\nAdams, Negrón immediately asked how he would get from his home on\n\nIsla Grande to the island of Vieques each day, given that he had no\n\naccess to a boat or a plane and there was no public transportation.\n\nAdams made no response.\n\n            Negrón raised the logistical problem created by his\n\ntransfer again in a May 11, 2002, letter to Adams, and, in another\n\nletter, dated June 3, 2002, announced that he would report to\n\nFajardo at 5:30 a.m. the next day, when he expected the airline to\n\nprovide him transportation to Vieques.     Negrón indeed showed up at\n\nFajardo as promised, wearing his uniform and carrying the necessary\n\nequipment.    He was ignored by VAL personnel for most of the day,\n\nuntil another pilot delivered a letter from Cruz reprimanding\n\nNegrón for being there and warning him that VAL would consider his\n\nemployment abandoned if he did not report to Vieques by 6 a.m. the\n\nnext day.    Negrón wrote back that, though he lived in the San Juan\n\narea with his wife and two children, as the airline was aware, he\n\nhad in fact attempted to get to Vieques by 6 a.m.    He added that he\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fwas not abandoning his employment and that he planned to report to\n\nFajardo again the next morning to await transportation to Vieques.\n\n           In response, Cruz denied that VAL had any responsibility\n\nto get Negrón to his new assignment on Vieques.               Negrón proceeded\n\nto report to Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. on June 5, 2005, despite Cruz’s\n\ninstruction to the contrary.        Negrón also wrote another letter to\n\nCruz that day reiterating his desire to keep his job but explaining\n\nthat he could not afford the costs of traveling to and staying\n\novernight in Vieques, given the expense of maintaining his family\n\nin the San Juan area.     On June 13, 2002, Cruz notified Negrón that\n\nhe had abandoned his position by failing to show up at Vieques by\n\n6 a.m. on June 6, 2002, and that he would therefore be replaced.\n\n           Gonzalez    testified    that     Cruz    made    the   decision    to\n\ntransfer Negrón.       Gonzalez also said, however, that he had a\n\ndiscussion with Cruz about having one of the VAL pilots who lived\n\nin Vieques–-rather than Negrón, who Gonzalez knew to reside near\n\nSan Juan–-make the first flight out of Vieques each day, but it was\n\ndecided to assign Negrón to the flight because the pilots living in\n\nVieques   had   more   seniority.        VAL,   however,     did   not    mention\n\nseniority as a reason for the transfer in any of its communications\n\nwith Negrón on the subject prior to his termination.\n\n           Meanwhile,    on   May   7,     2002,    Negrón    filed   a    timely\n\ncomplaint with the Department of Labor alleging that VAL had\n\nviolated AIR 21 by suspending him on March 22.               See 49 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f§   42121(b)(1).       Finding      reasonable    cause     to    believe    that   a\n\nviolation    had,     in    fact,   occurred,    both      in   the   form   of   the\n\nsuspension      and   the    subsequent    transfer     and      termination,     the\n\nDepartment issued a preliminary order in Negrón’s favor on November\n\n25, 2002.    See id. § 42112(b)(2)(A).          VAL objected and requested an\n\nevidentiary hearing, see id., which the ALJ conducted between May\n\n19 and May 21, 2003.           Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a\n\ndecision and order concluding that VAL had violated AIR 21 through\n\nits treatment of Negrón, ordering his reinstatement with the\n\nairline, and awarding him back pay, certain out-of-pocket expenses,\n\nand damages for mental anguish.              See id. § 42121(b)(3)(B).            VAL\n\nthen sought review of the ALJ’s actions before the ARB, which\n\naffirmed them in their entirety.\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n            Section 519 of AIR 21, in relevant part, prevents an\n\nairline from discriminating against an employee because he or she\n\n“provided . . . to the employer or Federal Government information\n\nrelating to any violation or alleged violation of any order,\n\nregulation, or standard of the [FAA] or any other provision of law\n\nrelating to air carrier safety under [Title 49, Subchapter VII] or\n\nany other law of the United States . . . .”                49 U.S.C. § 42121(a).\n\nThe ALJ ruled that VAL violated this provision by suspending Negrón\n\ntwice,   then    transferring       him,   because    he    complained       to   both\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fmanagement and the FAA about several instances where VAL failed to\n\ndetermine the weight aboard one of its planes properly before\n\nflying.      VAL challenges three of the findings underlying this\n\nconclusion, and affirmed by the ARB, on the ground that they were\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n\n             First, VAL argues that the ALJ could not have found that\n\nthe    airline   retaliated      against     Negrón    for       complaining      about\n\npossible     safety    problems       because    VAL   was       unaware    of    those\n\ncomplaints when it suspended and transferred him.                     The evidence\n\npresented to the ALJ, however, vitiates this contention.                     Just two\n\ndays after Negrón had notified his employer in writing that he\n\nwould be reporting the incident of March 1, 2002, to the FAA, an\n\ninspector from that agency showed up at VAL. Despite acknowledging\n\nthat    Negrón’s     report    had     precipitated     this       visit,    Gonzalez\n\ntestified that he did not know of the complaint when he issued his\n\nsuspension of Negrón later that same day.              As the ARB determined,\n\nthe    ALJ   acted    well    within   his     discretion    in     rejecting         that\n\ntestimony and finding that VAL knew of Negrón’s report to the FAA\n\nwhen the airline suspended him on March 22, 2002, and when it\n\nannounced its decision to transfer him on May 6, 2002.\n\n             As to Negrón’s initial two-day suspension, effected on\n\nMarch   1,   2002,    VAL    points    out   the   lack     of    evidence       of    its\n\nawareness, at that time, that he had made any complaints to the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fFAA.3       AIR 21, however, protects not only those who report air\n\nsafety violations to the government, but also those who make such\n\nreports to their employers.               See 49 U.S.C. § 42121(a).           The ALJ\n\nspecifically found that Cruz, VAL’s director of operations, knew at\n\nthe time he suspended Negrón for his argument with Ramos that the\n\nargument had arisen out of Negrón’s insistence on verifying the\n\npassenger weights that Ramos had entered on the manifest.                     Indeed,\n\nbefore Cruz issued the suspension, he spoke to Negrón, who provided\n\nhis     own    account    of    his    confrontation       with    Ramos.     The   ALJ\n\nsupportably found that this account constituted a report of an air\n\nsafety violation to VAL and, furthermore, that Cruz received the\n\nreport        before     taking       disciplinary       action     against   Negrón.\n\nAccordingly, the ARB did not err in adopting these findings.\n\n               Second,    VAL     challenges       the   ALJ’s    determination     that\n\nreassigning Negrón’s first daily flight from Fajardo to Vieques\n\namounted to discrimination with respect to the terms, conditions,\n\nor privileges of his employment as proscribed by AIR 21.                          As an\n\ninitial matter, we note that the ALJ found that Negrón’s transfer\n\namounted to both a constructive discharge and one of the other\n\nunspecified       types    of     adverse    employment      action    independently\n\nprohibited by the statute, and that the ARB accepted both of these\n\n\n        3\n      On February 25, 2002, Negrón called the FAA over an incident\nwhere Cruz had allegedly criticized him for taking a plane in for\nmaintenance and delaying the flight schedule as a result. The ALJ\ndid not find, however, that VAL became aware of this report before\nNegrón’s suspension on March 1.\n\n                                            -11-\n\ffindings.      Unlike the finding that the transfer was simply an\n\nadverse employment        action, the finding that it amounted to a\n\nconstructive discharge was essential to the damages Negrón was\n\nawarded, so we focus on that aspect of the ALJ’s decision.               See\n\nSerrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              “To prove that he was constructively discharged, [an\n\nemployee] must show that the new ‘working conditions imposed by the\n\nemployer had become so onerous, abusive, or unpleasant that a\n\nreasonable person in the employee’s position would have felt\n\ncompelled to resign.’”       Mercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co., 396\n\nF.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Suarez v. Pueblo Int’l, Inc.,\n\n229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2000)).        In concluding that Negrón had\n\nsuffered a constructive discharge, the ALJ noted that, after\n\nlearning of his transfer to Vieques, Negrón repeatedly asked his\n\nemployer for assistance in getting there by 6 a.m. each day, but\n\nreceived no response whatsoever.         Nevertheless, Negrón made his\n\nown, albeit unsuccessful, effort to comply with his new assignment,\n\nwhich included showing up ready for work at Fajardo at 5:30 a.m.\n\nwith the hope that VAL would get him to Vieques by 6.           Although VAL\n\nargued that Negrón could have simply joined some of his fellow\n\npilots in securing overnight accommodations in Vieques, the ALJ\n\nrelied   on    Negrón’s   testimony   that   he   could   not   afford   the\n\nadditional costs of staying there, while maintaining his young\n\nfamily in the San Juan area, on his weekly salary of $330.75.\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f“Doubtless a drastic increase in commuting time and unreimbursed\n\ncosts might at some point become sufficiently onerous to justify an\n\nemployee in quitting.”       Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago, 562 F.2d\n\n114,   120   (1st    Cir.   1977)    (footnote   omitted).    The   ALJ    had\n\nsufficient evidence before him to support his conclusion that the\n\ntransfer to Vieques imposed such conditions on Negrón and therefore\n\namounted to a constructive discharge.\n\n             Third, VAL disputes the ALJ’s finding that the transfer,\n\nas well as the two suspensions that preceded it, were motivated by\n\nNegrón’s reports of safety violations to the FAA and to VAL itself.\n\nAIR 21 puts the burden on the employee to show that his or her\n\nprotected behavior under the statute “was a contributing factor” in\n\nthe    adverse      employment      action   suffered.       49   U.S.C.    §\n\n42121(b)(2)(B)(iii).         If the employee carries this burden, the\n\nemployer nevertheless avoids liability if it “demonstrates by clear\n\nand convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same\n\nunfavorable personnel action in the absence of that [protected]\n\nbehavior.”     Id. § 42121(b)(2)(B)(iv).\n\n             In accordance with this framework, the ALJ found, and the\n\nARB agreed, that Negrón had demonstrated that his complaints of\n\nsafety violations contributed to both of his suspensions and his\n\ntransfer, and that VAL had failed to show the contrary by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.        The ALJ concluded, as a result, that VAL had\n\ntaken the adverse employment actions against Negrón because of his\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fcomplaints    in   violation    of    section     42121(a).      This   approach\n\ncomports with the general rule in employment discrimination cases\n\nthat “a plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient\n\nevidence to find that the employer’s asserted justification is\n\nfalse, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer\n\nunlawfully discriminated.”           Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.,\n\nInc., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000); see also Currier v. United Techs.\n\nCorp., 393 F.3d 246, 255 (1st Cir. 2004).                 Furthermore, we see\n\nsubstantial evidence in the administrative record to support the\n\nALJ’s   determinations    that,       in    the   case   of   each   unfavorable\n\npersonnel action, Negrón succeeded in showing that it arose from\n\nhis safety complaints and that VAL failed to prove that those\n\ncomplaints were unconnected to its decisions.             We explain briefly.\n\n            Both the March 1 and the March 22 suspension followed\n\nalmost immediately on the heels of reports Negrón made about air\n\nsafety violations at VAL. The ALJ permissibly treated the temporal\n\nproximity between the reports and the suspensions as sufficient to\n\nshow the requisite causal relationship. See Bechtel Constr. Co. v.\n\nSec’y of Labor, 50 F.3d 926, 934 (11th Cir. 1995) (applying\n\nidentical    standards   of    whistleblower       protection    provisions   of\n\nEnergy Reorganization Act).\n\n            The ALJ also supportably found that VAL’s attempts to\n\nexplain these disciplinary actions as unconnected to Negrón’s\n\nsafety complaints did not wash.            Although VAL claimed it suspended\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fNegrón on March 1 because he had argued with Ramos in front of the\n\nairline’s passengers, Ramos testified that the passengers had\n\nremained far enough away that they would not have perceived that\n\nanything was amiss.       The ALJ also noted the conflict between the\n\ndecision   to   suspend   Negrón   and   Cruz’s   testimony   that   he   was\n\nsatisfied with Negrón’s explanation for the incident, as well as\n\nthe less severe sanction Cruz imposed on Ramos even though he had\n\nbeen caught violating FAA weight regulations for the third time.\n\nIf this were not enough, the ALJ also found that Cruz had told\n\nRamos, in discussing the March 1 incident, that Negrón was “too\n\nstrict in his work” and would be “removed from the company.”\n\n           For similar reasons, the ALJ disbelieved VAL’s proffered\n\nreasons for suspending Negrón for two weeks beginning on March 22.\n\nVAL justified the action as an additional penalty for the March 1\n\nincident and as a sanction for Negrón’s disrespectful comments\n\nabout VAL’s management during the March 19 meeting.           The ALJ noted\n\nthat VAL’s witnesses had failed to come up with any reason why it\n\nwould have punished Negrón twice for the same alleged misconduct,\n\nparticularly when, again, Ramos had been punished only once for\n\nactions that were at least as objectionable.         The ALJ also pointed\n\nout that basing the suspension on Negrón’s comments at the meeting\n\nconflicted with the facts that (1) VAL had called the meeting\n\nspecifically to allow its pilots to air their grievances and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f(2) Gonzalez had offered nothing but praise for Negrón’s comments\n\nat the meeting itself.     In light of these deficiencies in VAL’s\n\nexplanation, the ALJ acted well within his discretion in rejecting\n\nit and concluding that the fallout from Negrón’s report to the FAA\n\nat least contributed to his suspension immediately thereafter.\n\n          In finding that Negrón had shown that his contacts with\n\nthe FAA precipitated his transfer to Vieques, the ALJ again relied\n\non the fact that the contacts closely preceded the personnel\n\naction.   In particular, the ALJ noted that, in a letter of April\n\n29, 2002, Negrón had mentioned that he had been praised by an FAA\n\ninspector during his meeting with VAL employees for bringing safety\n\nconcerns to the agency’s attention, only to receive word of the\n\ntransfer a week later, on May 6, 2002.\n\n          VAL contended that it needed someone to pilot its new 6\n\na.m. flight out of Vieques and that it selected Negrón, as opposed\n\nto one of the pilots already living on that island, simply because\n\nhe was the least senior.     The ALJ, however, did not accept this\n\nexplanation, largely because VAL had not cited Negrón’s lack of\n\nseniority as the reason for his transfer until the hearing itself.\n\nAs the ARB noted in concurring with the ALJ on this point, the fact\n\nthat an employer offers shifting explanations for its challenged\n\npersonnel action can itself serve to demonstrate pretext.     E.C.\n\nWaste, Inc. v. NLRB, 359 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir. 2004).    There was\n\nsubstantial evidence, then, to support the conclusion that Negrón’s\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fcomplaints to the FAA contributed to the decision to reassign him\n\nto Vieques.   We therefore conclude that the ARB properly affirmed\n\nthe ALJ’s decision that VAL suspended and transferred Negrón\n\nbecause of his reports of safety violations to both the FAA and\n\nVAL.\n\n           Finally, VAL challenges certain aspects of the relief\n\nawarded to Negrón, namely $50,000 in compensatory damages for\n\nmental anguish and $15,961.48 in attorneys’ fees.     In fixing the\n\nnoneconomic damage award, the ALJ relied on Negrón’s testimony that\n\nhe struggled to support his wife and two infant children while he\n\nlooked for new full-time employment following his termination by\n\nVAL.    Although Negrón found a new job by mid-September, 2002, in\n\nthe meantime he was forced to sell both of his family’s modest cars\n\nand deplete their meager savings to make ends meet.          Negrón\n\nspecifically testified that this ordeal caused him suffering and\n\npain.   The ALJ noted that like circumstances had justified similar\n\nawards in a number of cases which had come before the ARB; for its\n\npart, the ARB agreed with this assessment. Accordingly, we believe\n\nthat substantial evidence supported the $50,000 award that Negrón\n\nreceived for the mental anguish caused by his termination.\n\n           Following his decision on the merits of Negrón’s claims,\n\nthe ALJ issued a separate order awarding Negrón his attorneys’ fees\n\nin prosecuting his complaint to the Department of Labor that VAL\n\nhad violated AIR 21.   VAL, however, did not challenge the fee award\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fbefore the ARB.   By Department rule, “[a]ny party desiring to seek\n\nreview,   including   judicial    review,   of   a   decision   of   the\n\nadministrative law judge . . . must file a written petition for\n\nreview with the [ARB] . . . .    Any exception not specifically urged\n\nordinarily shall be deemed to have been waived by the parties.”       29\n\nC.F.R. § 1979.110.    Relying on this rule, the ARB simply treated\n\nthe ALJ’s award of attorneys’ fees as final in the absence of any\n\nobjection from VAL.   We must therefore do the same.     See Trafalgar\n\nCapital Assocs. v. Cuomo, 159 F.3d 21, 36 n.15 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(citing Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 153-54 (1993)).\n\n\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, VAL’s petition for review of\n\nthe ARB’s decision is DENIED.\n\n\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

Following an evidentiary hearing, an administrative law judge for the Department ruled that VAL had violated Section 519 of the Wendell H. Ford Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, colloquially known as \"AIR 21,\" by retaliating against Negr&#243;n for reporting the airline's violations of federal air safety standards, <i>see</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(a), and entered an award in his favor.

VAL initially suspended Negr&#243;n for two days, effective March 1, 2002, following his argument that day with Johnny Ramos-Melendez, the supervisor of the VAL counter at Isla Grande Airport in San Juan. Ramos became upset with Negr&#243;n when he started using a scale at the counter to verify passengers' weights that Ramos had already entered on the flight manifest. In response, Ramos physically interposed himself between Negr&#243;n and the scale; Negr&#243;n threatened to call the FAA and the local police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramos used the phone at the counter to call VAL's director of operations, Francisco Cruz, about the situation. Although Cruz asked to speak to Negr&#243;n, he was on his cell phone with the police at that point, so he did not pick up the counter phone to talk to Cruz. Cruz then told Ramos to have a different pilot make Negr&#243;n's scheduled flight because of his agitated condition. Although there were passengers in the waiting area during the brouhaha, they remained about fifteen feet away and therefore did not see anything out of the ordinary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Negr&#243;n called Cruz and gave his own version of the incident, with which Cruz later said he was \"satisfied.\" In fact, less than a week earlier, Cruz had reprimanded Ramos for inaccurately recording passengers' weights on a manifest. Nevertheless, Cruz told Negr&#243;n that he was suspended without pay for the balance of the two days remaining in his shift due to the fact that he and Ramos had argued in the presence of passengers. Ramos, for his part, testified that Cruz later told him that he would receive a paid suspension and, furthermore, that Negr&#243;n was \"too strict in his work\" and would be \"removed from the company.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although Cruz denied making this statement, the ALJ credited Ramos's version of the meeting, and the ARB in turn accepted the ALJ's resolution of the conflicting testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n sent VAL a letter on March 20, 2002, objecting to his suspension and stating his intention to make a report to the FAA about the March 1 incident and \"other irregularities.\" In fact, Negr&#243;n had alerted the FAA to that incident the day it occurred. On March 22, 2002, the FAA conducted an inspection of VAL's Isla Grande operations. VAL's president, Osvaldo Gonzalez, testified that he knew the inspection came about as a result of Negr&#243;n's complaint to the FAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That evening, VAL's chief pilot, Jimmy Adams, called Negr&#243;n at home to tell him that VAL had a letter waiting for him. The letter, signed by Gonzalez and dated March 22, 2002, advised Negr&#243;n that he had been suspended without pay for fifteen days for the March 1 incident and for his conduct at a March 19, 2002, meeting between VAL's pilots and its management. Gonzalez had called the meeting to give Negr&#243;n and his fellow pilots an opportunity to air their grievances, but testified that he became upset at Negr&#243;n's criticism of the abilities of VAL's management. At the meeting itself, however, Gonzalez had openly praised Negr&#243;n for his comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez acknowledged that the fifteen-day suspension amounted, at least in part, to a second disciplinary action taken in response to the same March 1 incident. Although Gonzalez denied knowing when he handed down the suspension that Negr&#243;n had complained to the FAA, the ALJ did not find this denial credible because of inconsistencies in Gonzalez's testimony on this point. Again, the ARB accepted the ALJ's credibility determination. Negr&#243;n wrote to Gonzalez on March 23, 2002, objecting to the suspension on a number of grounds, including that it closely followed the FAA's inspection of VAL's operations for violations of the kind Negr&#243;n had previously reported. Gonzalez reviewed the letter, but it failed to sway him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By late April, Negr&#243;n began to believe that Cruz was singling him out by regularly conducting interviews with his passengers after his flights had landed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Negr&#243;n communicated this suspicion to Cruz through an April 29, 2002, letter. The letter also noted that, during a meeting earlier that month between an FAA inspector and a number of VAL employees held to reacquaint them with proper weight procedures and other safety standards, the inspector had commended Negr&#243;n for reporting irregularities at VAL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten days later, VAL notified Negr&#243;n that, effective June 4, 2002, he was to report at the beginning of each workday to the airline's terminal in Vieques, rather than its terminal in Fajardo, on Isla Grande, as he had been. The memorandum informing Negr&#243;n of his reassignment explained that he would pilot VAL's first flight out of Vieques to Fajardo at 6 a.m. Upon receiving this news from Adams, Negr&#243;n immediately asked how he would get from his home on Isla Grande to the island of Vieques each day, given that he had no access to a boat or a plane and there was no public transportation. Adams made no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n raised the logistical problem created by his transfer again in a May 11, 2002, letter to Adams, and, in another letter, dated June 3, 2002, announced that he would report to Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. the next day, when he expected the airline to provide him transportation to Vieques. Negr&#243;n indeed showed up at Fajardo as promised, wearing his uniform and carrying the necessary equipment. He was ignored by VAL personnel for most of the day, until another pilot delivered a letter from Cruz reprimanding Negr&#243;n for being there and warning him that VAL would consider his employment abandoned if he did not report to Vieques by 6 a.m. the next day. Negr&#243;n wrote back that, though he lived in the San Juan area with his wife and two children, as the airline was aware, he had in fact attempted to get to Vieques by 6 a.m. He added that he was not abandoning his employment and that he planned to report to Fajardo again the next morning to await transportation to Vieques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Cruz denied that VAL had any responsibility to get Negr&#243;n to his new assignment on Vieques. Negr&#243;n proceeded to report to Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. on June 5, 2005, despite Cruz's instruction to the contrary. Negr&#243;n also wrote another letter to Cruz that day reiterating his desire to keep his job but explaining that he could not afford the costs of traveling to and staying overnight in Vieques, given the expense of maintaining his family in the San Juan area. On June 13, 2002, Cruz notified Negr&#243;n that he had abandoned his position by failing to show up at Vieques by 6 a.m. on June 6, 2002, and that he would therefore be replaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez testified that Cruz made the decision to transfer Negr&#243;n. Gonzalez also said, however, that he had a discussion with Cruz about having one of the VAL pilots who lived in Vieques&#8212;rather than Negr&#243;n, who Gonzalez knew to reside near San Juan&#8212;make the first flight out of Vieques each day, but it was decided to assign Negr&#243;n to the flight because the pilots living in Vieques had more seniority. VAL, however, did not mention seniority as a reason for the transfer in any of its communications with Negr&#243;n on the subject prior to his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on May 7, 2002, Negr&#243;n filed a timely complaint with the Department of Labor alleging that VAL had violated AIR 21 by suspending him on March 22. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(b)(1). Finding reasonable cause to believe that a violation had, in fact, occurred, both in the form of the suspension and the subsequent transfer and termination, the Department issued a preliminary order in Negr&#243;n's favor on November 25, 2002. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 42112(b)(2)(A). VAL objected and requested an evidentiary hearing, <i>see id.,</i> which the ALJ conducted between May 19 and May 21, 2003. Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a decision and order concluding that VAL had violated AIR 21 through its treatment of Negr&#243;n, ordering his reinstatement with the airline, and awarding him back pay, certain out-of-pocket expenses, and damages for mental anguish. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 42121(b)(3)(B). VAL then sought review of the ALJ's actions before the ARB, which affirmed them in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 519 of AIR 21, in relevant part, prevents an airline from discriminating against an employee because he or she \"provided ... to the employer or Federal Government information relating to any violation or alleged violation of any order, regulation, or standard of the [FAA] or any other provision of law relating to air carrier safety under [Title 49, Subchapter VII] or any other law of the United States....\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(a). The ALJ ruled that VAL violated this provision by suspending Negr&#243;n twice, then transferring him, because he complained to both management and the FAA about several instances where VAL failed to determine the weight aboard one of its planes properly before flying. VAL challenges three of the findings underlying this conclusion, and affirmed by the ARB, on the ground that they were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, VAL argues that the ALJ could not have found that the airline retaliated against Negr&#243;n for complaining about possible safety problems because VAL was unaware of those complaints when it suspended and transferred him. The evidence presented to the ALJ, however, vitiates this contention. Just two days after Negr&#243;n had notified his employer in writing that he would be reporting the incident of March 1, 2002, to the FAA, an inspector from that agency showed up at VAL. Despite acknowledging that Negr&#243;n's report had precipitated this visit, Gonzalez testified that he did not know of the complaint when he issued his suspension of Negr&#243;n later that same day. As the ARB determined, the ALJ acted well within his discretion in rejecting that testimony and finding that VAL knew of Negr&#243;n's report to the FAA when the airline suspended him on March 22, 2002, and when it announced its decision to transfer him on May 6, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Negr&#243;n's initial two-day suspension, effected on March 1, 2002, VAL points out the lack of evidence of its awareness, at that time, that he had made any complaints to the FAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> AIR 21, however, protects not only those who report air safety violations to the government, but also those who make such reports to their employers. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(a). The ALJ specifically found that Cruz, VAL's director of operations, knew at the time he suspended Negr&#243;n for his argument with Ramos that the argument had arisen out of Negr&#243;n's insistence on verifying the passenger weights that Ramos had entered on the manifest. Indeed, before Cruz issued the suspension, he spoke to Negr&#243;n, who provided his own account of his confrontation with Ramos. The ALJ supportably found that this account constituted a report of an air safety violation to VAL and, furthermore, that Cruz received the report before taking disciplinary action against Negr&#243;n. Accordingly, the ARB did not err in adopting these findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, VAL challenges the ALJ's determination that reassigning Negr&#243;n's first daily flight from Fajardo to Vieques amounted to discrimination with respect to the terms, conditions, or privileges of his employment as proscribed by AIR 21. As an initial matter, we note that the ALJ found that Negr&#243;n's transfer amounted to <i>both</i> a constructive discharge <i>and</i> one of the other unspecified types of adverse employment action independently prohibited by the statute, and that the ARB accepted both of these findings. Unlike the finding that the transfer was simply an adverse employment action, the finding that it amounted to a constructive discharge was essential to the damages Negr&#243;n was awarded, so we focus on that aspect of the ALJ's decision. <i>See Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc.,</i> 109 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To prove that he was constructively discharged, [an employee] must show that the new `working conditions imposed by the employer had become so onerous, abusive, or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.'\" <i>Mercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co.,</i> 396 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2000)). In concluding that Negr&#243;n had suffered a constructive discharge, the ALJ noted that, after learning of his transfer to Vieques, Negr&#243;n repeatedly asked his employer for assistance in getting there by 6 a.m. each day, but received no response whatsoever. Nevertheless, Negr&#243;n made his own, albeit unsuccessful, effort to comply with his new assignment, which included showing up ready for work at Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. with the hope that VAL would get him to Vieques by 6. Although VAL argued that Negr&#243;n could have simply joined some of his fellow pilots in securing overnight accommodations in Vieques, the ALJ relied on Negr&#243;n's testimony that he could not afford the additional costs of staying there, while maintaining his young family in the San Juan area, on his weekly salary of $330.75. \"Doubtless a drastic increase in commuting time and unreimbursed costs might at some point become sufficiently onerous to justify an employee in quitting.\" <i>Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago,</i> 562 F.2d 114, 120 (1st Cir.1977) (footnote omitted). The ALJ had sufficient evidence before him to support his conclusion that the transfer to Vieques imposed such conditions on Negr&#243;n and therefore amounted to a constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, VAL disputes the ALJ's finding that the transfer, as well as the two suspensions that preceded it, were motivated by Negr&#243;n's reports of safety violations to the FAA and to VAL itself. AIR 21 puts the burden on the employee to show that his or her protected behavior under the statute \"was a contributing factor\" in the adverse employment action suffered. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(b)(2)(B)(iii). If the employee carries this burden, the employer nevertheless avoids liability if it \"demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that [protected] behavior.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 42121(b)(2)(B)(iv).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with this framework, the ALJ found, and the ARB agreed, that Negr&#243;n had demonstrated that his complaints of safety violations contributed to both of his suspensions and his transfer, and that VAL had failed to show the contrary by clear and convincing evidence. The ALJ concluded, as a result, that VAL had taken the adverse employment actions against Negr&#243;n because of his complaints in violation of section 42121(a). This approach comports with the general rule in employment discrimination cases that \"a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\" <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <i>see also Currier v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> 393 F.3d 246, 255 (1st Cir.2004). Furthermore, we see substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the ALJ's determinations that, in the case of each unfavorable personnel action, Negr&#243;n succeeded in showing that it arose from his safety complaints and that VAL failed to prove that those complaints were unconnected to its decisions. We explain briefly. Both the March 1 and the March 22 suspension followed almost immediately on the heels of reports Negr&#243;n made about air safety violations at VAL. The ALJ permissibly treated the temporal proximity between the reports and the suspensions as sufficient to show the requisite causal relationship. <i>See Bechtel Constr. Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 50 F.3d 926, 934 (11th Cir.1995) (applying identical standards of whistleblower protection provisions of Energy Reorganization Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also supportably found that VAL's attempts to explain these disciplinary actions as unconnected to Negr&#243;n's safety complaints did not wash. Although VAL claimed it suspended Negr&#243;n on March 1 because he had argued with Ramos in front of the airline's passengers, Ramos testified that the passengers had remained far enough away that they would not have perceived that anything was amiss. The ALJ also noted the conflict between the decision to suspend Negr&#243;n and Cruz's testimony that he was satisfied with Negr&#243;n's explanation for the incident, as well as the less severe sanction Cruz imposed on Ramos even though he had been caught violating FAA weight regulations for the third time. If this were not enough, the ALJ also found that Cruz had told Ramos, in discussing the March 1 incident, that Negr&#243;n was \"too strict in his work\" and would be \"removed from the company.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, the ALJ disbelieved VAL's proffered reasons for suspending Negr&#243;n for two weeks beginning on March 22. VAL justified the action as an additional penalty for the March 1 incident and as a sanction for Negr&#243;n's disrespectful comments about VAL's management during the March 19 meeting. The ALJ noted that VAL's witnesses had failed to come up with any reason why it would have punished Negr&#243;n twice for the same alleged misconduct, particularly when, again, Ramos had been punished only once for actions that were at least as objectionable. The ALJ also pointed out that basing the suspension on Negr&#243;n's comments at the meeting conflicted with the facts that (1) VAL had called the meeting specifically to allow its pilots to air their grievances and (2) Gonzalez had offered nothing but praise for Negr&#243;n's comments at the meeting itself. In light of these deficiencies in VAL's explanation, the ALJ acted well within his discretion in rejecting it and concluding that the fallout from Negr&#243;n's report to the FAA at least contributed to his suspension immediately thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding that Negr&#243;n had shown that his contacts with the FAA precipitated his transfer to Vieques, the ALJ again relied on the fact that the contacts closely preceded the personnel action. In particular, the ALJ noted that, in a letter of April 29, 2002, Negr&#243;n had mentioned that he had been praised by an FAA inspector during his meeting with VAL employees for bringing safety concerns to the agency's attention, only to receive word of the transfer a week later, on May 6, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VAL contended that it needed someone to pilot its new 6 a.m. flight out of Vieques and that it selected Negr&#243;n, as opposed to one of the pilots already living on that island, simply because he was the least senior. The ALJ, however, did not accept this explanation, largely because VAL had not cited Negr&#243;n's lack of seniority as the reason for his transfer until the hearing itself. As the ARB noted in concurring with the ALJ on this point, the fact that an employer offers shifting explanations for its challenged personnel action can itself serve to demonstrate pretext. <i>E.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 359 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir. 2004). There was substantial evidence, then, to support the conclusion that Negr&#243;n's complaints to the FAA contributed to the decision to reassign him to Vieques. We therefore conclude that the ARB properly affirmed the ALJ's decision that VAL suspended and transferred Negr&#243;n because of his reports of safety violations to both the FAA and VAL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, VAL challenges certain aspects of the relief awarded to Negr&#243;n, namely $50,000 in compensatory damages for mental anguish and $15,961.48 in attorneys' fees. In fixing the noneconomic damage award, the ALJ relied on Negr&#243;n's testimony that he struggled to support his wife and two infant children while he looked for new full-time employment following his termination by VAL. Although Negr&#243;n found a new job by mid-September, 2002, in the meantime he was forced to sell both of his family's modest cars and deplete their meager savings to make ends meet. Negr&#243;n specifically testified that this ordeal caused him suffering and pain. The ALJ noted that like circumstances had justified similar awards in a number of cases which had come before the ARB; for its part, the ARB agreed with this assessment. Accordingly, we believe that substantial evidence supported the $50,000 award that Negr&#243;n received for the mental anguish caused by his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his decision on the merits of Negr&#243;n's claims, the ALJ issued a separate order awarding Negr&#243;n his attorneys' fees in prosecuting his complaint to the Department of Labor that VAL had violated AIR 21. VAL, however, did not challenge the fee award before the ARB. By Department rule, \"[a]ny party desiring to seek review, including judicial review, of a decision of the administrative law judge... must file a written petition for review with the [ARB] .... Any exception not specifically urged ordinarily shall be deemed to have been waived by the parties.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1979.110. Relying on this rule, the ARB simply treated the ALJ's award of attorneys' fees as final in the absence of any objection from VAL. We must therefore do the same. <i>See Trafalgar Capital Assocs. v. Cuomo,</i> 159 F.3d 21, 36 n. 15 (1st Cir.1998) (citing <i>Darby v.

VAL initially suspended Negr&#243;n for two days, effective March 1, 2002, following his argument that day with Johnny Ramos-Melendez, the supervisor of the VAL counter at Isla Grande Airport in San Juan. Ramos became upset with Negr&#243;n when he started using a scale at the counter to verify passengers' weights that Ramos had already entered on the flight manifest. In response, Ramos physically interposed himself between Negr&#243;n and the scale; Negr&#243;n threatened to call the FAA and the local police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramos used the phone at the counter to call VAL's director of operations, Francisco Cruz, about the situation. Although Cruz asked to speak to Negr&#243;n, he was on his cell phone with the police at that point, so he did not pick up the counter phone to talk to Cruz. Cruz then told Ramos to have a different pilot make Negr&#243;n's scheduled flight because of his agitated condition. Although there were passengers in the waiting area during the brouhaha, they remained about fifteen feet away and therefore did not see anything out of the ordinary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Negr&#243;n called Cruz and gave his own version of the incident, with which Cruz later said he was \"satisfied.\" In fact, less than a week earlier, Cruz had reprimanded Ramos for inaccurately recording passengers' weights on a manifest. Nevertheless, Cruz told Negr&#243;n that he was suspended without pay for the balance of the two days remaining in his shift due to the fact that he and Ramos had argued in the presence of passengers. Ramos, for his part, testified that Cruz later told him that he would receive a paid suspension and, furthermore, that Negr&#243;n was \"too strict in his work\" and would be \"removed from the company.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Although Cruz denied making this statement, the ALJ credited Ramos's version of the meeting, and the ARB in turn accepted the ALJ's resolution of the conflicting testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n sent VAL a letter on March 20, 2002, objecting to his suspension and stating his intention to make a report to the FAA about the March 1 incident and \"other irregularities.\" In fact, Negr&#243;n had alerted the FAA to that incident the day it occurred. On March 22, 2002, the FAA conducted an inspection of VAL's Isla Grande operations. VAL's president, Osvaldo Gonzalez, testified that he knew the inspection came about as a result of Negr&#243;n's complaint to the FAA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That evening, VAL's chief pilot, Jimmy Adams, called Negr&#243;n at home to tell him that VAL had a letter waiting for him. The letter, signed by Gonzalez and dated March 22, 2002, advised Negr&#243;n that he had been suspended without pay for fifteen days for the March 1 incident and for his conduct at a March 19, 2002, meeting between VAL's pilots and its management. Gonzalez had called the meeting to give Negr&#243;n and his fellow pilots an opportunity to air their grievances, but testified that he became upset at Negr&#243;n's criticism of the abilities of VAL's management. At the meeting itself, however, Gonzalez had openly praised Negr&#243;n for his comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez acknowledged that the fifteen-day suspension amounted, at least in part, to a second disciplinary action taken in response to the same March 1 incident. Although Gonzalez denied knowing when he handed down the suspension that Negr&#243;n had complained to the FAA, the ALJ did not find this denial credible because of inconsistencies in Gonzalez's testimony on this point. Again, the ARB accepted the ALJ's credibility determination. Negr&#243;n wrote to Gonzalez on March 23, 2002, objecting to the suspension on a number of grounds, including that it closely followed the FAA's inspection of VAL's operations for violations of the kind Negr&#243;n had previously reported. Gonzalez reviewed the letter, but it failed to sway him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By late April, Negr&#243;n began to believe that Cruz was singling him out by regularly conducting interviews with his passengers after his flights had landed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Negr&#243;n communicated this suspicion to Cruz through an April 29, 2002, letter. The letter also noted that, during a meeting earlier that month between an FAA inspector and a number of VAL employees held to reacquaint them with proper weight procedures and other safety standards, the inspector had commended Negr&#243;n for reporting irregularities at VAL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten days later, VAL notified Negr&#243;n that, effective June 4, 2002, he was to report at the beginning of each workday to the airline's terminal in Vieques, rather than its terminal in Fajardo, on Isla Grande, as he had been. The memorandum informing Negr&#243;n of his reassignment explained that he would pilot VAL's first flight out of Vieques to Fajardo at 6 a.m. Upon receiving this news from Adams, Negr&#243;n immediately asked how he would get from his home on Isla Grande to the island of Vieques each day, given that he had no access to a boat or a plane and there was no public transportation. Adams made no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negr&#243;n raised the logistical problem created by his transfer again in a May 11, 2002, letter to Adams, and, in another letter, dated June 3, 2002, announced that he would report to Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. the next day, when he expected the airline to provide him transportation to Vieques. Negr&#243;n indeed showed up at Fajardo as promised, wearing his uniform and carrying the necessary equipment. He was ignored by VAL personnel for most of the day, until another pilot delivered a letter from Cruz reprimanding Negr&#243;n for being there and warning him that VAL would consider his employment abandoned if he did not report to Vieques by 6 a.m. the next day. Negr&#243;n wrote back that, though he lived in the San Juan area with his wife and two children, as the airline was aware, he had in fact attempted to get to Vieques by 6 a.m. He added that he was not abandoning his employment and that he planned to report to Fajardo again the next morning to await transportation to Vieques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Cruz denied that VAL had any responsibility to get Negr&#243;n to his new assignment on Vieques. Negr&#243;n proceeded to report to Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. on June 5, 2005, despite Cruz's instruction to the contrary. Negr&#243;n also wrote another letter to Cruz that day reiterating his desire to keep his job but explaining that he could not afford the costs of traveling to and staying overnight in Vieques, given the expense of maintaining his family in the San Juan area. On June 13, 2002, Cruz notified Negr&#243;n that he had abandoned his position by failing to show up at Vieques by 6 a.m. on June 6, 2002, and that he would therefore be replaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez testified that Cruz made the decision to transfer Negr&#243;n. Gonzalez also said, however, that he had a discussion with Cruz about having one of the VAL pilots who lived in Vieques&#8212;rather than Negr&#243;n, who Gonzalez knew to reside near San Juan&#8212;make the first flight out of Vieques each day, but it was decided to assign Negr&#243;n to the flight because the pilots living in Vieques had more seniority. VAL, however, did not mention seniority as a reason for the transfer in any of its communications with Negr&#243;n on the subject prior to his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on May 7, 2002, Negr&#243;n filed a timely complaint with the Department of Labor alleging that VAL had violated AIR 21 by suspending him on March 22. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(b)(1). Finding reasonable cause to believe that a violation had, in fact, occurred, both in the form of the suspension and the subsequent transfer and termination, the Department issued a preliminary order in Negr&#243;n's favor on November 25, 2002. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 42112(b)(2)(A). VAL objected and requested an evidentiary hearing, <i>see id.,</i> which the ALJ conducted between May 19 and May 21, 2003. Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a decision and order concluding that VAL had violated AIR 21 through its treatment of Negr&#243;n, ordering his reinstatement with the airline, and awarding him back pay, certain out-of-pocket expenses, and damages for mental anguish. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 42121(b)(3)(B). VAL then sought review of the ALJ's actions before the ARB, which affirmed them in their entirety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 519 of AIR 21, in relevant part, prevents an airline from discriminating against an employee because he or she \"provided ... to the employer or Federal Government information relating to any violation or alleged violation of any order, regulation, or standard of the [FAA] or any other provision of law relating to air carrier safety under [Title 49, Subchapter VII] or any other law of the United States....\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(a). The ALJ ruled that VAL violated this provision by suspending Negr&#243;n twice, then transferring him, because he complained to both management and the FAA about several instances where VAL failed to determine the weight aboard one of its planes properly before flying. VAL challenges three of the findings underlying this conclusion, and affirmed by the ARB, on the ground that they were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, VAL argues that the ALJ could not have found that the airline retaliated against Negr&#243;n for complaining about possible safety problems because VAL was unaware of those complaints when it suspended and transferred him. The evidence presented to the ALJ, however, vitiates this contention. Just two days after Negr&#243;n had notified his employer in writing that he would be reporting the incident of March 1, 2002, to the FAA, an inspector from that agency showed up at VAL. Despite acknowledging that Negr&#243;n's report had precipitated this visit, Gonzalez testified that he did not know of the complaint when he issued his suspension of Negr&#243;n later that same day. As the ARB determined, the ALJ acted well within his discretion in rejecting that testimony and finding that VAL knew of Negr&#243;n's report to the FAA when the airline suspended him on March 22, 2002, and when it announced its decision to transfer him on May 6, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Negr&#243;n's initial two-day suspension, effected on March 1, 2002, VAL points out the lack of evidence of its awareness, at that time, that he had made any complaints to the FAA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> AIR 21, however, protects not only those who report air safety violations to the government, but also those who make such reports to their employers. <i>See</i> 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(a). The ALJ specifically found that Cruz, VAL's director of operations, knew at the time he suspended Negr&#243;n for his argument with Ramos that the argument had arisen out of Negr&#243;n's insistence on verifying the passenger weights that Ramos had entered on the manifest. Indeed, before Cruz issued the suspension, he spoke to Negr&#243;n, who provided his own account of his confrontation with Ramos. The ALJ supportably found that this account constituted a report of an air safety violation to VAL and, furthermore, that Cruz received the report before taking disciplinary action against Negr&#243;n. Accordingly, the ARB did not err in adopting these findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, VAL challenges the ALJ's determination that reassigning Negr&#243;n's first daily flight from Fajardo to Vieques amounted to discrimination with respect to the terms, conditions, or privileges of his employment as proscribed by AIR 21. As an initial matter, we note that the ALJ found that Negr&#243;n's transfer amounted to <i>both</i> a constructive discharge <i>and</i> one of the other unspecified types of adverse employment action independently prohibited by the statute, and that the ARB accepted both of these findings. Unlike the finding that the transfer was simply an adverse employment action, the finding that it amounted to a constructive discharge was essential to the damages Negr&#243;n was awarded, so we focus on that aspect of the ALJ's decision. <i>See Serrano-Cruz v. DFI P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738222\"><a href=\"/opinion/738222/digna-serrano-cruz-hector-irizarry-and-the-conjugal-society-comprised/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To prove that he was constructively discharged, [an employee] must show that the new `working conditions imposed by the employer had become so onerous, abusive, or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.'\" <i>Mercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201418\"><a href=\"/opinion/201418/mercado-alicea-v-pr-tourism-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770706\"><a href=\"/opinion/770706/ramon-m-suarez-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2000)). In concluding that Negr&#243;n had suffered a constructive discharge, the ALJ noted that, after learning of his transfer to Vieques, Negr&#243;n repeatedly asked his employer for assistance in getting there by 6 a.m. each day, but received no response whatsoever. Nevertheless, Negr&#243;n made his own, albeit unsuccessful, effort to comply with his new assignment, which included showing up ready for work at Fajardo at 5:30 a.m. with the hope that VAL would get him to Vieques by 6. Although VAL argued that Negr&#243;n could have simply joined some of his fellow pilots in securing overnight accommodations in Vieques, the ALJ relied on Negr&#243;n's testimony that he could not afford the additional costs of staying there, while maintaining his young family in the San Juan area, on his weekly salary of $330.75. \"Doubtless a drastic increase in commuting time and unreimbursed costs might at some point become sufficiently onerous to justify an employee in quitting.\" <i>Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349221\"><a href=\"/opinion/349221/israel-alicea-rosado-v-ramon-garcia-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 120 (1st Cir.1977) (footnote omitted). The ALJ had sufficient evidence before him to support his conclusion that the transfer to Vieques imposed such conditions on Negr&#243;n and therefore amounted to a constructive discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, VAL disputes the ALJ's finding that the transfer, as well as the two suspensions that preceded it, were motivated by Negr&#243;n's reports of safety violations to the FAA and to VAL itself. AIR 21 puts the burden on the employee to show that his or her protected behavior under the statute \"was a contributing factor\" in the adverse employment action suffered. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 42121(b)(2)(B)(iii). If the employee carries this burden, the employer nevertheless avoids liability if it \"demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that [protected] behavior.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 42121(b)(2)(B)(iv).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with this framework, the ALJ found, and the ARB agreed, that Negr&#243;n had demonstrated that his complaints of safety violations contributed to both of his suspensions and his transfer, and that VAL had failed to show the contrary by clear and convincing evidence. The ALJ concluded, as a result, that VAL had taken the adverse employment actions against Negr&#243;n because of his complaints in violation of section 42121(a). This approach comports with the general rule in employment discrimination cases that \"a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\" <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 148, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (2000); <i>see also Currier v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201387\"><a href=\"/opinion/201387/currier-v-united-technologies/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 255 (1st Cir.2004). Furthermore, we see substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the ALJ's determinations that, in the case of each unfavorable personnel action, Negr&#243;n succeeded in showing that it arose from his safety complaints and that VAL failed to prove that those complaints were unconnected to its decisions. We explain briefly. Both the March 1 and the March 22 suspension followed almost immediately on the heels of reports Negr&#243;n made about air safety violations at VAL. The ALJ permissibly treated the temporal proximity between the reports and the suspensions as sufficient to show the requisite causal relationship. <i>See Bechtel Constr. Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70182\"><a href=\"/opinion/70182/bechtel-constr-v-sec-of-labr/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 934 (11th Cir.1995) (applying identical standards of whistleblower protection provisions of Energy Reorganization Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ also supportably found that VAL's attempts to explain these disciplinary actions as unconnected to Negr&#243;n's safety complaints did not wash. Although VAL claimed it suspended Negr&#243;n on March 1 because he had argued with Ramos in front of the airline's passengers, Ramos testified that the passengers had remained far enough away that they would not have perceived that anything was amiss. The ALJ also noted the conflict between the decision to suspend Negr&#243;n and Cruz's testimony that he was satisfied with Negr&#243;n's explanation for the incident, as well as the less severe sanction Cruz imposed on Ramos even though he had been caught violating FAA weight regulations for the third time. If this were not enough, the ALJ also found that Cruz had told Ramos, in discussing the March 1 incident, that Negr&#243;n was \"too strict in his work\" and would be \"removed from the company.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For similar reasons, the ALJ disbelieved VAL's proffered reasons for suspending Negr&#243;n for two weeks beginning on March 22. VAL justified the action as an additional penalty for the March 1 incident and as a sanction for Negr&#243;n's disrespectful comments about VAL's management during the March 19 meeting. The ALJ noted that VAL's witnesses had failed to come up with any reason why it would have punished Negr&#243;n twice for the same alleged misconduct, particularly when, again, Ramos had been punished only once for actions that were at least as objectionable. The ALJ also pointed out that basing the suspension on Negr&#243;n's comments at the meeting conflicted with the facts that (1) VAL had called the meeting specifically to allow its pilots to air their grievances and (2) Gonzalez had offered nothing but praise for Negr&#243;n's comments at the meeting itself. In light of these deficiencies in VAL's explanation, the ALJ acted well within his discretion in rejecting it and concluding that the fallout from Negr&#243;n's report to the FAA at least contributed to his suspension immediately thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding that Negr&#243;n had shown that his contacts with the FAA precipitated his transfer to Vieques, the ALJ again relied on the fact that the contacts closely preceded the personnel action. In particular, the ALJ noted that, in a letter of April 29, 2002, Negr&#243;n had mentioned that he had been praised by an FAA inspector during his meeting with VAL employees for bringing safety concerns to the agency's attention, only to receive word of the transfer a week later, on May 6, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VAL contended that it needed someone to pilot its new 6 a.m. flight out of Vieques and that it selected Negr&#243;n, as opposed to one of the pilots already living on that island, simply because he was the least senior. The ALJ, however, did not accept this explanation, largely because VAL had not cited Negr&#243;n's lack of seniority as the reason for his transfer until the hearing itself. As the ARB noted in concurring with the ALJ on this point, the fact that an employer offers shifting explanations for its challenged personnel action can itself serve to demonstrate pretext. <i>E.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200878\"><a href=\"/opinion/200878/ec-waste-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 2004). There was substantial evidence, then, to support the conclusion that Negr&#243;n's complaints to the FAA contributed to the decision to reassign him to Vieques. We therefore conclude that the ARB properly affirmed the ALJ's decision that VAL suspended and transferred Negr&#243;n because of his reports of safety violations to both the FAA and VAL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, VAL challenges certain aspects of the relief awarded to Negr&#243;n, namely $50,000 in compensatory damages for mental anguish and $15,961.48 in attorneys' fees. In fixing the noneconomic damage award, the ALJ relied on Negr&#243;n's testimony that he struggled to support his wife and two infant children while he looked for new full-time employment following his termination by VAL. Although Negr&#243;n found a new job by mid-September, 2002, in the meantime he was forced to sell both of his family's modest cars and deplete their meager savings to make ends meet. Negr&#243;n specifically testified that this ordeal caused him suffering and pain. The ALJ noted that like circumstances had justified similar awards in a number of cases which had come before the ARB; for its part, the ARB agreed with this assessment. Accordingly, we believe that substantial evidence supported the $50,000 award that Negr&#243;n received for the mental anguish caused by his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his decision on the merits of Negr&#243;n's claims, the ALJ issued a separate order awarding Negr&#243;n his attorneys' fees in prosecuting his complaint to the Department of Labor that VAL had violated AIR 21. VAL, however, did not challenge the fee award before the ARB. By Department rule, \"[a]ny party desiring to seek review, including judicial review, of a decision of the administrative law judge... must file a written petition for review with the [ARB] .... Any exception not specifically urged ordinarily shall be deemed to have been waived by the parties.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1979.110. Relying on this rule, the ARB simply treated the ALJ's award of attorneys' fees as final in the absence of any objection from VAL. We must therefore do the same. <i>See Trafalgar Capital Assocs. v.
