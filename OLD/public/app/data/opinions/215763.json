Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA,    Circuit    Judge.         In   this   appeal,      defendant-\n\nappellant   Larry     Matthews    attempts      to    challenge     a    sentencing\n\nenhancement imposed pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act\n\n(ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).        We conclude that the law of the case\n\ndoctrine bars the attempted challenge.\n\n            The   background     facts    are    catalogued    in   considerable\n\ndetail in our earlier opinion in this case, see United States v.\n\nMatthews (Matthews I), 498 F.3d 25, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2007), and we\n\nassume the reader's familiarity with that account.                      We rehearse\n\nhere only those facts needed to bring the law of the case issue\n\ninto focus.\n\n            In 2004, a jury convicted the defendant on a charge of\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.                     See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1).      At sentencing, the district court applied an\n\nACCA enhancement, thus triggering a mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nfifteen years.       Id. § 924(e)(1).       The enhancement rested on the\n\ncourt's subsidiary finding that the defendant had three prior\n\nconvictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.                     This\n\narray included a 1996 conviction for assault and battery with a\n\ndangerous weapon, a 1995 drug-trafficking conviction, and a 1992\n\njuvenile adjudication for assault and battery.                 Matthews I, 498\n\nF.3d at 32 n.5.       The defendant conceded (then and now) that the\n\nfirst two predicates were properly counted.                   Consequently, we\n\nconcentrate on the juvenile adjudication.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           With respect to the juvenile adjudication, the crucial\n\nquestion was whether the defendant, in committing this offense, had\n\nused a knife.    The government tried to prove this point through a\n\npolice report.     Relying on that report, the sentencing court\n\nanswered the \"knife\" question in the affirmative and ruled that the\n\njuvenile adjudication qualified as an ACCA predicate.\n\n           In his ensuing appeal, the defendant challenged both his\n\nconviction and his sentence.       See id. at 30.     With respect to the\n\njuvenile   adjudication,   he     argued   categorically      that   juvenile\n\nadjudications should not be counted as ACCA predicates and that, in\n\nall events, the facts relating to this particular adjudication\n\nshould have been proven to a jury as required by the holding in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).               He did not,\n\nhowever, take issue with the method by which the government had\n\nproved the facts related to the juvenile adjudication (i.e.,\n\nthrough the use of a police report).             We rejected all of the\n\ndefendant's   arguments    and,    on   August   7,   2007,   affirmed   his\n\nconviction and sentence.     Matthews I, 498 F.3d at 37.\n\n           The defendant filed an untimely petition for rehearing\n\nand rehearing en banc on September 21, 2007.          See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n35(c), 40(a)(1).     We summarily denied the late petition.              The\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdefendant then unsuccessfully sought certiorari.1                 Matthews v.\n\nUnited States, 552 U.S. 1238 (2008).\n\n            In   2009,   the    defendant    invoked   the    federal     habeas\n\nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 2255, and moved to vacate, set aside, or\n\ncorrect his sentence.          After some preliminary skirmishing (not\n\nrelevant here), the district court granted the motion in part and\n\nconvened a new sentencing hearing.            The government renewed its\n\nquest for the ACCA enhancement but, instead of relying exclusively\n\non   the   police   report     to   prove   the   nature    of   the    juvenile\n\nadjudication, introduced copies of various juvenile court documents\n\nobtained from the files of the Massachusetts Department of Youth\n\nServices.    The district court admitted these exogenous documents\n\ninto evidence and also allowed explanatory testimony.                  The court\n\nthen used the juvenile adjudication along with the defendant's\n\nother two convictions to ground an ACCA enhancement. It thereafter\n\nimposed the same mandatory minimum sentence.               This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       In his untimely rehearing petition, the defendant for the\nfirst time asserted a claim that the method by which the government\nhad proven the facts associated with the juvenile adjudication was\nimproper. He reasserted that claim in his certiorari petition.\nThese efforts were too late to preserve the claim.         See Am.\nPolicyholders Ins. Co. v. Nyacol Prods., Inc., 989 F.2d 1256, 1264\n(1st Cir. 1993) (explaining that \"a party may not raise new and\nadditional matters for the first time in a petition for\nrehearing\"); see also Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. 198, 205\n(2001) (discussing same principle in certiorari context).\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            In our view, this appeal turns on an application of the\n\nlaw of the case doctrine.   The defendant disagrees: he argues that\n\nthe law of the case issue is not properly before us because it is\n\nnot listed in the statement of issues on appeal.   See Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 28(a)(5).    This argument is hopeless.    In the absence of a\n\ncross-appeal — and none is needed here — an appellee is not\n\nrequired to file a statement of issues.       See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(b)(2).   Rather, an appellee may defend a favorable judgment on\n\nany ground made apparent by the record.2   Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.\n\nv. Ludwig, 426 U.S. 479, 481 (1976); United States v. Craven, 239\n\nF.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. 2001).     Thus, we proceed to consider the\n\ngovernment's threshold argument.\n\n            Writ large, the law of the case doctrine \"posits that\n\nwhen a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should\n\ncontinue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same\n\ncase.\"   Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983).      This\n\nmeans that \"a legal decision made at one stage of a civil or\n\ncriminal case, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal despite the\n\nexistence of ample opportunity to do so, becomes the law of the\n\ncase for future stages of the same litigation.\"    United States v.\n\nBell, 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir. 1993).       In other words, the\n\ndoctrine bars a party from resurrecting issues that either were, or\n\n\n     2\n       In any event, a court may raise law of the case issues sua\nsponte. See United States v. Wallace, 573 F.3d 82, 90 n.6 (1st\nCir. 2009).\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcould have been, decided on an earlier appeal.              See United States\n\nv. Connell, 6 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1993).           \"[T]he aggrieved party\n\nis deemed to have forfeited any right to challenge that particular\n\ndecision at a subsequent date.\"           Bell, 988 F.2d at 250.\n\n             This    salutary   approach    safeguards     \"the    finality   and\n\nefficiency of the judicial process by protecting against the\n\nagitation of settled issues.\"         Christianson v. Colt Indus. Oper.\n\nCorp., 486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe result is a sturdier, more stable decisionmaking process.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Martínez, 931 F.2d 148, 151 (1st Cir.\n\n1991); see also Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 647 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (explaining that \"the law of the case doctrine affords\n\nlitigants a high degree of certainty as to what claims are — and\n\nare not — still open for adjudication\").\n\n             The law of the case doctrine has two branches. The first\n\nbranch   —   known    colloquially   as    the   mandate    rule    —   \"prevents\n\nrelitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or\n\nimplicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same\n\ncase.\"   United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             The second branch of the doctrine binds a \"successor\n\nappellate panel in a second appeal in the same case\" to honor fully\n\nthe original decision. Id. This branch \"contemplates that a legal\n\ndecision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should\n\nremain the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\funtil the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\"\n\nId.   Whether the doctrine applies in a specific instance is a\n\nquestion of law, engendering de novo review.       Negrón-Almeda v.\n\nSantiago, 579 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2009); Harlow v. Children's\n\nHosp., 432 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           We turn now from the general to the specific.      At the\n\ntime of the defendant's initial sentencing hearing, the Supreme\n\nCourt had already granted certiorari in Shepard v. United States,\n\n542 U.S. 981 (2004), which involved a challenge to the method of\n\nproving ACCA predicate convictions.       Shepard by then had been\n\nbriefed or argued, and the contours of the issue were clearly\n\ndelineated.   Yet when the government sought to prove the nature of\n\nthe juvenile adjudication at issue here through a police report,\n\nthe defendant made no contemporaneous objection.\n\n           Shortly thereafter — and well before the defendant's\n\ndirect appeal was briefed or argued — the Supreme Court decided\n\nShepard.   See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005).    This\n\ndecision clarified the method through which a predicate conviction\n\ncould be proved under the ACCA and forbade the use of a police\n\nreport for that purpose.   See id. at 21, 26.   This decision should\n\nnot have come as a surprise.          Beforehand (and prior   to the\n\ndefendant's sentencing) several courts had expressed doubt about\n\nthe use of police reports to prove predicate convictions, signaling\n\nthat such a tactic would offend Apprendi principles (and, thus,\n\n\n                                -7-\n\foffend the Constitution).   See, e.g., United States v. Allen, 282\n\nF.3d 339, 342-43 (5th Cir. 2002); United States v. Sparks, 265 F.3d\n\n825, 837 (9th Cir. 2001).      While this court had held to the\n\ncontrary, see United States v. Shepard, 348 F.3d 308, 314 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), rev'd sub nom., Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13\n\n(2005),3 that did not excuse a party wishing to preserve the issue\n\nfrom raising it.   See, e.g., Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S.\n\n614, 622-23 (1998); United States v. Lopéz-Peña, 912 F.2d 1542,\n\n1546 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Barreto-Barreto v. United States,\n\n551 F.3d 95, 101 (1st Cir. 2008).     The claim of error was readily\n\navailable, and \"the mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the\n\nfactual or legal basis for a claim, or failed to raise the claim\n\ndespite recognizing it\" is not enough to revive a defaulted claim.\n\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 486-87 (1986).\n\n          The defendant obviously knew about the Supreme Court's\n\nShepard decision (he cited it in his opening brief in Matthews I,\n\nalbeit for a different proposition), but failed to mount a claim of\n\nShepard error.   Nor did he seek reconsideration of the sentence in\n\nthe district court.   His belated efforts to repair these omissions\n\nin an untimely rehearing petition and in a subsequent certiorari\n\nfiling were too late and too little.     See supra note 1.   We have\n\nwarned that \"[t]he law ministers to the vigilant not to those who\n\n\n     3\n       Even within this circuit, skepticism had been voiced. See\nUnited States v. Delgado, 288 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2002) (Selya,\nJ., concurring).\n\n                                -8-\n\fsleep upon perceptible rights.\"             Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197,\n\n1203 (1st Cir. 1987).     So it is here: having defaulted the claim of\n\nShepard error the first time around, the defendant cannot, absent\n\nsome exceptional circumstance, resurrect it now. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Ellis, 619 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir. 2010) (per curiam);\n\nPeralta v. United States, 597 F.3d 74, 84 & n.12 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(per   curiam);   see   also   Connell,      6   F.3d     at   30   (warning      that\n\n\"litigants should not ordinarily be allowed to take serial bites at\n\nthe appellate apple\").\n\n             This is not quite the end of the matter.               The law of the\n\ncase doctrine is not a \"straitjacket for a court.\"                        Morgan v.\n\nBurke, 926 F.2d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1991).             There is a modest amount\n\nof play in the joints.         See Arizona, 460 U.S. at 618.                Withal,\n\nthese law of the case principles should not \"be lightly shrugged\n\naside,\" Rivera-Martínez, 931 F.2d at 151, and in the absence of\n\nexceptional    circumstances,      a   court     should    apply    the    doctrine\n\naccording to its tenor.        Connell, 6 F.3d at 31.\n\n             Such exceptional circumstances are rare and narrowly\n\ncircumscribed.    A party may avoid the application of the law of the\n\ncase doctrine only by showing that, in the relevant time frame,\n\n\"controlling legal authority has changed dramatically\"; or by\n\nshowing that \"significant new evidence, not earlier obtainable in\n\nthe exercise of due diligence,\" has come to light; or by showing\n\nthat   the    earlier   decision       is    blatantly     erroneous       and,     if\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\funcorrected, will work a miscarriage of justice. Bell, 988 F.2d at\n\n251; see Rivera-Martínez, 931 F.2d at 151 (collecting cases); White\n\nv. Murtha, 377 F.2d 428, 432 (5th Cir. 1967) (cited with approval\n\nin Arizona, 460 U.S. at 618 n.8).                       This case does not qualify for\n\nthe exception.\n\n              We can summarily dismiss the last two categories. On the\n\nfacts   here,       there     is       no    practical        reason    to   doubt    that    the\n\ndefendant         used    a   knife         when   he    committed       the    offense      that\n\nunderpinned the juvenile adjudication.                          Similarly, the defendant\n\ndoes not argue that there is any new, previously unavailable\n\nevidence that would benefit his position.\n\n              This       leaves        the    first     category,       which    requires      an\n\nintervening change in controlling legal authority.                              The defendant\n\nrelies on the Shepard decision to show such a change.                                        This\n\nreliance is misplaced.\n\n              To begin, we doubt that Shepard can be said to constitute\n\nan intervening change in the law.                        After all, the circuits were\n\nsplit   on    the        point    at    the    time      of    the     defendant's    original\n\nsentencing, and the legal theory undergirding a claim of Shepard\n\nerror was readily available to him.                       Moreover, the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Shepard before the defendant's appeal in Matthews I was\n\nbriefed      or    argued        and    before     his    sentence        became     final    and\n\nunappealable. The fact that Shepard was newly decided in that time\n\nframe, without more, does not trigger the exception.                               See Kashner\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\fDavidson Sec. Corp. v. Mscisz, 601 F.3d 19, 23 & n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n2010); Doe v. Chao, 511 F.3d 461, 467 (4th Cir. 2007).\n\n            If more were needed — and we do not think that it is — we\n\nnote that the defendant's present claim arises in the section 2255\n\ncontext.    The exceptions to the law of the case doctrine must be\n\napplied with special caution on collateral review.        See United\n\nStates v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 184 (1979) (explaining that it\n\nhas \"long been settled law that an error that may justify reversal\n\non direct appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack\n\non a final judgment\"); Ellis, 313 F.3d at 647 (noting that concerns\n\nunderlying the law of the case doctrine \"are heightened in the\n\nfederal habeas context\").     Allowing the defendant to raise a new\n\nargument in a habeas petition when he could (and should) have\n\nraised it either at his original sentencing or on direct review or\n\nboth would undermine the prudential goals of the law of the case\n\ndoctrine.   See Peoples v. United States, 403 F.3d 844, 846-47 (7th\n\nCir. 2005); United States v. Moran, 107 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997) (per\n\ncuriam) (table).\n\n            We need go no further.      Although the defendant makes\n\nadditional arguments — that the failure to prove the juvenile\n\nadjudication to a jury offended Apprendi principles, see Shepard,\n\n544 U.S. at 26-27 (Thomas, J., concurring), and that juvenile\n\nadjudications should never count as ACCA predicate convictions, see\n\nWelch v. United States, 604 F.3d 408, 432 (7th Cir. 2010) (Posner,\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fJ., dissenting) — he concedes that these plaints are foreclosed by\n\ncircuit precedent.      See, e.g., Ellis, 619 F.3d at 74; Matthews I,\n\n498 F.3d at 33, 35.      The short of it is that the defendant had a\n\nfull and fair opportunity to raise his claim of Shepard error both\n\nat his original sentencing and on direct review.           He did not do so.\n\nConsequently, he should not have been allowed to raise a belated\n\nShepard claim on collateral review.\n\n           This holding confronts us with a procedural anomaly. The\n\ndistrict court erred both in entertaining the defaulted claim of\n\nShepard error and in vacating the original sentence on that ground.\n\nYet, after conducting a new sentencing hearing, the court imposed\n\na sentence identical to the vacated sentence.           Given this outcome,\n\nit would be senseless to force the district court and the parties\n\nround and round the mulberry bush for no other reason than an\n\ninsistence on ceremonial punctiliousness.            Cf. Gibbs v. Buck, 307\n\nU.S. 66, 78 (1939) (terming it \"useless\" to reverse and remand\n\nwhere, after appeal was filed, district court corrected its own\n\nerror);   Jusino   v.   Zayas,   875   F.2d   986,   990   (1st   Cir.   1989)\n\n(observing that any error from district court's grant of a motion\n\nfor reconsideration over which it lacked jurisdiction was harmless\n\nbecause the court of appeals would have remanded case anyway).\n\nThus, we take a pragmatic course, treat the district court's errors\n\nas harmless, and simply leave the new sentence in place.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

In   this   appeal,      defendant-\n\nappellant   Larry     Matthews    attempts      to    challenge     a    sentencing\n\nenhancement imposed pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act\n\n(ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).        We conclude that the law of the case\n\ndoctrine bars the attempted challenge.\n\n            The   background     facts    are    catalogued    in   considerable\n\ndetail in our earlier opinion in this case, see United States v.\n\nMatthews (Matthews I), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202876\"><a href=\"/opinion/202876/united-states-v-matthews/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2007), and we\n\nassume the reader's familiarity with that account.                      We rehearse\n\nhere only those facts needed to bring the law of the case issue\n\ninto focus.\n\n            In 2004, a jury convicted the defendant on a charge of\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.                     See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1).      At sentencing, the district court applied an\n\nACCA enhancement, thus triggering a mandatory minimum sentence of\n\nfifteen years.       Id. § 924(e)(1).       The enhancement rested on the\n\ncourt's subsidiary finding that the defendant had three prior\n\nconvictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.                     This\n\narray included a 1996 conviction for assault and battery with a\n\ndangerous weapon, a 1995 drug-trafficking conviction, and a 1992\n\njuvenile adjudication for assault and battery.                 Matthews I, 498\n\nF.3d at 32 n.5.       The defendant conceded (then and now) that the\n\nfirst two predicates were properly counted.                   Consequently, we\n\nconcentrate on the juvenile adjudication.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           With respect to the juvenile adjudication, the crucial\n\nquestion was whether the defendant, in committing this offense, had\n\nused a knife.    The government tried to prove this point through a\n\npolice report.     Relying on that report, the sentencing court\n\nanswered the \"knife\" question in the affirmative and ruled that the\n\njuvenile adjudication qualified as an ACCA predicate.\n\n           In his ensuing appeal, the defendant challenged both his\n\nconviction and his sentence.       See id. at 30.     With respect to the\n\njuvenile   adjudication,   he     argued   categorically      that   juvenile\n\nadjudications should not be counted as ACCA predicates and that, in\n\nall events, the facts relating to this particular adjudication\n\nshould have been proven to a jury as required by the holding in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (2000).               He did not,\n\nhowever, take issue with the method by which the government had\n\nproved the facts related to the juvenile adjudication (i.e.,\n\nthrough the use of a police report).             We rejected all of the\n\ndefendant's   arguments    and,    on   August   7,   2007,   affirmed   his\n\nconviction and sentence.     Matthews I, 498 F.3d at 37.\n\n           The defendant filed an untimely petition for rehearing\n\nand rehearing en banc on September 21, 2007.          See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n35(c), 40(a)(1).     We summarily denied the late petition.              The\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdefendant then unsuccessfully sought certiorari.1                 Matthews v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).\n\n            In   2009,   the    defendant    invoked   the    federal     habeas\n\nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 2255, and moved to vacate, set aside, or\n\ncorrect his sentence.          After some preliminary skirmishing (not\n\nrelevant here), the district court granted the motion in part and\n\nconvened a new sentencing hearing.            The government renewed its\n\nquest for the ACCA enhancement but, instead of relying exclusively\n\non   the   police   report     to   prove   the   nature    of   the    juvenile\n\nadjudication, introduced copies of various juvenile court documents\n\nobtained from the files of the Massachusetts Department of Youth\n\nServices.    The district court admitted these exogenous documents\n\ninto evidence and also allowed explanatory testimony.                  The court\n\nthen used the juvenile adjudication along with the defendant's\n\nother two convictions to ground an ACCA enhancement. It thereafter\n\nimposed the same mandatory minimum sentence.               This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       In his untimely rehearing petition, the defendant for the\nfirst time asserted a claim that the method by which the government\nhad proven the facts associated with the juvenile adjudication was\nimproper.

The defendant disagrees: he argues that\n\nthe law of the case issue is not properly before us because it is\n\nnot listed in the statement of issues on appeal.   See Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 28(a)(5).    This argument is hopeless.    In the absence of a\n\ncross-appeal — and none is needed here — an appellee is not\n\nrequired to file a statement of issues.       See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(b)(2).

At the\n\ntime of the defendant's initial sentencing hearing, the Supreme\n\nCourt had already granted certiorari in Shepard v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004), which involved a challenge to the method of\n\nproving ACCA predicate convictions.       Shepard by then had been\n\nbriefed or argued, and the contours of the issue were clearly\n\ndelineated.   Yet when the government sought to prove the nature of\n\nthe juvenile adjudication at issue here through a police report,\n\nthe defendant made no contemporaneous objection.\n\n           Shortly thereafter — and well before the defendant's\n\ndirect appeal was briefed or argued — the Supreme Court decided\n\nShepard.   See Shepard v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).    This\n\ndecision clarified the method through which a predicate conviction\n\ncould be proved under the ACCA and forbade the use of a police\n\nreport for that purpose.   See id. at 21, 26.   This decision should\n\nnot have come as a surprise.          Beforehand (and prior   to the\n\ndefendant's sentencing) several courts had expressed doubt about\n\nthe use of police reports to prove predicate convictions, signaling\n\nthat such a tactic would offend Apprendi principles (and, thus,\n\n\n                                -7-\n\foffend the Constitution).

The law of the\n\ncase doctrine is not a \"straitjacket for a court.\"                        Morgan v.\n\nBurke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556397\"><a href=\"/opinion/556397/tallulah-morgan-v-daniel-r-burke-boston-teachers-union-local-66/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (1st Cir. 1991).             There is a modest amount\n\nof play in the joints.         See Arizona, 460 U.S. at 618.                Withal,\n\nthese law of the case principles should not \"be lightly shrugged\n\naside,\" Rivera-Martínez, 931 F.2d at 151, and in the absence of\n\nexceptional    circumstances,      a   court     should    apply    the    doctrine\n\naccording to its tenor.        Connell, 6 F.3d at 31.\n\n             Such exceptional circumstances are rare and narrowly\n\ncircumscribed.    A party may avoid the application of the law of the\n\ncase doctrine only by showing that, in the relevant time frame,\n\n\"controlling legal authority has changed dramatically\"; or by\n\nshowing that \"significant new evidence, not earlier obtainable in\n\nthe exercise of due diligence,\" has come to light; or by showing\n\nthat   the    earlier   decision       is    blatantly     erroneous       and,     if\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\funcorrected, will work a miscarriage of justice.

This case does not qualify for\n\nthe exception.\n\n              We can summarily dismiss the last two categories. On the\n\nfacts   here,       there     is       no    practical        reason    to   doubt    that    the\n\ndefendant         used    a   knife         when   he    committed       the    offense      that\n\nunderpinned the juvenile adjudication.                          Similarly, the defendant\n\ndoes not argue that there is any new, previously unavailable\n\nevidence that would benefit his position.\n\n              This       leaves        the    first     category,       which    requires      an\n\nintervening change in controlling legal authority.                              The defendant\n\nrelies on the Shepard decision to show such a change.                                        This\n\nreliance is misplaced.\n\n              To begin, we doubt that Shepard can be said to constitute\n\nan intervening change in the law.                        After all, the circuits were\n\nsplit   on    the        point    at    the    time      of    the     defendant's    original\n\nsentencing, and the legal theory undergirding a claim of Shepard\n\nerror was readily available to him.                       Moreover, the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Shepard before the defendant's appeal in Matthews I was\n\nbriefed      or    argued        and    before     his    sentence        became     final    and\n\nunappealable. The fact that Shepard was newly decided in that time\n\nframe, without more, does not trigger the exception.                               See Kashner\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\fDavidson Sec. Corp. v.

The exceptions to the law of the case doctrine must be\n\napplied with special caution on collateral review.        See United\n\nStates v. Addonizio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110094\"><a href=\"/opinion/110094/united-states-v-addonizio/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (1979) (explaining that it\n\nhas \"long been settled law that an error that may justify reversal\n\non direct appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack\n\non a final judgment\"); Ellis, 313 F.3d at 647 (noting that concerns\n\nunderlying the law of the case doctrine \"are heightened in the\n\nfederal habeas context\").     Allowing the defendant to raise a new\n\nargument in a habeas petition when he could (and should) have\n\nraised it either at his original sentencing or on direct review or\n\nboth would undermine the prudential goals of the law of the case\n\ndoctrine.   See Peoples v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789830\"><a href=\"/opinion/789830/robin-l-peoples-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846-47 (7th\n\nCir. 2005); United States v.

Although the defendant makes\n\nadditional arguments — that the failure to prove the juvenile\n\nadjudication to a jury offended Apprendi principles, see Shepard,\n\n544 U.S. at 26-27 (Thomas, J., concurring), and that juvenile\n\nadjudications should never count as ACCA predicate convictions, see\n\nWelch v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145466\"><a href=\"/opinion/145466/welch-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432 (7th Cir. 2010) (Posner,\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fJ., dissenting) — he concedes that these plaints are foreclosed by\n\ncircuit precedent.      See, e.g., Ellis, 619 F.3d at 74; Matthews I,\n\n498 F.3d at 33, 35.      The short of it is that the defendant had a\n\nfull and fair opportunity to raise his claim of Shepard error both\n\nat his original sentencing and on direct review.           He did not do so.\n\nConsequently, he should not have been allowed to raise a belated\n\nShepard claim on collateral review.\n\n           This holding confronts us with a procedural anomaly. The\n\ndistrict court erred both in entertaining the defaulted claim of\n\nShepard error and in vacating the original sentence on that ground.\n\nYet, after conducting a new sentencing hearing, the court imposed\n\na sentence identical to the vacated sentence.           Given this outcome,\n\nit would be senseless to force the district court and the parties\n\nround and round the mulberry bush for no other reason than an\n\ninsistence on ceremonial punctiliousness.
