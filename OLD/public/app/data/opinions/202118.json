USGen New England, Inc., now\n\nDominion Energy Brayton Point, LLC (Dominion), filed suit against\n\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, its administrator, and\n\nits regional office (collectively, the EPA), alleging that the EPA\n\nfailed to perform a non-discretionary duty when it refused to grant\n\nDominion's request for a formal evidentiary hearing after issuing\n\na proposed final National Pollution Discharge Elimination System\n\n(NPDES) permit.   The district court dismissed the case for want of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.         On appeal, the central question\n\npresented concerns the effect of this court's decision in Seacoast\n\nAnti-Pollution League v. Costle, 572 F.2d 872 (1st Cir. 1978), in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Chevron U.S.A.\n\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837\n\n(1984).   Concluding, as we do, that Seacoast does not control, we\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Dominion   owns    an   electrical    generating   facility   in\n\nSomerset, Massachusetts (the station).          The station opened in the\n\n1960s and, like most power plants of its era, utilizes an \"open-\n\ncycle\" cooling system.       Specifically, the station withdraws water\n\nfrom the Lees and Taunton Rivers, circulates that water through the\n\nplant's generating equipment as a coolant, and then discharges the\n\nwater (which, by then, has attained an elevated temperature) into\n\nMount Hope Bay.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           The withdrawals and discharges of water are regulated by\n\nthe Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387.           For the last\n\nthree decades, these actions have been authorized by a series of\n\nNPDES permits issued by the EPA pursuant to section 402(a) of the\n\nCWA.   See id. § 1342(a).       The standards incorporated into those\n\npermits are determined under the thermal variance procedures laid\n\nout in section 316(a).    See id. § 1326(a).\n\n           In 1998, the station applied for renewal of its NPDES\n\npermit and thermal variance authorization.           The EPA issued a\n\nproposed final permit on October 6, 2003, in which it rejected the\n\nrequested thermal variance.      On November 4, Dominion sought review\n\nbefore the Environmental Appeals Board (the Board), see 40 C.F.R.\n\n§   124.19(a)    (authorizing    Board   review),   and    asked   for   an\n\nevidentiary hearing.     The Board accepted the petition for review\n\nbut declined to convene an evidentiary hearing.           See In re USGen\n\nNew Eng., Inc. Brayton Point Station, 11 E.A.D. 525, 525 (EAB July\n\n23, 2004).\n\n           On August 11, 2004, Dominion notified the EPA of its\n\nintent to file a citizen's suit under section 505(a)(2) of the CWA,\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1365(a)(2), to compel the Board to hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing.     Receiving no reply, Dominion proceeded to file its\n\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.    The EPA moved to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f           The district court granted the motion on jurisdictional\n\ngrounds.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).       In a bench decision, it\n\nconcluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction because\n\nthe suit, though billed as a citizen's suit, constituted a direct\n\nchallenge to the EPA's hearing rule and, thus, came within the\n\nexclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court under 33 U.S.C. §\n\n1369(b)(1)(E).     This timely appeal followed.1\n\nII.   THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\n\n           We set the stage for our substantive discussion by\n\nundertaking a brief review of the legal rules that frame the\n\ncontroversy at hand.\n\n           Before    the   EPA   either   issues   an   NPDES   permit   or\n\nauthorizes a thermal variance,2 it must offer an \"opportunity for\n\npublic hearing.\"    33 U.S.C. §§ 1326(a), 1342(a).       No definition of\n\n\"public hearing\" is contained within the four corners of the CWA.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      During the pendency of this appeal, the Board issued its\nmerits decision. For the most part, the Board found no clear error\nin the permit proceedings.     It did, however, order a limited\nremand. See In re Dominion Energy Brayton Point, L.L.C. Brayton\nPoint Station, NPDES 03-12, slip op. at 5-7 (EAB Feb. 1, 2006).\nThat decision has no bearing on the issues before us.\n      2\n      Although it is unclear whether Dominion requested an\nevidentiary hearing under section 402(a) or section 316(a) of the\nCWA, that distinction has no bearing on our analysis.           See\nSeacoast, 572 F.2d at 875 n.3. The fact that Dominion is seeking\na permit renewal rather than a new permit is equally irrelevant; in\neither event, the application procedure is the same. See 40 C.F.R.\n§§ 122.21(d), 124.3.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f              The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et\n\nseq., is also part of the relevant legal landscape. Most pertinent\n\nhere are those sections that combine to describe the procedures for\n\nformal administrative adjudications.                   See id. §§ 554, 556, 557.\n\nThese procedures apply \"in every case of adjudication required by\n\nstatute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an\n\nagency hearing.\"          Id. § 554(a).       The APA does not directly address\n\nwhether these procedures apply when a statute simply calls for an\n\n\"opportunity for public hearing\" without any specific indication\n\nthat the hearing should be \"on the record.\"\n\n              In Seacoast, this court interpreted \"public hearing\" (as\n\nused in sections 402(a) and 316(a) of the CWA) to mean \"evidentiary\n\nhearing\" — in other words, a hearing that comports with the APA's\n\nrequirements        for    a   formal       adjudication.        572     F.2d       at    878.\n\nExamining     the    legislative        history      of   the    APA,    we     adopted      a\n\npresumption        that    \"unless      a    statute      otherwise      specifies,        an\n\nadjudicatory       hearing     subject       to    judicial     review       must    be   [an\n\nevidentiary hearing] on the record.\"                   Id. at 877.       Applying that\n\npresumption to the CWA, we concluded that \"the statute certainly\n\ndoes not indicate that the determination need not be on the\n\nrecord.\"      Id. at 878 (emphasis in original).\n\n              So viewed, Seacoast established a rebuttable presumption\n\nthat, in the context of an adjudication, an organic statute that\n\ncalls   for    a    \"public     hearing\"       should     be    read    to    require      an\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fevidentiary hearing in compliance with the formal adjudication\n\nprovisions of the APA.      Two other circuit courts reached the same\n\nconclusion, albeit through different reasoning.          See Marathon Oil\n\nCo. v. EPA, 564 F.2d 1253, 1264 (9th Cir. 1977); U.S. Steel Corp.\n\nv. Train, 556 F.2d 822, 833-34 (7th Cir. 1977).            Acquiescing in\n\nthis    construction,      the   EPA     promulgated   regulations      that\n\nmemorialized the use of formal evidentiary hearings in the NPDES\n\npermit process.    See NPDES; Revision of Regulations, 44 Fed. Reg.\n\n32,854, 32,938 (June 7, 1979).\n\n            In 1984, a sea change occurred in administrative law and,\n\nspecifically, in the interpretation of organic statutes such as the\n\nCWA.    The Supreme Court held that \"[w]hen a court reviews an\n\nagency's construction of the statute which it administers,\" the\n\nreviewing court first must ask \"whether Congress has directly\n\nspoken to the precise question at issue.\"          Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n\n842.   If Congress's intent is clear, that intent governs — both the\n\ncourt and the agency must give it full effect.         Id. at 842-43.    If,\n\nhowever, Congress has not directly addressed the question and the\n\nagency has stepped into the vacuum by promulgating an interpretive\n\nregulation, a reviewing court may \"not simply impose its own\n\nconstruction on the statute,\" but, rather, ought to ask \"whether\n\nthe agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the\n\nstatute.\"    Id. at 843.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            This paradigm, sometimes called the Chevron two-step,\n\nincreases     the    sphere     of    influence     of   agency        action.      If\n\ncongressional intent is unclear and an agency's interpretation of\n\na statute that it administers is reasonable, an inquiring court\n\nmust defer to that interpretation.              See id. at 843-44.        That is so\n\neven if the agency's interpretation is not the one that the court\n\nconsiders to be the best available interpretation. See id. at 843.\n\n            Armed     with    the    Chevron    decision    and    a    presidential\n\ndirective    to     streamline       regulatory    programs,      see    Remarks     on\n\nRegulatory Reform, 31 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 278 (Feb. 21, 1995),\n\nthe   EPA   advanced    a    proposal     to    eliminate   formal       evidentiary\n\nhearings from the NPDES permitting process.                  See Amendments to\n\nStreamline the NPDES Program Regulations: Round Two, 61 Fed. Reg.\n\n65,268, 65,276 (Dec. 11, 1996).                In due course, the EPA adopted\n\nthat proposal as a final rule.             See Amendments to Streamline the\n\nNPDES Program Regulations: Round Two, 65 Fed. Reg. 30,886, 30,900\n\n(May 15, 2000).\n\n            This revision depended heavily on a Chevron analysis.\n\nThe agency began by \"finding no evidence that Congress intended to\n\nrequire formal evidentiary hearings or that the text [of section\n\n402(a)]     precludes        informal    adjudication       of     permit        review\n\npetitions.\"         Id. at 30,896.        Then, it weighed the risks and\n\nbenefits of employing informal hearing procedures for NPDES permit\n\nreview, \"determining that these procedures would not violate the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fDue Process Clause.\"        Id.       Finally, it \"concluded that informal\n\nhearing procedures satisfy the hearing requirement of section\n\n402(a).\"     Id.\n\n             It was under this new regulatory scheme that the EPA\n\nconsidered Dominion's request to renew its NPDES permit and to\n\nauthorize a thermal variance.           Thus, it was under this scheme that\n\nthe EPA denied Dominion's request for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n             The court of appeals reviews a dismissal for want of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction de novo.              Gabriel v. Preble, 396 F.3d\n\n10, 12 (1st Cir. 2005).         In doing so, the court accepts the well-\n\npleaded     factual   allegations      of   the   plaintiff's     complaint    and\n\nindulges     all   reasonable     inferences      in   the   plaintiff's    favor.\n\nMuniz-Rivera v. United States, 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).                The\n\nappellate court is not wedded to the lower court's reasoning, but\n\nmay affirm the order of dismissal on any ground fairly presented by\n\nthe record.        See InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n             Here, Dominion's claim on appeal rests on the premise\n\nthat   it   has    satisfied    the    jurisdictional        requirements   for   a\n\ncitizen's suit under section 505(a)(2) of the CWA.                  Subject to a\n\nnotice requirement — suit may not be commenced \"prior to sixty days\n\nafter the plaintiff has given notice of such [proposed] action,\" 33\n\nU.S.C. § 1365(b)(2) — the statute invoked by Dominion grants\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\ffederal    district   courts   jurisdiction   over   any   citizen's   suit\n\nbrought \"against the Administrator [of the EPA] where there is\n\nalleged a failure of the Administrator to perform any act or duty\n\nunder [the CWA] which is not discretionary,\" id. § 1365(a)(2).\n\nThere is no question but that Dominion satisfied the applicable\n\nnotice requirement.     The crux of the case, therefore, is whether\n\nDominion has pleaded the flouting of a non-discretionary duty.\n\n            One thing is crystal clear: on their face, the current\n\nEPA regulations do not establish a non-discretionary duty to\n\nprovide the evidentiary hearing that Dominion seeks.         Prior to the\n\ndate of Dominion's request, the EPA vitiated the preexisting rule\n\nintroducing evidentiary hearings into the NPDES permitting process.\n\nSee 40 C.F.R. § 124.21(b) (explaining that the \"EPA eliminated the\n\nprevious requirement for NPDES permits to undergo an evidentiary\n\nhearing after permit issuance . . . on June 14, 2000\").          Dominion\n\nconcedes this fact, but nonetheless relies on Seacoast as the\n\nsource of a non-discretionary duty to convene an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n            This reliance is misplaced. Even if Seacoast established\n\na non-discretionary duty for section 505(a)(2) purposes when it was\n\ndecided — a matter upon which we need not opine — Dominion's\n\nposition ignores two important post-Seacoast changes in the legal\n\nlandscape: the Supreme Court's decision in Chevron and the agency's\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fsubsequent promulgation of the current \"no evidentiary hearing\"\n\nrule.\n\n              We   anticipated       this    situation       in   Citizens    Awareness\n\nNetwork, Inc. v. United States, 391 F.3d 338 (1st Cir. 2004), in\n\nwhich we noted that \"while the type of hearing required by a\n\nstatute      turns    on    congressional          intent,    Chevron    adds   a   new\n\ndimension, requiring that the agency's reasonable interpretation be\n\naccorded deference if there is any ambiguity as to that intent.\"\n\nId.     at   348     n.4.      We    also      recognized         Chevron's   possible\n\nramifications for Seacoast, but did not have the occasion to\n\nconfront the issue squarely. See id. (reserving the question \"[t]o\n\nwhat extent (if at all) [Chevron] erodes Seacoast's rationale\").\n\nNow, with guidance from the Supreme Court's last term lighting our\n\npath, we address the matter and conclude that, as to the CWA's\n\npublic hearing language, the Chevron doctrine trumps the potential\n\napplication of stare decisis principles.\n\n              For present purposes, the critical precedent is National\n\nCable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services, 125\n\nS. Ct. 2688 (2005).          There, the Court examined the relationship\n\nbetween the stare decisis effect of an appellate court's statutory\n\ninterpretation and the Chevron deference due to an administrative\n\nagency's      subsequent,      but    contrary,        interpretation.          Echoing\n\nChevron, the Court reiterated that \"[f]illing [statutory] gaps . .\n\n. involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\fequipped to make than courts.\"            Id. at 2699.      Then, concluding that\n\nChevron's     application     should      not   turn   on   the     order    in    which\n\njudicial    and    agency    interpretations       issue,     the    Justices          held\n\nsquarely that \"[a] court's prior judicial construction of a statute\n\ntrumps   an    agency     construction      otherwise       entitled    to    Chevron\n\ndeference     only   if     the   prior    court   decision       holds     that        its\n\nconstruction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and\n\nthus leaves no room for agency discretion.\"                   Id. at 2700.             This\n\napproach \"hold[s] judicial interpretations contained in precedents\n\nto the same demanding Chevron . . . standard that applies if the\n\ncourt is reviewing the agency's construction on a blank slate.\"\n\nId.\n\n              Brand X demands that we reexamine pre-Chevron precedents\n\nthrough a Chevron lens.           The Chevron two-step applies.                   At the\n\nfirst step, a court \"must look primarily to the plain meaning of\n\nthe statute, drawing its essence from the particular statutory\n\nlanguage at issue, as well as the language and design of the\n\nstatute as a whole.\"          Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human\n\nServs., 48 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1995) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). At this step, the court may \"examine the\n\nlegislative       history,    albeit      skeptically,       in     search        of     an\n\nunmistakable expression of congressional intent.\"                    Id. at 17.         If\n\nthe precedent at issue finds clarity at step one — that is, if the\n\nholding of the case rests on a perception of clear and unambiguous\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fcongressional intent — that precedent will govern.                     See Brand X,\n\n125 S. Ct. at 2700.       If, however, the precedent operates at Chevron\n\nstep   two    —   that    is,    if    the    case   holds,       in   effect,    that\n\ncongressional intent is less than pellucid and proceeds to choose\n\na \"best reading\" rather than \"the only permissible reading,\" id. at\n\n2701 (emphasis in original) — its stare decisis effect will,\n\nthrough Chevron deference, yield to a contrary but plausible agency\n\ninterpretation, see id. at 2700.\n\n             Once this mode of analysis is understood and applied,\n\nDominion's argument collapses.              Seacoast simply does not hold that\n\nCongress clearly intended the term \"public hearing\" in sections\n\n402(a) and 316(a) of the CWA to mean \"evidentiary hearing.\"                      To the\n\ncontrary, the Seacoast court based its interpretation of the CWA on\n\na presumption derived from the legislative history of the APA — a\n\npresumption that would hold sway only in the absence of a showing\n\nof a contrary congressional intent.               Seacoast, 572 F.2d at 877-78.\n\nIn other words, the court resorted to the presumption only because\n\nit could find no sign of a plainly discernible congressional\n\nintent.      Id. at 878.        A statutory interpretation constructed on\n\nsuch   a   negative      finding      is   antithetic   to    a    conclusion     that\n\nCongress's intent was clear and unambiguous.\n\n             The short of it is that the Seacoast court, faced with an\n\nopaque statute, settled upon what it sensibly thought was the best\n\nconstruction of the CWA's \"public hearing\" language.                         Such a\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\fholding is appropriate at step two of the Chevron pavane, not at\n\nstep one.    Consequently, under Brand X, Seacoast must yield to a\n\nreasonable agency interpretation of the CWA's \"public hearing\"\n\nrequirement.    See Brand X, 125 S. Ct. at 2700.\n\n            The only piece left to this puzzle is to confirm that the\n\nEPA's new regulations are, in fact, entitled to Chevron deference.\n\nThis inquiry is a straightforward one.     As our earlier discussion\n\nsuggests (and as the Seacoast court correctly deduced), Congress\n\nhas not spoken directly to the precise question at issue here.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co., 410 U.S. 224,\n\n239 (1973) (\"The term 'hearing' in its legal context undoubtedly\n\nhas a host of meanings.\"); Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 873\n\nF.2d 1477, 1480-82 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (concluding that Congress's\n\nintent behind the words \"public hearing\" in section 3008 of the\n\nRCRA was ambiguous for Chevron purposes).      Accordingly, we must\n\ndefer to the EPA's interpretation of the CWA as long as that\n\ninterpretation is reasonable.    See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44.\n\n            In this instance, the administrative interpretation took\n\ninto account the relevant universe of factors.     See 65 Fed. Reg. at\n\n30,898-30,900 (considering \"(1) [t]he private interests at stake,\n\n(2) the risk of erroneous decision-making, and (3) the nature of\n\nthe government interest,\" and concluding that its new regulation\n\nwas a reasonable interpretation of the CWA); see also Chem. Waste\n\nMgmt., 873 F.2d at 1483 (concluding that the EPA's choice of\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\finformal adjudicatory procedures under RCRA was reasonable).                          The\n\nagency's conclusion that evidentiary hearings are unnecessary and\n\nthat    Congress,      in   using     the    phrase    \"opportunity         for    public\n\nhearing,\" did not mean to mandate evidentiary hearings seems\n\nreasonable — and Dominion, to its credit, has conceded the point.\n\n               Dominion     makes     two    final    attempts        to    resuscitate\n\nSeacoast.      First, it asseverates that a refusal to follow Seacoast\n\noffends the \"law of the circuit\" rule.                That rule (a branch of the\n\nstare    decisis       doctrine)       holds       that,   \"[o]rdinarily,           newly\n\nconstituted      panels      in   a   multi-panel      circuit    should       consider\n\nthemselves bound by prior panel decisions\" closely on point.\n\nEulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nHowever, the \"law of the circuit\" rule, like most rules of general\n\napplication, is subject to exceptions.                One such exception \"comes\n\ninto    play    when   a    preexisting      panel    opinion    is    undermined      by\n\nsubsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of\n\nthe Supreme Court.\"          Id.      In this instance, the Supreme Court's\n\ndecisions in Chevron and Brand X counsel against a mechanical\n\napplication of Seacoast.\n\n               Second, Dominion exhorts us to find that Seacoast's\n\nholding is actually an interpretation of the APA, not the CWA (and,\n\ntherefore, the EPA's regulation is also an interpretation of the\n\nAPA,    not    entitled     to    Chevron    deference).        See,       e.g.,   Metro.\n\nStevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U.S. 121, 137 n.9 (1997) (noting that\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fChevron     deference        is   inappropriate      vis-à-vis       an     agency\n\ninterpretation of the APA's burden-of-proof provision).                    Such a\n\nreading of Seacoast is plainly incorrect. While the Seacoast court\n\nrelied on a presumption borrowed from the APA, the court's holding\n\nis an interpretation of the CWA and, specifically, of the term\n\n\"public hearing\" contained in sections 402(a) and 316(a).                      The\n\nEPA's regulations are also derived from the CWA.               See 40 C.F.R. §\n\n122.1(a) (explaining that 40 C.F.R. § 124 implements sections of\n\nthe CWA). Because those changes implicate the statute that the EPA\n\nadministers (i.e., the CWA), Chevron deference is appropriate. See\n\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We summarize succinctly. Although we in no way disparage\n\nthe soundness of Seacoast's reasoning, the Chevron and Brand X\n\nopinions and the interposition of a new and reasonable agency\n\ninterpretation of the disputed statutory language have changed the\n\npicture.     Because we, like the Seacoast court, cannot discern a\n\nclear and unambiguous congressional intent behind the words \"public\n\nhearing\" in the CWA and because the EPA's interpretation of that\n\nterm    constitutes     a    reasonable    construction    of    the      statute,\n\ndeference is due.     It follows inexorably that no non-discretionary\n\nduty   to   grant   Dominion      an   evidentiary   hearing    on   its    permit\n\napplication exists.         Consequently, the jurisdictional requirements\n\nof section 505(a)(2) have not been satisfied.\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f              We need go no further.3         For the reasons elucidated\n\nabove,   we    conclude   that   the    district   court   did   not   err   in\n\ndismissing Dominion's action.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Given this outcome, we need not address whether this suit is\nproperly characterized as a direct challenge to the EPA's rule\n(and, thus, barred by 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1)(E)).\n\n                                       -16-\n\f",

The district court dismissed the case for want of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the central question presented concerns the effect of this court's decision in <i>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League v. Costle,</i> 572 F.2d 872 (1st Cir.1978), in light of the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Concluding, as we do, that <i>Seacoast</i> does not control, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dominion owns an electrical generating facility in Somerset, Massachusetts (the station). The station opened in the 1960s and, like most power plants of its era, utilizes an \"open-cycle\" cooling system. Specifically, the station withdraws water from the Lees and Taunton Rivers, circulates that water through the plant's generating equipment as a coolant, and then discharges the water (which, by then, has attained an elevated temperature) into Mount Hope Bay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The withdrawals and discharges of water are regulated by the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1251-1387. For the last three decades, these actions have been authorized by a series of NPDES permits issued by the EPA pursuant to section 402(a) of the CWA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1342(a). The standards incorporated into those permits are determined under the thermal variance procedures laid out in section 316(a). <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1326(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the station applied for renewal of its NPDES permit and thermal variance authorization. The EPA issued a proposed final permit on October 6, 2003, in which it rejected the requested thermal variance. On November 4, Dominion sought review before the Environmental Appeals Board (the Board), <i>see</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 124.19(a) (authorizing Board review), and asked for an evidentiary hearing. The Board accepted the petition for review but declined to convene an evidentiary hearing. <i>See In re USGen New Eng., Inc. Brayton Point Station,</i> 11 E.A.D. 525, 525 (EAB July 23, 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 2004, Dominion notified the EPA of its intent to file a citizen's suit under section 505(a)(2) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1365(a)(2), to compel the Board to hold an evidentiary hearing. Receiving no reply, Dominion proceeded to file its complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The EPA moved to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion on jurisdictional grounds. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). In a bench decision, it concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction because the suit, though billed as a citizen's suit, constituted a direct challenge to the EPA's hearing rule and, thus, came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(E). This timely appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the stage for our substantive discussion by undertaking a brief review of the legal rules that frame the controversy at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the EPA either issues an NPDES permit or authorizes a thermal variance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> it must offer an \"opportunity for public hearing.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(a), 1342(a). No definition of \"public hearing\" is contained within the four corners of the CWA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551 <i>et seq.,</i> is also part of the relevant legal landscape. Most pertinent here are those sections that combine to describe the procedures for formal administrative adjudications. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 554, 556, 557. These procedures apply \"in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 554(a). The APA does not directly address whether these procedures apply when a statute simply calls for an \"opportunity for public hearing\" without any specific indication that the hearing should be \"on the record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Seacoast,</i> this court interpreted \"public hearing\" (as used in sections 402(a) and 316(a) of the CWA) to mean \"evidentiary hearing\"&#8212;in other words, a hearing that comports with the APA's requirements for a formal adjudication. 572 F.2d at 878. Examining the legislative history of the APA, we adopted a presumption that \"unless a statute otherwise specifies, an adjudicatory hearing subject to judicial review must be [an evidentiary hearing] on the record.\" <i>Id.</i> at 877. Applying that presumption to the CWA, we concluded that \"the statute certainly does not indicate that the determination need <i>not</i> be on the record.\" <i>Id.</i> at 878 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, <i>Seacoast</i> established a rebuttable presumption that, in the context of an adjudication, an organic statute that calls for a \"public hearing\" should be read to require an evidentiary hearing in compliance with the formal adjudication provisions of the APA. Two other circuit courts reached the same conclusion, albeit through different reasoning. <i>See Marathon Oil Co. v. EPA,</i> 564 F.2d 1253, 1264 (9th Cir.1977); <i>U.S. Steel Corp. v. Train,</i> 556 F.2d 822, 833-34 (7th Cir.1977). Acquiescing in this construction, the EPA promulgated regulations that memorialized the use of formal evidentiary hearings in the NPDES permit process. <i>See</i> NPDES; Revision of Regulations, 44 Fed.Reg. 32,854, 32,938 (June 7, 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, a sea change occurred in administrative law and, specifically, in the interpretation of organic statutes such as the CWA. The Supreme Court held that \"[w]hen a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute which it administers,\" the reviewing court first must ask \"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If Congress's intent is clear, that intent governs&#8212;both the court and the agency must give it full effect. <i>Id.</i> at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If, however, Congress has not directly addressed the question and the agency has stepped into the vacuum by promulgating an interpretive regulation, a reviewing court may \"not simply impose its own construction on the statute,\" but, rather, ought to ask \"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This paradigm, sometimes called the <i>Chevron</i> two-step, increases the sphere of influence of agency action. If congressional intent is unclear and an agency's interpretation of a statute that it administers is reasonable, an inquiring court must defer to that interpretation. <i>See id.</i> at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778. That is so even if the agency's interpretation is not the one that the court considers to be the best available interpretation. <i>See id.</i> at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Armed with the <i>Chevron</i> decision and a presidential directive to streamline regulatory programs, <i>see</i> Remarks on Regulatory Reform, 31 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 278 (Feb. 21, 1995), the EPA advanced a proposal to eliminate formal evidentiary hearings from the NPDES permitting process. <i>See</i> Amendments to Streamline the NPDES Program Regulations: Round Two, 61 Fed.Reg. 65,268, 65,276 (Dec. 11, 1996). In due course, the EPA adopted that proposal as a final rule. <i>See</i> Amendments to Streamline the NPDES Program Regulations: Round Two, 65 Fed.Reg. 30,886, 30,900 (May 15, 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This revision depended heavily on a <i>Chevron</i> analysis. The agency began by \"finding no evidence that Congress intended to require formal evidentiary hearings or that the text [of section 402(a)] precludes informal adjudication of permit review petitions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 30,896. Then, it weighed the risks and benefits of employing informal hearing procedures for NPDES permit review, \"determining that these procedures would not violate the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, it \"concluded that informal hearing procedures satisfy the hearing requirement of section 402(a).\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was under this new regulatory scheme that the EPA considered Dominion's request to renew its NPDES permit and to authorize a thermal variance. Thus, it was under this scheme that the EPA denied Dominion's request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals reviews a dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <i>Gabriel v. Preble,</i> 396 F.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir.2005). In doing so, the court accepts the well-pleaded factual allegations of the plaintiff's complaint and indulges all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. <i>Muniz-Rivera v. United States,</i> 326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2003). The appellate court is not wedded to the lower court's reasoning, but may affirm the order of dismissal on any ground fairly presented by the record. <i>See InterGen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Dominion's claim on appeal rests on the premise that it has satisfied the jurisdictional requirements for a citizen's suit under section 505(a)(2) of the CWA. Subject to a notice requirement&#8212;suit may not be commenced \"prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of such [proposed] action,\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1365(b)(2)&#8212;the statute invoked by Dominion grants federal district courts jurisdiction over any citizen's suit brought \"against the Administrator [of the EPA] where there is alleged a failure of the Administrator to perform any act or duty under [the CWA] which is not discretionary,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1365(a)(2). There is no question but that Dominion satisfied the applicable notice requirement. The crux of the case, therefore, is whether Dominion has pleaded the flouting of a non-discretionary duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One thing is crystal clear: on their face, the current EPA regulations do not establish a non-discretionary duty to provide the evidentiary hearing that Dominion seeks. Prior to the date of Dominion's request, the EPA vitiated the preexisting rule introducing evidentiary hearings into the NPDES permitting process. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 124.21(b) (explaining that the \"EPA eliminated the previous requirement for NPDES permits to undergo an evidentiary hearing after permit issuance ... on June 14, 2000\"). Dominion concedes this fact, but nonetheless relies on <i>Seacoast</i> as the source of a non-discretionary duty to convene an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reliance is misplaced. Even if <i>Seacoast</i> established a non-discretionary duty for section 505(a)(2) purposes when it was decided&#8212;a matter upon which we need not opine&#8212;Dominion's position ignores two important post-<i>Seacoast</i> changes in the legal landscape: the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Chevron</i> and the agency's subsequent promulgation of the current \"no evidentiary hearing\" rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We anticipated this situation in <i>Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United States,</i> 391 F.3d 338 (1st Cir.2004), in which we noted that \"while the type of hearing required by a statute turns on congressional intent, <i>Chevron</i> adds a new dimension, requiring that the agency's reasonable interpretation be accorded deference if there is any ambiguity as to that intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 348 n. 4. We also recognized <i>Chevron's</i> possible ramifications for <i>Seacoast,</i> but did not have the occasion to confront the issue squarely. <i>See id.</i> (reserving the question \"[t]o what extent (if at all) [<i>Chevron</i>] erodes <i>Seacoast's</i> rationale\"). Now, with guidance from the Supreme Court's last term lighting our path, we address the matter and conclude that, as to the CWA's public hearing language, the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine trumps the potential application of stare decisis principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, the critical precedent is <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005). There, the Court examined the relationship between the stare decisis effect of an appellate court's statutory interpretation and the <i>Chevron</i> deference due to an administrative agency's subsequent, but contrary, interpretation. Echoing <i>Chevron,</i> the Court reiterated that \"[f]illing [statutory] gaps ... involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2699. Then, concluding that <i>Chevron's</i> application should not turn on the order in which judicial and agency interpretations issue, the Justices held squarely that \"[a] court's prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2700. This approach \"hold[s] judicial interpretations contained in precedents to the same demanding <i>Chevron</i> ... standard that applies if the court is reviewing the agency's construction on a blank slate.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Brand X</i> demands that we reexamine pre-<i>Chevron</i> precedents through a <i>Chevron</i> lens. The <i>Chevron</i> two-step applies. At the first step, a court \"must look primarily to the plain meaning of the statute, drawing its essence from the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\" <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> 48 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). At this step, the court may \"examine the legislative history, albeit skeptically, in search of an unmistakable expression of congressional intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. If the precedent at issue finds clarity at step one&#8212;that is, if the holding of the case rests on a perception of clear and unambiguous congressional intent&#8212;that precedent will govern. <i>See Brand X,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2700. If, however, the precedent operates at <i>Chevron</i> step two&#8212;that is, if the case holds, in effect, that congressional intent is less than pellucid and proceeds to choose a \"<i>best</i> reading\" rather than \"the <i>only permissible</i> reading,\" <i>id.</i> at 2701 (emphasis in original)&#8212;its stare decisis effect will, through <i>Chevron</i> deference, yield to a contrary but plausible agency interpretation, <i>see id.</i> at 2700.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once this mode of analysis is understood and applied, Dominion's argument collapses. <i>Seacoast</i> simply does not hold that Congress clearly intended the term \"public hearing\" in sections 402(a) and 316(a) of the CWA to mean \"evidentiary hearing.\" To the contrary, the <i>Seacoast</i> court based its interpretation of the CWA on a presumption derived from the legislative history of the APA&#8212;a presumption that would hold sway only in the absence of a showing of a contrary congressional intent. <i>Seacoast,</i> 572 F.2d at 877-78. In other words, the court resorted to the presumption only because it could find no sign of a plainly discernible congressional intent. <i>Id.</i> at 878. A statutory interpretation constructed on such a negative finding is antithetic to a conclusion that Congress's intent was clear and unambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the <i>Seacoast</i> court, faced with an opaque statute, settled upon what it sensibly thought was the best construction of the CWA's \"public hearing\" language. Such a holding is appropriate at step two of the <i>Chevron</i> pavane, not at step one. Consequently, under <i>Brand X, Seacoast</i> must yield to a reasonable agency interpretation of the CWA's \"public hearing\" requirement. <i>See Brand X,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2700.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only piece left to this puzzle is to confirm that the EPA's new regulations are, in fact, entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. This inquiry is a straightforward one. As our earlier discussion suggests (and as the <i>Seacoast</i> court correctly deduced), Congress has not spoken directly to the precise question at issue here. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co.,</i> 410 U.S. 224, 239, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973) (\"The term `hearing' in its legal context undoubtedly has a host of meanings.\"); <i>Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. U.S. EPA,</i> 873 F.2d 1477, 1480-82 (D.C.Cir. 1989) (concluding that Congress's intent behind the words \"public hearing\" in section 3008 of the RCRA was ambiguous for <i>Chevron</i> purposes). Accordingly, we must defer to the EPA's interpretation of the CWA as long as that interpretation is reasonable. <i>See Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the administrative interpretation took into account the relevant universe of factors. <i>See</i> 65 Fed.Reg. at 30,898-30,900 (considering \"(1) [t]he private interests at stake, (2) the risk of erroneous decision-making, and (3) the nature of the government interest,\" and concluding that its new regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the CWA); <i>see also Chem. Waste Mgmt.,</i> 873 F.2d at 1483 (concluding that the EPA's choice of informal adjudicatory procedures under RCRA was reasonable). The agency's conclusion that evidentiary hearings are unnecessary and that Congress, in using the phrase \"opportunity for public hearing,\" did not mean to mandate evidentiary hearings seems reasonable&#8212;and Dominion, to its credit, has conceded the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dominion makes two final attempts to resuscitate <i>Seacoast.</i> First, it asseverates that a refusal to follow <i>Seacoast</i> offends the \"law of the circuit\" rule. That rule (a branch of the stare decisis doctrine) holds that, \"[o]rdinarily, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit should consider themselves bound by prior panel decisions\" closely on point. <i>Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir.2004). However, the \"law of the circuit\" rule, like most rules of general application, is subject to exceptions. One such exception \"comes into play when a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court.\" <i>Id.</i> In this instance, the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Chevron</i> and <i>Brand X</i> counsel against a mechanical application of <i>Seacoast.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Dominion exhorts us to find that <i>Seacoast's</i> holding is actually an interpretation of the APA, not the CWA (and, therefore, the EPA's regulation is also an interpretation of the APA, not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference). <i>See, e.g., Metro. Stevedore Co. v. Rambo,</i> 521 U.S. 121, 137 n. 9, 117 S.Ct. 1953, 138 L.Ed.2d 327 (1997) (noting that <i>Chevron</i> deference is inappropriate vis-&#224;-vis an agency interpretation of the APA's burden-of-proof provision). Such a reading of <i>Seacoast</i> is plainly incorrect. While the <i>Seacoast</i> court relied on a presumption borrowed from the APA, the court's holding is an interpretation of the CWA and, specifically, of the term \"public hearing\" contained in sections 402(a) and 316(a). The EPA's regulations are also derived from the CWA. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 122.1(a) (explaining that 40 C.F.R. &#167; 124 implements sections of the CWA). Because those changes implicate the statute that the EPA administers (i.e., the CWA), <i>Chevron</i> deference is appropriate. <i>See Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. Although we in no way disparage the soundness of <i>Seacoast's</i> reasoning, the <i>Chevron</i> and <i>Brand X</i> opinions and the interposition of a new and reasonable agency interpretation of the disputed statutory language have changed the picture. Because we, like the <i>Seacoast</i> court, cannot discern a clear and unambiguous congressional intent behind the words \"public hearing\" in the CWA and because the EPA's interpretation of that term constitutes a reasonable construction of the statute, deference is due. It follows inexorably that no non-discretionary duty to grant Dominion an evidentiary hearing on its permit application exists.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984). Concluding, as we do, that <i>Seacoast</i> does not control, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dominion owns an electrical generating facility in Somerset, Massachusetts (the station). The station opened in the 1960s and, like most power plants of its era, utilizes an \"open-cycle\" cooling system. Specifically, the station withdraws water from the Lees and Taunton Rivers, circulates that water through the plant's generating equipment as a coolant, and then discharges the water (which, by then, has attained an elevated temperature) into Mount Hope Bay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The withdrawals and discharges of water are regulated by the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1251-1387. For the last three decades, these actions have been authorized by a series of NPDES permits issued by the EPA pursuant to section 402(a) of the CWA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1342(a). The standards incorporated into those permits are determined under the thermal variance procedures laid out in section 316(a). <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1326(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the station applied for renewal of its NPDES permit and thermal variance authorization. The EPA issued a proposed final permit on October 6, 2003, in which it rejected the requested thermal variance. On November 4, Dominion sought review before the Environmental Appeals Board (the Board), <i>see</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 124.19(a) (authorizing Board review), and asked for an evidentiary hearing. The Board accepted the petition for review but declined to convene an evidentiary hearing. <i>See In re USGen New Eng., Inc. Brayton Point Station,</i> 11 E.A.D. 525, 525 (EAB July 23, 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 11, 2004, Dominion notified the EPA of its intent to file a citizen's suit under section 505(a)(2) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1365(a)(2), to compel the Board to hold an evidentiary hearing. Receiving no reply, Dominion proceeded to file its complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The EPA moved to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the motion on jurisdictional grounds. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). In a bench decision, it concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction because the suit, though billed as a citizen's suit, constituted a direct challenge to the EPA's hearing rule and, thus, came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1369(b)(1)(E). This timely appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the stage for our substantive discussion by undertaking a brief review of the legal rules that frame the controversy at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the EPA either issues an NPDES permit or authorizes a thermal variance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> it must offer an \"opportunity for public hearing.\" 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(a), 1342(a). No definition of \"public hearing\" is contained within the four corners of the CWA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 551 <i>et seq.,</i> is also part of the relevant legal landscape. Most pertinent here are those sections that combine to describe the procedures for formal administrative adjudications. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 554, 556, 557. These procedures apply \"in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 554(a). The APA does not directly address whether these procedures apply when a statute simply calls for an \"opportunity for public hearing\" without any specific indication that the hearing should be \"on the record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Seacoast,</i> this court interpreted \"public hearing\" (as used in sections 402(a) and 316(a) of the CWA) to mean \"evidentiary hearing\"&#8212;in other words, a hearing that comports with the APA's requirements for a formal adjudication. 572 F.2d at 878. Examining the legislative history of the APA, we adopted a presumption that \"unless a statute otherwise specifies, an adjudicatory hearing subject to judicial review must be [an evidentiary hearing] on the record.\" <i>Id.</i> at 877. Applying that presumption to the CWA, we concluded that \"the statute certainly does not indicate that the determination need <i>not</i> be on the record.\" <i>Id.</i> at 878 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So viewed, <i>Seacoast</i> established a rebuttable presumption that, in the context of an adjudication, an organic statute that calls for a \"public hearing\" should be read to require an evidentiary hearing in compliance with the formal adjudication provisions of the APA. Two other circuit courts reached the same conclusion, albeit through different reasoning. <i>See Marathon Oil Co. v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350208\"><a href=\"/opinion/350208/marathon-oil-company-union-oil-company-of-california-atlantic-richfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1253</span></a></span>, 1264 (9th Cir.1977); <i>U.S. Steel Corp. v.

Acquiescing in this construction, the EPA promulgated regulations that memorialized the use of formal evidentiary hearings in the NPDES permit process. <i>See</i> NPDES; Revision of Regulations, 44 Fed.Reg. 32,854, 32,938 (June 7, 1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, a sea change occurred in administrative law and, specifically, in the interpretation of organic statutes such as the CWA. The Supreme Court held that \"[w]hen a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute which it administers,\" the reviewing court first must ask \"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If Congress's intent is clear, that intent governs&#8212;both the court and the agency must give it full effect. <i>Id.</i> at 842-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span>. If, however, Congress has not directly addressed the question and the agency has stepped into the vacuum by promulgating an interpretive regulation, a reviewing court may \"not simply impose its own construction on the statute,\" but, rather, ought to ask \"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 843, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Pres. Doc. 278 (Feb. 21, 1995), the EPA advanced a proposal to eliminate formal evidentiary hearings from the NPDES permitting process. <i>See</i> Amendments to Streamline the NPDES Program Regulations: Round Two, 61 Fed.Reg. 65,268, 65,276 (Dec. 11, 1996). In due course, the EPA adopted that proposal as a final rule. <i>See</i> Amendments to Streamline the NPDES Program Regulations: Round Two, 65 Fed.Reg. 30,886, 30,900 (May 15, 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This revision depended heavily on a <i>Chevron</i> analysis. The agency began by \"finding no evidence that Congress intended to require formal evidentiary hearings or that the text [of section 402(a)] precludes informal adjudication of permit review petitions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 30,896. Then, it weighed the risks and benefits of employing informal hearing procedures for NPDES permit review, \"determining that these procedures would not violate the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, it \"concluded that informal hearing procedures satisfy the hearing requirement of section 402(a).\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was under this new regulatory scheme that the EPA considered Dominion's request to renew its NPDES permit and to authorize a thermal variance.

Subject to a notice requirement&#8212;suit may not be commenced \"prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of such [proposed] action,\" 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1365(b)(2)&#8212;the statute invoked by Dominion grants federal district courts jurisdiction over any citizen's suit brought \"against the Administrator [of the EPA] where there is alleged a failure of the Administrator to perform any act or duty under [the CWA] which is not discretionary,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 1365(a)(2). There is no question but that Dominion satisfied the applicable notice requirement. The crux of the case, therefore, is whether Dominion has pleaded the flouting of a non-discretionary duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One thing is crystal clear: on their face, the current EPA regulations do not establish a non-discretionary duty to provide the evidentiary hearing that Dominion seeks. Prior to the date of Dominion's request, the EPA vitiated the preexisting rule introducing evidentiary hearings into the NPDES permitting process. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 124.21(b) (explaining that the \"EPA eliminated the previous requirement for NPDES permits to undergo an evidentiary hearing after permit issuance ... on June 14, 2000\"). Dominion concedes this fact, but nonetheless relies on <i>Seacoast</i> as the source of a non-discretionary duty to convene an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reliance is misplaced. Even if <i>Seacoast</i> established a non-discretionary duty for section 505(a)(2) purposes when it was decided&#8212;a matter upon which we need not opine&#8212;Dominion's position ignores two important post-<i>Seacoast</i> changes in the legal landscape: the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Chevron</i> and the agency's subsequent promulgation of the current \"no evidentiary hearing\" rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We anticipated this situation in <i>Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201376\"><a href=\"/opinion/201376/citizens-awareness-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), in which we noted that \"while the type of hearing required by a statute turns on congressional intent, <i>Chevron</i> adds a new dimension, requiring that the agency's reasonable interpretation be accorded deference if there is any ambiguity as to that intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 348 n. 4. We also recognized <i>Chevron's</i> possible ramifications for <i>Seacoast,</i> but did not have the occasion to confront the issue squarely. <i>See id.</i> (reserving the question \"[t]o what extent (if at all) [<i>Chevron</i>] erodes <i>Seacoast's</i> rationale\"). Now, with guidance from the Supreme Court's last term lighting our path, we address the matter and conclude that, as to the CWA's public hearing language, the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine trumps the potential application of stare decisis principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For present purposes, the critical precedent is <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-internet-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span> (2005). There, the Court examined the relationship between the stare decisis effect of an appellate court's statutory interpretation and the <i>Chevron</i> deference due to an administrative agency's subsequent, but contrary, interpretation. Echoing <i>Chevron,</i> the Court reiterated that \"[f]illing [statutory] gaps ... involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2699. Then, concluding that <i>Chevron's</i> application should not turn on the order in which judicial and agency interpretations issue, the Justices held squarely that \"[a] court's prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2700. This approach \"hold[s] judicial interpretations contained in precedents to the same demanding <i>Chevron</i> ... standard that applies if the court is reviewing the agency's construction on a blank slate.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Brand X</i> demands that we reexamine pre-<i>Chevron</i> precedents through a <i>Chevron</i> lens. The <i>Chevron</i> two-step applies. At the first step, a court \"must look primarily to the plain meaning of the statute, drawing its essence from the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\" <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689917\"><a href=\"/opinion/689917/nancy-strickland-v-commissioner-maine-department-of-human-services-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). At this step, the court may \"examine the legislative history, albeit skeptically, in search of an unmistakable expression of congressional intent.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. If the precedent at issue finds clarity at step one&#8212;that is, if the holding of the case rests on a perception of clear and unambiguous congressional intent&#8212;that precedent will govern. <i>See Brand X,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2700. If, however, the precedent operates at <i>Chevron</i> step two&#8212;that is, if the case holds, in effect, that congressional intent is less than pellucid and proceeds to choose a \"<i>best</i> reading\" rather than \"the <i>only permissible</i> reading,\" <i>id.</i> at 2701 (emphasis in original)&#8212;its stare decisis effect will, through <i>Chevron</i> deference, yield to a contrary but plausible agency interpretation, <i>see id.</i> at 2700.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once this mode of analysis is understood and applied, Dominion's argument collapses. <i>Seacoast</i> simply does not hold that Congress clearly intended the term \"public hearing\" in sections 402(a) and 316(a) of the CWA to mean \"evidentiary hearing.\" To the contrary, the <i>Seacoast</i> court based its interpretation of the CWA on a presumption derived from the legislative history of the APA&#8212;a presumption that would hold sway only in the absence of a showing of a contrary congressional intent. <i>Seacoast,</i> 572 F.2d at 877-78. In other words, the court resorted to the presumption only because it could find no sign of a plainly discernible congressional intent. <i>Id.</i> at 878. A statutory interpretation constructed on such a negative finding is antithetic to a conclusion that Congress's intent was clear and unambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the <i>Seacoast</i> court, faced with an opaque statute, settled upon what it sensibly thought was the best construction of the CWA's \"public hearing\" language. Such a holding is appropriate at step two of the <i>Chevron</i> pavane, not at step one. Consequently, under <i>Brand X, Seacoast</i> must yield to a reasonable agency interpretation of the CWA's \"public hearing\" requirement. <i>See Brand X,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 2700.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only piece left to this puzzle is to confirm that the EPA's new regulations are, in fact, entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference. This inquiry is a straightforward one. As our earlier discussion suggests (and as the <i>Seacoast</i> court correctly deduced), Congress has not spoken directly to the precise question at issue here. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108715\"><a href=\"/opinion/108715/united-states-v-florida-east-coast-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108715\"><a href=\"/opinion/108715/united-states-v-florida-east-coast-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span> (1973) (\"The term `hearing' in its legal context undoubtedly has a host of meanings.\"); <i>Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. U.S. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522851\"><a href=\"/opinion/522851/chemical-waste-management-inc-and-waste-management-of-north-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1477</span></a></span>, 1480-82 (D.C.Cir. 1989) (concluding that Congress's intent behind the words \"public hearing\" in section 3008 of the RCRA was ambiguous for <i>Chevron</i> purposes). Accordingly, we must defer to the EPA's interpretation of the CWA as long as that interpretation is reasonable. <i>See Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Waste Mgmt.,</i> 873 F.2d at 1483 (concluding that the EPA's choice of informal adjudicatory procedures under RCRA was reasonable). The agency's conclusion that evidentiary hearings are unnecessary and that Congress, in using the phrase \"opportunity for public hearing,\" did not mean to mandate evidentiary hearings seems reasonable&#8212;and Dominion, to its credit, has conceded the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dominion makes two final attempts to resuscitate <i>Seacoast.</i> First, it asseverates that a refusal to follow <i>Seacoast</i> offends the \"law of the circuit\" rule. That rule (a branch of the stare decisis doctrine) holds that, \"[o]rdinarily, newly constituted panels in a multi-panel circuit should consider themselves bound by prior panel decisions\" closely on point. <i>Eulitt v. Me., Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201301\"><a href=\"/opinion/201301/eulitt-v-me-dept-of-edu/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 349 (1st Cir.2004). However, the \"law of the circuit\" rule, like most rules of general application, is subject to exceptions. One such exception \"comes into play when a preexisting panel opinion is undermined by subsequently announced controlling authority, such as a decision of the Supreme Court.\" <i>Id.</i> In this instance, the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Chevron</i> and <i>Brand X</i> counsel against a mechanical application of <i>Seacoast.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Dominion exhorts us to find that <i>Seacoast's</i> holding is actually an interpretation of the APA, not the CWA (and, therefore, the EPA's regulation is also an interpretation of the APA, not entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference). <i>See, e.g., Metro. Stevedore Co. v. Rambo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118130\"><a href=\"/opinion/118130/metropolitan-stevedore-co-v-rambo/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 137 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118130\"><a href=\"/opinion/118130/metropolitan-stevedore-co-v-rambo/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span> (1997) (noting that <i>Chevron</i> deference is inappropriate vis-&#224;-vis an agency interpretation of the APA's burden-of-proof provision). Such a reading of <i>Seacoast</i> is plainly incorrect. While the <i>Seacoast</i> court relied on a presumption borrowed from the APA, the court's holding is an interpretation of the CWA and, specifically, of the term \"public hearing\" contained in sections 402(a) and 316(a). The EPA's regulations are also derived from the CWA. <i>See</i> 40 C.F.R. &#167; 122.1(a) (explaining that 40 C.F.R. &#167; 124 implements sections of the CWA). Because those changes implicate the statute that the EPA administers (i.e., the CWA), <i>Chevron</i> deference is appropriate. <i>See Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly. Although we in no way disparage the soundness of <i>Seacoast's</i> reasoning, the <i>Chevron</i> and <i>Brand X</i> opinions and the interposition of a new and reasonable agency interpretation of the disputed statutory language have changed the picture. Because we, like the <i>Seacoast</i> court, cannot discern a clear and unambiguous congressional intent behind the words \"public hearing\" in the CWA and because the EPA's interpretation of that term constitutes a reasonable construction of the statute, deference is due. It follows inexorably that no non-discretionary duty to grant Dominion an evidentiary hearing on its permit application exists. Consequently, the jurisdictional requirements of section 505(a)(2) have not been satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Dominion's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> During the pendency of this appeal, the Board issued its merits decision.
