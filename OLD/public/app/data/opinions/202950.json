Sunoto, a native and citizen of\n\nIndonesia, petitions for review of a decision of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming the denial of his application\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal and voluntary departure.       An\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Sunoto was not eligible for\n\nrelief because, inter alia, he originally submitted a fraudulent\n\napplication and failed to present credible testimony in support of\n\nhis amended application.     The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision.     Sunoto challenges the IJ's decision on a host of\n\ngrounds, most of which were not raised in his appeal to the BIA.\n\nOn those omitted issues, he unquestionably failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), leaving us\n\nwithout jurisdiction to review the agency's decision on those\n\nissues.     Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).      Two issues may be deemed preserved only if his BIA\n\nsubmissions are viewed generously. Those issues are, in any event,\n\nunavailing, and we therefore deny the petition for review.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Sunoto1 lawfully entered the United States in July 1991\n\nas a non-immigrant alien in transit and was authorized to remain in\n\nthe country until the end of August that same year.      On June 3,\n\n2002, he filed an asylum application with the former Immigration\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although the official record refers to petitioner as \"Sunoto\nSunoto,\" he testified that his name is simply \"Sunoto.\"\n\n                                 -2-\n\fand Naturalization Service claiming that he was a Christian who\n\nfeared Muslim extremists in his native Indonesia. Among other past\n\nepisodes described in the application, he claimed that his father,\n\na church deacon, had been shot and killed by the extremists.             He\n\nreiterated this background in an interview with an asylum officer.\n\n           More than two years later, while removal proceedings were\n\npending against him, Sunoto filed a new asylum application and\n\nadmitted that his earlier application was almost entirely false.\n\nHe explained at a hearing before an IJ that he had allowed an\n\nindividual with whom he lived to fabricate the facts in the first\n\napplication because Sunoto was newly arrived in the United States,\n\nhe \"did not know anything,\" and he \"did not want to argue because\n\n[he] did not want to make that person angry.\"            Sunoto admitted\n\nthat, in fact, he had become a Christian only after arriving in the\n\nUnited   States,   and   neither   he    nor   any   family   members   had\n\nexperienced mistreatment in Indonesia.         However, he repeated his\n\nfear of future persecution based on his newly adopted Christian\n\nbeliefs.\n\n           In an oral ruling, the IJ denied Sunoto's application for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal, and also found that he was not\n\nentitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture.2           The\n\nIJ found Sunoto statutorily ineligible for asylum on two grounds:\n\n\n\n     2\n       Sunoto did not seek relief under the Convention, but the IJ\nnonetheless considered his eligibility under its provisions.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f(1) his revised application was untimely because it was not filed\n\nwithin one year of his arrival in the United States, see 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1158(a)(2)(B),     and   (2)    Sunoto     knowingly   filed      a    frivolous\n\napplication     for    asylum,     and   gave    fraudulent     and       fabricated\n\ntestimony     before    an   asylum      officer,   disqualifying          him    from\n\nobtaining benefits under the Immigration and Naturalization Act,\n\nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(6).            The IJ alternatively concluded that\n\nSunoto had failed to present credible testimony in support of his\n\napplication, finding Sunoto to be \"evasive, nonresponsive, furtive,\n\nand a wholly incredible witness.\"                In making the credibility\n\nfinding, the IJ pointed to inconsistencies in Sunoto's testimony at\n\nthe hearing, his admittedly fraudulent first application, the\n\nsubsequent false testimony he gave to the asylum officer, and his\n\nexplanation    for     his   earlier     conduct    –   which   the       IJ     termed\n\n\"disingenuous at best.\"            The negative credibility finding also\n\ndoomed Sunoto's request for withholding of removal.                See Abdullah\n\nv. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"An alien who fails\n\nto satisfy the standard for asylum automatically fails to satisfy\n\nthe more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\").\n\n            In his notice of appeal to the BIA, which apparently was\n\nfiled without the assistance of counsel, Sunoto complained that\n\n\"[t]he judge was not fair enough to listen to my testimony\" and\n\nasserted that \"I told everything the truth, but the judge said I\n\nwas lie.\"    A subsequently filed \"brief\" consisted of a three-page\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fstatement describing his conversion to Christianity, the absence of\n\nreligious freedom in Indonesia, and his fear that he would be a\n\ntarget of persecution if he returned there.         In reference to his\n\nfirst application, he explained: \"I realized that my application\n\nfor asylum was fraud.      The reason I changed my affidavit on the\n\nhearing last year just because I couldn't lie to myself anymore.\n\nI already received the truth from God.        I convinced myself always\n\nto tell the truth to everyone.\"          Attached to his statement were\n\ncopies of news reports about religious violence in Indonesia.\n\n          The    BIA   adopted   and   affirmed   the   IJ's   decision   in\n\nFebruary 2006.     It declined to decide whether Sunoto's second\n\napplication was timely filed, but agreed with the IJ that he was in\n\nany event ineligible for asylum because he had filed a frivolous\n\napplication. Although the Board disagreed with the IJ's finding of\n\ninconsistencies in Sunoto's testimony,3 it agreed that he was not\n\na credible witness based on the other reasons cited by the IJ and\n\nthat he therefore failed to prove his claim for withholding of\n\n\n\n     3\n       The testimony at issue concerned Sunoto's knowledge of the\ncontents of his original asylum application. The IJ stated that\nSunoto first testified that he understood the fabrications in that\napplication, but changed his testimony on cross-examination to say\nthat he was unfamiliar with the answers given on the form. The BIA\nnoted   that  petitioner's   original   testimony   concerned  the\nsubstantive material in the application, but the cross-examination\ntestimony followed questioning about his understanding of written\nwarnings about frivolous applications. The BIA concluded that the\nlatter testimony about his lack of understanding was \"not clearly\ninconsistent with his prior testimony . . . that he knew the\nsubstance of the application.\"\n\n                                   -5-\n\fremoval.     The BIA also endorsed the IJ's rejection of voluntary\n\ndeparture.     It treated Sunoto's submission of new documents as a\n\nmotion to remand, but concluded that, given the adverse credibility\n\nfinding, he could not meet his \"heavy burden\" to prove a likely\n\nchange in result if the proceedings were reopened.       See Abdullah,\n\n461 F.3d at 100 (referring to the \"heavy burden\" faced by an alien\n\nseeking to reopen immigration proceedings).\n\n           In his petition for review to this court, Sunoto presents\n\nsix issues: (1) the IJ erred as a matter of law in ruling that his\n\nfraudulent application permanently barred him from receiving any\n\nimmigration benefits; (2) the IJ erroneously ruled that his amended\n\nasylum application was untimely; (3) the BIA erroneously failed to\n\ngive full effect to its finding that the IJ improperly identified\n\ninconsistencies in his hearing testimony; (4) the IJ improperly\n\nused an irrebuttable presumption that he was incapable of telling\n\nthe truth; (5) the IJ's \"clear predisposition\" to find that he was\n\nincapable of telling the truth denied him due process of law; and\n\n(6) the case must be remanded because the IJ did not rule on his\n\namended application.\n\n           As revealed by our description of Sunoto's notice of\n\nappeal   and   supporting   materials,   none   of   these   claims   was\n\nexplicitly presented to the BIA. A petitioner who fails to present\n\na claim to the BIA has failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies on that issue, and we consequently lack jurisdiction to\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\freview the claim.    Berrio-Barrera, 460 F.3d at 167; see also\n\nOlujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          However, among the six asserted challenges in Sunoto's\n\nbrief are two focusing on the IJ's credibility finding – the\n\nirrebuttable presumption and due process claims – that resemble his\n\ncontentions to the BIA that the IJ was unfair in not listening to\n\nhis testimony and called him \"a lie.\"    Whether the similarity is\n\nenough to warrant our review is doubtful.       The exhaustion of\n\nremedies doctrine extends not only to claims omitted from an appeal\n\nto the BIA but also to claims that were \"insufficiently developed\n\nbefore the BIA.\"    Silva v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Olujoke, 411 F.3d at 22-23.4     Nonetheless, preferring to\n\napply this standard generously, we briefly consider his objections\n\nconcerning the IJ's approach toward his truthfulness.\n\n                               II.\n\n          When the BIA adopts and affirms an IJ's decision, we\n\nreview the IJ's decision \"to the extent of the adoption, and the\n\nBIA's decision as to [any] additional ground.\" Berrio-Barrera, 460\n\n\n\n     4\n       In Bencosme de Rodriguez v. Gonzales, 433 F.3d 163, 164\n(1st Cir. 2005), we declined to review \"the petitioner's claim that\nimproper judicial conduct by the Immigration Judge violated her due\nprocess rights because the petitioner failed to raise this claim in\nher appeal to the BIA and therefore failed to exhaust her\nadministrative remedies.\" Although some constitutional claims are\nexempt from the exhaustion requirement because the BIA lacks\nauthority to address them, that exception does not apply to a claim\nof \"bias and misconduct by [the] Immigration Judge.\" Id. at 165\n(citing Sayyah v. Farquharson, 382 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n                               -7-\n\fF.3d at 167; see also Chen v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.\n\n2004) (\"[W]hen the BIA both adopts the findings of the IJ and\n\ndiscusses   some   of   the      bases   for   the   IJ's   decision,    we   have\n\nauthority to review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.\").\n\nIn conducting our review, we use the deferential substantial\n\nevidence     standard      for     factual       findings    and      credibility\n\ndeterminations.    Silva, 463 F.3d at 72.            That approach requires us\n\nto \"uphold the BIA's decision 'unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"                  Id. (quoting 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).\n\n            At   bottom,      Sunoto's     due    process    and     irrebuttable\n\npresumption claims are both assertions that the IJ unfairly relied\n\non the fraudulent application in making the adverse credibility\n\nfinding, and lacked a sufficient basis in the record for that\n\nfinding.    The BIA determined that the IJ erred with respect to one\n\nrationale – that Sunoto had testified inconsistently about his\n\nknowledge of the contents of his fraudulent application – but held\n\nthat the finding was sufficiently supported by other factors: \"the\n\nrespondent's fraudulent filing and testimony before the asylum\n\noffice, his demeanor, [and] his implausible explanation for why he\n\npursued a fraudulent claim . . . .\"\n\n            Sunoto does not challenge the relevance and validity of\n\nthese other reasons; indeed, it cannot be debated that his earlier\n\nfabrications carry some weight.            However, he claims that the IJ\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fbegan the credibility assessment with an unfair emphasis on his\n\npast       conduct    and   then    unfairly    bolstered   the    inference     of\n\nuntruthfulness by relying heavily on the inconsistency that the BIA\n\nrejected.      Sunoto cites several comments made by the IJ, including\n\nthat \"[t]his respondent is incapable of telling the truth,\" and\n\nthat \"this Court cannot find anything that comes out of the\n\nrespondent's mouth or anything that he submits to this Court in\n\nwriting to be credible.\"             Sunoto argues that the predisposition\n\nreflected in this \"strong language\" is \"particularly objectionable\n\nbecause it is based on a view of Sunoto's testimony that the BIA\n\nhas found unwarranted.\"            He further asserts that these statements\n\nsuggest a predisposition that diminishes the force of the other\n\nfactors cited by the IJ and prevented him from having a fair\n\nhearing.5\n\n               While the IJ's credibility determination undoubtedly was\n\ninfluenced       to    some   extent    by     his   erroneous    finding   of   an\n\ninconsistency, he cited – as noted above – multiple other reasons\n\n\n\n       5\n       Sunoto also attempted to buttress his due process claim by\npointing to the immigration judge's statement that he (the judge)\nwas \"uncertain of the respondent's identity.\" Sunoto notes that no\nquestions ever were raised concerning his identity, and the IJ's\ncomment   was   therefore   further   indication  of   an   unfair\npredisposition toward petitioner.     We can agree that the IJ's\nreference to identity was unnecessary and without basis, but, in\ncontext, it is more reasonably understood as a general comment on\nSunoto's credibility – based on the other factors noted above –\nthan a challenge to Sunoto's identity. There is no indication that\nidentity played a consequential role in the IJ's decision or any\nrole in the BIA's assessment of the IJ's ruling.\n\n                                         -9-\n\ffor his conclusion and observed that \"[a]ll of these actions go to\n\nthe heart of the matter before this Court today, that is, is the\n\nrespondent a credible witness.\" For example, in rejecting Sunoto's\n\nexplanation that he filed the fraudulent application because he\n\nfeared confronting his friend, the IJ observed that if he were\n\n\"afraid   to   contradict   his   roommate    and   change   his   asylum\n\napplication because he thought he would be kicked out of his house,\n\n[he] certainly would have refused to go under oath and perjure\n\nhimself in such grave and great detail before the United States\n\nasylum officer.\"     The IJ thus found that Sunoto was \"a full,\n\nwilling participant in this fraud on the United States.\"\n\n          We therefore are persuaded that the IJ did not, as Sunoto\n\nsuggests, pre-judge his credibility.     Rather, the judge deemed his\n\nnew story unbelievable and, among other reasons, factored in his\n\nassessment of demeanor. Moreover, the BIA reviewed the record with\n\ncare, discounting the IJ's subsidiary finding of inconsistency.6\n\nOn this record, we cannot say that the IJ's credibility finding was\n\nunfairly derived or that the nature of the proceedings compelled\n\nthe BIA to reject the IJ's credibility determination.7\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n     6\n         The BIA also pointed out a          legal error in the IJ's\ndecision, noting that submission of           a frivolous application\nforecloses asylum but does not – as the      IJ stated – also preclude\nwithholding of removal. See 8 C.F.R. §       1208.20.\n     7\n       While we do not reach Sunoto's other claims, we note that\nthe credibility finding renders them moot.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Sunoto was not eligible for relief because, <i>inter alia,</i> he originally submitted a fraudulent application and failed to present credible testimony in support of his amended application. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision. Sunoto challenges the IJ's decision on a host of grounds, most of which were not raised in his appeal to the BIA. On those omitted issues, he unquestionably failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), leaving us without jurisdiction to review the agency's decision on those issues. <i>Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales,</i> 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir.2006). Two issues may be deemed preserved only if his BIA submissions are viewed generously. Those issues are, in any event, unavailing, and we therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Sunoto<sup>[1]</sup> lawfully entered the United States in July 1991 as a non-immigrant alien in transit and was authorized to remain in the country until the end of August that same year. On June 3, 2002, he filed an asylum application with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service claiming that he was a Christian who feared Muslim extremists in his native Indonesia. Among other past episodes described in the application, he claimed that his father, a church deacon, had been shot and killed by the extremists. He reiterated this background in an interview with an asylum officer.</p>\n<p>More than two years later, while removal proceedings were pending against him, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> Sunoto filed a new asylum application and admitted that his earlier application was almost entirely false. He explained at a hearing before an IJ that he had allowed an individual with whom he lived to fabricate the facts in the first application because Sunoto was newly arrived in the United States, he \"did not know anything,\" and he \"did not want to argue because [he] did not want to make that person angry.\" Sunoto admitted that, in fact, he had become a Christian only after arriving in the United States, and neither he nor any family members had experienced mistreatment in Indonesia. However, he repeated his fear of future persecution based on his newly adopted Christian beliefs.</p>\n<p>In an oral ruling, the IJ denied Sunoto's application for asylum and withholding of removal, and also found that he was not entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture.<sup>[2]</sup> The IJ found Sunoto statutorily ineligible for asylum on two grounds: (1) his revised application was untimely because it was not filed within one year of his arrival in the United States, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and (2) Sunoto knowingly filed a frivolous application for asylum, and gave fraudulent and fabricated testimony before an asylum officer, disqualifying him from obtaining benefits under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(6). The IJ alternatively concluded that Sunoto had failed to present credible testimony in support of his application, finding Sunoto to be \"evasive, nonresponsive, furtive, and a wholly incredible witness.\" In making the credibility finding, the IJ pointed to inconsistencies in Sunoto's testimony at the hearing, his admittedly fraudulent first application, the subsequent false testimony he gave to the asylum officer, and his explanation for his earlier conduct  which the IJ termed \"disingenuous at best.\" The negative credibility finding also doomed Sunoto's request for withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Abdullah v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir.2006) (\"An alien who fails to satisfy the standard for asylum automatically fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\").</p>\n<p>In his notice of appeal to the BIA, which apparently was filed without the assistance of counsel, Sunoto complained that \"[t]he judge was not fair enough to listen to my testimony\" and asserted that \"I told everything the truth, but the judge said I was lie.\" A subsequently filed \"brief\" consisted of a three-page statement describing his conversion to Christianity, the absence of religious freedom in Indonesia, and his fear that he would be a target of persecution if he returned there. In reference to his first application, he explained: \"I realized that my application for asylum was fraud. The reason I changed my affidavit on the hearing last year just because I couldn't lie to myself anymore. I already received the truth from God. I convinced myself always to tell the truth to everyone.\" Attached to his statement were copies of news reports about religious violence in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision in February 2006. It declined to decide whether Sunoto's second application was timely filed, but agreed with the IJ that he was in any event ineligible for asylum because he had filed a frivolous application. Although the Board disagreed with the IJ's finding of inconsistencies in Sunoto's testimony,<sup>[3]</sup> it agreed that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> he was not a credible witness based on the other reasons cited by the IJ and that he therefore failed to prove his claim for withholding of removal. The BIA also endorsed the IJ's rejection of voluntary departure. It treated Sunoto's submission of new documents as a motion to remand, but concluded that, given the adverse credibility finding, he could not meet his \"heavy burden\" to prove a likely change in result if the proceedings were reopened. <i>See </i><i>Abdullah,</i> 461 F.3d at 100 (referring to the \"heavy burden\" faced by an alien seeking to reopen immigration proceedings).</p>\n<p>In his petition for review to this court, Sunoto presents six issues: (1) the IJ erred as a matter of law in ruling that his fraudulent application permanently barred him from receiving any immigration benefits; (2) the IJ erroneously ruled that his amended asylum application was untimely; (3) the BIA erroneously failed to give full effect to its finding that the IJ improperly identified inconsistencies in his hearing testimony; (4) the IJ improperly used an irrebuttable presumption that he was incapable of telling the truth; (5) the IJ's \"clear predisposition\" to find that he was incapable of telling the truth denied him due process of law; and (6) the case must be remanded because the IJ did not rule on his amended application.</p>\n<p>As revealed by our description of Sunoto's notice of appeal and supporting materials, none of these claims was explicitly presented to the BIA. A petitioner who fails to present a claim to the BIA has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on that issue, and we consequently lack jurisdiction to review the claim. <i>Berrio-Barrera,</i> 460 F.3d at 167; <i>see also </i><i>Olujoke v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>However, among the six asserted challenges in Sunoto's brief are two focusing on the IJ's credibility finding  the irrebuttable presumption and due process claims  that resemble his contentions to the BIA that the IJ was unfair in not listening to his testimony and called him \"a lie.\" Whether the similarity is enough to warrant our review is doubtful. The exhaustion of remedies doctrine extends not only to claims omitted from an appeal to the BIA but also to claims that were \"insufficiently developed before the BIA.\" <i>Silva v. Gonzales,</i> 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>Olujoke,</i> 411 F.3d at 22-23.<sup>[4]</sup> Nonetheless, preferring to apply this standard generously, we briefly consider his objections concerning the IJ's approach toward his truthfulness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>When the BIA adopts and affirms an IJ's decision, we review the IJ's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> decision \"to the extent of the adoption, and the BIA's decision as to [any] additional ground.\" <i>Berrio-Barrera,</i> 460 F.3d at 167; <i>see also </i><i>Chen v.

In conducting our review, we use the deferential substantial evidence standard for factual findings and credibility determinations. <i>Silva,</i> 463 F.3d at 72. That approach requires us to \"uphold the BIA's decision `unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p>At bottom, Sunoto's due process and irrebuttable presumption claims are both assertions that the IJ unfairly relied on the fraudulent application in making the adverse credibility finding, and lacked a sufficient basis in the record for that finding. The BIA determined that the IJ erred with respect to one rationale  that Sunoto had testified inconsistently about his knowledge of the contents of his fraudulent application  but held that the finding was sufficiently supported by other factors: \"the respondent's fraudulent filing and testimony before the asylum office, his demeanor, [and] his implausible explanation for why he pursued a fraudulent claim. . . .\"</p>\n<p>Sunoto does not challenge the relevance and validity of these other reasons; indeed, it cannot be debated that his earlier fabrications carry some weight. However, he claims that the IJ began the credibility assessment with an unfair emphasis on his past conduct and then unfairly bolstered the inference of untruthfulness by relying heavily on the inconsistency that the BIA rejected. Sunoto cites several comments made by the IJ, including that \"[t]his respondent is incapable of telling the truth,\" and that \"this Court cannot find anything that comes out of the respondent's mouth or anything that he submits to this Court in writing to be credible.\" Sunoto argues that the predisposition reflected in this \"strong language\" is \"particularly objectionable because it is based on a view of Sunoto's testimony that the BIA has found unwarranted.\" He further asserts that these statements suggest a predisposition that diminishes the force of the other factors cited by the IJ and prevented him from having a fair hearing.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>While the IJ's credibility determination undoubtedly was influenced to some extent by his erroneous finding of an inconsistency, he cited  as noted above  multiple other reasons for his conclusion and observed that \"[a]ll of these actions go to the heart of the matter before this Court today, that is, is the respondent a credible witness.\" For example, in rejecting Sunoto's explanation that he filed the fraudulent application because he feared confronting his friend, the IJ observed that if he were \"afraid to contradict his roommate and change his asylum application because he thought he would be kicked out of his house, [he] certainly would have refused to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> go under oath and perjure himself in such grave and great detail before the United States asylum officer.\" The IJ thus found that Sunoto was \"a full, willing participant in this fraud on the United States.\"</p>\n<p>We therefore are persuaded that the IJ did not, as Sunoto suggests, prejudge his credibility. Rather, the judge deemed his new story unbelievable and, among other reasons, factored in his assessment of demeanor. Moreover, the BIA reviewed the record with care, discounting the IJ's subsidiary finding of inconsistency.<sup>[6]</sup> On this record, we cannot say that the IJ's credibility finding was unfairly derived or that the nature of the proceedings compelled the BIA to reject the IJ's credibility determination.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>The petition for review is denied.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although the official record refers to petitioner as \"Sunoto Sunoto,\" he testified that his name is simply \"Sunoto.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Sunoto did not seek relief under the Convention, but the IJ nonetheless considered his eligibility under its provisions.</p>\n<p>[3]  The testimony at issue concerned Sunoto's knowledge of the contents of his original asylum application.

The BIA noted that petitioner's original testimony concerned the substantive material in the application, but the cross-examination testimony followed questioning about his understanding of written warnings about frivolous applications.

We can agree that the IJ's reference to identity was unnecessary and without basis, but, in context, it is more reasonably understood as a general comment on Sunoto's credibility  based on the other factors noted above  than a challenge to Sunoto's identity.

An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") found that Sunoto was not eligible for relief because, <i>inter alia,</i> he originally submitted a fraudulent application and failed to present credible testimony in support of his amended application. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision. Sunoto challenges the IJ's decision on a host of grounds, most of which were not raised in his appeal to the BIA. On those omitted issues, he unquestionably failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), leaving us without jurisdiction to review the agency's decision on those issues. <i>Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202382\"><a href=\"/opinion/202382/berrio-barrera-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 167 (1st Cir.2006). Two issues may be deemed preserved only if his BIA submissions are viewed generously. Those issues are, in any event, unavailing, and we therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Sunoto<sup>[1]</sup> lawfully entered the United States in July 1991 as a non-immigrant alien in transit and was authorized to remain in the country until the end of August that same year. On June 3, 2002, he filed an asylum application with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service claiming that he was a Christian who feared Muslim extremists in his native Indonesia. Among other past episodes described in the application, he claimed that his father, a church deacon, had been shot and killed by the extremists. He reiterated this background in an interview with an asylum officer.</p>\n<p>More than two years later, while removal proceedings were pending against him, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> Sunoto filed a new asylum application and admitted that his earlier application was almost entirely false. He explained at a hearing before an IJ that he had allowed an individual with whom he lived to fabricate the facts in the first application because Sunoto was newly arrived in the United States, he \"did not know anything,\" and he \"did not want to argue because [he] did not want to make that person angry.\" Sunoto admitted that, in fact, he had become a Christian only after arriving in the United States, and neither he nor any family members had experienced mistreatment in Indonesia. However, he repeated his fear of future persecution based on his newly adopted Christian beliefs.</p>\n<p>In an oral ruling, the IJ denied Sunoto's application for asylum and withholding of removal, and also found that he was not entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture.<sup>[2]</sup> The IJ found Sunoto statutorily ineligible for asylum on two grounds: (1) his revised application was untimely because it was not filed within one year of his arrival in the United States, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and (2) Sunoto knowingly filed a frivolous application for asylum, and gave fraudulent and fabricated testimony before an asylum officer, disqualifying him from obtaining benefits under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(6). The IJ alternatively concluded that Sunoto had failed to present credible testimony in support of his application, finding Sunoto to be \"evasive, nonresponsive, furtive, and a wholly incredible witness.\" In making the credibility finding, the IJ pointed to inconsistencies in Sunoto's testimony at the hearing, his admittedly fraudulent first application, the subsequent false testimony he gave to the asylum officer, and his explanation for his earlier conduct  which the IJ termed \"disingenuous at best.\" The negative credibility finding also doomed Sunoto's request for withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Abdullah v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202383\"><a href=\"/opinion/202383/abdullah-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2006) (\"An alien who fails to satisfy the standard for asylum automatically fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal.\").</p>\n<p>In his notice of appeal to the BIA, which apparently was filed without the assistance of counsel, Sunoto complained that \"[t]he judge was not fair enough to listen to my testimony\" and asserted that \"I told everything the truth, but the judge said I was lie.\" A subsequently filed \"brief\" consisted of a three-page statement describing his conversion to Christianity, the absence of religious freedom in Indonesia, and his fear that he would be a target of persecution if he returned there. In reference to his first application, he explained: \"I realized that my application for asylum was fraud. The reason I changed my affidavit on the hearing last year just because I couldn't lie to myself anymore. I already received the truth from God. I convinced myself always to tell the truth to everyone.\" Attached to his statement were copies of news reports about religious violence in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision in February 2006. It declined to decide whether Sunoto's second application was timely filed, but agreed with the IJ that he was in any event ineligible for asylum because he had filed a frivolous application. Although the Board disagreed with the IJ's finding of inconsistencies in Sunoto's testimony,<sup>[3]</sup> it agreed that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> he was not a credible witness based on the other reasons cited by the IJ and that he therefore failed to prove his claim for withholding of removal. The BIA also endorsed the IJ's rejection of voluntary departure. It treated Sunoto's submission of new documents as a motion to remand, but concluded that, given the adverse credibility finding, he could not meet his \"heavy burden\" to prove a likely change in result if the proceedings were reopened. <i>See </i><i>Abdullah,</i> 461 F.3d at 100 (referring to the \"heavy burden\" faced by an alien seeking to reopen immigration proceedings).</p>\n<p>In his petition for review to this court, Sunoto presents six issues: (1) the IJ erred as a matter of law in ruling that his fraudulent application permanently barred him from receiving any immigration benefits; (2) the IJ erroneously ruled that his amended asylum application was untimely; (3) the BIA erroneously failed to give full effect to its finding that the IJ improperly identified inconsistencies in his hearing testimony; (4) the IJ improperly used an irrebuttable presumption that he was incapable of telling the truth; (5) the IJ's \"clear predisposition\" to find that he was incapable of telling the truth denied him due process of law; and (6) the case must be remanded because the IJ did not rule on his amended application.</p>\n<p>As revealed by our description of Sunoto's notice of appeal and supporting materials, none of these claims was explicitly presented to the BIA.
