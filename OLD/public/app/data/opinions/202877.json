Duval     and\n\nMichael R. Doucette were each convicted of one count of being a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.   ยง    922(g)(1).     Duval   and     Doucette   now    appeal      their\n\nconvictions and sentences. After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n             On January 27, 2003, Heath Woodward, then a resident of\n\nSanford, Maine, reported that his 1996 maroon Buick was stolen from\n\na convenience store parking lot.       Woodward later testified that he\n\ndid not have any weapons in the car at that time.\n\n             In late January, Duval, Doucette, and Carlos Ramos (an\n\nacquaintance of Duval and Doucette) spent a few nights at an\n\napartment rented by Robert Dyott.          Dyott was an associate of Ramos\n\nand unbeknownst to his guests, an informant for the Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"ATF\").         Dyott would later testify\n\nthat while staying at his apartment, Doucette said that he and\n\nDuval had stolen a car from a convenience store and that they had\n\nsome weapons in the trunk of that car that they wanted to \"move\"\n\n(i.e., sell).     Dyott also testified that Duval and Ramos were in\n\nthe room when Doucette said this, and that Duval did not disavow\n\nDoucette's statement.      According to Dyott, Doucette also said that\n\nhe and Duval were going to stay at a hotel the following night.\n\n             On January 31, 2003, a guest identifying himself as\n\n\"Carlos Ramos\" registered at the Chelmsford Best Western for\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fhimself and a guest named \"Paul Santos.\"          They were assigned room\n\n102.   In filling out the registration form, \"Ramos\" identified his\n\ncar as a \"96 maroon Buick.\"        That same night, a call was placed\n\nfrom Room 102 to a cell phone provided to Dyott by the ATF.\n\n           On February 1, 2003, Dyott spoke with Daniel Meade, an\n\nATF Agent, and told him that there was a stolen car with weapons at\n\nthe Chelmsford Best Western.         The ATF notified the Chelmsford\n\npolice department, which sent Officers Tyros and Tine, joined by\n\nAgent Meade, to the Best Western to investigate the suspected\n\nstolen vehicle.    Officer Tyros watched as a Caucasian male, later\n\nidentified as Duval, walked toward a maroon Buick carrying a black\n\nobject, and paused briefly by the trunk             of the car.     Tyros\n\ntestified that Duval noticed his presence and walked back to room\n\n102.\n\n           Later   that    day,   Agent   Meade   encountered   Duval   and\n\nDoucette as they walked towards a gas station near the motel and\n\nasked them to identify themselves. Upon learning their identities,\n\nAgent Meade arrested Duval and Doucette on outstanding warrants.\n\nMeade found the keys to the stolen Buick in Doucette's front\n\npocket.    A search of the car revealed a Remington rifle, a\n\nRemington shotgun, a Marlin rifle, and ammunition inside the trunk.\n\nInvestigators found no fingerprints in the trunk, on the firearms,\n\nor the ammunition.        However, Duval's and Doucette's prints were\n\nrecovered from objects found in the passenger compartment.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f             On June 19, 2003, a complaint was filed with the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging\n\nDuval and Doucette each with being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g).             The Government filed\n\nan indictment against Duval and Doucette on September 3, 2003.\n\nBoth Duval and Doucette pleaded not guilty.\n\n             In an attempt to comply with Local Rule 116.1(c)(1) and\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the Government initially\n\ndisclosed to Duval and Doucette in October 2003 that it would call\n\nDyott   to   testify   at    trial,   and   that   Dyott    was   a   Government\n\ninformant.      The Government stated that Dyott had not been paid for\n\nhis cooperation and that there was no evidence that would otherwise\n\ncast    doubt   on   his    credibility.     But   two     months     later,   the\n\nGovernment informed Duval and Doucette that Dyott had been paid\n\n$5,150 for his cooperation since 1998. Then, in February 2004, the\n\nGovernment sent a letter to Duval and Doucette stating that in\n\n1998, it had dropped firearms charges against Dyott in exchange for\n\nhis cooperation.       Eight months after that, the Government added\n\nthat it had discovered that Dyott had been paid an additional $600\n\nin 1998 and 1999, and that Dyott had a long history of mental\n\nillness.\n\n             On January 10, 2005, the Government moved to supplement\n\nits witness list to include Carlos Ramos, the acquaintance of Duval\n\nand Doucette who had allegedly rented the motel room for them.                 The\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fGovernment disclosed in a letter to Duval and Doucette that Ramos\n\nhad a history of drug abuse, and had once cooperated with the\n\nGovernment by making a \"controlled buy.\"                 The following week, on\n\nJanuary 19, the Government sent a second letter to Duval and\n\nDoucette stating that Ramos had told the Government that he did not\n\nsee any guns or hear either defendant make any reference to guns,\n\nand that Ramos had told Agent Meade in 2003 that he had no\n\nknowledge of a stolen car.               Other than this disclosure, the\n\nGovernment    indicated     that    it     had    no    additional       exculpatory\n\ninformation regarding Ramos.\n\n            Two days later, on January 21, 2005, the Government sent\n\nanother letter to Duval and Doucette. This time, the letter stated\n\nthat the Government did have exculpatory information regarding\n\nRamos,   specifically      that    Ramos    was      offered    leniency    for    his\n\nparticipation in the firearms transaction in exchange for becoming\n\nan   informant.     The    letter    also      stated    that    Agent     Meade   had\n\ninterviewed Ramos in February 2003, but that Meade had not made any\n\nnotes of the interview.           The letter stated that Meade had asked\n\nRamos about his renting a hotel room for Duval and Doucette, but\n\nthat he did not recall if he asked Ramos whether he was in the room\n\nwith Dyott, Duval, and Doucette in late January when Doucette was\n\nalleged to have offered to sell Dyott weapons.                      The Government\n\ncontinued    to   assert    that    Ramos      had     not   been   paid    for    his\n\ncooperation on the Duval and Doucette case.                  On January 31, 2005,\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthe Government sent yet another letter to Duval and Doucette,\n\namending its prior disclosure to add that Ramos had in fact\n\nattempted to make at least three or four controlled purchases for\n\nthe ATF, and that Meade had given him money to buy telephone\n\ncalling cards.     On the sixth day of the trial -- February 14, 2005\n\n-- the Government disclosed to Duval and Doucette, seemingly\n\ncontrary to prior claims that Ramos had not been paid in connection\n\nwith the present case, that an entry on the ATF payment roster\n\nindicated that Ramos had been paid $50 for \"informant subsistence.\"\n\nThe entry included a reference to \"Ducette [sic] & Duval.\"\n\n           Duval    and   Doucette    moved   to    dismiss   the   indictment\n\nbecause   of   a   pattern   of   Government       non-compliance    with   its\n\ndisclosure obligations.       The Government opposed the dismissal of\n\nthe indictment, contending that neither Duval nor Doucette had\n\nsuffered prejudice as a result of the belated disclosures.                  The\n\ncourt denied the motion to dismiss, stating that the Government had\n\nviolated its Brady obligations, but that neither Duval nor Doucette\n\nwere prejudiced.\n\n           Duval and Doucette also requested that the Government\n\nprovide the records of each individual payment to Dyott and Ramos\n\nso they could determine if the Government had failed to disclose\n\nany other payments to the witnesses.               Instead, the Government\n\nprovided Duval and Doucette a summary of the payments made to\n\nDyott.     Duval    and    Doucette    claimed      that   the   summary    was\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\finsufficient given the history of belated disclosures by the\n\nGovernment, and asked the court to compel production of the payment\n\nrecords, or in the alternative, to review the records in camera, in\n\norder to determine whether any additional payments had been made to\n\nDyott or Ramos.    The court denied the request.1\n\n            In addition, Duval moved to exclude as inadmissible\n\nhearsay Dyott's testimony that Doucette had offered firearms for\n\nsale.    The   court    denied   Duval's   motion   to   exclude   without\n\nprejudice, ruling that he could raise it again at trial if the\n\nGovernment failed to show that Doucette's statement was either a\n\nstatement in furtherance of a conspiracy or an adoptive admission\n\nby Duval.\n\n            The jury trial of Duval and Doucette began on February 7,\n\n2005, and lasted eight days.     At trial, Dyott testified that he had\n\nmet with Duval, Doucette, and Ramos in late January, that Doucette\n\nhad told him that he had firearms to sell, and that Duval said\n\nnothing when he heard this.          Dyott also disclosed on direct\n\nexamination his past and present drug habits, mental illness, and\n\ncriminal history.      Duval and Doucette cross-examined Dyott as to\n\nhis cooperation with the ATF and payments that he received.            In\n\naddition, both Ramos and Agent Meade testified, along with various\n\nother witnesses.\n\n\n1\n   The request was made prior to trial and was renewed after the\nGovernment's additional disclosure of exculpatory evidence on\nFebruary 14, 2005.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           During closing arguments, the Government noted that Duval\n\nhad been within fifteen miles of the location where the Buick was\n\nstolen, that the Buick did not have firearms or ammunition in it\n\nwhen it was stolen, that the Buick was later found at the hotel\n\nwhere Duval and Doucette were staying, that Duval had suspiciously\n\napproached the vehicle but turned away when he saw the police, that\n\nDoucette had the keys to the vehicle, and that the trunk contained\n\nfirearms and ammunition.          The Government then stated, \"[Y]ou can\n\nstop right there . . . because that evidence proves beyond a\n\nreasonable     doubt   that   [Duval    and     Doucette]        were    in   knowing\n\npossession [of the firearms and ammunition].                But there's more.\"\n\nThe Government then noted that Dyott had testified that Doucette\n\nhad   admitted    to   possessing    the     firearms,     and    that    Duval   had\n\nremained silent.       The Government acknowledged Dyott's substantial\n\ncredibility      problems   but    said,     \"Take   Mr.    Dyott's      testimony,\n\ndiscount it altogether. . . . [T]here is still no reasonable doubt\n\nthat these men possessed those guns and that ammunition.\"                      Duval\n\nand Doucette then gave their closing arguments.                   Duval suggested\n\nthat \"the Government cannot get around the testimony of Robert\n\nDyott.   [If] Robert Dyott's testimony [is] not in this case, there\n\nis no case.\"     Doucette stated, \"[I]f you don't believe Mr. Dyott's\n\ntestimony about a conversation he claims to have heard January 31st\n\nof 2003, if you don't believe his testimony beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, you cannot convict in this case.\"\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            Duval and Doucette then asked the court to give two\n\ninstructions to the jury.    First, they asked the court to instruct\n\nthe jury that, \"if [you] do not believe Mr. Dyott's testimony\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt [about his alleged conversation with\n\nDoucette], [you] must acquit the defendant.\"             Second, Duval and\n\nDoucette asked the court to instruct the jury that \"[o]ne cannot be\n\nfound guilty of possessing an object unless he has knowledge of its\n\npresence.     Knowledge   alone,   however,   is   not    enough   to   prove\n\npossession. Similarly, mere presence in the vicinity of the object\n\nis insufficient to prove possession.\"          The court refused both\n\ninstructions, and instead instructed the jury as follows:\n\n            To possess something means to have control or\n            dominion and control over something.    It is\n            not necessarily the same as legal ownership.\n\n            The   law   recognizes  different   kinds  of\n            possession. Possession includes both actual\n            and constructive possession.     A person who\n            has direct, physical control of something on\n            or around his person is in actual possession\n            of it.     A person who is not in actual\n            possession but who has the -- both the power\n            and intention to exercise control or dominion\n            and control over something is in constructive\n            possession of it. So whenever I use the word\n            \"possession\" in these instructions, I mean\n            both actual and constructive possession.\n\n            In considering the issue of possession in this\n            case it is not necessary for you to conclude\n            that a defendant in this case was in actual or\n            constructive possession of the firearm and/or\n            ammunition for a specified period of time.\n\n            More than one person can have control over the\n            same firearms and/or ammunition. If this is\n            so, then these people have what is called\n\n                                   -9-\n\f          joint possession. For purposes of determining\n          a defendant's guilt, joint possession is not\n          different from sole possession.\n\n          While you may consider a defendant's proximity\n          to the firearms and/or ammunition in deciding\n          whether the government has established beyond\n          a reasonable doubt that he possessed those\n          items, mere proximity to the firearm and/or\n          ammunition or mere presence of a defendant in\n          the place where the firearm and/or ammunition\n          were found is insufficient by itself to\n          support a finding of possession.\n                              . . .\n          The Government must also establish beyond a\n          reasonable doubt as to each defendant that he\n          knowingly   possessed   the   firearms  and/or\n          ammunition in question. The word \"knowingly\"\n          means that the act was done voluntarily and\n          intentionally and not because of ignorance,\n          mistake, or accident.      Thus, in order to\n          convict a defendant, you must find beyond a\n          reasonable doubt that he knew he was in\n          possession of a firearm and/or ammunition and\n          that he knew that what he possessed was a\n          firearm and/or ammunition as we commonly use\n          these words.\n\n          The jury convicted both Duval and Doucette on the sole\n\ncount of being a felon in possession of a firearm.    Presentence\n\nreports were prepared for both defendants, suggesting that they\n\nwere subject to the Armed Career Criminals Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C.\n\nยง 924(e), which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen\n\nyears on any person convicted of a firearms charge who has been\n\npreviously convicted of three violent felonies.   Neither Duval's\n\nnor Doucette's prior convictions were alleged before the jury, and\n\nthe jury made no finding as to them.\n\n\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f            Both Duval and Doucette challenged the court's ability to\n\nimpose a sentence under the ACCA unless the predicate convictions\n\nhad been proven to a jury.        In addition, Duval stated that one of\n\nthe predicate convictions being used to support his eligibility for\n\nan ACCA sentence, a conviction for assault and battery under Me.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 207(1)(A), was neither a violent crime\n\nnor a felony.      The court rejected Duval's and Doucette's arguments\n\nand found them both to be subject to the ACCA because they had each\n\nbeen convicted of three prior felonies.             The court imposed a\n\nsentence of 180 months on Duval and 204 months on Doucette.\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\n            Duval and Doucette appeal their convictions on the ground\n\nthat the Government failed to meet its obligation to disclose\n\nexculpatory evidence under Brady, 373 U.S. 83, and the Jencks Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3500(b).           In addition, Duval argues that Dyott's\n\ntestimony as to Doucette's statement during the January 30, 2003\n\nmeeting should not have been admitted against him because it was\n\ninadmissible hearsay.          Duval and Doucette both challenge the\n\ndistrict court's failure to give their requested jury instructions\n\nregarding    the    elements    of   constructive   possession   and   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence against them.       Duval and Doucette also\n\nbring a Sixth Amendment challenge to their ACCA-mandated sentences.\n\nFinally, Doucette argues that he has not been convicted of three\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fviolent felonies, and thus is not subject to sentencing under the\n\nACCA.   We discuss each of these claims in turn.\n\n              A. The Government's Disclosure Obligations\n\n              Duval and Doucette argue that the Government failed to\n\ncomply with its obligations under Brady and the Jencks Act to\n\ndisclose exculpatory and impeaching evidence regarding Dyott and\n\nRamos and that it should have been sanctioned accordingly.                      In\n\naddition, because of the belated disclosure that Ramos had been\n\npaid for his cooperation with the ATF, Duval and Doucette suggest\n\nthat the Government may have failed to disclose additional payments\n\nmade to Dyott and Ramos, and they argue that they were entitled to\n\nin   camera    review    of   the    Government's   records     of   payments   to\n\nconfidential informants.            We review the district court's denial of\n\nsanctions and in camera review for abuse of discretion. See United\n\nStates v. Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir. 1999); United\n\nStates v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 289 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n              In Brady v. Maryland, the Supreme Court held that a\n\nprosecutor     has   a   duty   to     disclose,    upon   request,    \"evidence\n\nfavorable to an accused . . . where the evidence is material either\n\nto guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad\n\nfaith of the prosecution.\"             373 U.S. at 87; see also Giglio v.\n\nUnited States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) (reversing a conviction\n\nwhere   the    Government     failed     to   disclose   that   it   had   granted\n\nimmunity to a witness upon whose testimony the Government's case\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fwas heavily dependent).          Likewise, under the Jencks Act, the\n\nprosecution has an obligation to \"provide, upon request, certain\n\nprior statements made by trial witnesses . . . that . . . 'relate[]\n\nto the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Schneiderhan, 404 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing 18 U.S.C. ยง 3500(b)).        To vacate a conviction because of a\n\nBrady violation, a defendant must show that \"the evidence at issue\n\nmust be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory,\n\nor   because    it    is   impeaching;   that   evidence   must   have   been\n\nsuppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and\n\nprejudice must have ensued.\" United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104,\n\n114 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d\n\n144, 153 (1st Cir. 2000)).       The test for a Jencks Act violation is\n\nsimilar; we look to see whether the Government failed to disclose\n\nprior statements by witnesses         that relate to their testimony at\n\ntrial,    and        whether   the   nondisclosure     was    prejudicial.\n\nSchneiderhan, 404 F.3d at 79.         \"When the issue is one of delayed\n\ndisclosure rather than of nondisclosure, however, the test is\n\nwhether defendant's counsel was prevented by the delay from using\n\nthe disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the\n\ndefendant's case.\" United States v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 411-12\n\n(1st Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Arboleda, 929 F.2d 858,\n\n864 (1st Cir. 1991) (applying Ingraldi to allegations that the\n\nGovernment belatedly disclosed Jencks Act materials).\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f           We begin by noting that the Government's conduct during\n\nthe course of this prosecution was a clear violation of its Brady\n\nand   Jencks   Act   obligations.        The   Government     \"amended\"      its\n\ndisclosures of potentially exculpatory evidence no less than five\n\ntimes, each time disclosing information that further cast doubt on\n\nthe testimony of Dyott and Ramos, two of the Government's principal\n\nwitnesses at trial.    At least part of the problem appears to have\n\nbeen that the ATF agent involved in the investigation kept scant\n\nnotes on conversations with Ramos that tended to exculpate his\n\nprime suspects, Duval and Doucette -- a practice whose propriety is\n\nquestionable.2   Another part of the problem appears to have been\n\nshoddy   record-keeping   by    the    ATF   with   regard   to   payments    to\n\nconfidential informants.       Finally, overly broad statements by the\n\nGovernment that all exculpatory information had been disclosed may\n\nhave led Duval and Doucette to believe that the Government had in\n\nfact disclosed all that it knew, when it had not.            Whether the late\n\ndisclosures were the product of happenstance or of negligence is\n\nunclear, but we take this opportunity to remind prosecutors that\n\ndisclosure of Brady and Jencks Act material is not a suggestion,\n\nbut a constitutional and statutory obligation.\n\n\n2\n   Cf. United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1289 (1st Cir.\n1996) (\"Eschewing tape recordings and ordering law enforcement\nagents not to take notes during pretrial interviews is risky\nbusiness -- and not guaranteed to redound either to the sovereign's\ncredit or to its benefit. By adopting a 'what we don't create can't\ncome back to haunt us' approach, prosecutors demean their primary\nmission: to see that justice is done.\").\n\n                                      -14-\n\f             We are mindful that not all convictions must be vacated\n\nbecause of non-compliance with disclosure obligations; we must also\n\ndetermine whether the late-disclosed information prejudiced Duval\n\nand Doucette's ability to present their case.                 The first set of\n\nevidence belatedly disclosed by the Government was impeachment\n\nevidence regarding Dyott, namely that he had been treated for\n\nmental illness and had been paid $5,750 and given leniency in a\n\nprior    case   in   exchange    for   his    services   as    a   confidential\n\ninformant.      This information falls within the purview of Brady\n\nbecause it could be used to impeach the reliability and motivation\n\nof Dyott's testimony.           However, the last of these disclosures\n\noccurred in October 2004, nearly six months before the start of the\n\ntrial.       This left sufficient time for Duval's and Doucette's\n\ncounsel to incorporate the information into their defense strategy.\n\nWhile we do not condone the lateness of these disclosures, we do\n\nnot   find    that   the   district    court   abused    its    discretion   in\n\ndetermining that the lateness did not prejudice Duval and Doucette\n\nin the preparation of their cases, and that sanctions were not\n\nwarranted.\n\n             The second set of late disclosures involved statements by\n\nRamos to Agent Meade that he had not heard Dyott and Doucette\n\ndiscussing the arms sale; this statement falls within the scope of\n\nmaterial that must be disclosed under Brady because it casts doubt\n\non both the Government's claim that the conversation occurred, and\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fthe claim that Duval heard the statement and adopted the implicit\n\nadmission of criminal activity by remaining silent.                It also falls\n\nwithin the ambit of the Jencks Act, as it is a prior statement by\n\na witness that relates to his trial testimony.                   However, as the\n\nGovernment points out, Ramos remained missing until January 2005,\n\nand it is unclear that Duval and Doucette could have located him\n\nbefore then.    Furthermore, Ramos admitted during cross-examination\n\nthat he had told Meade that he did not remember hearing anything\n\nabout the sale of arms at the motel, and that he did not tell Meade\n\nanything about the stolen car when they met in February 2003.\n\nThus, even assuming that Doucette and Duval could have located\n\nRamos before that time and interviewed him regarding his statement,\n\nit is unclear what benefit this would have been to the defense\n\nstrategy.    See Casas, 356 F.3d at 115 (finding no prejudice where\n\ndefense counsel had an opportunity to cross-examine witness about\n\nbelatedly disclosed cooperation agreement).              Again, we do not find\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in determining that\n\nneither Duval nor Doucette were prejudiced by the late disclosure\n\nof Ramos's statement, and thus that sanctions were therefore not\n\nwarranted.\n\n            Finally,   Duval   and   Doucette      point    to    the   mid-trial\n\ndisclosure     that   the   Government      may   have   paid     Ramos   $50   in\n\nconnection with his cooperation in another case.                  The Government\n\nhas stated that it has no further records of payment, but Duval and\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fDoucette, having observed a pattern of delayed disclosures, suggest\n\notherwise. Thus, Duval and Doucette suggest that the proper remedy\n\nfor this late disclosure is to give them the opportunity to examine\n\nthe   Government's      confidential    informant     payment    records   to\n\ndetermine if other payments have been made to Ramos.3                 In the\n\nalternative, Duval and Doucette propose that we direct the court to\n\nengage in an in camera review of the records to determine whether\n\nadditional exculpatory material exists. Duval and Doucette suggest\n\nthat their case is similar to United States v. Rosario-Peralta,\n\n175 F.3d 48 (1st Cir. 1999).           In that case, various Government\n\nagencies had been pursuing a boat at sea that was observed dumping\n\ndrugs overboard.     Id. at 50-51.      The principal defense theory was\n\nthat the pursuing vessels had lost track of the boat engaged in the\n\ndumping, and that they had mistakenly seized the defendants' boat\n\ninstead.    Id.    at   55.   Accordingly,    the   defendants      requested\n\ncommunication logs from the Government, which they argued would\n\nconclusively establish that their boat could not have been the same\n\nboat observed dumping drugs overboard.        Id. at 54.        We noted that\n\nthe information in the logs was \"critical to defendants' theory and\n\nwas a disputed issue at trial,\" and that \"we do not see how [the\n\nlogs] could fail to be relevant.\"        Id. at 55.    Thus, we ordered in\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Assuming that they found additional exculpatory information,\nDuval and Doucette argue that they would be entitled to a new trial\nor dismissal of the indictment altogether.\n\n                                   -17-\n\fcamera review of the logs to determine whether they contained\n\npotentially exculpatory evidence.              Id. at 57.\n\n             Two principal differences between the present case and\n\nRosario-Peralta support our conclusion that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in failing to order in camera review of\n\nthe Government's payment logs.            First, the defendants in Rosario-\n\nPeralta made a clear showing that the evidence they sought in fact\n\nexisted; the Government had acknowledged the existence of the\n\ncommunication logs and that they dealt with the defendants' case,\n\nbut    had   argued    that    they   were     cumulative    of   other    evidence\n\npresented.      Here, Duval and Doucette have merely postulated a\n\ntheory that additional records of payment to Ramos or Dyott exist;\n\nalbeit a theory that was fostered by the Government's pattern of\n\nnon-disclosure.        While we emphasize that the Government's denial\n\nthat    additional     Brady    or    Jencks    Act   material    exists    is   not\n\ndispositive to our analysis, Duval and Doucette have not done much\n\nbetter than to take a shot in the dark.                This is insufficient to\n\nestablish the likelihood of a Brady violation, United States v.\n\nCaro-Muรฑiz, 406 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 2005), and as such is\n\ncertainly insufficient to require in camera review.\n\n             Second,    the    material      sought   in    Rosario-Peralta      was\n\nundisputably directly relevant to the key issue in the case: the\n\ntapes would either potentially reveal that the defendants' boat had\n\nbeen the one pursued or that the Government had, in fact, lost\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\ftrack of the boat in question.      In Duval and Doucette's case, even\n\nif there were an adequate showing that records of additional\n\npayments made to Ramos or Dyott existed, they would not bear\n\ndirectly on the guilt or innocence of either defendant.            Although\n\nthe records would have some utility as impeachment evidence, Duval\n\nand Doucette were already aware that Ramos and Dyott had accepted\n\npayments   from   the   ATF.4    Thus,    the   records   would   have    been\n\ncumulative of other evidence, and it is unclear that their addition\n\nwould have \"put the whole case in such a different light as to\n\nundermine confidence in the verdict.\"            Casas, 356 F.3d at 114.\n\nAccordingly, the court did not err in denying Duval and Doucette's\n\nrequest to review the Government's records.          See United States v.\n\nNelson-Rodrรญguez, 319 F.3d 12, 35 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that\n\nneither Brady nor the Jencks Act \"provides grounds for relief\n\nunless   the   exclusion   or   failure   to    produce   prejudiced     [the]\n\ndefense\").\n\n           In short, while we disapprove of the practice of belated\n\ndisclosures of Brady and Jencks Act material, we do not find that\n\nthe Government's conduct in this case was so prejudicial that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Our belief that Duval and Doucette were not prejudiced is\nbolstered by the fact that the known payments to Ramos were not\nused to impeach him at trial.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f            B. Use of the Adoptive Admission Against Duval\n\n            Duval's next claim of error concerns the district court's\n\ndecision to admit against him the testimony of Dyott, who claimed\n\nthat Doucette said that he and Duval wanted to sell firearms in\n\ntheir possession.         The Government claimed that Dyott's testimony\n\nimplicated Duval because Duval was present when the incriminating\n\nstatement was made yet did not attempt to disassociate himself from\n\nit, and thus was admissible as an adoptive admission by an opponent\n\nparty.    See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B).5              On January 27, 2005,\n\nDuval    filed   a   written   motion    to   exclude   the   use   of   Dyott's\n\ntestimony as inadmissible hearsay.              On February 4, 2005, the\n\ndistrict court denied Duval's pretrial motion without prejudice to\n\nits   renewal    during    trial.   At    the   Government's    request,    the\n\nstatement was admitted at trial.\n\n            While    the    admissibility     of   evidence    is   ordinarily\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion, United States v. Barrow, 448 F.3d\n\n37, 42 (1st Cir. 2006), we review the case at bar for plain error\n\nbecause Duval \"failed to interpose a contemporaneous objection\" at\n\ntrial.    Udemba v. Nicoli, 237 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 2001); see also\n\nUnited States v. Desimone, No. 05-2314, 2007 WL 1633556 at *5 (1st\n\nCir. June 7, 2007) (reviewing the admission of hearsay for plain\n\n\n\n5\n    The Government also claimed that Doucette's statement was\nadmissible as a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy. Because\nwe find this statement admissible as an adoptive admission, we need\nnot reach this issue.\n\n                                    -20-\n\ferror).     \"Under     the   plain   error     standard,    an    appellant         must\n\ndemonstrate that (1) there was an error; (2) the error was plain;\n\nand (3) the error affected substantial rights.\"                  United States v.\n\nTom, 330 F.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Johnson v. United\n\nStates, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997)).               In addition, the error must\n\nhave   \"seriously      affect[ed]    the     fairness,    integrity       or    public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"                Id. (quoting Johnson, 520\n\nU.S. at 466-67).\n\n            We have long recognized \"so-called adoptive admissions,\n\nincluding admissions by silence or acquiescence,\" as admissible\n\nagainst a party-opponent pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n801(d)(2)(B). United States v. Fortes, 619 F.2d 108, 115 (1st Cir.\n\n1980).    In United States v. Miller, we elaborated, stating that \"a\n\nparty's agreement with a fact stated by another may be inferred\n\nfrom (or 'adopted' by) silence . . . when (i) a statement is made\n\nin a party's presence, (ii) the nature of the statement is such\n\nthat it normally would induce the party to respond, and (iii) the\n\nparty nonetheless fails to take exception.\"               478 F.3d 48, 51 (1st\n\nCir.   2007).     Alleged     admissions       by    silence   may   be    properly\n\nsubmitted to the jury only if \"a reasonable jury could properly\n\nfind the ultimate fact in favor of the proponent of the evidence.\"\n\nUnited States v. Barletta, 652 F.2d 218, 219 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n            In   the    present      case,    Dyott     testified     as       to    the\n\nincriminating nature of Doucette's statement and placed Duval at\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fthe     scene   of   the   conversation.     Duval   argues   that   these\n\nfoundational facts -- which were proffered by the Government --\n\nwere insufficient to prove that he heard the statement, and thus\n\nfor it to be admitted as an adoptive admission.           While in some\n\ncases, the paucity of facts introduced at trial precludes any\n\nreasonably grounded finding of actual acquiescence, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Moore, 522 F.2d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 1975), we\n\nhave left the resolution of substantial yet conflicting testimony\n\nfor the jury, see, e.g., United States v. Wiseman, 814 F.2d 826,\n\n829 (1st Cir. 1987).       This same principle applies to cases in which\n\nthe facts give rise to conflicting but plausible inferences.\n\n            In the present case, the trial court properly found that\n\nthe Government laid an adequate foundation for the admission of\n\nDyott's testimony by offering testimony that the conversation\n\nbetween Dyott and Doucette took place in a small room, and that\n\nDuval was in that room, testimony from which it could be reasonably\n\ninferred that Duval heard Doucette's statements.          Although Duval\n\noffered the contrary testimony of Ramos, who stated that he did not\n\nhear the conversation between Dyott and Doucette, the ultimate\n\nquestion of whether to believe Ramos's testimony and to infer from\n\nit that Duval also did not hear Doucette was properly left to the\n\njury.    Because the court properly found that a foundation existed\n\nfor the admission of Dyott's testimony against Duval, we see no\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fbasis for concluding that the district court erred, plainly or\n\notherwise, in admitting his testimony against Duval.\n\n           C. Instructional Errors\n\n           Duval and Doucette argue that the court erred in denying\n\ntheir request for two jury instructions. First, Duval and Doucette\n\ncontend that the court erroneously denied their request to instruct\n\nthe jury on the sufficiency of evidence against them.               Second,\n\nDuval and Doucette argue that the court erred in refusing to give\n\ntheir   requested   instruction   on   the    elements   of   constructive\n\npossession.\n\n           The standard of review varies with respect to claims of\n\ninstructional error.     See United States v. Figueroa-Encarnaciรณn,\n\n343 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting this phenomenon).             Here,\n\nhowever, the claims of error are such that we review the denial of\n\nthe requested jury instructions for abuse of discretion.           Fryar v.\n\nCurtis, 485 F.3d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 2007).       In considering whether\n\nthe district court abused its discretion, we look to see whether\n\nthe   requested   instruction   was    \"(1)   correct    as   a   matter   of\n\nsubstantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge\n\nas rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.\"\n\nWhite v. N.H. Dept. of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                    1. The \"Constructive Possession\" Instruction\n\n           Duval and Doucette claim that the court's instructions on\n\nconstructive possession were insufficient because it failed to give\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\ftheir requested instruction that \"knowledge alone, however, is not\n\nenough to prove possession.         Similarly, mere presence in the\n\nvicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.\" Duval\n\nand Doucette suggest that by failing to give this instruction, the\n\njury was allowed to equate knowledge with possession, and that\n\nknowledge   alone   is   not   sufficient   to   establish   constructive\n\npossession.\n\n            Applying the three-factor test set forth in White, 221\n\nF.3d at 263, we note that there does not appear to be any dispute\n\nthat Duval and Doucette's requested instruction was correct as a\n\nmatter of law: mere presence in the vicinity of an object is\n\ninsufficient to prove constructive possession of that object, see\n\nUnited States v. Wight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir. 1992), and\n\nknowledge of an object's location, without more, is insufficient to\n\nestablish possession of that object, see United States v. McLean,\n\n409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]here must be some action,\n\nsome word, or some conduct that links the individual to the\n\ncontraband and indicates that he had some stake in it, some power\n\nover it.\" (quoting In re Sealed Case, 105 F.3d 1460, 1463 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997)).   Furthermore, there is little question that the issue\n\nof constructive possession was integral to the case.\n\n            The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying the requested instruction, however, because the law of\n\nconstructive possession was \"substantially incorporated into the\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fcharge as rendered.\"       White, 221 F.3d at 263.             We have said before\n\nthat a court is not obligated to \"follow the exact form and wording\n\nof the defendant's proposed instructions.\"                         United States v.\n\nGibson, 726 F.2d 869, 874 (1st Cir. 1984).                    Here, the court very\n\nclearly instructed the jury that to find constructive possession it\n\nneeded to find both \"power and intention to exercise control or\n\ndominion   and       control     over   something,\"          and     that   Defendants\n\n\"knowingly possessed the firearms and/or ammunition in question.\"\n\nThus, it is not the case that the jury was invited to convict based\n\non mere knowledge of the firearms; rather, the jury was plainly\n\ninstructed that it needed to find knowing possession.                       Because the\n\ncourt's instructions adequately expressed the law of constructive\n\npossession,     we    detect   no    error   in       its   denial    of    Defendant's\n\nrequested instruction.\n\n                       2. The \"Sufficiency\" Instruction\n\n           Duval and Doucette also argue that the court erred by\n\nrefusing to instruct the jurors that, \"if they do not believe Mr.\n\nDyott's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt [that Doucette had told\n\nDyott   about    the    stolen      guns],   .    .    .    they   must     acquit   the\n\ndefendant.\" As we have already explained, the court correctly gave\n\ndetailed instructions on the elements of the offenses with which\n\nDuval and Doucette were charged and a defendant is not entitled to\n\nan instruction \"on every particular that conceivably might be of\n\ninterest to the jury.\"         Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d at 567.\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\f           Nevertheless, Duval and Doucette put a new twist on their\n\nclaim, arguing that the requested instruction was necessary because\n\nthe prosecutor suggested on closing that, in fact, there was\n\nsufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony to convict Duval\n\nand Doucette. In analyzing this claim of prosecutorial misconduct,\n\nour first step is to determine whether the prosecutor did in fact\n\nmake \"improper statements\" to the jury on closing.                See United\n\nStates v. Lowe, 145 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 1998) (reaching other\n\nelements    of    test   for   prosecutorial       misconduct    only    after\n\ndetermining      that    statements    made   by    the     prosecutor   were\n\n\"improper\").\n\n           We set forth the standard for establishing constructive\n\npossession in Wight: the Government must show \"that the defendant\n\nhad dominion and control over the area where the contraband was\n\nfound.\"    968 F.2d at 1397.     While circumstantial evidence can be\n\nused to satisfy this burden, \"mere presence or association with\n\nanother who possessed the contraband is insufficient to establish\n\nconstructive possession,\"       id., nor is it sufficient to show only\n\nthat a defendant had access to the weapons, see United States v.\n\nKelso, 942 F.2d 680, 682 (9th Cir. 1991).                 \"[T]he ability and\n\nintent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm or area\n\nwhere it is located,\" however, is sufficient to support a finding\n\nof constructive possession.       United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d\n\n387, 399 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\f           The prosecutor argued to the jury that, even if they\n\ndisregarded Dyott's testimony (which had been heavily impeached at\n\ntrial), the remaining evidence was sufficient to convict.             Duval\n\nand Doucette argue that the Government's evidence was insufficient,\n\nas a matter of law, for the jury to infer constructive possession\n\nbecause apart from Dyott, there was no direct evidence that they\n\nknew that the firearms were in the trunk.             In support of this\n\nclaim, Duval and Doucette provide a litany of supposedly analogous\n\ncases in which findings of constructive possession were overturned.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Reece, 86 F.3d 994, 996 (10th Cir.\n\n1996) (holding that \"[w]here possession is not clear,\" constructive\n\npossession requires \"some nexus, link, or other connection between\n\nthe defendant and the contraband.\"); United States v. Soto, 779\n\nF.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. 1986) (\"It is well established that mere\n\npresence as a passenger in a car from which the police recover\n\nweapons does not establish possession.        The mere proximity of a\n\nweapon to a passenger in a car goes only to its accessibility, not\n\nto the dominion or control which must be proved to establish\n\npossession.\" (citations omitted)). Furthermore, Duval and Doucette\n\nemphasize that here the guns were hidden in the trunk of their car\n\nrather   than   in   the   passenger   compartment,    which   they   argue\n\ndistinguishes their situation from prior appeals where we upheld\n\njury inferences of constructive possession.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Liranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2004) (affirming\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdefendant's conviction where the \"precarious, angled position\" of\n\nweapon suggested it was stashed after car came to stop, and\n\ndefendant was only person observed moving.).     Lastly they aver\n\nthat, as in Kelso, access to a place where a firearm is located is\n\ninsufficient to infer knowledge that the firearm is there.      942\n\nF.2d at 682.    Absent Dyott's testimony, Duval and Doucette's\n\nargument goes, the Government did not offer sufficient evidence to\n\nprove that they were aware of the contents of the trunk.\n\n          We agree that the evidence could have supported a jury\n\ninference that Duval and Doucette did not constructively possess\n\nthe weapons.   However, that is not the question on appeal.     The\n\njury found Duval and Doucette guilty, and thus we must determine\n\nwhether, as a matter of law, the prosecutor was incorrect when he\n\nstated that the jury could infer from the evidence presented that\n\nDuval and Doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in\n\nthe trunk even if they disregarded Dyott.\n\n          We conclude that there was sufficient evidence apart from\n\nDyott's testimony for the jury to infer that Duval and Doucette\n\nconstructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk, and thus\n\nthat the prosecutor's arguments were not improper.         Like the\n\ndefendants in Liranzo, the evidence suggests Doucette and Duval\n\nexercised \"exclusive dominion and control over the location of the\n\ngun.\"   385 F.3d at 70.   Doucette had the keys when the two were\n\napprehended, Duval appeared to avoid opening the trunk upon sight\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fof police officers, and the guns were not in the car when it was\n\nstolen.      Although     much   of    the   Government's    evidence     was\n\ncircumstantial, we have held that circumstantial evidence may\n\nsupport a finding of constructive possession. United States v.\n\nMcFarland, 445 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Accordingly, this is not a situation where the evidence\n\nshowed only a defendant's \"mere proximity\" to weapons.             See Soto,\n\n779 F.2d at 560-61; United States v. Madkins, 994 F.2d 540, 542\n\n(8th Cir. 1993) (holding that it was unreasonable for a jury to\n\ninfer constructive possession of a weapon from the fact that the\n\ndefendant was found working under the hood of a car where the\n\nweapon was found).      Duval and Doucette's reliance on United States\n\nv. Blue, 957 F.2d 106 (4th Cir. 1992), is similarly misplaced.             In\n\nBlue, the Fourth Circuit overturned a conviction where the only\n\nevidence presented was the presence of a gun under the defendant-\n\npassenger's seat and testimony that the defendant dipped his\n\nshoulder as the police officer approached the vehicle. Id. at 107-\n\n08.   Here, not only was there evidence that guns were in the trunk\n\nof the stolen car and that Duval turned away from the trunk when he\n\nnoticed a police officer, but also that Doucette had the keys to\n\nthe trunk, that Duval and Doucette had stolen the car and had\n\nexclusive    possession    of    it    thereafter,   and    that   they   had\n\nsuspiciously registered under a false name at the Chelmsford motel,\n\nwhere the car and the guns were eventually found.           This quantum of\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fevidence was legally sufficient for the jury to infer that Duval\n\nand Doucette constructively possessed the weapons at issue.\n\n              Thus, because there was sufficient evidence apart from\n\nDyott's testimony that Defendants constructively possessed the\n\nweapons found in their car, we find no error in the denial of a\n\njury instruction to the contrary.\n\n              D. Constitutional Challenges to the ACCA\n\n              Duval and Doucette both argue that the Government's\n\nfailure to plead and prove their prior convictions to the jury\n\nrenders ACCA sentences invalid under the Sixth Amendment.                       We\n\nreview constitutional challenges to the ACCA de novo.                       United\n\nStates v. McKenney, 450 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              The   Supreme   Court    rejected   this      very   argument    in\n\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 247 (1998), and\n\nhas   since    reiterated     its   position   that   the   fact   of   a    prior\n\nconviction is exempt from the general rule that a jury must find\n\nany fact that raises a sentence above the statutorily-prescribed\n\nmaximum, see United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 244 (2005);\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).              We continue to\n\nbe bound by Supreme Court precedent on this point, and as such, we\n\nmust reject Duval and Doucette's Sixth Amendment challenge to the\n\nimposition of an ACCA sentence.          See, e.g., McKenney, 450 F.3d at\n\n46; United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 105 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\f              E. Duval's Challenges to the ACCA Sentence\n\n              In   addition     to   his    constitutional       arguments,    Duval\n\ncontends that he should not be subject to an ACCA sentence because\n\nhe has not been convicted of three violent felonies.                        The ACCA\n\nimposes a mandatory minimum sentence on defendants convicted of\n\n\"three previous convictions by any court . . . for a violent\n\nfelony.\"      18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(1).              A violent felony is defined as\n\n\"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\n\n.   .   .   [that]   has   as   an   element       the   use,   attempted   use,   or\n\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of another\n\n. . . or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\" Id. ยง 924(e)(2)(B).\n\nIn determining whether a conviction was for a violent felony, the\n\ntrial court may look \"only to the fact of conviction and the\n\nstatutory definition of the prior offense.\"                      Taylor v. United\n\nStates, 495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990).             In Shepard v. United States, the\n\nSupreme Court recognized that where a defendant had plead guilty to\n\na prior crime, a court could also examine a \"statement of factual\n\nbasis for the charge, shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by\n\nwritten plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of\n\ncomparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering\n\nthe plea.\"      544 U.S. 13, 20 (2005) (citation omitted).\n\n              There appears to be no dispute among the parties that\n\nDuval had been convicted of at least two violent felonies prior to\n\n\n                                           -31-\n\fhis conviction for the instant offense.       Thus, the dispute centers\n\naround Duval's third conviction, a conviction for assault and\n\nbattery under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 207, which provides\n\nin part that it shall be a crime for a person to \"intentionally,\n\nknowingly or recklessly cause[] bodily injury or offensive physical\n\ncontact   to   another   person.\"6     Ordinarily,   simple   assault   and\n\nbattery is punishable in Maine as a \"Class D\" offense, id., which\n\nprovides for a maximum sentence of up to one year in prison, id.\n\nยง 1252(2). However, because Duval had previously been convicted of\n\ntwo misdemeanor assaults, he was sentenced under Maine's recidivist\n\noffender statute, making Duval's conviction a \"Class C\" offense,\n\nid., which provided for a maximum sentence of five years in prison,\n\nid. ยง 1252 (4-A).    Duval offers two arguments as to why his third\n\nconviction should not qualify as a violent felony for the purposes\n\nof the ACCA.\n\n                    1. The Recidivist Sentencing Enhancement\n\n           First, Duval argues that because assault is usually\n\npunishable as a Class D felony with a maximum term of less than one\n\nyear in prison, his conviction was for a misdemeanor, and thus not\n\na \"felony,\" even though the sentence he received was five years\n\nbecause of Maine's recidivist sentencing statute. Thus, Duval asks\n\n\n6\n    Because we are unaware of additional information regarding\nDuval's conviction that could be considered under Shepard, we must\nrely only on the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of\nthe crime for which Duval has been convicted. See United States v.\nWalter, 434 F.3d 30, 38 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                     -32-\n\fus to decide whether the word \"crime\" as used in 18 U.S.C. ยง 924\n\n(e)(2)(B) means criminal conduct (assault) or criminal conduct in\n\ncombination with certain attendant circumstances (assault plus\n\nrecidivism). We ordinarily review de novo a claim that a defendant\n\nis not subject to the ACCA de novo.        United States v. Mastera, 435\n\nF.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              This question is a novel one in this circuit, but has\n\nbeen addressed by other courts.            Duval urges us to adopt the\n\nreasoning of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Corona-Sรกnchez,\n\n291 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc).           In Corona-Sรกnchez, the\n\nNinth Circuit held that under Taylor's categorical approach, the\n\nproper analysis for determining whether a crime was a \"felony\"\n\nwould be to \"consider the sentence available for the crime itself,\n\nwithout considering separate recidivist sentencing enhancements.\"\n\nId. at 1209.     Thus, the Ninth Circuit found that a prior conviction\n\nfor   petty    theft   in   California,   which   provides   for   a   maximum\n\nsentence of six months, Cal. Penal Code ยง 490, could not be a\n\nfelony conviction even though the defendant had been subject to\n\nCalifornia's repeat offender statute which increased the maximum\n\nterm to one year, id. ยง 666.         Corona-Sรกnchez, 291 F.3d at 1210.\n\nAlso supporting Duval's position is a line of decisions which hold\n\nthat the ACCA, itself a recidivist sentencing statute, does not\n\nalter the nature of the underlying offense, but simply changes the\n\nsentencing structure for it.       See, e.g., United States v. McGatha,\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\f891 F.2d 1520, 1521-25 (11th Cir. 1990) (concluding that the ACCA\n\nis simply a sentencing enhancement provision); United States v.\n\nRumney, 867 F.2d 714, 718 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"[T]he three felonies\n\nprovision is for sentence enhancement and is not an element of a\n\nheightened crime.\").\n\n            The Government, on the other hand, urges us to adopt the\n\nreasoning of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits.                    In Mutascu v.\n\nGonzรกles, the Fifth Circuit found that where a defendant had been\n\npreviously convicted and sentenced under California's recidivist\n\nsentencing statute, the ultimate conviction was not merely for\n\n\"petty theft,\" but rather for \"petty theft with prior jail term.\"\n\n444 F.3d 710, 712 (5th Cir. 2006).             Thus, the Fifth Circuit refused\n\nto   \"atomize\"   a     sentence    into    its     recidivist    and    predicate\n\ncomponents, and held instead that the relevant sentence for the\n\npurposes of determining whether a crime was a felony was the\n\nsentence \"ordered by a court of law.\"             Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101\n\n(a)(48)(B)).         Likewise,    the    Seventh     Circuit    has    held   that\n\nrecidivist sentencing statutes may be used to determine the maximum\n\nsentence for a prior conviction when deciding whether a prior drug\n\nconviction constituted a \"serious drug offense\" for the purposes of\n\nthe ACCA.   United States v. Henton, 374 F.3d 467, 469-70 (7th Cir.\n\n2004).   The Fourth Circuit has suggested a similar conclusion,\n\nalthough it noted that the maximum sentence imposable under a\n\nrecidivist sentencing statute might depend on compliance with\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fadditional safeguards codified in state law.             United States v.\n\nWilliams, 326 F.3d 535, 539-40 (4th Cir. 2003).\n\n            The parties also point to recent Supreme Court decisions\n\non sentencing issues to support their positions.         In Apprendi, the\n\nSupreme Court very explicitly stated that \"recidivism 'does not\n\nrelate to the commission of the offense' itself.\"         530 U.S. at 496\n\n(quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U.S. at 230).         Duval contends that\n\nthis statement supports his argument that his recidivist sentence\n\nwas the product of a sentencing enhancement and not a change in the\n\nunderlying    offense.      The    Government   points   us   to   Ewing   v.\n\nCalifornia, in which the Court, reviewing California's recidivist\n\nsentencing statute, explained that the petitioner had not been\n\nconvicted of \"merely 'shoplifting three golf clubs.' Rather, Ewing\n\nwas convicted of felony grand theft for stealing nearly $1,200\n\nworth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at\n\nleast two 'violent' or 'serious' felonies.\"              538 U.S. 11, 28\n\n(2003).     This, the Government argues, supports its argument that\n\nrecidivist sentencing statutes in effect create new \"recidivist\n\ncrimes,\"    which   might   be    construed   as   felonies   even   if    the\n\nunderlying offense was a misdemeanor.\n\n            These arguments highlight two conundrums.         The first is\n\nthat   by   using   state-law     definitions   of   crimes   to   determine\n\nsentencing on federal offenses, Congress may have allowed states to\n\ndisturb the balance struck in the ACCA: repeat offenders would be\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fsubject to higher sentences, but only if they had committed three\n\nviolent felonies.     For example, it appears that under Maine's\n\nrecidivist sentencing statute, a person might be convicted of three\n\nviolent \"felonies\" (and thus sentenced under the ACCA) even if he\n\nhad only been twice convicted of certain felony offenses (robbery)\n\nand once of a misdemeanor offense (assault).            This would seem to\n\ndisturb Congress's determination that the ACCA should be applied\n\nonly to hardened criminals, i.e., those who have committed three\n\n(rather than two) crimes whose nature is so serious that they are\n\npunishable as felonies.\n\n           Second,   this   case   highlights    the     ambiguous    status\n\naccorded to recidivist sentencing statutes. The Government asks us\n\nto classify Duval's third offense as \"recidivist assault,\" an\n\noffense that is different than non-recidivist assault. However, in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court's holding in Apprendi that a maximum\n\nsentence may not be raised based on elements of the offense not\n\npleaded and proven to a jury, 530 U.S. at 490, this calls into\n\nquestion   Almendarez-Torres's      holding     that,    in   fact,    prior\n\nconvictions need not be proven to a jury before they are used to\n\nincrease a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. 523 U.S. at 239-\n\n247 (rejecting argument that recidivism is an element of a crime\n\nthat needs to be plead and proven to a jury); see Rangel-Reyes v.\n\nUnited States, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 2874 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting\n\n\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\ffrom   denial       of   certiorari)   (urging     the    Court     to   overrule\n\nAlmendarez-Torres for this reason).\n\n              In spite of the difficult questions that the Government's\n\nposition presents, we are ultimately persuaded that logic and\n\nprecedent support the conclusion that Duval was convicted of\n\n\"recidivist assault,\" and thus was convicted of a felony.                  First,\n\nalthough Apprendi stated that recidivism did not necessarily relate\n\nto the commission of an offense, 530 U.S. at 496, this does not\n\nmean   that    an    offense   could   not    be   defined   with    respect   to\n\nrecidivism.      In fact, since Apprendi was decided, Ewing construed\n\na   conviction      under   California's      repeat     offender    statute   as\n\nrecidivist theft, 538 U.S. at 28, and more recently, in Lรณpez v.\n\nGonzรกles, the Court noted that state drug possession statutes\n\ncorrespond to federal drug statutes, including \"possession of\n\ncocaine base and recidivist possession,\"             127 S. Ct. 625, 630 n.6\n\n(2006) (emphasis added). We acknowledge that these holdings create\n\nsome tension with Almendarez-Torres, but as Justice Thomas noted in\n\nhis dissent from denial of certiorari in Rangel-Reyes, the Supreme\n\nCourt is \"the only court authorized to\" overturn that decision.\n\n126 S. Ct. at 2875.\n\n              Furthermore, although there are some anomalies in having\n\nMaine's recidivist offender statute affect the operation of the\n\nACCA's recidivist offender scheme, this is not a unique situation.\n\nA single conviction in Maine for simple assault is ordinarily not\n\n\n                                       -37-\n\ftreated as a felony for ACCA purposes because it carries a penalty\n\nof less than one year, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยงยง 207,\n\n1252(2),     whereas    a    conviction   for   the    exact   same   conduct     in\n\nMassachusetts would be treated as a felony because Massachusetts\n\nlaw punishes assault by up to two and a half years, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 265, ยง 13A(a).          Moreover, states use different characteristics\n\nto categorize the same crimes as felonies or misdemeanors.                  Maine\n\nmakes assault a felony if it is accomplished with the use of a\n\nfirearm, see State v. Gilbert, 473 A.2d 1273, 1275 n.1 (Me. 1984)\n\n(\"Criminal threatening is a Class D crime, which, when committed\n\nwith   use   of   a    dangerous    weapon,     is    enhanced   to   a   Class    C\n\noffense.\"), whereas Oregon uses the presence of a victim's minor\n\nchild to turn a simple assault into a felony, see United States v.\n\nMoreno-Hernรกndez, 419 F.3d 906, 910, 915 (9th Cir. 2005) (also\n\nnoting that a conviction with such an enhancement would qualify as\n\na felony crime of violence).          It appears that Congress implicitly\n\naccepted such inconsistencies in the application of the ACCA\n\nbecause it was concerned about federalism and wanted to preserve\n\nthe    state's    role       in   defining,     enforcing,     and    prosecuting\n\nessentially local crimes:\n\n             In \"enhancing\" this [federal firearms] offense\n             with [ACCA]-type sanctions, if the defendant\n             has been convicted three times of robbery or\n             burglary, we are \"enhancing\" an existing\n             Federal crime, which would alleviate many of\n             the problems associated with [the ACCA] such\n             as the issue of a local D.A. veto or the\n             difficulties encountered by Federal courts in\n\n                                       -38-\n\f              applying State robbery and burglary laws in\n              Federal prosecutions.\n\nH.R.

We\n\ncan    only   assume   that     Congress   thought    that    these    federalism\n\nconcerns would outweigh whatever inconsistencies arose.\n\n              In addition, as one of the dissents in Corona-Sรกnchez\n\npointed out:\n\n              Raising an offense from a misdemeanor to a\n              felony has effects far beyond the extra time\n              defendant might serve. While employers may be\n              willing to overlook a misdemeanor in potential\n              employees, they are much less likely to hire\n              convicted felons, especially for positions of\n              trust and responsibility. Suffering a felony\n              conviction, rather than a misdemeanor, can\n              also   have   serious   effects  on    personal\n              relationships and reputation in the community.\n              Moreover, under [California] law, felons\n              suffer   a   variety    of   limitations    and\n              disabilities   that   misdemeanants   do   not.\n              Misdemeanor sentences are served in local\n              jails, while felony time is spent in state\n              prison. For the rest of their lives, felons\n              (but not misdemeanants) are denied the right\n              to vote . . . and the right to bear arms.\n\nCorona-Sรกnchez, 291 F.3d at 1219 (Kozinski, J., dissenting in part\n\nand concurring in part) (internal citations omitted). So too here.\n\nSee,    e.g.,   Me.    Rev.     Stat.   Ann.   tit.   17-A,   ยง   1252(1)(A)(2)\n\n(specifying that a class C felon sentenced to more than nine months\n\nin jail are committed to the Department of Corrections); Me. Rev.\n\nStat.

Ann. tit. 28-A, ยง 653(2)(A) (listing\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fClass C felony conviction as a ground for denying liquor license).\n\nIt   would   be   unusual   if    a   court   could   not   consider   Duval's\n\nconviction as a felony for the ACCA when Maine law would recognize\n\nit as such for state-law purposes.\n\n             If Congress finds fault in the pattern of inconsistent\n\nsentences mandated by the ACCA, it is within its power to amend it.\n\nHowever, as it presently stands, the ACCA defines a felony as \"any\n\ncrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(2)(B).         Because Duval was convicted of a crime\n\nwhich provided for punishment of up to five years, he has been\n\nconvicted of a felony for the purposes of the ACCA.\n\n                    2. Is Assault a Violent Crime in Maine?\n\n             Duval also argues for the first time on appeal that even\n\nif his assault conviction was for a felony, it was not for a\n\nviolent crime.     Duval argues that because the charging documents\n\nand plea agreement provide no indication as to the nature of the\n\nassault that he committed, we must find that he engaged in the\n\nminimum level of culpable conduct punishable under the assault\n\nstatute, i.e., \"recklessly causing offensive physical contact,\" and\n\nthat this conduct would not qualify as a violent crime.                Because\n\nDuval did not raise this objection to his sentence below, we review\n\nthat objection for plain error. United States v. Bennett, 469 F.3d\n\n46, 51 (1st Cir. 2006).          Plain error requires that the defendant\n\nshow that \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\fobvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                    Id. (quoting United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n             We   detect       no   plain   error     in     the   district    court's\n\ndetermination     that     a    conviction       in   Maine    for   simple   assault\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of the ACCA.                       In\n\nUnited States v. Nason, we explicitly stated that \"both variants of\n\nassault regulated under Maine's general-purpose assault statute\n\nnecessarily involve the use of physical force,\" and concluded that\n\na conviction in Maine for simple assault qualified as a crime of\n\ndomestic violence for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(9).                      269\n\nF.3d 10, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).                Nason is the only case cited by\n\neither party to have interpreted the Maine assault and battery\n\nstatute, and we cannot distinguish it in any meaningful way from\n\nthe circumstances of Duval's case.               Until such time as we revisit\n\nNason en banc, see United States v. Allen, 469 F.3d 11, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (noting that, absent extraordinary circumstances, three-\n\njudge panels are bound by prior circuit panel decisions), we are\n\nbound   to    apply   its       holding     that      even    \"offensive      contact\"\n\nconstitutes a violent felony under Maine's assault and battery\n\nstatute.7\n\n\n7\n   Although my colleagues would prefer not to address the issue, I\nconsider that circuit law on this point is in some disarray. We\nhave strongly suggested that a conviction under the Massachusetts\n\n                                          -41-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nassault and battery statute -- which is similar to the Maine\nstatute -- would not constitute a crime of violence for purposes of\nthe ACCA absent evidence that the conviction was for a \"violent\"\nassault, rather than for an offensive contact. See United States\nv. Mangos, 134 F.3d 460, 464 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that the\nMassachusetts assault and battery statute \"involves different types\nof offenses, some arguably violent and some not\"); United States v.\nFernรกndez, 121 F.3d 777, 779 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[B]oth violent and\nnon-violent conduct is covered by the [Massachusetts assault and\nbattery] statute.\"). I think that the circuit might do better to\nresolve this disarray in light of the fact that the imposing a\nsentence under ACCA often makes a world of difference to the amount\nof prison time a defendant receives. See James v. United States,\n127 S. Ct. 1586, 1602 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Imprecision\nand indeterminacy are particularly inappropriate in the application\nof a criminal statute.     Years of prison hinge on the scope of\nACCA's residual provision, yet its boundaries are ill defined.\").\n\n                               -42-\n\f",

Duval and Michael R. Doucette were each convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1). Duval and Doucette now appeal their convictions and sentences. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On January 27, 2003, Heath Woodward, then a resident of Sanford, Maine, reported that his 1996 maroon Buick was stolen from a convenience store parking lot. Woodward later testified that he did not have any weapons in the car at that time.</p>\n<p>In late January, Duval, Doucette, and Carlos Ramos (an acquaintance of Duval and Doucette) spent a few nights at an apartment rented by Robert Dyott. Dyott was an associate of Ramos and unbeknownst to his guests, an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"ATF\"). Dyott would later testify that while staying at his apartment, Doucette said that he and Duval had stolen a car from a convenience store and that they had some weapons in the trunk of that car that they wanted to \"move\" (<i>i.e.,</i> sell). Dyott also testified that Duval and Ramos were in the room when Doucette said this, and that Duval did not disavow Doucette's statement. According to Dyott, Doucette also said that he and Duval were going to stay at a hotel the following night.</p>\n<p>On January 31, 2003, a guest identifying himself as \"Carlos Ramos\" registered at the Chelmsford Best Western for himself and a guest named \"Paul Santos.\" They were assigned room 102. In filling out the registration form, \"Ramos\" identified his car as a \"96 maroon Buick.\" That same night, a call was placed from Room 102 to a cell phone provided to Dyott by the ATF.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 2003, Dyott spoke with Daniel Meade, an ATF Agent, and told him that there was a stolen car with weapons at the Chelmsford Best Western. The ATF notified the Chelmsford police department, which sent Officers Tyros and Tine, joined by Agent Meade, to the Best Western to investigate the suspected stolen vehicle. Officer Tyros watched as a Caucasian male, later identified as Duval, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> walked toward a maroon Buick carrying a black object, and paused briefly by the trunk of the car. Tyros testified that Duval noticed his presence and walked back to room 102.</p>\n<p>Later that day, Agent Meade encountered Duval and Doucette as they walked towards a gas station near the motel and asked them to identify themselves. Upon learning their identities, Agent Meade arrested Duval and Doucette on outstanding warrants. Meade found the keys to the stolen Buick in Doucette's front pocket. A search of the car revealed a Remington rifle, a Remington shotgun, a Marlin rifle, and ammunition inside the trunk. Investigators found no fingerprints in the trunk, on the firearms, or the ammunition. However, Duval's and Doucette's prints were recovered from objects found in the passenger compartment.</p>\n<p>On June 19, 2003, a complaint was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Duval and Doucette each with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g). The Government filed an indictment against Duval and Doucette on September 3, 2003. Both Duval and Doucette pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to comply with Local Rule 116.1(c)(1) and <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the Government initially disclosed to Duval and Doucette in October 2003 that it would call Dyott to testify at trial, and that Dyott was a Government informant. The Government stated that Dyott had not been paid for his cooperation and that there was no evidence that would otherwise cast doubt on his credibility. But two months later, the Government informed Duval and Doucette that Dyott had been paid $5,150 for his cooperation since 1998. Then, in February 2004, the Government sent a letter to Duval and Doucette stating that in 1998, it had dropped firearms charges against Dyott in exchange for his cooperation. Eight months after that, the Government added that it had discovered that Dyott had been paid an additional $600 in 1998 and 1999, and that Dyott had a long history of mental illness.</p>\n<p>On January 10, 2005, the Government moved to supplement its witness list to include Carlos Ramos, the acquaintance of Duval and Doucette who had allegedly rented the motel room for them. The Government disclosed in a letter to Duval and Doucette that Ramos had a history of drug abuse, and had once cooperated with the Government by making a \"controlled buy.\" The following week, on January 19, the Government sent a second letter to Duval and Doucette stating that Ramos had told the Government that he did not see any guns or hear either defendant make any reference to guns, and that Ramos had told Agent Meade in 2003 that he had no knowledge of a stolen car. Other than this disclosure, the Government indicated that it had no additional exculpatory information regarding Ramos.</p>\n<p>Two days later, on January 21, 2005, the Government sent another letter to Duval and Doucette. This time, the letter stated that the Government did have exculpatory information regarding Ramos, specifically that Ramos was offered leniency for his participation in the firearms transaction in exchange for becoming an informant. The letter also stated that Agent Meade had interviewed Ramos in February 2003, but that Meade had not made any notes of the interview. The letter stated that Meade had asked Ramos about his renting a hotel room for Duval and Doucette, but that he did not recall if he asked Ramos whether he was in the room with Dyott, Duval, and Doucette in late January when Doucette was alleged to have offered to sell Dyott <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> weapons. The Government continued to assert that Ramos had not been paid for his cooperation on the Duval and Doucette case. On January 31, 2005, the Government sent yet another letter to Duval and Doucette, amending its prior disclosure to add that Ramos had in fact attempted to make at least three or four controlled purchases for the ATF, and that Meade had given him money to buy telephone calling cards. On the sixth day of the trial ย February 14, 2005 ย the Government disclosed to Duval and Doucette, seemingly contrary to prior claims that Ramos had not been paid in connection with the present case, that an entry on the ATF payment roster indicated that Ramos had been paid $50 for \"informant subsistence.\" The entry included a reference to \"Ducette [sic] &amp; Duval.\"</p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette moved to dismiss the indictment because of a pattern of Government non-compliance with its disclosure obligations. The Government opposed the dismissal of the indictment, contending that neither Duval nor Doucette had suffered prejudice as a result of the belated disclosures. The court denied the motion to dismiss, stating that the Government had violated its <i>Brady</i> obligations, but that neither Duval nor Doucette were prejudiced.</p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette also requested that the Government provide the records of each individual payment to Dyott and Ramos so they could determine if the Government had failed to disclose any other payments to the witnesses. Instead, the Government provided Duval and Doucette a summary of the payments made to Dyott. Duval and Doucette claimed that the summary was insufficient given the history of belated disclosures by the Government, and asked the court to compel production of the payment records, or in the alternative, to review the records <i>in camera,</i> in order to determine whether any additional payments had been made to Dyott or Ramos. The court denied the request.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, Duval moved to exclude as inadmissible hearsay Dyott's testimony that Doucette had offered firearms for sale. The court denied Duval's motion to exclude without prejudice, ruling that he could raise it again at trial if the Government failed to show that Doucette's statement was either a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy or an adoptive admission by Duval.</p>\n<p>The jury trial of Duval and Doucette began on February 7, 2005, and lasted eight days. At trial, Dyott testified that he had met with Duval, Doucette, and Ramos in late January, that Doucette had told him that he had firearms to sell, and that Duval said nothing when he heard this. Dyott also disclosed on direct examination his past and present drug habits, mental illness, and criminal history. Duval and Doucette cross-examined Dyott as to his cooperation with the ATF and payments that he received. In addition, both Ramos and Agent Meade testified, along with various other witnesses.</p>\n<p>During closing arguments, the Government noted that Duval had been within fifteen miles of the location where the Buick was stolen, that the Buick did not have firearms or ammunition in it when it was stolen, that the Buick was later found at the hotel where Duval and Doucette were staying, that Duval had suspiciously approached the vehicle but turned away when he saw the police, that Doucette had the keys to the vehicle, and that the trunk contained firearms and ammunition. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> Government then stated, \"[Y]ou can stop right there . . . because that evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that [Duval and Doucette] were in knowing possession [of the firearms and ammunition]. But there's more.\" The Government then noted that Dyott had testified that Doucette had admitted to possessing the firearms, and that Duval had remained silent. The Government acknowledged Dyott's substantial credibility problems but said, \"Take Mr. Dyott's testimony, discount it altogether. . . . [T]here is still no reasonable doubt that these men possessed those guns and that ammunition.\" Duval and Doucette then gave their closing arguments. Duval suggested that \"the Government cannot get around the testimony of Robert Dyott. [If] Robert Dyott's testimony [is] not in this case, there is no case.\" Doucette stated, \"[I]f you don't believe Mr. Dyott's testimony about a conversation he claims to have heard January 31st of 2003, if you don't believe his testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, you cannot convict in this case.\"</p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette then asked the court to give two instructions to the jury. First, they asked the court to instruct the jury that, \"if [you] do not believe Mr. Dyott's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt [about his alleged conversation with Doucette], [you] must acquit the defendant.\" Second, Duval and Doucette asked the court to instruct the jury that \"[o]ne cannot be found guilty of possessing an object unless he has knowledge of its presence. Knowledge alone, however, is not enough to prove possession. Similarly, mere presence in the vicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.\" The court refused both instructions, and instead instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>To possess something means to have control or dominion and control over something. It is not necessarily the same as legal ownership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The law recognizes different kinds of possession. Possession includes both actual and constructive possession. A person who has direct, physical control of something on or around his person is in actual possession of it. A person who is not in actual possession but who has the-both the power and intention to exercise control or dominion and control over something is in constructive possession of it. So whenever I use the word \"possession\" in these instructions, I mean both actual and constructive possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In considering the issue of possession in this case it is not necessary for you to conclude that a defendant in this case was in actual or constructive possession of the firearm and/or ammunition for a specified period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>More than one person can have control over the same firearms and/or ammunition. If this is so, then these people have what is called joint possession. For purposes of determining a defendant's guilt, joint possession is not different from sole possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>While you may consider a defendant's proximity to the firearms and/or ammunition in deciding whether the government has established beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed those items, mere proximity to the firearm and/or ammunition or mere presence of a defendant in the place where the firearm and/or ammunition were found is insufficient by itself to support a finding of possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Government must also establish beyond a reasonable doubt as to each defendant that he knowingly possessed the firearms and/or ammunition in question. The word \"knowingly\" means that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of ignorance, mistake, or accident. Thus, in order to convict a defendant, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was in possession of a firearm and/or ammunition and that he knew that what he possessed was a firearm and/or ammunition as we commonly use these words.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury convicted both Duval and Doucette on the sole count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Presentence reports were prepared for both defendants, suggesting that they were subject to the Armed Career Criminals Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e), which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years on any person convicted of a firearms charge who has been previously convicted of three violent felonies. Neither Duval's nor Doucette's prior convictions were alleged before the jury, and the jury made no finding as to them.</p>\n<p>Both Duval and Doucette challenged the court's ability to impose a sentence under the ACCA unless the predicate convictions had been proven to a jury. In addition, Duval stated that one of the predicate convictions being used to support his eligibility for an ACCA sentence, a conviction for assault and battery under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 207(1)(A), was neither a violent crime nor a felony. The court rejected Duval's and Doucette's arguments and found them both to be subject to the ACCA because they had each been convicted of three prior felonies. The court imposed a sentence of 180 months on Duval and 204 months on Doucette.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette appeal their convictions on the ground that the Government failed to meet its obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence under <i>Brady,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, and the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3500(b). In addition, Duval argues that Dyott's testimony as to Doucette's statement during the January 30, 2003 meeting should not have been admitted against him because it was inadmissible hearsay. Duval and Doucette both challenge the district court's failure to give their requested jury instructions regarding the elements of constructive possession and the sufficiency of the evidence against them. Duval and Doucette also bring a Sixth Amendment challenge to their ACCA-mandated sentences. Finally, Doucette argues that he has not been convicted of three violent felonies, and thus is not subject to sentencing under the ACCA. We discuss each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Government's Disclosure Obligations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette argue that the Government failed to comply with its obligations under <i>Brady</i> and the Jencks Act to disclose exculpatory and impeaching evidence regarding Dyott and Ramos and that it should have been sanctioned accordingly. In addition, because of the belated disclosure that Ramos had been paid for his cooperation with the ATF, Duval and Doucette suggest that the Government may have failed to disclose additional payments made to Dyott and Ramos, and they argue that they were entitled to <i>in camera</i> review of the Government's records of payments to confidential informants. We review the district court's denial of sanctions and <i>in camera</i> review for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 289 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>In <i>Brady v. Maryland</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor has a duty to disclose, upon request, \"evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> favorable to an accused . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194; <i>see also </i><i>Giglio v. United States,</i> 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (reversing a conviction where the Government failed to disclose that it had granted immunity to a witness upon whose testimony the Government's case was heavily dependent). Likewise, under the Jencks Act, the prosecution has an obligation to \"provide, upon request, certain prior statements made by trial witnesses . . . that . . . `relate [] to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.'\" <i>United States v. Schneiderhan,</i> 404 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. ยง 3500(b)). To vacate a conviction because of a <i>Brady</i> violation, a defendant must show that \"the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\" <i>United States v. Casas,</i> 356 F.3d 104, 114 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 153 (1st Cir.2000)). The test for a Jencks Act violation is similar; we look to see whether the Government failed to disclose prior statements by witnesses that relate to their testimony at trial, and whether the nondisclosure was prejudicial. <i>Schneiderhan,</i> 404 F.3d at 79. \"When the issue is one of delayed disclosure rather than of nondisclosure, however, the test is whether defendant's counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant's case.\" <i>United States v. Ingraldi,</i> 793 F.2d 408, 411-12 (1st Cir.1986); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Arboleda,</i> 929 F.2d 858, 864 (1st Cir.1991) (applying <i>Ingraldi</i> to allegations that the Government belatedly disclosed Jencks Act materials).</p>\n<p>We begin by noting that the Government's conduct during the course of this prosecution was a clear violation of its <i>Brady</i> and Jencks Act obligations. The Government \"amended\" its disclosures of potentially exculpatory evidence no less than five times, each time disclosing information that further cast doubt on the testimony of Dyott and Ramos, two of the Government's principal witnesses at trial. At least part of the problem appears to have been that the ATF agent involved in the investigation kept scant notes on conversations with Ramos that tended to exculpate his prime suspects, Duval and Doucette ย a practice whose propriety is questionable.<sup>[2]</sup> Another part of the problem appears to have been shoddy record-keeping by the ATF with regard to payments to confidential informants. Finally, overly broad statements by the Government that all exculpatory information had been disclosed may have led Duval and Doucette to believe that the Government had in fact disclosed all that it knew, when it had not. Whether the late disclosures were the product of happenstance or of negligence is unclear, but we take this opportunity to remind prosecutors that disclosure of <i>Brady</i> and Jencks Act material is not a suggestion, but a constitutional and statutory obligation.</p>\n<p>We are mindful that not all convictions must be vacated because of non-compliance with disclosure obligations; we must also determine whether the late-disclosed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> information prejudiced Duval and Doucette's ability to present their case. The first set of evidence belatedly disclosed by the Government was impeachment evidence regarding Dyott, namely that he had been treated for mental illness and had been paid $5,750 and given leniency in a prior case in exchange for his services as a confidential informant. This information falls within the purview of <i>Brady</i> because it could be used to impeach the reliability and motivation of Dyott's testimony. However, the last of these disclosures occurred in October 2004, nearly six months before the start of the trial. This left sufficient time for Duval's and Doucette's counsel to incorporate the information into their defense strategy. While we do not condone the lateness of these disclosures, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the lateness did not prejudice Duval and Doucette in the preparation of their cases, and that sanctions were not warranted.</p>\n<p>The second set of late disclosures involved statements by Ramos to Agent Meade that he had not heard Dyott and Doucette discussing the arms sale; this statement falls within the scope of material that must be disclosed under <i>Brady</i> because it casts doubt on both the Government's claim that the conversation occurred, and the claim that Duval heard the statement and adopted the implicit admission of criminal activity by remaining silent. It also falls within the ambit of the Jencks Act, as it is a prior statement by a witness that relates to his trial testimony. However, as the Government points out, Ramos remained missing until January 2005, and it is unclear that Duval and Doucette could have located him before then. Furthermore, Ramos admitted during cross-examination that he had told Meade that he did not remember hearing anything about the sale of arms at the motel, and that he did not tell Meade anything about the stolen car when they met in February 2003. Thus, even assuming that Doucette and Duval could have located Ramos before that time and interviewed him regarding his statement, it is unclear what benefit this would have been to the defense strategy. <i>See </i><i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 115 (finding no prejudice where defense counsel had an opportunity to cross-examine witness about belatedly disclosed cooperation agreement). Again, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that neither Duval nor Doucette were prejudiced by the late disclosure of Ramos's statement, and thus that sanctions were therefore not warranted.</p>\n<p>Finally, Duval and Doucette point to the mid-trial disclosure that the Government may have paid Ramos $50 in connection with his cooperation in another case. The Government has stated that it has no further records of payment, but Duval and Doucette, having observed a pattern of delayed disclosures, suggest otherwise. Thus, Duval and Doucette suggest that the proper remedy for this late disclosure is to give them the opportunity to examine the Government's confidential informant payment records to determine if other payments have been made to Ramos.<sup>[3]</sup> In the alternative, Duval and Doucette propose that we direct the court to engage in an <i>in camera</i> review of the records to determine whether additional exculpatory material exists. Duval and Doucette suggest that their case is similar to <i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d 48 (1st Cir. 1999). In that case, various Government agencies had been pursuing a boat at sea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> that was observed dumping drugs overboard. <i>Id.</i> at 50-51. The principal defense theory was that the pursuing vessels had lost track of the boat engaged in the dumping, and that they had mistakenly seized the defendants' boat instead. <i>Id.</i> at 55. Accordingly, the defendants requested communication logs from the Government, which they argued would conclusively establish that their boat could not have been the same boat observed dumping drugs overboard. <i>Id.</i> at 54. We noted that the information in the logs was \"critical to defendants' theory and was a disputed issue at trial,\" and that \"we do not see how [the logs] could fail to be relevant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55. Thus, we ordered <i>in camera</i> review of the logs to determine whether they contained potentially exculpatory evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 57.</p>\n<p>Two principal differences between the present case and <i>Rosario-Peralta</i> support our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order <i>in camera</i> review of the Government's payment logs. First, the defendants in <i>Rosario-Peralta</i> made a clear showing that the evidence they sought in fact existed; the Government had acknowledged the existence of the communication logs and that they dealt with the defendants' case, but had argued that they were cumulative of other evidence presented. Here, Duval and Doucette have merely postulated a theory that additional records of payment to Ramos or Dyott exist; albeit a theory that was fostered by the Government's pattern of non-disclosure. While we emphasize that the Government's denial that additional <i>Brady</i> or Jencks Act material exists is not dispositive to our analysis, Duval and Doucette have not done much better than to take a shot in the dark. This is insufficient to establish the likelihood of a <i>Brady</i> violation, <i>United States v. Caro-Muรฑiz,</i> 406 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir.2005), and as such is certainly insufficient to require <i>in camera</i> review.</p>\n<p>Second, the material sought in <i>Rosario-Peralta</i> was undisputably directly relevant to the key issue in the case: the tapes would either potentially reveal that the defendants' boat had been the one pursued or that the Government had, in fact, lost track of the boat in question. In Duval and Doucette's case, even if there were an adequate showing that records of additional payments made to Ramos or Dyott existed, they would not bear directly on the guilt or innocence of either defendant. Although the records would have some utility as impeachment evidence, Duval and Doucette were already aware that Ramos and Dyott had accepted payments from the ATF.<sup>[4]</sup> Thus, the records would have been cumulative of other evidence, and it is unclear that their addition would have \"put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 114. Accordingly, the court did not err in denying Duval and Doucette's request to review the Government's records. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Nelson-Rodrรญguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 35 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that neither <i>Brady</i> nor the Jencks Act \"provides grounds for relief unless the exclusion or failure to produce prejudiced [the] defense\").</p>\n<p>In short, while we disapprove of the practice of belated disclosures of <i>Brady</i> and Jencks Act material, we do not find that the Government's conduct in this case was so prejudicial that the district court abused its discretion in denying sanctions.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Use of the Adoptive Admission Against Duval</i></p>\n<p>Duval's next claim of error concerns the district court's decision to admit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> against him the testimony of Dyott, who claimed that Doucette said that he and Duval wanted to sell firearms in their possession. The Government claimed that Dyott's testimony implicated Duval because Duval was present when the incriminating statement was made yet did not attempt to disassociate himself from it, and thus was admissible as an adoptive admission by an opponent party. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B).<sup>[5]</sup> On January 27, 2005, Duval filed a written motion to exclude the use of Dyott's testimony as inadmissible hearsay. On February 4, 2005, the district court denied Duval's pretrial motion without prejudice to its renewal during trial. At the Government's request, the statement was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p>While the admissibility of evidence is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion, <i>United States v. Barrow,</i> 448 F.3d 37, 42 (1st Cir.2006), we review the case at bar for plain error because Duval \"failed to interpose a contemporaneous objection\" at trial. <i>Udemba v. Nicoli,</i> 237 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Desimone,</i> No. 05-2314, 2007 WL 1633556 at *5 (1st Cir. June 7, 2007) (reviewing the admission of hearsay for plain error). \"Under the plain error standard, an appellant must demonstrate that (1) there was an error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected substantial rights.\" <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). In addition, the error must have \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544).</p>\n<p>We have long recognized \"so-called adoptive admissions, including admissions by silence or acquiescence,\" as admissible against a party-opponent pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(B). <i>United States v. Fortes,</i> 619 F.2d 108, 115 (1st Cir.1980). In <i>United States v. Miller,</i> we elaborated, stating that \"a party's agreement with a fact stated by another may be inferred from (or `adopted' by) silence . . . when (i) a statement is made in a party's presence, (ii) the nature of the statement is such that it normally would induce the party to respond, and (iii) the party nonetheless fails to take exception.\" 478 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir.2007). Alleged admissions by silence may be properly submitted to the jury only if \"a reasonable jury could properly find the ultimate fact in favor of the proponent of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Barletta,</i> 652 F.2d 218, 219 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>In the present case, Dyott testified as to the incriminating nature of Doucette's statement and placed Duval at the scene of the conversation. Duval argues that these foundational facts ย which were proffered by the Government ย were insufficient to prove that he heard the statement, and thus for it to be admitted as an adoptive admission. While in some cases, the paucity of facts introduced at trial precludes any reasonably grounded finding of actual acquiescence, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moore,</i> 522 F.2d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir.1975), we have left the resolution of substantial yet conflicting testimony for the jury, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Wiseman,</i> 814 F.2d 826, 829 (1st Cir.1987). This same principle applies to cases in which the facts give rise to conflicting but plausible inferences.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the trial court properly found that the Government laid an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> adequate foundation for the admission of Dyott's testimony by offering testimony that the conversation between Dyott and Doucette took place in a small room, and that Duval was in that room, testimony from which it could be reasonably inferred that Duval heard Doucette's statements. Although Duval offered the contrary testimony of Ramos, who stated that he did not hear the conversation between Dyott and Doucette, the ultimate question of whether to believe Ramos's testimony and to infer from it that Duval also did not hear Doucette was properly left to the jury. Because the court properly found that a foundation existed for the admission of Dyott's testimony against Duval, we see no basis for concluding that the district court erred, plainly or otherwise, in admitting his testimony against Duval.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Instructional Errors</i></p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette argue that the court erred in denying their request for two jury instructions. First, Duval and Doucette contend that the court erroneously denied their request to instruct the jury on the sufficiency of evidence against them. Second, Duval and Doucette argue that the court erred in refusing to give their requested instruction on the elements of constructive possession.</p>\n<p>The standard of review varies with respect to claims of instructional error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnaciรณn,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.2003) (noting this phenomenon). Here, however, the claims of error are such that we review the denial of the requested jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <i>Fryar v. Curtis,</i> 485 F.3d 179, 183 (1st Cir.2007). In considering whether the district court abused its discretion, we look to see whether the requested instruction was \"(1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.\" <i>White v. N.H. Dept. of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 263 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The \"Constructive Possession\" Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette claim that the court's instructions on constructive possession were insufficient because it failed to give their requested instruction that \"knowledge alone, however, is not enough to prove possession. Similarly, mere presence in the vicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.\" Duval and Doucette suggest that by failing to give this instruction, the jury was allowed to equate knowledge with possession, and that knowledge alone is not sufficient to establish constructive possession.</p>\n<p>Applying the three-factor test set forth in <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 263, we note that there does not appear to be any dispute that Duval and Doucette's requested instruction was correct as a matter of law: mere presence in the vicinity of an object is insufficient to prove constructive possession of that object, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Wight,</i> 968 F.2d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir.1992), and knowledge of an object's location, without more, is insufficient to establish possession of that object, <i>see </i><i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]here must be some action, some word, or some conduct that links the individual to the contraband and indicates that he had some stake in it, some power over it.\") (quoting <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 105 F.3d 1460, 1463 (D.C.Cir.1997)). Furthermore, there is little question that the issue of constructive possession was integral to the case.</p>\n<p>The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested instruction, however, because the law of constructive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> possession was \"substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered.\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 263. We have said before that a court is not obligated to \"follow the exact form and wording of the defendant's proposed instructions.\" <i>United States v. Gibson,</i> 726 F.2d 869, 874 (1st Cir.1984). Here, the court very clearly instructed the jury that to find constructive possession it needed to find both \"power and intention to exercise control or dominion and control over something,\" and that Defendants \"knowingly possessed the firearms and/or ammunition in question.\" Thus, it is not the case that the jury was invited to convict based on mere knowledge of the firearms; rather, the jury was plainly instructed that it needed to find knowing possession. Because the court's instructions adequately expressed the law of constructive possession, we detect no error in its denial of Defendant's requested instruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The \"Sufficiency\" Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette also argue that the court erred by refusing to instruct the jurors that, \"if they do not believe Mr. Dyott's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt [that Doucette had told Dyott about the stolen guns], . . . they must acquit the defendant.\" As we have already explained, the court correctly gave detailed instructions on the elements of the offenses with which Duval and Doucette were charged and a defendant is not entitled to an instruction \"on every particular that conceivably might be of interest to the jury.\" <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 199 F.3d at 567.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Duval and Doucette put a new twist on their claim, arguing that the requested instruction was necessary because the prosecutor suggested on closing that, in fact, there was sufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony to convict Duval and Doucette. In analyzing this claim of prosecutorial misconduct, our first step is to determine whether the prosecutor did in fact make \"improper statements\" to the jury on closing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lowe,</i> 145 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir.1998) (reaching other elements of test for prosecutorial misconduct only after determining that statements made by the prosecutor were \"improper\").</p>\n<p>We set forth the standard for establishing constructive possession in <i>Wight:</i> the Government must show \"that the defendant had dominion and control over the area where the contraband was found.\" 968 F.2d at 1397. While circumstantial evidence can be used to satisfy this burden, \"mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient to establish constructive possession,\" <i>id.,</i> nor is it sufficient to show only that a defendant had access to the weapons, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Kelso,</i> 942 F.2d 680, 682 (9th Cir.1991). \"[T]he ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm or area where it is located,\" however, is sufficient to support a finding of constructive possession. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 473 F.3d 387, 399 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The prosecutor argued to the jury that, even if they disregarded Dyott's testimony (which had been heavily impeached at trial), the remaining evidence was sufficient to convict. Duval and Doucette argue that the Government's evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, for the jury to infer constructive possession because apart from Dyott, there was no direct evidence that they knew that the firearms were in the trunk. In support of this claim, Duval and Doucette provide a litany of supposedly analogous cases in which findings of constructive possession were overturned. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Reece,</i> 86 F.3d 994, 996 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that \"[w]here possession is not clear,\" constructive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> possession requires \"some nexus, link, or other connection between the defendant and the contraband.\"); <i>United States v. Soto,</i> 779 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir.1986) (\"It is well established that mere presence as a passenger in a car from which the police recover weapons does not establish possession. The mere proximity of a weapon to a passenger in a car goes only to its accessibility, not to the dominion or control which must be proved to establish possession.\" (citations omitted)). Furthermore, Duval and Doucette emphasize that here the guns were hidden in the trunk of their car rather than in the passenger compartment, which they argue distinguishes their situation from prior appeals where we upheld jury inferences of constructive possession. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> 385 F.3d 66, 69-70 (1st Cir.2004) (affirming defendant's conviction where the \"precarious, angled position\" of weapon suggested it was stashed after car came to stop, and defendant was only person observed moving.). Lastly they aver that, as in <i>Kelso,</i> access to a place where a firearm is located is insufficient to infer knowledge that the firearm is there. 942 F.2d at 682. Absent Dyott's testimony, Duval and Doucette's argument goes, the Government did not offer sufficient evidence to prove that they were aware of the contents of the trunk.</p>\n<p>We agree that the evidence could have supported a jury inference that Duval and Doucette did not constructively possess the weapons. However, that is not the question on appeal. The jury found Duval and Doucette guilty, and thus we must determine whether, as a matter of law, the prosecutor was incorrect when he stated that the jury <i>could</i> infer from the evidence presented that Duval and Doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk even if they disregarded Dyott.</p>\n<p>We conclude that there was sufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony for the jury to infer that Duval and Doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk, and thus that the prosecutor's arguments were not improper. Like the defendants in <i>Liranzo,</i> the evidence suggests Doucette and Duval exercised \"exclusive dominion and control over the location of the gun.\" 385 F.3d at 70. Doucette had the keys when the two were apprehended, Duval appeared to avoid opening the trunk upon sight of police officers, and the guns were not in the car when it was stolen. Although much of the Government's evidence was circumstantial, we have held that circumstantial evidence may support a finding of constructive possession. <i>United States v. McFarland,</i> 445 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, this is not a situation where the evidence showed only a defendant's \"mere proximity\" to weapons. <i>See </i><i>Soto,</i> 779 F.2d at 560-61; <i>United States v. Madkins,</i> 994 F.2d 540, 542 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that it was unreasonable for a jury to infer constructive possession of a weapon from the fact that the defendant was found working under the hood of a car where the weapon was found). Duval and Doucette's reliance on <i>United States v. Blue,</i> 957 F.2d 106 (4th Cir.1992), is similarly misplaced. In <i>Blue,</i> the Fourth Circuit overturned a conviction where the only evidence presented was the presence of a gun under the defendant-passenger's seat and testimony that the defendant dipped his shoulder as the police officer approached the vehicle. <i>Id.</i> at 107-08. Here, not only was there evidence that guns were in the trunk of the stolen car and that Duval turned away from the trunk when he noticed a police officer, but also that Doucette had the keys to the trunk, that Duval and Doucette had stolen the car and had exclusive possession of it thereafter, and that they had suspiciously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> registered under a false name at the Chelmsford motel, where the car and the guns were eventually found. This quantum of evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to infer that Duval and Doucette constructively possessed the weapons at issue.</p>\n<p>Thus, because there was sufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony that Defendants constructively possessed the weapons found in their car, we find no error in the denial of a jury instruction to the contrary.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Constitutional Challenges to the ACCA</i></p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette both argue that the Government's failure to plead and prove their prior convictions to the jury renders ACCA sentences invalid under the Sixth Amendment. We review constitutional challenges to the ACCA <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. McKenney,</i> 450 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court rejected this very argument in <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and has since reiterated its position that the fact of a prior conviction is exempt from the general rule that a jury must find any fact that raises a sentence above the statutorily-prescribed maximum, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We continue to be bound by Supreme Court precedent on this point, and as such, we must reject Duval and Doucette's Sixth Amendment challenge to the imposition of an ACCA sentence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McKenney,</i> 450 F.3d at 46; <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 105 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>E. <i>Duval's Challenges to the ACCA Sentence</i></p>\n<p>In addition to his constitutional arguments, Duval contends that he should not be subject to an ACCA sentence because he has not been convicted of three violent felonies. The ACCA imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on defendants convicted of \"three previous convictions by any court . . . for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(1). A violent felony is defined as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . [that] has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another . . . or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.</i> ยง 924(e)(2)(B). In determining whether a conviction was for a violent felony, the trial court may look \"only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\" <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> the Supreme Court recognized that where a defendant had plead guilty to a prior crime, a court could also examine a \"statement of factual basis for the charge, shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.\" 544 U.S. 13, 20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>There appears to be no dispute among the parties that Duval had been convicted of at least two violent felonies prior to his conviction for the instant offense. Thus, the dispute centers around Duval's third conviction, a conviction for assault and battery under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 207, which provides in part that it shall be a crime for a person to \"intentionally, knowingly or recklessly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> cause [] bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.\"<sup>[6]</sup> Ordinarily, simple assault and battery is punishable in Maine as a \"Class D\" offense, <i>id.,</i> which provides for a maximum sentence of up to one year in prison, <i>id.</i> ยง 1252(2). However, because Duval had previously been convicted of two misdemeanor assaults, he was sentenced under Maine's recidivist offender statute, making Duval's conviction a \"Class C\" offense, <i>id.,</i> which provided for a maximum sentence of five years in prison, <i>id.</i> ยง 1252(4-A). Duval offers two arguments as to why his third conviction should not qualify as a violent felony for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Recidivist Sentencing Enhancement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>First, Duval argues that because assault is usually punishable as a Class D felony with a maximum term of less than one year in prison, his conviction was for a misdemeanor, and thus not a \"felony,\" even though the sentence he received was five years because of Maine's recidivist sentencing statute. Thus, Duval asks us to decide whether the word \"crime\" as used in 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(2)(B) means criminal conduct (assault) or criminal conduct in combination with certain attendant circumstances (assault plus recidivism). We ordinarily review <i>de novo</i> a claim that a defendant is not subject to the ACCA <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Mastera,</i> 435 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>This question is a novel one in this circuit, but has been addressed by other courts. Duval urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in <i>United States v. Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> 291 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). In <i>Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that under <i>Taylor</i>'s categorical approach, the proper analysis for determining whether a crime was a \"felony\" would be to \"consider the sentence available for the crime itself, without considering separate recidivist sentencing enhancements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1209. Thus, the Ninth Circuit found that a prior conviction for petty theft in California, which provides for a maximum sentence of six months, Cal.Penal Code ยง 490, could not be a felony conviction even though the defendant had been subject to California's repeat offender statute which increased the maximum term to one year, <i>id.</i> ยง 666. <i>Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> 291 F.3d at 1210. Also supporting Duval's position is a line of decisions which hold that the ACCA, itself a recidivist sentencing statute, does not alter the nature of the underlying offense, but simply changes the sentencing structure for it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. McGatha,</i> 891 F.2d 1520, 1521-25 (11th Cir.1990) (concluding that the ACCA is simply a sentencing enhancement provision); <i>United States v. Rumney,</i> 867 F.2d 714, 718 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[T]he three felonies provision is for sentence enhancement and is not an element of a heightened crime.\").</p>\n<p>The Government, on the other hand, urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits. In <i>Mutascu v. Gonzรกles,</i> the Fifth Circuit found that where a defendant had been previously convicted and sentenced under California's recidivist sentencing statute, the ultimate conviction was not merely for \"petty theft,\" but rather for \"petty theft with prior jail term.\" 444 F.3d 710, 712 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, the Fifth Circuit refused to \"atomize\" a sentence into its recidivist <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> and predicate components, and held instead that the relevant sentence for the purposes of determining whether a crime was a felony was the sentence \"ordered by a court of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(48)(B)). Likewise, the Seventh Circuit has held that recidivist sentencing statutes may be used to determine the maximum sentence for a prior conviction when deciding whether a prior drug conviction constituted a \"serious drug offense\" for the purposes of the ACCA. <i>United States v. Henton,</i> 374 F.3d 467, 469-70 (7th Cir.2004). The Fourth Circuit has suggested a similar conclusion, although it noted that the maximum sentence imposable under a recidivist sentencing statute might depend on compliance with additional safeguards codified in state law. <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 326 F.3d 535, 539-40 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The parties also point to recent Supreme Court decisions on sentencing issues to support their positions. In <i>Apprendi,</i> the Supreme Court very explicitly stated that \"recidivism `does not relate to the commission of the offense' itself.\" 530 U.S. at 496, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> 523 U.S. at 230, 118 S.Ct. 1219). Duval contends that this statement supports his argument that his recidivist sentence was the product of a sentencing enhancement and not a change in the underlying offense. The Government points us to <i>Ewing v. California,</i> in which the Court, reviewing California's recidivist sentencing statute, explained that the petitioner had not been convicted of \"merely `shoplifting three golf clubs.' Rather, Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for stealing nearly $1,200 worth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at least two `violent' or `serious' felonies.\" 538 U.S. 11, 28, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003). This, the Government argues, supports its argument that recidivist sentencing statutes in effect create new \"recidivist crimes,\" which might be construed as felonies even if the underlying offense was a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p>These arguments highlight two conundrums. The first is that by using state-law definitions of crimes to determine sentencing on federal offenses, Congress may have allowed states to disturb the balance struck in the ACCA: repeat offenders would be subject to higher sentences, but only if they had committed three violent felonies. For example, it appears that under Maine's recidivist sentencing statute, a person might be convicted of three violent \"felonies\" (and thus sentenced under the ACCA) even if he had only been twice convicted of certain felony offenses (robbery) and once of a misdemeanor offense (assault). This would seem to disturb Congress's determination that the ACCA should be applied only to hardened criminals, <i>i.e.,</i> those who have committed three (rather than two) crimes whose nature is so serious that they are punishable as felonies.</p>\n<p>Second, this case highlights the ambiguous status accorded to recidivist sentencing statutes. The Government asks us to classify Duval's third offense as \"recidivist assault,\" an offense that is different than non-recidivist assault. However, in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Apprendi</i> that a maximum sentence may not be raised based on elements of the offense not pleaded and proven to a jury, 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, this calls into question <i>Almendarez-Torres's</i> holding that, in fact, prior convictions need not be proven to a jury before they are used to increase a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. 523 U.S. at 239-247, 118 S.Ct. 1219 (rejecting argument that recidivism is an element of a crime that needs to be plead and proven to a jury); <i>see </i><i>Rangel-Reyes v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> 2873, 2874, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (urging the Court to overrule <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> for this reason).</p>\n<p>In spite of the difficult questions that the Government's position presents, we are ultimately persuaded that logic and precedent support the conclusion that Duval was convicted of \"recidivist assault,\" and thus was convicted of a felony. First, although <i>Apprendi</i> stated that recidivism did not <i>necessarily</i> relate to the commission of an offense, 530 U.S. at 496, 120 S.Ct. 2348, this does not mean that an offense could not be defined with respect to recidivism. In fact, since <i>Apprendi</i> was decided, <i>Ewing</i> construed a conviction under California's repeat offender statute as recidivist theft, 538 U.S. at 28, 123 S.Ct. 1179, and more recently, in <i>Lรณpez v. Gonzรกles,</i> the Court noted that state drug possession statutes correspond to federal drug statutes, including \"possession of cocaine base and <i>recidivist possession,</i>\" ___ U.S. ___, n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 625, 630 n. 6, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006) (emphasis added). We acknowledge that these holdings create some tension with <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> but as Justice Thomas noted in his dissent from denial of certiorari in <i>Rangel-Reyes,</i> the Supreme Court is \"the <i>only</i> court authorized to\" overturn that decision. 126 S.Ct. at 2875.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, although there are some anomalies in having Maine's recidivist offender statute affect the operation of the ACCA's recidivist offender scheme, this is not a unique situation. A single conviction in Maine for simple assault is ordinarily not treated as a felony for ACCA purposes because it carries a penalty of less than one year, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยงยง 207, 1252(2), whereas a conviction for the exact same conduct in Massachusetts would be treated as a felony because Massachusetts law punishes assault by up to two and a half years, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, ยง 13A(a). Moreover, states use different characteristics to categorize the same crimes as felonies or misdemeanors. Maine makes assault a felony if it is accomplished with the use of a firearm, <i>see </i><i>State v. Gilbert,</i> 473 A.2d 1273, 1275 n. 1 (Me.1984) (\"Criminal threatening is a Class D crime, which, when committed with use of a dangerous weapon, is enhanced to a Class C offense.\"), whereas Oregon uses the presence of a victim's minor child to turn a simple assault into a felony, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Moreno-Hernรกndez,</i> 419 F.3d 906, 910, 915 (9th Cir. 2005) (also noting that a conviction with such an enhancement would qualify as a felony crime of violence). It appears that Congress implicitly accepted such inconsistencies in the application of the ACCA because it was concerned about federalism and wanted to preserve the state's role in defining, enforcing, and prosecuting essentially local crimes:</p>\n<blockquote>In \"enhancing\" this [federal firearms] offense with [ACCA]-type sanctions, if the defendant has been convicted three times of robbery or burglary, we are \"enhancing\" an existing Federal crime, which would alleviate many of the problems associated with [the ACCA] such as the issue of a local D.A. veto or the difficulties encountered by Federal courts in applying State robbery and burglary laws in Federal prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 1073 at 5, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3665. We can only assume that Congress thought that these federalism concerns would outweigh whatever inconsistencies arose.</p>\n<p>In addition, as one of the dissents in <i>Corona-Sรกnchez</i> pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote>Raising an offense from a misdemeanor to a felony has effects far beyond the extra time defendant might serve. While employers may be willing to overlook <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> a misdemeanor in potential employees, they are much less likely to hire convicted felons, especially for positions of trust and responsibility. Suffering a felony conviction, rather than a misdemeanor, can also have serious effects on personal relationships and reputation in the community. Moreover, under [California] law, felons suffer a variety of limitations and disabilities that misdemeanants do not. Misdemeanor sentences are served in local jails, while felony time is spent in state prison. For the rest of their lives, felons (but not misdemeanants) are denied the right to vote . . . and the right to bear arms.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> 291 F.3d at 1219 (Kozinski, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (internal citations omitted). So too here. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 1252(1)(A)(2) (specifying that a class C felon sentenced to more than nine months in jail are committed to the Department of Corrections); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 8, ยง 275-D(5)(D)(2) (listing Class C felony conviction as a ground for denying an off-track betting facility license); 28 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 28-A, ยง 653(2)(A) (listing Class C felony conviction as a ground for denying liquor license). It would be unusual if a court could not consider Duval's conviction as a felony for the ACCA when Maine law would recognize it as such for state-law purposes.</p>\n<p>If Congress finds fault in the pattern of inconsistent sentences mandated by the ACCA, it is within its power to amend it. However, as it presently stands, the ACCA defines a felony as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(2)(B). Because Duval was convicted of a crime which provided for punishment of up to five years, he has been convicted of a felony for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Is Assault a Violent Crime in Maine?</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval also argues for the first time on appeal that even if his assault conviction was for a felony, it was not for a violent crime. Duval argues that because the charging documents and plea agreement provide no indication as to the nature of the assault that he committed, we must find that he engaged in the minimum level of culpable conduct punishable under the assault statute, <i>i.e.,</i> \"recklessly causing offensive physical contact,\" and that this conduct would not qualify as a violent crime. Because Duval did not raise this objection to his sentence below, we review that objection for plain error. <i>United States v. Bennett,</i> 469 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir.2006). Plain error requires that the defendant show that \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>We detect no plain error in the district court's determination that a conviction in Maine for simple assault constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of the ACCA. In <i>United States v. Nason,</i> we explicitly stated that \"both variants of assault regulated under Maine's general-purpose assault statute necessarily involve the use of physical force,\" and concluded that a conviction in Maine for simple assault qualified as a crime of domestic violence for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(9). 269 F.3d 10, 21 (1st Cir.2001). <i>Nason</i> is the only case cited by either party to have interpreted the Maine assault and battery statute, and we cannot distinguish it in any meaningful way from the circumstances of Duval's case. Until such time as we revisit <i>Nason en banc, see </i><i>United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> 469 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that, absent extraordinary circumstances, three-judge panels are bound by prior circuit panel decisions), we are bound to apply its holding that even \"offensive contact\" constitutes a violent felony under Maine's assault and battery statute.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The request was made prior to trial and was renewed after the Government's additional disclosure of exculpatory evidence on February 14, 2005.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d 1271, 1289 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Eschewing tape recordings and ordering law enforcement agents not to take notes during pretrial interviews is risky business-and not guaranteed to redound either to the sovereign's credit or to its benefit. By adopting a `what we don't create can't come back to haunt us' approach, prosecutors demean their primary mission: to see that justice is done.\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Assuming that they found additional exculpatory information, Duval and Doucette argue that they would be entitled to a new trial or dismissal of the indictment altogether.</p>\n<p>[4]  Our belief that Duval and Doucette were not prejudiced is bolstered by the fact that the known payments to Ramos were not used to impeach him at trial.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Government also claimed that Doucette's statement was admissible as a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy. Because we find this statement admissible as an adoptive admission, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p>[6]  Because we are unaware of additional information regarding Duval's conviction that could be considered under <i>Shepard,</i> we must rely only on the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the crime for which Duval has been convicted. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Walter,</i> 434 F.3d 30, 38 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[7]  Although my colleagues would prefer not to address the issue, I consider that circuit law on this point is in some disarray. We have strongly suggested that a conviction under the Massachusetts assault and battery statute ย which is similar to the Maine statute ย would not constitute a crime of violence for purposes of the ACCA absent evidence that the conviction was for a \"violent\" assault, rather than for an offensive contact. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mangos,</i> 134 F.3d 460, 464 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that the Massachusetts assault and battery statute \"involves different types of offenses, some arguably violent and some not\"); <i>United States v. Fernรกndez,</i> 121 F.3d 777, 779 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[B]oth violent and non-violent conduct is covered by the [Massachusetts assault and battery] statute.\"). I think that the circuit might do better to resolve this disarray in light of the fact that the imposing a sentence under ACCA often makes a world of difference to the amount of prison time a defendant receives. <i>See </i><i>James v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1602, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Imprecision and indeterminacy are particularly inappropriate in the application of a criminal statute. Years of prison hinge on the scope of ACCA's residual provision, yet its boundaries are ill defined.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Duval and Michael R. Doucette were each convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1). Duval and Doucette now appeal their convictions and sentences. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On January 27, 2003, Heath Woodward, then a resident of Sanford, Maine, reported that his 1996 maroon Buick was stolen from a convenience store parking lot. Woodward later testified that he did not have any weapons in the car at that time.</p>\n<p>In late January, Duval, Doucette, and Carlos Ramos (an acquaintance of Duval and Doucette) spent a few nights at an apartment rented by Robert Dyott. Dyott was an associate of Ramos and unbeknownst to his guests, an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"ATF\"). Dyott would later testify that while staying at his apartment, Doucette said that he and Duval had stolen a car from a convenience store and that they had some weapons in the trunk of that car that they wanted to \"move\" (<i>i.e.,</i> sell). Dyott also testified that Duval and Ramos were in the room when Doucette said this, and that Duval did not disavow Doucette's statement. According to Dyott, Doucette also said that he and Duval were going to stay at a hotel the following night.</p>\n<p>On January 31, 2003, a guest identifying himself as \"Carlos Ramos\" registered at the Chelmsford Best Western for himself and a guest named \"Paul Santos.\" They were assigned room 102. In filling out the registration form, \"Ramos\" identified his car as a \"96 maroon Buick.\" That same night, a call was placed from Room 102 to a cell phone provided to Dyott by the ATF.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 2003, Dyott spoke with Daniel Meade, an ATF Agent, and told him that there was a stolen car with weapons at the Chelmsford Best Western. The ATF notified the Chelmsford police department, which sent Officers Tyros and Tine, joined by Agent Meade, to the Best Western to investigate the suspected stolen vehicle. Officer Tyros watched as a Caucasian male, later identified as Duval, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> walked toward a maroon Buick carrying a black object, and paused briefly by the trunk of the car. Tyros testified that Duval noticed his presence and walked back to room 102.</p>\n<p>Later that day, Agent Meade encountered Duval and Doucette as they walked towards a gas station near the motel and asked them to identify themselves. Upon learning their identities, Agent Meade arrested Duval and Doucette on outstanding warrants. Meade found the keys to the stolen Buick in Doucette's front pocket. A search of the car revealed a Remington rifle, a Remington shotgun, a Marlin rifle, and ammunition inside the trunk. Investigators found no fingerprints in the trunk, on the firearms, or the ammunition. However, Duval's and Doucette's prints were recovered from objects found in the passenger compartment.</p>\n<p>On June 19, 2003, a complaint was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging Duval and Doucette each with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g). The Government filed an indictment against Duval and Doucette on September 3, 2003. Both Duval and Doucette pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to comply with Local Rule 116.1(c)(1) and <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1963), the Government initially disclosed to Duval and Doucette in October 2003 that it would call Dyott to testify at trial, and that Dyott was a Government informant. The Government stated that Dyott had not been paid for his cooperation and that there was no evidence that would otherwise cast doubt on his credibility. But two months later, the Government informed Duval and Doucette that Dyott had been paid $5,150 for his cooperation since 1998. Then, in February 2004, the Government sent a letter to Duval and Doucette stating that in 1998, it had dropped firearms charges against Dyott in exchange for his cooperation. Eight months after that, the Government added that it had discovered that Dyott had been paid an additional $600 in 1998 and 1999, and that Dyott had a long history of mental illness.</p>\n<p>On January 10, 2005, the Government moved to supplement its witness list to include Carlos Ramos, the acquaintance of Duval and Doucette who had allegedly rented the motel room for them. The Government disclosed in a letter to Duval and Doucette that Ramos had a history of drug abuse, and had once cooperated with the Government by making a \"controlled buy.\" The following week, on January 19, the Government sent a second letter to Duval and Doucette stating that Ramos had told the Government that he did not see any guns or hear either defendant make any reference to guns, and that Ramos had told Agent Meade in 2003 that he had no knowledge of a stolen car. Other than this disclosure, the Government indicated that it had no additional exculpatory information regarding Ramos.</p>\n<p>Two days later, on January 21, 2005, the Government sent another letter to Duval and Doucette. This time, the letter stated that the Government did have exculpatory information regarding Ramos, specifically that Ramos was offered leniency for his participation in the firearms transaction in exchange for becoming an informant. The letter also stated that Agent Meade had interviewed Ramos in February 2003, but that Meade had not made any notes of the interview. The letter stated that Meade had asked Ramos about his renting a hotel room for Duval and Doucette, but that he did not recall if he asked Ramos whether he was in the room with Dyott, Duval, and Doucette in late January when Doucette was alleged to have offered to sell Dyott <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> weapons. The Government continued to assert that Ramos had not been paid for his cooperation on the Duval and Doucette case. On January 31, 2005, the Government sent yet another letter to Duval and Doucette, amending its prior disclosure to add that Ramos had in fact attempted to make at least three or four controlled purchases for the ATF, and that Meade had given him money to buy telephone calling cards. On the sixth day of the trial ย February 14, 2005 ย the Government disclosed to Duval and Doucette, seemingly contrary to prior claims that Ramos had not been paid in connection with the present case, that an entry on the ATF payment roster indicated that Ramos had been paid $50 for \"informant subsistence.\" The entry included a reference to \"Ducette [sic] &amp; Duval.\"</p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette moved to dismiss the indictment because of a pattern of Government non-compliance with its disclosure obligations. The Government opposed the dismissal of the indictment, contending that neither Duval nor Doucette had suffered prejudice as a result of the belated disclosures. The court denied the motion to dismiss, stating that the Government had violated its <i>Brady</i> obligations, but that neither Duval nor Doucette were prejudiced.</p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette also requested that the Government provide the records of each individual payment to Dyott and Ramos so they could determine if the Government had failed to disclose any other payments to the witnesses. Instead, the Government provided Duval and Doucette a summary of the payments made to Dyott. Duval and Doucette claimed that the summary was insufficient given the history of belated disclosures by the Government, and asked the court to compel production of the payment records, or in the alternative, to review the records <i>in camera,</i> in order to determine whether any additional payments had been made to Dyott or Ramos. The court denied the request.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, Duval moved to exclude as inadmissible hearsay Dyott's testimony that Doucette had offered firearms for sale. The court denied Duval's motion to exclude without prejudice, ruling that he could raise it again at trial if the Government failed to show that Doucette's statement was either a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy or an adoptive admission by Duval.</p>\n<p>The jury trial of Duval and Doucette began on February 7, 2005, and lasted eight days. At trial, Dyott testified that he had met with Duval, Doucette, and Ramos in late January, that Doucette had told him that he had firearms to sell, and that Duval said nothing when he heard this. Dyott also disclosed on direct examination his past and present drug habits, mental illness, and criminal history. Duval and Doucette cross-examined Dyott as to his cooperation with the ATF and payments that he received. In addition, both Ramos and Agent Meade testified, along with various other witnesses.</p>\n<p>During closing arguments, the Government noted that Duval had been within fifteen miles of the location where the Buick was stolen, that the Buick did not have firearms or ammunition in it when it was stolen, that the Buick was later found at the hotel where Duval and Doucette were staying, that Duval had suspiciously approached the vehicle but turned away when he saw the police, that Doucette had the keys to the vehicle, and that the trunk contained firearms and ammunition. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> Government then stated, \"[Y]ou can stop right there . . . because that evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that [Duval and Doucette] were in knowing possession [of the firearms and ammunition]. But there's more.\" The Government then noted that Dyott had testified that Doucette had admitted to possessing the firearms, and that Duval had remained silent. The Government acknowledged Dyott's substantial credibility problems but said, \"Take Mr. Dyott's testimony, discount it altogether. . . . [T]here is still no reasonable doubt that these men possessed those guns and that ammunition.\" Duval and Doucette then gave their closing arguments. Duval suggested that \"the Government cannot get around the testimony of Robert Dyott. [If] Robert Dyott's testimony [is] not in this case, there is no case.\" Doucette stated, \"[I]f you don't believe Mr. Dyott's testimony about a conversation he claims to have heard January 31st of 2003, if you don't believe his testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, you cannot convict in this case.\"</p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette then asked the court to give two instructions to the jury. First, they asked the court to instruct the jury that, \"if [you] do not believe Mr. Dyott's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt [about his alleged conversation with Doucette], [you] must acquit the defendant.\" Second, Duval and Doucette asked the court to instruct the jury that \"[o]ne cannot be found guilty of possessing an object unless he has knowledge of its presence. Knowledge alone, however, is not enough to prove possession. Similarly, mere presence in the vicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.\" The court refused both instructions, and instead instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>To possess something means to have control or dominion and control over something. It is not necessarily the same as legal ownership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The law recognizes different kinds of possession. Possession includes both actual and constructive possession. A person who has direct, physical control of something on or around his person is in actual possession of it. A person who is not in actual possession but who has the-both the power and intention to exercise control or dominion and control over something is in constructive possession of it. So whenever I use the word \"possession\" in these instructions, I mean both actual and constructive possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In considering the issue of possession in this case it is not necessary for you to conclude that a defendant in this case was in actual or constructive possession of the firearm and/or ammunition for a specified period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>More than one person can have control over the same firearms and/or ammunition. If this is so, then these people have what is called joint possession. For purposes of determining a defendant's guilt, joint possession is not different from sole possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>While you may consider a defendant's proximity to the firearms and/or ammunition in deciding whether the government has established beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed those items, mere proximity to the firearm and/or ammunition or mere presence of a defendant in the place where the firearm and/or ammunition were found is insufficient by itself to support a finding of possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Government must also establish beyond a reasonable doubt as to each defendant that he knowingly possessed the firearms and/or ammunition in question. The word \"knowingly\" means that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of ignorance, mistake, or accident. Thus, in order to convict a defendant, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was in possession of a firearm and/or ammunition and that he knew that what he possessed was a firearm and/or ammunition as we commonly use these words.</blockquote>\n<p>The jury convicted both Duval and Doucette on the sole count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Presentence reports were prepared for both defendants, suggesting that they were subject to the Armed Career Criminals Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e), which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years on any person convicted of a firearms charge who has been previously convicted of three violent felonies. Neither Duval's nor Doucette's prior convictions were alleged before the jury, and the jury made no finding as to them.</p>\n<p>Both Duval and Doucette challenged the court's ability to impose a sentence under the ACCA unless the predicate convictions had been proven to a jury. In addition, Duval stated that one of the predicate convictions being used to support his eligibility for an ACCA sentence, a conviction for assault and battery under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 207(1)(A), was neither a violent crime nor a felony. The court rejected Duval's and Doucette's arguments and found them both to be subject to the ACCA because they had each been convicted of three prior felonies. The court imposed a sentence of 180 months on Duval and 204 months on Doucette.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette appeal their convictions on the ground that the Government failed to meet its obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence under <i>Brady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In addition, Duval argues that Dyott's testimony as to Doucette's statement during the January 30, 2003 meeting should not have been admitted against him because it was inadmissible hearsay. Duval and Doucette both challenge the district court's failure to give their requested jury instructions regarding the elements of constructive possession and the sufficiency of the evidence against them. Duval and Doucette also bring a Sixth Amendment challenge to their ACCA-mandated sentences. Finally, Doucette argues that he has not been convicted of three violent felonies, and thus is not subject to sentencing under the ACCA. We discuss each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Government's Disclosure Obligations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette argue that the Government failed to comply with its obligations under <i>Brady</i> and the Jencks Act to disclose exculpatory and impeaching evidence regarding Dyott and Ramos and that it should have been sanctioned accordingly. In addition, because of the belated disclosure that Ramos had been paid for his cooperation with the ATF, Duval and Doucette suggest that the Government may have failed to disclose additional payments made to Dyott and Ramos, and they argue that they were entitled to <i>in camera</i> review of the Government's records of payments to confidential informants. We review the district court's denial of sanctions and <i>in camera</i> review for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

The Government \"amended\" its disclosures of potentially exculpatory evidence no less than five times, each time disclosing information that further cast doubt on the testimony of Dyott and Ramos, two of the Government's principal witnesses at trial. At least part of the problem appears to have been that the ATF agent involved in the investigation kept scant notes on conversations with Ramos that tended to exculpate his prime suspects, Duval and Doucette ย a practice whose propriety is questionable.<sup>[2]</sup> Another part of the problem appears to have been shoddy record-keeping by the ATF with regard to payments to confidential informants. Finally, overly broad statements by the Government that all exculpatory information had been disclosed may have led Duval and Doucette to believe that the Government had in fact disclosed all that it knew, when it had not. Whether the late disclosures were the product of happenstance or of negligence is unclear, but we take this opportunity to remind prosecutors that disclosure of <i>Brady</i> and Jencks Act material is not a suggestion, but a constitutional and statutory obligation.</p>\n<p>We are mindful that not all convictions must be vacated because of non-compliance with disclosure obligations; we must also determine whether the late-disclosed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> information prejudiced Duval and Doucette's ability to present their case. The first set of evidence belatedly disclosed by the Government was impeachment evidence regarding Dyott, namely that he had been treated for mental illness and had been paid $5,750 and given leniency in a prior case in exchange for his services as a confidential informant. This information falls within the purview of <i>Brady</i> because it could be used to impeach the reliability and motivation of Dyott's testimony. However, the last of these disclosures occurred in October 2004, nearly six months before the start of the trial. This left sufficient time for Duval's and Doucette's counsel to incorporate the information into their defense strategy. While we do not condone the lateness of these disclosures, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the lateness did not prejudice Duval and Doucette in the preparation of their cases, and that sanctions were not warranted.</p>\n<p>The second set of late disclosures involved statements by Ramos to Agent Meade that he had not heard Dyott and Doucette discussing the arms sale; this statement falls within the scope of material that must be disclosed under <i>Brady</i> because it casts doubt on both the Government's claim that the conversation occurred, and the claim that Duval heard the statement and adopted the implicit admission of criminal activity by remaining silent. It also falls within the ambit of the Jencks Act, as it is a prior statement by a witness that relates to his trial testimony. However, as the Government points out, Ramos remained missing until January 2005, and it is unclear that Duval and Doucette could have located him before then. Furthermore, Ramos admitted during cross-examination that he had told Meade that he did not remember hearing anything about the sale of arms at the motel, and that he did not tell Meade anything about the stolen car when they met in February 2003. Thus, even assuming that Doucette and Duval could have located Ramos before that time and interviewed him regarding his statement, it is unclear what benefit this would have been to the defense strategy. <i>See </i><i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 115 (finding no prejudice where defense counsel had an opportunity to cross-examine witness about belatedly disclosed cooperation agreement). Again, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that neither Duval nor Doucette were prejudiced by the late disclosure of Ramos's statement, and thus that sanctions were therefore not warranted.</p>\n<p>Finally, Duval and Doucette point to the mid-trial disclosure that the Government may have paid Ramos $50 in connection with his cooperation in another case. The Government has stated that it has no further records of payment, but Duval and Doucette, having observed a pattern of delayed disclosures, suggest otherwise. Thus, Duval and Doucette suggest that the proper remedy for this late disclosure is to give them the opportunity to examine the Government's confidential informant payment records to determine if other payments have been made to Ramos.<sup>[3]</sup> In the alternative, Duval and Doucette propose that we direct the court to engage in an <i>in camera</i> review of the records to determine whether additional exculpatory material exists. Duval and Doucette suggest that their case is similar to <i>United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763556\"><a href=\"/opinion/763556/united-states-v-cruz-rosario-peralta-aka-crescencio-cedeno-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1999). In that case, various Government agencies had been pursuing a boat at sea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> that was observed dumping drugs overboard. <i>Id.</i> at 50-51. The principal defense theory was that the pursuing vessels had lost track of the boat engaged in the dumping, and that they had mistakenly seized the defendants' boat instead. <i>Id.</i> at 55. Accordingly, the defendants requested communication logs from the Government, which they argued would conclusively establish that their boat could not have been the same boat observed dumping drugs overboard. <i>Id.</i> at 54. We noted that the information in the logs was \"critical to defendants' theory and was a disputed issue at trial,\" and that \"we do not see how [the logs] could fail to be relevant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55. Thus, we ordered <i>in camera</i> review of the logs to determine whether they contained potentially exculpatory evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 57.</p>\n<p>Two principal differences between the present case and <i>Rosario-Peralta</i> support our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order <i>in camera</i> review of the Government's payment logs. First, the defendants in <i>Rosario-Peralta</i> made a clear showing that the evidence they sought in fact existed; the Government had acknowledged the existence of the communication logs and that they dealt with the defendants' case, but had argued that they were cumulative of other evidence presented. Here, Duval and Doucette have merely postulated a theory that additional records of payment to Ramos or Dyott exist; albeit a theory that was fostered by the Government's pattern of non-disclosure. While we emphasize that the Government's denial that additional <i>Brady</i> or Jencks Act material exists is not dispositive to our analysis, Duval and Doucette have not done much better than to take a shot in the dark. This is insufficient to establish the likelihood of a <i>Brady</i> violation, <i>United States v. Caro-Muรฑiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201553\"><a href=\"/opinion/201553/united-states-v-caro-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2005), and as such is certainly insufficient to require <i>in camera</i> review.</p>\n<p>Second, the material sought in <i>Rosario-Peralta</i> was undisputably directly relevant to the key issue in the case: the tapes would either potentially reveal that the defendants' boat had been the one pursued or that the Government had, in fact, lost track of the boat in question. In Duval and Doucette's case, even if there were an adequate showing that records of additional payments made to Ramos or Dyott existed, they would not bear directly on the guilt or innocence of either defendant. Although the records would have some utility as impeachment evidence, Duval and Doucette were already aware that Ramos and Dyott had accepted payments from the ATF.<sup>[4]</sup> Thus, the records would have been cumulative of other evidence, and it is unclear that their addition would have \"put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Casas,</i> 356 F.3d at 114. Accordingly, the court did not err in denying Duval and Doucette's request to review the Government's records. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Nelson-Rodrรญguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780802\"><a href=\"/opinion/780802/united-states-v-milton-a-nelson-rodriguez-luis-a-romero-lopez-miguel-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that neither <i>Brady</i> nor the Jencks Act \"provides grounds for relief unless the exclusion or failure to produce prejudiced [the] defense\").</p>\n<p>In short, while we disapprove of the practice of belated disclosures of <i>Brady</i> and Jencks Act material, we do not find that the Government's conduct in this case was so prejudicial that the district court abused its discretion in denying sanctions.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Use of the Adoptive Admission Against Duval</i></p>\n<p>Duval's next claim of error concerns the district court's decision to admit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> against him the testimony of Dyott, who claimed that Doucette said that he and Duval wanted to sell firearms in their possession. The Government claimed that Dyott's testimony implicated Duval because Duval was present when the incriminating statement was made yet did not attempt to disassociate himself from it, and thus was admissible as an adoptive admission by an opponent party. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B).<sup>[5]</sup> On January 27, 2005, Duval filed a written motion to exclude the use of Dyott's testimony as inadmissible hearsay. On February 4, 2005, the district court denied Duval's pretrial motion without prejudice to its renewal during trial. At the Government's request, the statement was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p>While the admissibility of evidence is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion, <i>United States v.

In <i>United States v. Miller,</i> we elaborated, stating that \"a party's agreement with a fact stated by another may be inferred from (or `adopted' by) silence . . . when (i) a statement is made in a party's presence, (ii) the nature of the statement is such that it normally would induce the party to respond, and (iii) the party nonetheless fails to take exception.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202646\"><a href=\"/opinion/202646/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2007). Alleged admissions by silence may be properly submitted to the jury only if \"a reasonable jury could properly find the ultimate fact in favor of the proponent of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Barletta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391830\"><a href=\"/opinion/391830/united-states-v-john-r-barletta/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 219 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p>In the present case, Dyott testified as to the incriminating nature of Doucette's statement and placed Duval at the scene of the conversation. Duval argues that these foundational facts ย which were proffered by the Government ย were insufficient to prove that he heard the statement, and thus for it to be admitted as an adoptive admission. While in some cases, the paucity of facts introduced at trial precludes any reasonably grounded finding of actual acquiescence, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330088\"><a href=\"/opinion/330088/united-states-v-emslie-leander-moore-united-states-of-america-v-floyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>, 1076 (9th Cir.1975), we have left the resolution of substantial yet conflicting testimony for the jury, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Wiseman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485243\"><a href=\"/opinion/485243/united-states-v-paul-wiseman/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 829 (1st Cir.1987). This same principle applies to cases in which the facts give rise to conflicting but plausible inferences.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the trial court properly found that the Government laid an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> adequate foundation for the admission of Dyott's testimony by offering testimony that the conversation between Dyott and Doucette took place in a small room, and that Duval was in that room, testimony from which it could be reasonably inferred that Duval heard Doucette's statements. Although Duval offered the contrary testimony of Ramos, who stated that he did not hear the conversation between Dyott and Doucette, the ultimate question of whether to believe Ramos's testimony and to infer from it that Duval also did not hear Doucette was properly left to the jury. Because the court properly found that a foundation existed for the admission of Dyott's testimony against Duval, we see no basis for concluding that the district court erred, plainly or otherwise, in admitting his testimony against Duval.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Instructional Errors</i></p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette argue that the court erred in denying their request for two jury instructions. First, Duval and Doucette contend that the court erroneously denied their request to instruct the jury on the sufficiency of evidence against them. Second, Duval and Doucette argue that the court erred in refusing to give their requested instruction on the elements of constructive possession.</p>\n<p>The standard of review varies with respect to claims of instructional error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnaciรณn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783504\"><a href=\"/opinion/783504/united-states-v-ramon-figueroa-encarnacion-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2003) (noting this phenomenon). Here, however, the claims of error are such that we review the denial of the requested jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <i>Fryar v. Curtis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202730\"><a href=\"/opinion/202730/fryar-v-curtis/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 183 (1st Cir.2007). In considering whether the district court abused its discretion, we look to see whether the requested instruction was \"(1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.\" <i>White v.

Similarly, mere presence in the vicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.\" Duval and Doucette suggest that by failing to give this instruction, the jury was allowed to equate knowledge with possession, and that knowledge alone is not sufficient to establish constructive possession.</p>\n<p>Applying the three-factor test set forth in <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 263, we note that there does not appear to be any dispute that Duval and Doucette's requested instruction was correct as a matter of law: mere presence in the vicinity of an object is insufficient to prove constructive possession of that object, <i>see </i><i>United States v.

Furthermore, there is little question that the issue of constructive possession was integral to the case.</p>\n<p>The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested instruction, however, because the law of constructive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> possession was \"substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered.\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 263. We have said before that a court is not obligated to \"follow the exact form and wording of the defendant's proposed instructions.\" <i>United States v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430881\"><a href=\"/opinion/430881/united-states-v-paul-w-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span>, 874 (1st Cir.1984). Here, the court very clearly instructed the jury that to find constructive possession it needed to find both \"power and intention to exercise control or dominion and control over something,\" and that Defendants \"knowingly possessed the firearms and/or ammunition in question.\" Thus, it is not the case that the jury was invited to convict based on mere knowledge of the firearms; rather, the jury was plainly instructed that it needed to find knowing possession. Because the court's instructions adequately expressed the law of constructive possession, we detect no error in its denial of Defendant's requested instruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The \"Sufficiency\" Instruction</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval and Doucette also argue that the court erred by refusing to instruct the jurors that, \"if they do not believe Mr. Dyott's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt [that Doucette had told Dyott about the stolen guns], . . . they must acquit the defendant.\" As we have already explained, the court correctly gave detailed instructions on the elements of the offenses with which Duval and Doucette were charged and a defendant is not entitled to an instruction \"on every particular that conceivably might be of interest to the jury.\" <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 199 F.3d at 567.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Duval and Doucette put a new twist on their claim, arguing that the requested instruction was necessary because the prosecutor suggested on closing that, in fact, there was sufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony to convict Duval and Doucette. In analyzing this claim of prosecutorial misconduct, our first step is to determine whether the prosecutor did in fact make \"improper statements\" to the jury on closing. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754636\"><a href=\"/opinion/754636/united-states-v-paul-e-lowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.1998) (reaching other elements of test for prosecutorial misconduct only after determining that statements made by the prosecutor were \"improper\").</p>\n<p>We set forth the standard for establishing constructive possession in <i>Wight:</i> the Government must show \"that the defendant had dominion and control over the area where the contraband was found.\" 968 F.2d at 1397. While circumstantial evidence can be used to satisfy this burden, \"mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient to establish constructive possession,\" <i>id.,</i> nor is it sufficient to show only that a defendant had access to the weapons, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Kelso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566897\"><a href=\"/opinion/566897/united-states-v-mark-wayne-kelso/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span>, 682 (9th Cir.1991). \"[T]he ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm or area where it is located,\" however, is sufficient to support a finding of constructive possession. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202591\"><a href=\"/opinion/202591/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span>, 399 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The prosecutor argued to the jury that, even if they disregarded Dyott's testimony (which had been heavily impeached at trial), the remaining evidence was sufficient to convict. Duval and Doucette argue that the Government's evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, for the jury to infer constructive possession because apart from Dyott, there was no direct evidence that they knew that the firearms were in the trunk. In support of this claim, Duval and Doucette provide a litany of supposedly analogous cases in which findings of constructive possession were overturned. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Reece,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153517\"><a href=\"/opinion/153517/united-states-v-reece/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 996 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that \"[w]here possession is not clear,\" constructive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> possession requires \"some nexus, link, or other connection between the defendant and the contraband.\"); <i>United States v. Soto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462364\"><a href=\"/opinion/462364/united-states-v-jimmy-ruben-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, 560 (9th Cir.1986) (\"It is well established that mere presence as a passenger in a car from which the police recover weapons does not establish possession. The mere proximity of a weapon to a passenger in a car goes only to its accessibility, not to the dominion or control which must be proved to establish possession.\" (citations omitted)). Furthermore, Duval and Doucette emphasize that here the guns were hidden in the trunk of their car rather than in the passenger compartment, which they argue distinguishes their situation from prior appeals where we upheld jury inferences of constructive possession. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201265\"><a href=\"/opinion/201265/united-states-v-liranzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 69-70 (1st Cir.2004) (affirming defendant's conviction where the \"precarious, angled position\" of weapon suggested it was stashed after car came to stop, and defendant was only person observed moving.). Lastly they aver that, as in <i>Kelso,</i> access to a place where a firearm is located is insufficient to infer knowledge that the firearm is there. 942 F.2d at 682. Absent Dyott's testimony, Duval and Doucette's argument goes, the Government did not offer sufficient evidence to prove that they were aware of the contents of the trunk.</p>\n<p>We agree that the evidence could have supported a jury inference that Duval and Doucette did not constructively possess the weapons. However, that is not the question on appeal. The jury found Duval and Doucette guilty, and thus we must determine whether, as a matter of law, the prosecutor was incorrect when he stated that the jury <i>could</i> infer from the evidence presented that Duval and Doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk even if they disregarded Dyott.</p>\n<p>We conclude that there was sufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony for the jury to infer that Duval and Doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk, and thus that the prosecutor's arguments were not improper. Like the defendants in <i>Liranzo,</i> the evidence suggests Doucette and Duval exercised \"exclusive dominion and control over the location of the gun.\" 385 F.3d at 70. Doucette had the keys when the two were apprehended, Duval appeared to avoid opening the trunk upon sight of police officers, and the guns were not in the car when it was stolen. Although much of the Government's evidence was circumstantial, we have held that circumstantial evidence may support a finding of constructive possession. <i>United States v. McFarland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202152\"><a href=\"/opinion/202152/united-states-v-mcfarland/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Accordingly, this is not a situation where the evidence showed only a defendant's \"mere proximity\" to weapons. <i>See </i><i>Soto,</i> 779 F.2d at 560-61; <i>United States v. Madkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607939\"><a href=\"/opinion/607939/united-states-v-richard-earl-madkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 542 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that it was unreasonable for a jury to infer constructive possession of a weapon from the fact that the defendant was found working under the hood of a car where the weapon was found). Duval and Doucette's reliance on <i>United States v. Blue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578218\"><a href=\"/opinion/578218/united-states-v-herbert-randolph-blue/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1992), is similarly misplaced. In <i>Blue,</i> the Fourth Circuit overturned a conviction where the only evidence presented was the presence of a gun under the defendant-passenger's seat and testimony that the defendant dipped his shoulder as the police officer approached the vehicle. <i>Id.</i> at 107-08. Here, not only was there evidence that guns were in the trunk of the stolen car and that Duval turned away from the trunk when he noticed a police officer, but also that Doucette had the keys to the trunk, that Duval and Doucette had stolen the car and had exclusive possession of it thereafter, and that they had suspiciously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> registered under a false name at the Chelmsford motel, where the car and the guns were eventually found. This quantum of evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to infer that Duval and Doucette constructively possessed the weapons at issue.</p>\n<p>Thus, because there was sufficient evidence apart from Dyott's testimony that Defendants constructively possessed the weapons found in their car, we find no error in the denial of a jury instruction to the contrary.</p>\n<p>D. <i>Constitutional Challenges to the ACCA</i></p>\n<p>Duval and Doucette both argue that the Government's failure to plead and prove their prior convictions to the jury renders ACCA sentences invalid under the Sixth Amendment.

We continue to be bound by Supreme Court precedent on this point, and as such, we must reject Duval and Doucette's Sixth Amendment challenge to the imposition of an ACCA sentence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McKenney,</i> 450 F.3d at 46; <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202424\"><a href=\"/opinion/202424/united-states-v-coplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 105 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>E. <i>Duval's Challenges to the ACCA Sentence</i></p>\n<p>In addition to his constitutional arguments, Duval contends that he should not be subject to an ACCA sentence because he has not been convicted of three violent felonies. The ACCA imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on defendants convicted of \"three previous convictions by any court . . . for a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(1). A violent felony is defined as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . [that] has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another . . . or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.</i> ยง 924(e)(2)(B). In determining whether a conviction was for a violent felony, the trial court may look \"only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\" <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990). In <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> the Supreme Court recognized that where a defendant had plead guilty to a prior crime, a court could also examine a \"statement of factual basis for the charge, shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>There appears to be no dispute among the parties that Duval had been convicted of at least two violent felonies prior to his conviction for the instant offense. Thus, the dispute centers around Duval's third conviction, a conviction for assault and battery under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 207, which provides in part that it shall be a crime for a person to \"intentionally, knowingly or recklessly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> cause [] bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.\"<sup>[6]</sup> Ordinarily, simple assault and battery is punishable in Maine as a \"Class D\" offense, <i>id.,</i> which provides for a maximum sentence of up to one year in prison, <i>id.</i> ยง 1252(2). However, because Duval had previously been convicted of two misdemeanor assaults, he was sentenced under Maine's recidivist offender statute, making Duval's conviction a \"Class C\" offense, <i>id.,</i> which provided for a maximum sentence of five years in prison, <i>id.</i> ยง 1252(4-A). Duval offers two arguments as to why his third conviction should not qualify as a violent felony for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Recidivist Sentencing Enhancement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>First, Duval argues that because assault is usually punishable as a Class D felony with a maximum term of less than one year in prison, his conviction was for a misdemeanor, and thus not a \"felony,\" even though the sentence he received was five years because of Maine's recidivist sentencing statute. Thus, Duval asks us to decide whether the word \"crime\" as used in 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(2)(B) means criminal conduct (assault) or criminal conduct in combination with certain attendant circumstances (assault plus recidivism). We ordinarily review <i>de novo</i> a claim that a defendant is not subject to the ACCA <i>de novo. </i><i>United States v. Mastera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202030\"><a href=\"/opinion/202030/united-states-v-mastera/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>This question is a novel one in this circuit, but has been addressed by other courts. Duval urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in <i>United States v. Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777840\"><a href=\"/opinion/777840/united-states-v-moses-corona-sanchez-aka-enrique-sanchez-corona/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). In <i>Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that under <i>Taylor</i>'s categorical approach, the proper analysis for determining whether a crime was a \"felony\" would be to \"consider the sentence available for the crime itself, without considering separate recidivist sentencing enhancements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1209. Thus, the Ninth Circuit found that a prior conviction for petty theft in California, which provides for a maximum sentence of six months, Cal.Penal Code ยง 490, could not be a felony conviction even though the defendant had been subject to California's repeat offender statute which increased the maximum term to one year, <i>id.</i> ยง 666. <i>Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> 291 F.3d at 1210. Also supporting Duval's position is a line of decisions which hold that the ACCA, itself a recidivist sentencing statute, does not alter the nature of the underlying offense, but simply changes the sentencing structure for it. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. McGatha,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533850\"><a href=\"/opinion/533850/united-states-v-ronald-dale-mcgatha/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1520</span></a></span>, 1521-25 (11th Cir.1990) (concluding that the ACCA is simply a sentencing enhancement provision); <i>United States v. Rumney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518388\"><a href=\"/opinion/518388/united-states-v-arthur-w-rumney/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 718 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[T]he three felonies provision is for sentence enhancement and is not an element of a heightened crime.\").</p>\n<p>The Government, on the other hand, urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Fifth and Seventh Circuits. In <i>Mutascu v. Gonzรกles,</i> the Fifth Circuit found that where a defendant had been previously convicted and sentenced under California's recidivist sentencing statute, the ultimate conviction was not merely for \"petty theft,\" but rather for \"petty theft with prior jail term.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"41404\"><a href=\"/opinion/41404/mutascu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 712 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, the Fifth Circuit refused to \"atomize\" a sentence into its recidivist <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> and predicate components, and held instead that the relevant sentence for the purposes of determining whether a crime was a felony was the sentence \"ordered by a court of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(48)(B)). Likewise, the Seventh Circuit has held that recidivist sentencing statutes may be used to determine the maximum sentence for a prior conviction when deciding whether a prior drug conviction constituted a \"serious drug offense\" for the purposes of the ACCA. <i>United States v. Henton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786822\"><a href=\"/opinion/786822/united-states-v-david-l-henton/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 469-70 (7th Cir.2004). The Fourth Circuit has suggested a similar conclusion, although it noted that the maximum sentence imposable under a recidivist sentencing statute might depend on compliance with additional safeguards codified in state law. <i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781644\"><a href=\"/opinion/781644/united-states-v-baseem-shakir-williams-aka-gregory-burgess-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 539-40 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>The parties also point to recent Supreme Court decisions on sentencing issues to support their positions. In <i>Apprendi,</i> the Supreme Court very explicitly stated that \"recidivism `does not relate to the commission of the offense' itself.\" 530 U.S. at 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span> (quoting <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> 523 U.S. at 230, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>). Duval contends that this statement supports his argument that his recidivist sentence was the product of a sentencing enhancement and not a change in the underlying offense. The Government points us to <i>Ewing v. California,</i> in which the Court, reviewing California's recidivist sentencing statute, explained that the petitioner had not been convicted of \"merely `shoplifting three golf clubs.' Rather, Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for stealing nearly $1,200 worth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at least two `violent' or `serious' felonies.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127897\"><a href=\"/opinion/127897/ewing-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127897\"><a href=\"/opinion/127897/ewing-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127897\"><a href=\"/opinion/127897/ewing-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span> (2003). This, the Government argues, supports its argument that recidivist sentencing statutes in effect create new \"recidivist crimes,\" which might be construed as felonies even if the underlying offense was a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p>These arguments highlight two conundrums. The first is that by using state-law definitions of crimes to determine sentencing on federal offenses, Congress may have allowed states to disturb the balance struck in the ACCA: repeat offenders would be subject to higher sentences, but only if they had committed three violent felonies. For example, it appears that under Maine's recidivist sentencing statute, a person might be convicted of three violent \"felonies\" (and thus sentenced under the ACCA) even if he had only been twice convicted of certain felony offenses (robbery) and once of a misdemeanor offense (assault). This would seem to disturb Congress's determination that the ACCA should be applied only to hardened criminals, <i>i.e.,</i> those who have committed three (rather than two) crimes whose nature is so serious that they are punishable as felonies.</p>\n<p>Second, this case highlights the ambiguous status accorded to recidivist sentencing statutes. The Government asks us to classify Duval's third offense as \"recidivist assault,\" an offense that is different than non-recidivist assault. However, in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Apprendi</i> that a maximum sentence may not be raised based on elements of the offense not pleaded and proven to a jury, 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, this calls into question <i>Almendarez-Torres's</i> holding that, in fact, prior convictions need not be proven to a jury before they are used to increase a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. 523 U.S. at 239-247, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span> (rejecting argument that recidivism is an element of a crime that needs to be plead and proven to a jury); <i>see </i><i>Rangel-Reyes v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*83</span> 2873, 2874, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span> (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (urging the Court to overrule <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> for this reason).</p>\n<p>In spite of the difficult questions that the Government's position presents, we are ultimately persuaded that logic and precedent support the conclusion that Duval was convicted of \"recidivist assault,\" and thus was convicted of a felony. First, although <i>Apprendi</i> stated that recidivism did not <i>necessarily</i> relate to the commission of an offense, 530 U.S. at 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, this does not mean that an offense could not be defined with respect to recidivism. In fact, since <i>Apprendi</i> was decided, <i>Ewing</i> construed a conviction under California's repeat offender statute as recidivist theft, 538 U.S. at 28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127897\"><a href=\"/opinion/127897/ewing-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span>, and more recently, in <i>Lรณpez v. Gonzรกles,</i> the Court noted that state drug possession statutes correspond to federal drug statutes, including \"possession of cocaine base and <i>recidivist possession,</i>\" ___ U.S. ___, n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145772\"><a href=\"/opinion/145772/lopez-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 630 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145772\"><a href=\"/opinion/145772/lopez-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span> (2006) (emphasis added). We acknowledge that these holdings create some tension with <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> but as Justice Thomas noted in his dissent from denial of certiorari in <i>Rangel-Reyes,</i> the Supreme Court is \"the <i>only</i> court authorized to\" overturn that decision. 126 S.Ct. at 2875.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, although there are some anomalies in having Maine's recidivist offender statute affect the operation of the ACCA's recidivist offender scheme, this is not a unique situation. A single conviction in Maine for simple assault is ordinarily not treated as a felony for ACCA purposes because it carries a penalty of less than one year, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยงยง 207, 1252(2), whereas a conviction for the exact same conduct in Massachusetts would be treated as a felony because Massachusetts law punishes assault by up to two and a half years, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, ยง 13A(a). Moreover, states use different characteristics to categorize the same crimes as felonies or misdemeanors. Maine makes assault a felony if it is accomplished with the use of a firearm, <i>see </i><i>State v. Gilbert,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></span>, 1275 n. 1 (Me.1984) (\"Criminal threatening is a Class D crime, which, when committed with use of a dangerous weapon, is enhanced to a Class C offense.\"), whereas Oregon uses the presence of a victim's minor child to turn a simple assault into a felony, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Moreno-Hernรกndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791541\"><a href=\"/opinion/791541/united-states-v-isidro-moreno-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span>, 910, 915 (9th Cir. 2005) (also noting that a conviction with such an enhancement would qualify as a felony crime of violence). It appears that Congress implicitly accepted such inconsistencies in the application of the ACCA because it was concerned about federalism and wanted to preserve the state's role in defining, enforcing, and prosecuting essentially local crimes:</p>\n<blockquote>In \"enhancing\" this [federal firearms] offense with [ACCA]-type sanctions, if the defendant has been convicted three times of robbery or burglary, we are \"enhancing\" an existing Federal crime, which would alleviate many of the problems associated with [the ACCA] such as the issue of a local D.A. veto or the difficulties encountered by Federal courts in applying State robbery and burglary laws in Federal prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 1073 at 5, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3665. We can only assume that Congress thought that these federalism concerns would outweigh whatever inconsistencies arose.</p>\n<p>In addition, as one of the dissents in <i>Corona-Sรกnchez</i> pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote>Raising an offense from a misdemeanor to a felony has effects far beyond the extra time defendant might serve. While employers may be willing to overlook <span class=\"star-pagination\">*84</span> a misdemeanor in potential employees, they are much less likely to hire convicted felons, especially for positions of trust and responsibility. Suffering a felony conviction, rather than a misdemeanor, can also have serious effects on personal relationships and reputation in the community. Moreover, under [California] law, felons suffer a variety of limitations and disabilities that misdemeanants do not. Misdemeanor sentences are served in local jails, while felony time is spent in state prison. For the rest of their lives, felons (but not misdemeanants) are denied the right to vote . . . and the right to bear arms.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Corona-Sรกnchez,</i> 291 F.3d at 1219 (Kozinski, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (internal citations omitted). So too here. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, ยง 1252(1)(A)(2) (specifying that a class C felon sentenced to more than nine months in jail are committed to the Department of Corrections); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 8, ยง 275-D(5)(D)(2) (listing Class C felony conviction as a ground for denying an off-track betting facility license); 28 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 28-A, ยง 653(2)(A) (listing Class C felony conviction as a ground for denying liquor license). It would be unusual if a court could not consider Duval's conviction as a felony for the ACCA when Maine law would recognize it as such for state-law purposes.</p>\n<p>If Congress finds fault in the pattern of inconsistent sentences mandated by the ACCA, it is within its power to amend it. However, as it presently stands, the ACCA defines a felony as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(e)(2)(B). Because Duval was convicted of a crime which provided for punishment of up to five years, he has been convicted of a felony for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Is Assault a Violent Crime in Maine?</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Duval also argues for the first time on appeal that even if his assault conviction was for a felony, it was not for a violent crime. Duval argues that because the charging documents and plea agreement provide no indication as to the nature of the assault that he committed, we must find that he engaged in the minimum level of culpable conduct punishable under the assault statute, <i>i.e.,</i> \"recklessly causing offensive physical contact,\" and that this conduct would not qualify as a violent crime. Because Duval did not raise this objection to his sentence below, we review that objection for plain error. <i>United States v. Bennett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202519\"><a href=\"/opinion/202519/united-states-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2006). Plain error requires that the defendant show that \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>We detect no plain error in the district court's determination that a conviction in Maine for simple assault constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of the ACCA. In <i>United States v. Nason,</i> we explicitly stated that \"both variants of assault regulated under Maine's general-purpose assault statute necessarily involve the use of physical force,\" and concluded that a conviction in Maine for simple assault qualified as a crime of domestic violence for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(9). <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199640\"><a href=\"/opinion/199640/united-states-v-nason/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2001). <i>Nason</i> is the only case cited by either party to have interpreted the Maine assault and battery statute, and we cannot distinguish it in any meaningful way from the circumstances of Duval's case. Until such time as we revisit <i>Nason en banc, see </i><i>United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*85</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202509\"><a href=\"/opinion/202509/united-states-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that, absent extraordinary circumstances, three-judge panels are bound by prior circuit panel decisions), we are bound to apply its holding that even \"offensive contact\" constitutes a violent felony under Maine's assault and battery statute.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The request was made prior to trial and was renewed after the Government's additional disclosure of exculpatory evidence on February 14, 2005.</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1289 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Eschewing tape recordings and ordering law enforcement agents not to take notes during pretrial interviews is risky business-and not guaranteed to redound either to the sovereign's credit or to its benefit. By adopting a `what we don't create can't come back to haunt us' approach, prosecutors demean their primary mission: to see that justice is done.\").</p>\n<p>[3]  Assuming that they found additional exculpatory information, Duval and Doucette argue that they would be entitled to a new trial or dismissal of the indictment altogether.</p>\n<p>[4]  Our belief that Duval and Doucette were not prejudiced is bolstered by the fact that the known payments to Ramos were not used to impeach him at trial.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Government also claimed that Doucette's statement was admissible as a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy. Because we find this statement admissible as an adoptive admission, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p>[6]  Because we are unaware of additional information regarding Duval's conviction that could be considered under <i>Shepard,</i> we must rely only on the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the crime for which Duval has been convicted. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Walter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202006\"><a href=\"/opinion/202006/united-states-v-walter/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[7]  Although my colleagues would prefer not to address the issue, I consider that circuit law on this point is in some disarray. We have strongly suggested that a conviction under the Massachusetts assault and battery statute ย which is similar to the Maine statute ย would not constitute a crime of violence for purposes of the ACCA absent evidence that the conviction was for a \"violent\" assault, rather than for an offensive contact. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mangos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197749\"><a href=\"/opinion/197749/united-states-v-mangos/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span>, 464 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that the Massachusetts assault and battery statute \"involves different types of offenses, some arguably violent and some not\"); <i>United States v. Fernรกndez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></span>, 779 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[B]oth violent and non-violent conduct is covered by the [Massachusetts assault and battery] statute.\"). I think that the circuit might do better to resolve this disarray in light of the fact that the imposing a sentence under ACCA often makes a world of difference to the amount of prison time a defendant receives. <i>See </i><i>James v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span> (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Imprecision and indeterminacy are particularly inappropriate in the application of a criminal statute. Years of prison hinge on the scope of ACCA's residual provision, yet its boundaries are ill defined.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
