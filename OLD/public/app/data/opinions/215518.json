Benjamín Berríos-Romero, a Puerto\n\nRican prisoner convicted of second degree murder in 1993 and\n\nviolation of a domestic relations restraining order in 2010, filed\n\na federal civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.               He alleged\n\nhis constitutional rights were violated by a June 25, 2008 decision\n\nof the Administration of Corrections that he was ineligible under\n\nPuerto Rican law for pre-parole community-based diversion programs.\n\n          The    exact    nature    of    Berríos-Romero's       constitutional\n\nclaims is unclear.        As we understand it, he argues he has a\n\nconstitutional right to rehabilitation and treatment, and that such\n\nrehabilitation and treatment must be carried out not in a prison,\n\nbut in a community-based setting because Puerto Rican law grants\n\nhim that entitlement.       His basic contention is that Puerto Rican\n\nlaw   created    a     liberty     interest      in   such   community-based\n\nrehabilitation       programs    because    it    created    a     \"justifiable\n\nexpectation\" or \"implicit promise\" of conditional liberty.                 See\n\nSandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995); Bd. of Pardons v. Allen, 482\n\nU.S. 369 (1987).       His primary federal claim is that a denial of\n\nthat alleged entitlement violates his procedural and substantive\n\ndue process rights.      He also makes an equal protection claim.\n\n          The district court dismissed the federal claims on the\n\nground that Puerto Rican law granted him no such protected liberty\n\ninterest and dismissed the pendent state claims without prejudice.\n\nThe court also reasoned, inter alia, that under Sandin, there was\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fno protected, state-created liberty interest for constitutional\n\npurposes   because     Berríos-Romero      had   not   even   pled   that   the\n\ndeprivation     of    community     placement     \"imposes     atypical     and\n\nsignificant hardships on [him] in relation to ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life.\"        Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484; see also Wilkinson v.\n\nAustin, 545 U.S. 209, 223 (2005).          We affirm, albeit on different\n\ngrounds.\n\n           The Puerto Rican Court of Appeals (PRCA) on March 24,\n\n2009 issued a decision that requires that we dismiss both the\n\nfederal and pendent state claims with prejudice. Berríos Romero v.\n\nAdministración de Corrección, KLRA 2008-00955, 2009 WL 1522663\n\n(P.R. Cir. Mar. 24, 2009).        The PRCA engaged in judicial review of\n\nthe same administrative decision of the prison authorities which is\n\nat issue in the federal litigation and affirmed that decision.               It\n\nheld that Berríos-Romero was properly excluded from participation\n\nin the community diversion programs, which are offered only to\n\nthose qualifying under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 4, § 1136a.1\n\n           Because the PRCA held he has no entitlement to the relief\n\nhe seeks under Puerto Rican law, his federal due process claims\n\nfail, even if we were to accept his dubious argument that the\n\nproper inquiry turns on state statutes and regulations.              His claim\n\n\n\n     1\n          The PRCA also held that Berríos-Romero was ineligible for\na diversion procedure, as he claimed he was, under Article 3.6 of\nthe Domestic Abuse Prevention and Intervention Act, P.R. Laws Ann.\ntit. 7, § 636.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fis barred by issue preclusion under the doctrine of res judicata.\n\nSee Puerto Ricans for P.R. Party v. Dalmau, 544 F.3d 58, 69 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (\"Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, 'forecloses\n\nrelitigation   in   a   subsequent   action   of    a    fact   essential   for\n\nrendering a judgment in a prior action between the same parties,\n\neven when different causes of action are involved.'\" (quoting\n\nGener-Villar v. Adcom Grp., Inc., 417 F.3d 201, 205-06 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (per curiam)).\n\n          It is clear, applying principles of Puerto Rican res\n\njudicata law, as we must, that Berríos-Romero's federal claims are\n\nbarred by the March 2009 PRCA decision.            Under Puerto Rico issue\n\nand claim preclusion law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3343, there\n\nmust be \"the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and\n\npersons of the litigants.\"     Cruz-Berrios v. Gonzalez-Rosario, 630\n\nF.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2010).     The general principles are familiar.\n\nSee Dalmau, 544 F.3d at 69; Breneman v. U.S. ex rel FAA, 381 F.3d\n\n33, 38 (1st Cir. 2004).      The PRCA issued a final judgment on the\n\nmerits and Berríos-Romero did not appeal.               There was sufficient\n\nidenticality of the parties: the plaintiff and the defendant prison\n\nadministrators.     And there is sufficient identicality between the\n\ncauses of action, as both are concerned with the same determination\n\nby the prison authorities that Berríos-Romero was ineligible for\n\nthe programs in which he wishes to participate.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f           Berríos-Romero does not dispute any of this; rather he\n\nrelies on an exception for situations in which a party was denied\n\na fair opportunity to litigate his claims.              See Baez-Cruz v.\n\nMunicipality of Comerio, 140 F.3d 24, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nHowever,   his    argument   that    there    are    limitations     on   the\n\npresentation of evidence and cross examination of witnesses in\n\nprison administrative proceedings misses the point.                 The PRCA\n\ndecision is based on its interpretation of Puerto Rican law and on\n\nthe record of his conviction.\n\n           Berríos-Romero also argues that we are precluded from\n\neven considering the dispositive March 2009 PRCA decision for two\n\nreasons.   First, he argues that the defendants failed to put an\n\nEnglish copy of the relevant PRCA decision into the record until\n\nthe appeal, so we should ignore it.          Second, he argues that the\n\ndefendants waived their res judicata argument as to this PRCA\n\ndecision because the defendants failed to argue to the district\n\ncourt that this decision was res judicata.          Neither is persuasive.\n\n           The first argument is mistaken for several reasons.             A\n\ndecision of a sister court is a proper matter of judicial notice.\n\nLamar v. Micou, 114 U.S. 218, 223 (1985) (\"The law of any state of\n\nthe   Union,   whether   depending   upon    statutes   or   upon   judicial\n\nopinions, is a matter of which the courts of the United States are\n\nbound to take judicial notice, without plea or proof.\"); see also\n\nRodi v. New Eng. Sch. of Law, 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2007); Getty\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fPetroleum Mktg. v. Capital Terminal Co., 391 F. 3d 312, 320 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).    We are taking judicial notice of law, not of fact.\n\nThus, even when a copy of a judicial decision is placed in the\n\nrecord, it is not \"evidence\" nor is it fact.   We may take judicial\n\nnotice of law at any time.   We certainly would have taken notice of\n\nthe opinion had the PRCA decision been issued while this federal\n\ncase was on appeal.\n\n          The question is whether we should take judicial notice\n\nhere, given the negligence of defense counsel in not complying with\n\nthe local rule that decisions in Spanish from the Puerto Rican\n\ncourts should be translated into English if they are to be used in\n\nfederal court.   See D.P.R. Civ. R. 5(g) (\"All documents not in the\n\nEnglish language which are presented or filed, whether as evidence\n\nor otherwise, must be accompanied by a certified translation into\n\nEnglish prepared by an interpreter certified by the Administrative\n\nOffice of the United States Courts.\"); cf. 48 U.S.C. § 864 (\"All\n\npleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English\n\nlanguage.\").     District court counsel for defendant failed to\n\nprovide an English copy to the district court in violation of the\n\nlocal rule; however, appellate counsel has remedied this error and\n\nwe see no reason to ignore the decision of the Puerto Rican courts\n\nsimply to punish the derelictions of district court counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            More serious is the objection that this March 2009 PRCA\n\ndecision was not argued to the district court as a basis for res\n\njudicata.    Still, res judicata was raised by the defendants by\n\nmotion as to an earlier PRCA decision affirming the administrator's\n\ndecision to deny Berríos-Romero's release on parole.2       The PRCA\n\ndecision to which we now grant res judicata effect was, however,\n\nreferenced in the plaintiff's complaint and to the district court.\n\nWe see no reason to ignore the PRCA claim.\n\n            Strong considerations of comity lead us to apply res\n\njudicata here.   The courts of Puerto Rico have found that Berríos-\n\nRomero simply does not have any right under Puerto Rico law to\n\nenter pre-release community-based programs.       The choices as to\n\nthose best suited for pre-release community-based rehabilitation\n\nprograms are policy choices for Puerto Rico.\n\n            This leaves one final claim.   We agree with the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of Berríos-Romero's equal protection claim.    His\n\ncomplaint is inadequate in pleading that there is a gender based\n\ndifferential in access to pre-release community-based treatment\n\nprograms.    He has not pled the needed facts to give substance to\n\nhis bare bones claim.      It is not enough to use boiler plate\n\nlanguage merely asserting plaintiff is \"similarly situated in all\n\nrespects.\"    Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. & Mtg. Fin.\n\n\n\n     2\n          The correctness of the district court's decision to deny\nres judicata on the basis of that decision is not argued to us.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fCorp., 246 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001).   Further, the PRCA opinion\n\ndemonstrates Berríos-Romero is not so similarly situated.\n\n          The dismissal of the federal claims is affirmed; the\n\ndismissal of the state claims is altered to be with prejudice.\n\nCosts are awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Second, he argues that the\n\ndefendants waived their res judicata argument as to this PRCA\n\ndecision because the defendants failed to argue to the district\n\ncourt that this decision was res judicata.          Neither is persuasive.\n\n           The first argument is mistaken for several reasons.             A\n\ndecision of a sister court is a proper matter of judicial notice.\n\nLamar v. Micou, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (1985) (\"The law of any state of\n\nthe   Union,   whether   depending   upon    statutes   or   upon   judicial\n\nopinions, is a matter of which the courts of the United States are\n\nbound to take judicial notice, without plea or proof.\"); see also\n\nRodi v.

Capital Terminal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201373\"><a href=\"/opinion/201373/getty-properties-v-capital-terminal/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).    We are taking judicial notice of law, not of fact.\n\nThus, even when a copy of a judicial decision is placed in the\n\nrecord, it is not \"evidence\" nor is it fact.   We may take judicial\n\nnotice of law at any time.   We certainly would have taken notice of\n\nthe opinion had the PRCA decision been issued while this federal\n\ncase was on appeal.\n\n          The question is whether we should take judicial notice\n\nhere, given the negligence of defense counsel in not complying with\n\nthe local rule that decisions in Spanish from the Puerto Rican\n\ncourts should be translated into English if they are to be used in\n\nfederal court.   See D.P.R. Civ. R. 5(g) (\"All documents not in the\n\nEnglish language which are presented or filed, whether as evidence\n\nor otherwise, must be accompanied by a certified translation into\n\nEnglish prepared by an interpreter certified by the Administrative\n\nOffice of the United States Courts.\"); cf. 48 U.S.C. § 864 (\"All\n\npleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English\n\nlanguage.\").     District court counsel for defendant failed to\n\nprovide an English copy to the district court in violation of the\n\nlocal rule; however, appellate counsel has remedied this error and\n\nwe see no reason to ignore the decision of the Puerto Rican courts\n\nsimply to punish the derelictions of district court counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            More serious is the objection that this March 2009 PRCA\n\ndecision was not argued to the district court as a basis for res\n\njudicata.    Still, res judicata was raised by the defendants by\n\nmotion as to an earlier PRCA decision affirming the administrator's\n\ndecision to deny Berríos-Romero's release on parole.2       The PRCA\n\ndecision to which we now grant res judicata effect was, however,\n\nreferenced in the plaintiff's complaint and to the district court.\n\nWe see no reason to ignore the PRCA claim.\n\n            Strong considerations of comity lead us to apply res\n\njudicata here.   The courts of Puerto Rico have found that Berríos-\n\nRomero simply does not have any right under Puerto Rico law to\n\nenter pre-release community-based programs.       The choices as to\n\nthose best suited for pre-release community-based rehabilitation\n\nprograms are policy choices for Puerto Rico.\n\n            This leaves one final claim.   We agree with the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of Berríos-Romero's equal protection claim.    His\n\ncomplaint is inadequate in pleading that there is a gender based\n\ndifferential in access to pre-release community-based treatment\n\nprograms.    He has not pled the needed facts to give substance to\n\nhis bare bones claim.      It is not enough to use boiler plate\n\nlanguage merely asserting plaintiff is \"similarly situated in all\n\nrespects.\"    Barrington Cove Ltd. P'ship v. R.I. Hous. & Mtg. Fin.\n\n\n\n     2\n          The correctness of the district court's decision to deny\nres judicata on the basis of that decision is not argued to us.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199364\"><a href=\"/opinion/199364/barrington-cove-v-rhode-island-housing/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2001).   Further, the PRCA opinion\n\ndemonstrates Berríos-Romero is not so similarly situated.\n\n          The dismissal of the federal claims is affirmed; the\n\ndismissal of the state claims is altered to be with prejudice.\n\nCosts are awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
