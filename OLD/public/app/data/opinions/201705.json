This    is   an   employment\n\ndiscrimination action in which appellant Kathleen Ingram (“Ingram”)\n\nbrought state and federal claims against her former employer,\n\nappellee Brink’s, Incorporated (“Brink’s”), pursuant to M.G.L. ch.\n\n151B §§ 4(1) and (16A), and the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d).\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment for Brink’s on both the\n\nfailure-to-promote and unequal pay claims.                          Ingram now appeals.\n\nFinding no error, we affirm the district court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n       Brink’s is a nationwide corporation whose core business is\n\nproviding secure, armored transportation of valuables.                            Brink’s\n\noperates from local, largely autonomous branches that vary widely\n\nin   size   from    five      to   hundreds      of    employees.          Branches     are\n\nadministered       by    a    branch    manager       with    the    assistance    of    an\n\nassistant branch manager.\n\n       Ingram worked at Brinks for nearly three years. She was hired\n\nin September 1998 and resigned in May 2001.                     Although her work was\n\nexemplary, she claims that she was passed over for a number of\n\npromotions between 1998 and early 2001.                        The fatal problem for\n\nIngram’s discrimination claims, however, is her failure to file\n\nsuit until August 2001, by which time her earlier grievances were\n\ntime   barred.          The   only     relevant   hiring        decision       during   the\n\napplicable limitations period was the decision to fill the Lawrence\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fassistant branch manager position, but that decision was favorable\n\nto Ingram as she was offered the job.             But she rejected it for a\n\nbetter paying one outside the company.             Although Ingram goes to\n\ngreat lengths to describe a pattern of sex-based discrimination\n\nduring her first two years with the company, without a showing of\n\nan adverse employment action within the limitations period, Ingram\n\ncannot     make    out   even    the    minimal     prima     facie     case    of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n      With respect to the Equal Pay Act claim, Ingram alleges that\n\nthere were two male employees in the Lawrence branch and several\n\nmale employees throughout the company who were paid more than she\n\nwas   paid   for   performing    comparable   work.         But   the   only   two\n\nemployees that Ingram names – David Hardy and Jeffrey Hosfeld –\n\nwere assistant branch managers.          Ingram never formally held that\n\nposition; she turned it down when it was offered to her.                 Nor did\n\nshe effectively perform the same duties while she was in other\n\npositions.        Without more, her pay discrimination claim cannot\n\nprevail.\n\n      A.     Ingram’s Employment from September 1998 through December\n             2000\n\n      Ingram took her first position at Brink’s in September 1998 as\n\nChief Office Employee of its Lawrence, Massachusetts branch at an\n\nhourly wage of $11.50.          The job was largely administrative and\n\nclerical.     By November 1998, according to the branch manager,\n\nIngram had become “a great asset” to the Lawrence branch, and was\n\n                                       -3-\n\freclassified from an hourly employee to a salaried employee earning\n\n$28,000 per year.   Her new job title was “branch supervisor,” a\n\nrare, non-managerial position with flexible duties depending on the\n\nneeds of the individual branch.1\n\n     At the time that Ingram was hired, the Lawrence branch had no\n\nassistant branch manager.   In December 1998, two months after she\n\nbegan working at Brink’s, the assistant manager position was\n\nposted.   Ingram applied, although she conceded in her application\n\nthat a co-worker deserved the promotion because of his longer\n\ntenure with the company.    Neither was hired; the assistant branch\n\nmanager position was not filled, and the company stopped recruiting\n\napplicants until 2000 when the vacancy was posted again.\n\n     In March 1999 Ingram became pregnant.    She claims no adverse\n\nemployment consequence attributable to her pregnancy except for a\n\ndispute about the painting of the Lawrence branch.2        While on\n\nmaternity leave, in January 2000, the assistant branch manager\n\nposition in Lawrence was posted once again.    For the first time,\n\nthe posting stated that the assistant branch manager will be\n\n\n\n     1\n       At least two members of Brink’s management testified that\nthey had never heard of the branch supervisor position before this\nlawsuit commenced.\n     2\n       Ingram presented the branch manager with a note from her\ndoctor indicating that no painting should take place in her\nimmediate work areas, and suggesting that an air purifier be\ninstalled.   In response, the branch manager ordered that the\npainting take place at night, but he did not install the purifier.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\frequired “to learn every run and make recommendations for route\n\nrestructuring.”   And it included a        new requirement for on-call\n\navailability seven days per week, which Ingram, as a new mother,\n\nfound to be virtually impossible.        She nevertheless expressed an\n\ninterest in the position to David Weinstock, the Lawrence branch\n\nmanager at the time.      He responded that she needed “more armored\n\nexperience.”\n\n     While it is true that Ingram had never worked in the armored\n\nvehicle industry before her employment with Brink’s, and had no\n\nexperience working on the armored trucks even within Brink’s,\n\nWeinstock had never before mentioned the need for her to gain\n\n“armored   experience.”      Indeed,    notwithstanding   this   supposed\n\ndeficiency, Weinstock rated her as “outstanding” in seventeen out\n\nof twenty categories on her February 2000 performance review.         And\n\nin the section assessing areas in which Ingram needed to improve,\n\nWeinstock made no mention of the need for armored experience. In\n\nany event, when Ingram returned from maternity leave in March 2000\n\nshe set out to obtain armored experience by accompanying drivers\n\nand messengers on runs.\n\n     On April 15, 2000, Brink’s appointed Jeffrey Hosfeld to the\n\nassistant branch manager position that had then been vacant for\n\nover two years.   Hosfeld was a former corrections officer and had\n\npreviously served as a Brink’s branch supervisor in another branch,\n\nthe same title that Ingram had, where he earned $4,000 more per\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fyear than Ingram despite what Ingram describes as comparable\n\nexperience and job responsibilities.3   In support of her challenge\n\nto Hosfeld being promoted instead of her, Ingram also claims –\n\ncontradicting herself – that Hosfeld had no experience in the\n\nadministrative side of business operations prior to his appointment\n\nas assistant branch manager.   In any case, Hosfeld apparently had\n\nextensive experience in the field working on armored trucks, as\n\nrequired by the assistant branch manager job posting.4\n\n     In May 2000, Weinstock was promoted to regional management,\n\nleaving the Lawrence branch without a branch manager.        Brink’s\n\nposted the branch manager position, specifying that it required a\n\nbachelor’s degree or its equivalent.    Ingram expressed an interest\n\nin the position. Weinstock recommended her to his supervisor,\n\nThomas Szczepanski.   Szczepanski disagreed and chose a male, Mark\n\nAlbright, on the ground that Albright was more qualified because he\n\nhad a bachelor’s degree and Ingram did not. However, Szczepanski\n\noffered Ingram a branch manager position at a smaller branch in\n\nRochester, New York, although he acknowledged that she probably was\n\nnot interested in moving in light of her recent maternity.    Ingram\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Although Hosfeld earned $4000 more per year than Ingram as\nbranch supervisor of another branch, Ingram does not make an Equal\nPay Act claim with respect to this issue.\n     4\n       In any event, as described below, her challenges to his\nselection in this position would be time barred.\n\n                                -6-\n\fdid not pursue the Rochester position.      In June 2000, Albright was\n\nappointed to the branch manager position, replacing Weinstock.\n\n     In September 2000, Ingram was promoted to the position of\n\n“Operations Manager.”     Her salary was raised to $37,000 per year\n\nfrom $28,000 per year.5\n\n     Shortly thereafter Albright left the Lawrence branch manager\n\nposition and the vacancy was posted yet again.               Ingram again\n\nexpressed   an   interest.6    In    early-October   2000,    Szczepanski\n\nappointed Tim Messner, the Syracuse branch manager, as interim\n\nmanager of the Lawrence branch while a more thorough search for a\n\npermanent branch manager could be conducted.         As interim branch\n\nmanager, Messner split his time between the Syracuse and Lawrence\n\nbranches.\n\n     B.     The Position At Issue – Assistant Branch Manger\n\n     In mid-October 2000, Hosfeld, then the Lawrence assistant\n\nbranch manager, transferred to another branch, leaving vacant both\n\nthe assistant branch manager and branch manager positions.         Ingram\n\napplied for the former.       In her letter of application, Ingram\n\nacknowledged that she did not feel ready for the branch manager\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       She describes her responsibilities as Operations Manager as\n“overseeing all of the administrative operations of the branch,\nincluding... billing and accounting, human resources and customer\ntroubleshooting.”\n     6\n       After the position was filled, Ingram conceded that she was\nnot genuinely interested in the position.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fposition, but was “unequivocally prepared to successfully function\n\nin the capacity of Assistant Manager.”\n\n      After Ingram applied, Jim Gaherity, Szczepanski’s replacement\n\nas regional manager, informed Ingram that he was keeping the\n\nassistant branch manager position open until the branch manager\n\nposition was filled.          He wanted the new branch manager to be\n\ninvolved in the selection of his staff.\n\n      Ingram then expressed an interest in the branch manager’s\n\nposition despite her admission only weeks earlier that she was not\n\nqualified for it. Gaherity, the regional manager, rejected Ingram,\n\nappointing Daniel Harrington in her stead.               Harrington had worked\n\nat Brink’s since February 1999, six months after Ingram was hired.\n\nAlthough    at   the   time   of   his    appointment     to     branch    manager,\n\nHarrington was working as a messenger in the Lawrence branch,\n\nHarrington had spent over fifteen years in management positions in\n\nthe   trucking   and   delivery    field       before   joining    Brink’s.       In\n\ncontrast,   before     her    employment       with   Brink’s,    Ingram    had   no\n\nexperience in the trucking and delivery field.7\n\n      According to Ingram, after interviewing her for the branch\n\nmanager position, Gaherity told her that she was well-suited for an\n\nassistant branch manager position.               Indeed, even the new branch\n\n\n      7\n       To be clear, Ingram is not suing over her failure to be\npromoted to the position of branch manager. However, she compares\nherself to Harrington for the purpose of showing that she was\npassed over for promotion several times, and that each time a man\nassumed the management role that she sought.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fmanager, Harrington, agreed and expressly recommended Ingram for\n\nthe position. But Gaherity hesitated, reporting to Harrington that\n\nIngram    lacked   the   requisite    experience       and    qualifications.\n\nGaherity proposed that someone from outside the company be hired\n\ninstead   –   David   Hardy,   the   eventual   hire    for    the   position.\n\nHarrington rejected Hardy because he had no experience in the\n\narmored car industry, and because Hardy had explicitly stated his\n\nconcerns about the job’s safety hazards during his interview with\n\nHarrington.     As of December 2000, the assistant branch manager\n\nposition remained vacant.\n\n     Ingram delivered her second child on February 22, 2001, and\n\ntook maternity leave through April 2001, although she continued to\n\ncome to work once a week. In March 2001, Harrington assured Ingram\n\nthat he would relate to Gaherity that she was still his pick for\n\nassistant manager.\n\n     Shortly thereafter, Ingram saw the assistant branch manager\n\nposition advertised in a local newspaper.              When she confronted\n\nHarrington, he told her that Gaherity was resisting her promotion.\n\nThen, in mid-April 2001, Harrington showed Ingram an email message\n\nstating that Brink’s was eliminating the assistant branch manager\n\ntitle in favor of the operations manager title, the very title that\n\nshe already held.     According to Brink’s, the title was changed to\n\nmore accurately reflect the duties of the position.             The internal\n\nposting for the position was changed to reflect the title change,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fbut was otherwise identical to the prior posting.     It is unclear\n\nfrom the record what the relationship was between the title change\n\nand Ingram’s existing job title and duties.   What is clear is that,\n\nby this juncture, Ingram was convinced that the company had no\n\nintention of promoting her.\n\n     On May 1, 2001, Harrington resigned without warning. Gaherity\n\nvisited the Lawrence branch the following day, and he and Ingram\n\nhad an emotional confrontation.       Ingram expressed her anger at\n\nbeing passed over for promotion several times.        Gaherity told\n\nIngram that she could have the promotion to assistant branch\n\nmanager, and that he would make a phone call to accomplish her\n\npromotion “in an hour.”\n\n     Later that day, Gaherity did send an email to his supervisor,\n\nJim Tingley, requesting that Ingram be appointed to the assistant\n\nbranch manager/operations manager position, with an accompanying\n\nsalary increase to $45,000, an $8,000 increase over Ingram’s salary\n\nat the time and $3,000 more than Hosfeld made as assistant branch\n\nmanager. The next morning, Tingley forwarded the email, along with\n\na strong endorsement of his own, to Senior Vice President Greg\n\nHanno.   On May 18, 2001, Hanno approved the request.    Weinstock,\n\nwho was assisting with the management of the Lawrence branch in the\n\nface of Harrington’s sudden resignation, called Ingram at home to\n\nformally offer her the promotion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f     By this time, however, Ingram was on medical leave on the\n\nadvice of her doctor.         After not hearing back from Gaherity to\n\nconfirm her promotion after their confrontation on May 1, Ingram\n\nreports leaving the office “a wreck, a total wreck.”                 She visited\n\nher doctor who told her to take medical leave for stress.                  She was\n\nstill on medical leave on May 18, 2001, when Harrington called to\n\noffer her the promotion.        Ingram told him that she would think\n\nabout the offer.\n\n     In the meantime, Ingram looked for another job. On May 30, she\n\ntook a job at Genesys Software Systems with a starting salary of\n\n$47,000 per year.      Notably, Ingram cited her $45,000 salary at\n\nBrink’s (the amount offered with the promotion) when applying to\n\nGenesys.     By letter dated May 31, 2001, Ingram resigned from\n\nBrink’s, admitting that their most recent offer was what she had\n\nsought but that “it took too long.”\n\n     In    mid-June   2001,    Hardy   was     hired    as    assistant    branch\n\nmanager/operations manager for the Lawrence branch.                 His starting\n\nsalary was $50,000, $5,000 more than Brink’s offered Ingram just\n\none month prior.\n\n     C.     Procedural History Below\n\n     Ingram filed a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against\n\nDiscrimination   (MCAD)   on    August    8,    2001.        The   claim   alleged\n\nviolations of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151B §§ 4(1) and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f(16A), relating to promotions she sought during her employment with\n\nBrink’s dating back to December 1998.\n\n      On May 15, 2002, Ingram filed a complaint in Essex Superior\n\nCourt.   The Complaint alleged a pattern and practice of gender and\n\npregnancy discrimination by Brink’s, in violation of M.G.L. ch.\n\n151B § 4(1).    On July 2, 2002, Brink’s removed the case to federal\n\ncourt.    On April 24, 2003, Ingram filed an Amended Complaint,\n\nadding a federal claim under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d),\n\non the ground that both Hosfeld and Hardy were paid more than her\n\nfor performing substantially equal work while they were assistant\n\nbranch managers of the Lawrence branch.\n\n      On September 7, 2004, the district court entered a memorandum\n\nand order granting Brinks’ motion for summary judgment on both the\n\nstate    and   federal   claims.    Pursuant      to   the   burden-shifting\n\nframework laid out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792 (1973), Judge Keeton concluded that Brink’s could successfully\n\nrebut a prima facie showing of discrimination by showing that\n\nIngram was eventually offered the very promotion that she claims\n\nshe was denied, and that Ingram could not rebut with a showing of\n\npretext or discriminatory animus. See Memorandum and Order, Ingram\n\nv.   Brink’s,   Inc.,    Civil   Action    No.   02-11333-REK,    (D.   Mass.\n\nSeptember 7, 2004) at 11-13 (“Memorandum and Order of September 7,\n\n2004\"). With regard to Ingram’s claim under the Equal Pay Act, the\n\ndistrict court found that Ingram could not show that she received\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fless pay than any male employee performing “equal work on jobs the\n\nperformance    of     which   requires    equal   skill,   effort   and\n\nresponsibility,” as required by Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417\n\nU.S. 188, 195 (1974).     Memorandum and Order of September 7, 2004,\n\nat 14-15.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n     A.     Standard of Review\n\n     An appellate court reviews entries of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2004),\n\nand the reviewing court is not confined to the trial court’s\n\nrationale; the trial court’s ultimate holding may be sustained “on\n\nany ground manifest in the record.”        Id. at 70; Garside v. Osco\n\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) permits the trial court\n\nto enter summary judgment “if the pleadings, depositions, answers\n\nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.”       On summary judgment, the facts are viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmovant (here, Ingram), and all\n\nreasonable inferences are drawn in the nonmovant’s favor. Rathbun,\n\n361 F.3d at 64.     Once the moving party avers the absence of genuine\n\nissues of material fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual\n\ndispute does exist, but summary judgment cannot be defeated by\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\frelying on improbable inferences, conclusory allegations, or rank\n\nspeculation.    See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (“[n]ot every discrepancy in the proof is enough to\n\nforestall a properly supported motion for summary judgment; the\n\ndisagreement must relate to some genuine issue of material fact”).\n\nAnd summary judgment can be entered even where ambiguous, often\n\nmurky concepts such as motive and intent are involved, as in the\n\nemployment discrimination context.          Id.\n\n     B.   Ingram’s Failure-To-Promote Claim Under M.G.L. ch. 151B\n\n     Ingram alleges that Brinks’ failure to promote her to either\n\nassistant branch manager or branch manager amounts to actionable\n\nsex and pregnancy discrimination under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B.\n\nIn relevant part, ch. 151B § 4(1) makes it unlawful for an employer\n\nto   discriminate     on   the   basis     of     sex   in   hiring,   firing,\n\ncompensating,    or   in   providing       other    terms,    conditions,   or\n\nprivileges of employment.        The protections of this provision have\n\nbeen interpreted to apply to plaintiffs asserting claims of sex\n\ndiscrimination stemming from their pregnancy.                Gunther v. Gap,\n\nInc., 1 F.Supp.2d 73 (D. Mass. 1998).\n\n     Neither party disputes that the applicable limitations period\n\nis six months, since ch. 151B §5 as it existed before 2002 requires\n\na plaintiff to file a charge with the MCAD no later than six months\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fafter    the    alleged   act   of   discrimination.8   See   Ocean   Spray\n\nCranberries v. MCAD, 441 Mass. 632, 641 (2004).         Accordingly, only\n\nevents taking place between February 8, 2001, and August 8, 2001,\n\nthe day that Ingram filed her claim with the MCAD, are actionable.9\n\nTo be sure, discriminatory acts or practices that predate or\n\npostdate the actionable period can be used as relevant background\n\nevidence.      Rathbun, 361 F.3d at 76.     But the problem with Ingram’s\n\n\n     8\n      In 2002, the Massachusetts Legislature amended ch. 151B § 5,\nextending the limitations period from six months to 300 days.\nHowever, the parties agree that the earlier version of the statute\napplies to the case at bar.\n     9\n       Pursuant to its authority under ch. 151B § 3(5), the MCAD\nadopted an exception to the six-month limitations period for\nviolations “of a continuing nature,” 804 Code Mass. Regs. §\n1.03(2), recognizing that “some claims of discrimination involve a\nseries of related events that have to be viewed in their totality\nin order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and\nimpact.” Cuddyer v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 434 Mass. 521,\n531 (2001). For the continuing violation exception to apply, the\nplaintiff must prove that (1) at least one discriminatory act\noccurred within the six-month limitations period, (2) the alleged\ntimely discriminatory act has a substantial relationship to the\nalleged untimely discriminatory act(s), and (3) earlier violations\noutside the six-month limitations period did not trigger the\nplaintiff’s awareness and duty to assert her rights. Desrosiers v.\nGreat Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 885 F.Supp. 308, 312 (D. Mass. 1995).\n\n     The continuing violation exception is unavailable to Ingram.\nFailure-to-hire claims, like Ingram’s, generally do not fit into\nthe exception because the discriminatory act alleged is discrete\nand cabined, as opposed to hostile work environment claims in which\nthe discrimination alleged is itself a culmination of ongoing\nworkplace attributes. Indeed, in interpreting the meaning of “act\nof discrimination” as it appears in the applicable statute of\nlimitations, the SJC noted that “[i]n some instances, the precise\nmoment of the ‘act of discrimination’ is easy to calculate:\nplainly, if an employee is denied a promotion on an improper basis,\nthe date of the ‘act of discrimination’ is the date of that\ndenial.” Ocean Spray, 441 Mass. at 641.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcase is more fundamental:            While the prior acts that Ingram\n\ndescribes can be introduced to provide a background for or evidence\n\nof animus in connection with an adverse decision, without an\n\nadverse decision within the limitations period, the discrimination\n\ninquiry simply stops.\n\n     The following events occurred during the actionable six-month\n\nperiod between February 8, 2001, and August 8, 2001:\n\n     In March 2001, Harrington, the newly appointed branch manager,\n\nassured Ingram that he would tell Gaherity that she was his choice\n\nfor assistant manager, although he asked Ingram whether she would\n\nbe able to meet the demands of the job with two small children.\n\nShe assured him that she would.\n\n     Notwithstanding Harrington’s assurances, while Ingram was\n\nstill on maternity leave, Brink’s advertised the assistant branch\n\nmanager position in the local newspaper. Gaherity, it appears, was\n\nstill resisting Ingram’s promotion.         And then, on April 11, 2001,\n\nevidence suggested that Brink’s was eliminating the assistant\n\nbranch manager position in favor of an “Operations Manager,”\n\nIngram’s job title at that time.\n\n     On   May   1,   2001,   after    Harrington’s   resignation,   Ingram\n\nreiterated her desire for the assistant branch manager title and\n\ncorresponding salary. While Gaherity assured her that he would get\n\nthe job for her that very day, he did not.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f     On May 18, 2001, Brink’s finally offered Ingram the promotion\n\nand salary raise to $45,000.     Ingram, however, turned it down and\n\ninstead accepted a higher paying job with a different firm.       On May\n\n31, 2001, Ingram formally resigned.\n\n     Three weeks later, Brink’s hired Hardy for the assistant\n\nbranch manager/operations manager position at a starting salary of\n\n$50,000, $5,000 more than Brink’s offered Ingram the month prior.\n\n          1.       The McDonnell Burden-Shifting Framework\n\n     Employment discrimination claims, including failure-to-promote\n\nclaims brought under ch. 151B, are reviewed according to the\n\nburden-shifting framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).    See Wheelock College v. MCAD, 371\n\nMass. 130 (1976).\n\n     Where there is no direct evidence of discriminatory intent –\n\nno smoking gun – the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie\n\ncase of gender discrimination.     McDonnell, 411 U.S. at 802.       In a\n\nfailure-to-promote claim, the plaintiff establishes a prima facie\n\ncase by showing that (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2)\n\nshe was qualified for an open position for which she applied, (3)\n\nshe was rejected, and (4) someone possessing similar qualifications\n\nfilled the position instead.     Rathbun, 361 F.2d at 71.     If a prima\n\nfacie case is made out, an inference of intentional discrimination\n\nis raised, and the burden of production shifts to the employer to\n\narticulate     a   legitimate,   nondiscriminatory   reason    for    its\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\femployment decision(s).   Id.   If the employer does so, the burden\n\nof production reverts to the plaintiff, who then must prove   that\n\nthe employer’s neutral reasons were actually a pretext for the\n\nalleged discrimination. Id.; see also Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs\n\nv. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981).\n\n     If, as is the case here, the plaintiff fails to make it past\n\nthe first stage, i.e. to aver a prima facie case, the inference of\n\ndiscrimination simply never arises and the employer’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment is granted.\n\n          2.   The Merits of Ingram’s Failure-to-Hire Claim\n\n     As the district court found, it is beyond dispute that (1)\n\nIngram is a member of a protected class based on her sex and her\n\npregnancy status during the relevant period, and (2) she applied\n\nfor the assistant manager position.    One could even conclude that\n\nIngram was qualified for the assistant branch manager position, as\n\nBrink’s apparently believed.    The problem is with respect to the\n\nthird prong of the test – an adverse employment action. Ingram\n\nfinally got the promotion that she wanted and she turned it down.\n\n     Ingram argues that three events occurring after February 8,\n\n2001 can be construed as a de facto rejection of her for the\n\nassistant manager position – (1) the April 2001 advertisement for\n\nthe assistant manager position, notwithstanding earlier assurances\n\nthat the job was her’s, (2) the elimination in April 2001 of the\n\nassistant branch manager position in favor of operations manager,\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fthe title Ingram held, and (3) Gaherity’s unfulfilled promise to\n\nsecure Ingram the assistant manager position “within an hour” on\n\nMay 2, 2001.      But these events, while they surely may have been\n\nfrustrating to Ingram, comprise nothing more than delays in the\n\ndecision making process which are not actionable.\n\n     The   district    court     correctly     found    that     no   reasonable\n\nfactfinder   could    conclude    that   the   first      or   second    occasion\n\namounted to a rejection.        The process of finding a candidate for\n\nthe assistant manager position continued; no one else was hired.\n\nAfter Ingram brought the newspaper advertisement to Harrington’s\n\nattention,   he    told   her    that    Gaherity      was     “resisting”       his\n\nrecommendation, not that Gaherity had conclusively rejected Ingram\n\nfor the position.     And, in the second instance, the change in title\n\nfrom “assistant branch manager” to “operations manager” was nothing\n\nmore than an upper-management decision to change the title of the\n\nposition to more accurately reflect its role and responsibilities.\n\nWhile the significance of the title change is not at all clear, it\n\nsurely did not spell rejection for Ingram.\n\n     The   district    court     characterized      the      third    instance    –\n\nGaherity’s failed promise to secure Ingram the promotion “in an\n\nhour” – as a closer call, and then passed on the question, finding\n\nno need to decide whether this instance amounted to a rejection\n\nbecause Ingram’s claim failed at another point in the McDonnell\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\ftest, namely Brink’s ability to rebut a prima facie showing of\n\ndiscrimination       with legitimate non-discriminatory motives.\n\n      It is difficult to construe Gaherity’s actions on May 2, 2001,\n\nas a rejection. Indeed, after boasting to Ingram that he could\n\nsecure   her   the    promotion   within   the   hour,   Gaherity   left   the\n\nLawrence branch and promptly drafted an email to his supervisor\n\nemphatically         recommending     Ingram       for     the      assistant\n\nmanager/operations manager position.             Gaherity’s email set the\n\nhiring process in motion, and, only two weeks later, Ingram was\n\noffered the promotion.\n\n      To be sure, Gaherity’s initial assurances about how quickly he\n\ncould effect her promotion were nothing more than a boast.            But his\n\nempty boasts hardly amounted to a rejection.              On the contrary,\n\nIngram was offered the promotion within a relatively short time\n\nthereafter.\n\n      Without establishing that she was rejected for the promotion\n\nwithin the actionable time frame, Ingram cannot establish a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination and her failure-to-promote claim\n\nfalters.   Central to the first stage of the McDonell framework, is\n\nevidence of an adverse employment decision.               To be sure, the\n\nfavorable decision did not come as quickly as Ingram would have\n\nliked, and she had her hopes dashed on more than one occasion.             But\n\nin the final analysis, she got the job and she chose not to take\n\nit.\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f      C.    Ingram’s Equal Pay Claim Under 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)\n\n      Ingram alleges that several male employees within and outside\n\nthe Lawrence branch were paid more than she was paid in violation\n\nof the federal Equal Pay Act (“EPA” or “the Act”), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n206(d)(1).       The EPA prohibits an employer from discriminating on\n\nthe   basis      of    sex   “by    paying     wages     to   employees   in     such\n\nestablishment at a rate less than the rate at which [s]he pays\n\nwages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for\n\nequal work on jobs the performance of which are performed under\n\nsimilar working conditions, except where such payment is made\n\npursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a\n\nsystem     which      measures     earnings    by      quantity   or   quality     of\n\nproduction; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other\n\nthan sex.”    29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1).\n\n            1.        The Corning Glass Burden-Shifting Framework\n\n      To prevail on a claim under the EPA, the plaintiff must first\n\nestablish a prima facie case by showing that the employer paid\n\ndifferent wages to specific employees of different sexes for jobs\n\nperformed under similar working conditions and requiring equal\n\nskill, effort and responsibility.             Corning Glass Works v. Brennan,\n\n417 U.S. 188, 195 (1974).            Such a showing is harder to make than\n\nthe prima facie showing under the McDonnell framework because it\n\nrequires the plaintiff to identify specific employees of the\n\nopposite sex holding positions requiring equal skill, effort and\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fresponsibility   under   similar        working    positions     who   were   more\n\ngenerously compensated.        Petsch-Schmid v. Boston Edison Co., 914\n\nF.Supp. 697 (D. Mass. 1996).             The EPA is more concerned with\n\nsubstance than title, so Ingram is free to bring EPA claims against\n\nmale employees holding different positions then she held if she can\n\nestablish that they performed comparable work.\n\n     “Equal responsibility,” as it is used in the Act, is defined\n\nas “concern[ing] the degree of accountability required in the\n\nperformance of the job, with emphasis on the importance of the job\n\nobligation.”    29 C.F.R. § 1620.17.           “Establishment,” as it is used\n\nin the Act, refers to “a distinct physical place of business rather\n\nthan to an entire business or ‘enterprise’ which may include\n\nseveral   separate    places    of    business.”         29   C.F.R.   §   1620.9.\n\nAccordingly, Ingram’s EPA claim focuses on two male employees\n\nwithin a single establishment – the Lawrence branch.\n\n     Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of an\n\nunlawful wage differential, the burden shifts to the employer to\n\nshow that the differential is justified under one of the Act’s four\n\nexceptions.      At   this     stage,    the     Act’s   exceptions    serve   as\n\naffirmative defenses on which the employer carries the burden of\n\nproof, not just production.          Corning Glass, 417 U.S. at 196.\n\n           2.    The Merits of Ingram’s EPA Claim\n\n     The district court properly noted that Ingram provided scant\n\nevidence showing that she was paid less than Hardy and Hosfeld for\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fjobs requiring equal responsibility.     Ingram provides no specifics\n\nas to Hardy’s job functions while he was assistant branch manager\n\nafter her resignation from Brink’s,10 and the specifics she provides\n\nwith regard to Hosfeld’s job functions while he was assistant branch\n\nmanager indicate that his responsibilities were distinct from hers,\n\nand significantly more demanding.      Based on these facts, Ingram’s\n\npay discrimination claim is not viable.\n\n     First, Ingram makes much of Hardy’s $50,000 starting salary as\n\nassistant branch manager, $5,000 more than she was offered just a\n\nfew weeks earlier.   But Ingram turned down Brinks’ promotion offer\n\nbecause she found another job paying more than the $45,000 that they\n\noffered her. But Ingram was never paid less than Hardy for the same\n\njob – she never took the job – and Hardy was offered more after\n\nIngram had already left the company (quite possibly because the\n\ncompany got the message that they were not offering enough).\n\n     Second, Ingram alleges that Hosfeld was paid $4000 more per\n\nyear than she was paid while he was the Lawrence assistant manager.\n\nBased on the record, however, Hosfeld and Ingram performed distinct\n\nduties.   Hosfeld’s responsibilities included “learning more of the\n\noperation of the branch, learning more of budgeting, being available\n\n24 hours, seven days a week, overall supervision of the facility,\n\n\n     10\n        In an EPA action, it is appropriate to compare the\nplaintiff-employee’s compensation to that of her immediate (and\nnon-immediate) successors and predecessors. See Broadus v. O.K.\nIndustries, Inc., 226 F.3d 937, 941-42 (8th Cir. 2000); Brinkley-\nObu v. Hughes Training, Inc., 36 F.3d 336, 352 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                -23-\n\fopening and closing, staffing, dispatching, scheduling the runs,\n\nscheduling the personnel,” and on and on.       Meanwhile, by her own\n\ndescription, Ingram’s responsibilities as operations manager were\n\nlargely    administrative,   including   maintaining   billing   records,\n\npreparing monthly financial reports, handling customer service\n\nissues related to billing, and performing vault audits.\n\n     In summary, both of the male employees that she alleges were\n\nbeing paid more for performing equal responsibilities were paid as\n\nassistant managers, a position that she never held either in title\n\nor substance.    By all accounts, their duties and responsibilities\n\nwere distinctly more demanding, requiring more skill breadth and\n\ntraining, than Ingram’s duties as branch supervisor or operations\n\nmanager.    Without more, Ingram has failed to show that Brink’s\n\ncompensated certain male employees at higher rates for performing\n\njobs requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility.\n\n                             III. Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons stated in this opinion, the district court’s\n\nentry of summary judgment for Defendant-Appellee Brink’s is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f",

Brink's operates from local, largely autonomous branches that vary widely in size from five to hundreds of employees. Branches are administered by a branch manager with the assistance of an assistant branch manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram worked at Brink's for nearly three years. She was hired in September 1998 and resigned in May 2001. Although her work was exemplary, she claims that she was passed over for a number of promotions between 1998 and early 2001. The fatal problem for Ingram's discrimination claims, however, is her failure to file suit until August 2001, by which time her earlier grievances were time barred. The only relevant hiring decision during the applicable limitations period was the decision to fill the Lawrence assistant branch manager position, but that decision was favorable to Ingram as she was offered the job. But she rejected it for a better paying one outside the company. Although Ingram goes to great lengths to describe a pattern of sex-based discrimination during her first two years with the company, without a showing of an adverse employment action within the limitations period, Ingram cannot make out even the minimal prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the Equal Pay Act claim, Ingram alleges that there were two male employees in the Lawrence branch and several male employees throughout the company who were paid more than she was paid for performing comparable work. But the only two employees that Ingram names &#8212; David Hardy and Jeffrey Hosfeld &#8212; were assistant branch managers. Ingram never formally held that position; she turned it down when it was offered to her. Nor did she effectively perform the same duties while she was in other positions. Without more, her pay discrimination claim cannot prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The job was largely administrative and clerical. By November 1998, according to the branch manager, Ingram had become \"a great asset\" to the Lawrence branch, and was reclassified from an hourly employee to a salaried employee earning $28,000 per year. Her new job title was \"branch supervisor,\" a rare, non-managerial position with flexible duties depending on the needs of the individual branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that Ingram was hired, the Lawrence branch had no assistant branch manager. In December 1998, two months after she began working at Brink's, the assistant manager position was posted. Ingram applied, although she conceded in her application that a co-worker deserved the promotion because of his longer tenure with the company. Neither was hired; the assistant branch manager position was not filled, and the company stopped recruiting applicants until 2000 when the vacancy was posted again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999 Ingram became pregnant. She claims no adverse employment consequence attributable to her pregnancy except for a dispute about the painting of the Lawrence branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> While on maternity leave, in January 2000, the assistant branch manager position in Lawrence was posted once again. For the first time, the posting stated that the assistant branch manager will be required \"to learn every run and make recommendations for route restructuring.\" And it included a new requirement for on-call availability seven days per week, which Ingram, as a new mother, found to be virtually impossible. She nevertheless expressed an interest in the position to David Weinstock, the Lawrence branch manager at the time. He responded that she needed \"more armored experience.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that Ingram had never worked in the armored vehicle industry before her employment with Brink's, and had no experience working on the armored trucks even within Brink's, Weinstock had never before mentioned the need for her to gain \"armored experience.\" Indeed, notwithstanding this supposed deficiency, Weinstock rated her as \"outstanding\" in seventeen out of twenty categories on her February 2000 performance review. And in the section assessing areas in which Ingram needed to improve, Weinstock made no mention of the need for armored experience. In any event, when Ingram returned from maternity leave in March 2000 she set out to obtain armored experience by accompanying drivers and messengers on runs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2000, Brink's appointed Jeffrey Hosfeld to the assistant branch manager position that had then been vacant for over two years. Hosfeld was a former corrections officer and had previously served as a Brink's branch supervisor in another branch, the same title that Ingram had, where he earned $4,000 more per year than Ingram despite what Ingram describes as comparable experience and job responsibilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In support of her challenge to Hosfeld being promoted instead of her, Ingram also claims &#8212; contradicting herself &#8212; that Hosfeld had no experience in the administrative side of business operations prior to his appointment as assistant branch manager. In any case, Hosfeld apparently had extensive experience in the field working on armored trucks, as required by the assistant branch manager job posting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Weinstock was promoted to regional management, leaving the Lawrence branch without a branch manager. Brink's posted the branch manager position, specifying that it required a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. Ingram expressed an interest in the position. Weinstock recommended her to his supervisor, Thomas Szczepanski. Szczepanski disagreed and chose a male, Mark Albright, on the ground that Albright was more qualified because he had a bachelor's degree and Ingram did not. However, Szczepanski offered Ingram a branch manager position at a smaller branch in Rochester, New York, although he acknowledged that she probably was not interested in moving in light of her recent maternity. Ingram did not pursue the Rochester position. In June 2000, Albright was appointed to the branch manager position, replacing Weinstock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2000, Ingram was promoted to the position of \"Operations Manager.\" Her salary was raised to $37,000 per year from $28,000 per year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter Albright left the Lawrence branch manager position and the vacancy was posted yet again. Ingram again expressed an interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In early-October 2000, Szczepanski appointed Tim Messner, the Syracuse branch manager, as interim manager of the Lawrence branch while a more thorough search for a permanent branch manager could be conducted. As interim branch manager, Messner split his time between the Syracuse and Lawrence branches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Position At Issue &#8212; Assistant Branch Manager</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-October 2000, Hosfeld, then the Lawrence assistant branch manager, transferred to another branch, leaving vacant both the assistant branch manager and branch manager positions. Ingram applied for the former. In her letter of application, Ingram acknowledged that she did not feel ready for the branch manager position, but was \"unequivocally prepared to successfully function in the capacity of Assistant Manager.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ingram applied, Jim Gaherity, Szczepanski's replacement as regional manager, informed Ingram that he was keeping the assistant branch manager position open until the branch manager position was filled. He wanted the new branch manager to be involved in the selection of his staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram then expressed an interest in the branch manager's position despite her admission only weeks earlier that she was not qualified for it. Gaherity, the regional manager, rejected Ingram, appointing Daniel Harrington in her stead. Harrington had worked at Brink's since February 1999, six months after Ingram was hired. Although at the time of his appointment to branch manager, Harrington was working as a messenger in the Lawrence branch, Harrington had spent over fifteen years in management positions in the trucking and delivery field before joining Brink's. In contrast, before her employment with Brink's, Ingram had no experience in the trucking and delivery field.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Ingram, after interviewing her for the branch manager position, Gaherity told her that she was well-suited for an assistant branch manager position. Indeed, even the new branch manager, Harrington, agreed and expressly recommended Ingram for the position. But Gaherity hesitated, reporting to Harrington that Ingram lacked the requisite experience and qualifications. Gaherity proposed that someone from outside the company be hired instead &#8212; David Hardy, the eventual hire for the position. Harrington rejected Hardy because he had no experience in the armored car industry, and because Hardy had explicitly stated his concerns about the job's safety hazards during his interview with Harrington. As of December 2000, the assistant branch manager position remained vacant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram delivered her second child on February 22, 2001, and took maternity leave through April 2001, although she continued to come to work once a week. In March 2001, Harrington assured Ingram that he would relate to Gaherity that she was still his pick for assistant manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Ingram saw the assistant branch manager position advertised in a local newspaper. When she confronted Harrington, he told her that Gaherity was resisting her promotion. Then, in mid-April 2001, Harrington showed Ingram an email message stating that Brink's was eliminating the assistant branch manager title in favor of the operations manager title, the very title that she already held. According to Brink's, the title was changed to more accurately reflect the duties of the position. The internal posting for the position was changed to reflect the title change, but was otherwise identical to the prior posting. It is unclear from the record what the relationship was between the title change and Ingram's existing job title and duties. What is clear is that, by this juncture, Ingram was convinced that the company had no intention of promoting her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2001, Harrington resigned without warning. Gaherity visited the Lawrence branch the following day, and he and Ingram had an emotional confrontation. Ingram expressed her anger at being passed over for promotion several times. Gaherity told Ingram that she could have the promotion to assistant branch manager, and that he would make a phone call to accomplish her promotion \"in an hour.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Gaherity did send an email to his supervisor, Jim Tingley, requesting that Ingram be appointed to the assistant branch manager/operations manager position, with an accompanying salary increase to $45,000, an $8,000 increase over Ingram's salary at the time and $3,000 more than Hosfeld made as assistant branch manager. The next morning, Tingley forwarded the email, along with a strong endorsement of his own, to Senior Vice President Greg Hanno. On May 18, 2001, Hanno approved the request. Weinstock, who was assisting with the management of the Lawrence branch in the face of Harrington's sudden resignation, called Ingram at home to formally offer her the promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By this time, however, Ingram was on medical leave on the advice of her doctor. After not hearing back from Gaherity to confirm her promotion after their confrontation on May 1, Ingram reports leaving the office \"a wreck, a total wreck.\" She visited her doctor who told her to take medical leave for stress. She was still on medical leave on May 18, 2001, when Harrington called to offer her the promotion. Ingram told him that she would think about the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Ingram looked for another job. On May 30, she took a job at Genesys Software Systems with a starting salary of $47,000 per year. Notably, Ingram cited her $45,000 salary at Brink's (the amount offered with the promotion) when applying to Genesys. By letter dated May 31, 2001, Ingram resigned from Brink's, admitting that their most recent offer was what she had sought but that \"it took too long.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-June 2001, Hardy was hired as assistant branch manager/operations manager for the Lawrence branch. His starting salary was $50,000, $5,000 more than Brink's offered Ingram just one month prior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedural History Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram filed a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) on August 8, 2001. The claim alleged violations of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151B &#167;&#167; 4(1) and (16A), relating to promotions she sought during her employment with Brink's dating back to December 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 2002, Ingram filed a complaint in Essex Superior Court. The Complaint alleged a pattern and practice of gender and pregnancy discrimination by Brink's, in violation of M.G.L. ch. 151B &#167; 4(1). On July 2, 2002, Brink's removed the case to federal court. On April 24, 2003, Ingram filed an Amended Complaint, adding a federal claim under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 206(d), on the ground that both Hosfeld and Hardy were paid more than her for performing substantially equal work while they were assistant branch managers of the Lawrence branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 2004, the district court entered a memorandum and order granting Brinks' motion for summary judgment on both the state and federal claims. Pursuant to the burden-shifting framework laid out in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), Judge Keeton concluded that Brink's could successfully rebut a prima facie showing of discrimination by showing that Ingram was eventually offered the very promotion that she claims she was denied, and that Ingram could not rebut with a showing of pretext or discriminatory animus. <i>See</i> Memorandum and Order, <i>Ingram v. Brink's, Inc.,</i> Civil Action No. 02-11333-REK, (D.Mass. September 7, 2004) at 11-13 (\"Memorandum and Order of September 7, 2004\"). With regard to Ingram's claim under the Equal Pay Act, the district court found that Ingram could not show that she received less pay than any male employee performing \"equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort and responsibility,\" as required by <i>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan,</i> 417 U.S. 188, 195, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974).

Once the moving party avers the absence of genuine issues of material fact, the nonmovant must show that a factual dispute does exist, but summary judgment cannot be defeated by relying on improbable inferences, conclusory allegations, or rank speculation. <i>See Mesnick v.

Gen. Laws ch. 151B. In relevant part, ch. 151B &#167; 4(1) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate on the basis of sex in hiring, firing, compensating, or in providing other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The protections of this provision have been interpreted to apply to plaintiffs asserting claims of sex discrimination stemming from their pregnancy. <i>Gunther v. Gap, Inc.,</i> 1 F.Supp.2d 73 (D.Mass.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party disputes that the applicable limitations period is six months, since ch. 151B &#167; 5 as it existed before 2002 requires a plaintiff to file a charge with the MCAD no later than six months after the alleged act of discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Ocean Spray Cranberries v. MCAD,</i> 441 Mass. 632, 641, 808 N.E.2d 257 (2004). Accordingly, only events taking place between February 8, 2001, and August 8, 2001, the day that Ingram filed her claim with the MCAD, are actionable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> To be sure, discriminatory acts or practices that predate or postdate the actionable period can be used as relevant background evidence. <i>Rathbun,</i> 361 F.3d at 76. But the problem with Ingram's case is more fundamental: While the prior acts that Ingram describes can be introduced to provide a background for or evidence of animus in connection with an adverse decision, without an adverse decision within the limitations period, the discrimination inquiry simply stops.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following events occurred during the actionable six-month period between February 8, 2001, and August 8, 2001:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2001, Harrington, the newly appointed branch manager, assured Ingram that he would tell Gaherity that she was his choice for assistant manager, although he asked Ingram whether she would be able to meet the demands of the job with two small children. She assured him that she would.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding Harrington's assurances, while Ingram was still on maternity leave, Brink's advertised the assistant branch manager position in the local newspaper. Gaherity, it appears, was still resisting Ingram's promotion. And then, on April 11, 2001, evidence suggested that Brink's was eliminating the assistant branch manager position in favor of an \"Operations Manager,\" Ingram's job title at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2001, after Harrington's resignation, Ingram reiterated her desire for the assistant branch manager title and corresponding salary. While Gaherity assured her that he would get the job for her that very day, he did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 18, 2001, Brink's finally offered Ingram the promotion and salary raise to $45,000. Ingram, however, turned it down and instead accepted a higher paying job with a different firm. On May 31, 2001, Ingram formally resigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks later, Brink's hired Hardy for the assistant branch manager/operations manager position at a starting salary of $50,000, $5,000 more than Brink's offered Ingram the month prior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The <i>McDonnell</i> Burden-Shifting Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employment discrimination claims, including failure-to-promote claims brought under ch. 151B, are reviewed according to the burden-shifting framework articulated in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>See Wheelock College v. MCAD,</i> 371 Mass. 130, 355 N.E.2d 309 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where there is no direct evidence of discriminatory intent &#8212; no smoking gun &#8212; the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination. <i>McDonnell,</i> 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. In a failure-to-promote claim, the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) she was qualified for an open position for which she applied, (3) she was rejected, and (4) someone possessing similar qualifications filled the position instead. <i>Rathbun,</i> 361 F.3d at 71. If a prima facie case is made out, an inference of intentional discrimination is raised, and the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision(s). <i>Id.</i> If the employer does so, the burden of production reverts to the plaintiff, who then must prove that the employer's neutral reasons were actually a pretext for the alleged discrimination. <i>Id.; see also Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, as is the case here, the plaintiff fails to make it past the first stage, i.e. to aver a prima facie case, the inference of discrimination simply never arises and the employer's motion for summary judgment is granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Merits of Ingram's Failure-to-Hire Claim</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court found, it is beyond dispute that (1) Ingram is a member of a protected class based on her sex and her pregnancy status during the relevant period, and (2) she applied for the assistant manager position. One could even conclude that Ingram was qualified for the assistant branch manager position, as Brink's apparently believed. The problem is with respect to the third prong of the test &#8212; an adverse employment action. Ingram finally got the promotion that she wanted and she turned it down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram argues that three events occurring after February 8, 2001 can be construed as a de facto rejection of her for the assistant manager position &#8212; (1) the April 2001 advertisement for the assistant manager position, notwithstanding earlier assurances that the job was her's, (2) the elimination in April 2001 of the assistant branch manager position in favor of operations manager, the title Ingram held, and (3) Gaherity's unfulfilled promise to secure Ingram the assistant manager position \"within an hour\" on May 2, 2001. But these events, while they surely may have been frustrating to Ingram, comprise nothing more than delays in the decision making process which are not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly found that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the first or second occasion amounted to a rejection. The process of finding a candidate for the assistant manager position continued; no one else was hired. After Ingram brought the newspaper advertisement to Harrington's attention, he told her that Gaherity was \"resisting\" his recommendation, not that Gaherity had conclusively rejected Ingram for the position. And, in the second instance, the change in title from \"assistant branch manager\" to \"operations manager\" was nothing more than an upper-management decision to change the title of the position to more accurately reflect its role and responsibilities. While the significance of the title change is not at all clear, it surely did not spell rejection for Ingram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court characterized the third instance &#8212; Gaherity's failed promise to secure Ingram the promotion \"in an hour\" &#8212; as a closer call, and then passed on the question, finding no need to decide whether this instance amounted to a rejection because Ingram's claim failed at another point in the <i>McDonnell</i> test, namely Brink's ability to rebut a prima facie showing of discrimination with legitimate non-discriminatory motives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to construe Gaherity's actions on May 2, 2001, as a rejection. Indeed, after boasting to Ingram that he could secure her the promotion within the hour, Gaherity left the Lawrence branch and promptly drafted an email to his supervisor emphatically recommending Ingram for the assistant manager/operations manager position. Gaherity's email set the hiring process in motion, and, only two weeks later, Ingram was offered the promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Gaherity's initial assurances about how quickly he could effect her promotion were nothing more than a boast. But his empty boasts hardly amounted to a rejection. On the contrary, Ingram was offered the promotion within a relatively short time thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without establishing that she was rejected for the promotion within the actionable time frame, Ingram cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination and her failure-to-promote claim falters. Central to the first stage of the <i>McDonnell</i> framework, is evidence of an adverse employment decision. To be sure, the favorable decision did not come as quickly as Ingram would have liked, and she had her hopes dashed on more than one occasion. But in the final analysis, she got the job and she chose not to take it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Such a showing is harder to make than the prima facie showing under the <i>McDonnell</i> framework because it requires the plaintiff to identify specific employees of the opposite sex holding positions requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility under similar working positions who were more generously compensated. <i>Petsch-Schmid v. Boston Edison Co.,</i> 914 F.Supp. 697 (D.Mass.1996). The EPA is more concerned with substance than title, so Ingram is free to bring EPA claims against male employees holding different positions than she held <i>if</i> she can establish that they performed comparable work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Equal responsibility,\" as it is used in the Act, is defined as \"concern[ing] the degree of accountability required in the performance of the job, with emphasis on the importance of the job obligation.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1620.17. \"Establishment,\" as it is used in the Act, refers to \"a distinct physical place of business rather than to an entire business or `enterprise' which may include several separate places of business.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1620.9. Accordingly, Ingram's EPA claim focuses on two male employees within a single establishment &#8212; the Lawrence branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of an unlawful wage differential, the burden shifts to the employer to show that the differential is justified under one of the Act's four exceptions. At this stage, the Act's exceptions serve as affirmative defenses on which the employer carries the burden of proof, not just production. <i>Corning Glass,</i> 417 U.S. at 196, 94 S.Ct. 2223.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Merits of Ingram's EPA Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly noted that Ingram provided scant evidence showing that she was paid less than Hardy and Hosfeld for jobs requiring equal responsibility. Ingram provides no specifics as to Hardy's job functions while he was assistant branch manager after her resignation from Brink's,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and the specifics she provides with regard to Hosfeld's job functions while he was assistant branch manager indicate that his responsibilities were distinct from hers, and significantly more demanding. Based on these facts, Ingram's pay discrimination claim is not viable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ingram makes much of Hardy's $50,000 starting salary as assistant branch manager, $5,000 more than she was offered just a few weeks earlier. But Ingram turned down Brinks' promotion offer because she found another job paying more than the $45,000 that they offered her. But Ingram was never paid less than Hardy for the same job &#8212; she never took the job &#8212; and Hardy was offered more after Ingram had already left the company (quite possibly because the company got the message that they were not offering enough).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Ingram alleges that Hosfeld was paid $4000 more per year than she was paid while he was the Lawrence assistant manager. Based on the record, however, Hosfeld and Ingram performed distinct duties. Hosfeld's responsibilities included \"learning more of the operation of the branch, learning more of budgeting, being available 24 hours, seven days a week, overall supervision of the facility, opening and closing, staffing, dispatching, scheduling the runs, scheduling the personnel,\" and on and on. Meanwhile, by her own description, Ingram's responsibilities as operations manager were largely administrative, including maintaining billing records, preparing monthly financial reports, handling customer service issues related to billing, and performing vault audits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, both of the male employees that she alleges were being paid more for performing equal responsibilities were paid as assistant managers, a position that she never held either in title or substance. By all accounts, their duties and responsibilities were distinctly more demanding, requiring more skill breadth and training, than Ingram's duties as branch supervisor or operations manager. Without more, Ingram has failed to show that Brink's compensated certain male employees at higher rates for performing jobs requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, the district court's entry of summary judgment for Defendant-Appellee Brink's is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At least two members of Brink's management testified that they had never heard of the branch supervisor position before this lawsuit commenced</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Ingram presented the branch manager with a note from her doctor indicating that no painting should take place in her immediate work areas, and suggesting that an air purifier be installed.

Regs. &#167; 1.03(2), recognizing that \"some claims of discrimination involve a series of related events that have to be viewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and impact.\"<i>Cuddyer v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.,</i> 434 Mass. 521, 531, 750 N.E.2d 928 (2001). For the continuing violation exception to apply, the plaintiff must prove that (1) at least one discriminatory act occurred within the six-month limitations period, (2) the alleged timely discriminatory act has a substantial relationship to the alleged untimely discriminatory act(s), and (3) earlier violations outside the six-month limitations period did not trigger the plaintiff's awareness and duty to assert her rights. <i>Desrosiers v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,</i> 885 F.Supp. 308, 312 (D.Mass.1995).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The continuing violation exception is unavailable to Ingram. Failure-to-hire claims, like Ingram's, generally do not fit into the exception because the discriminatory act alleged is discrete and cabined, as opposed to hostile work environment claims in which the discrimination alleged is itself a culmination of ongoing workplace attributes. Indeed, in interpreting the meaning of \"act of discrimination\" as it appears in the applicable statute of limitations, the SJC noted that \"[i]n some instances, the precise moment of the `act of discrimination' is easy to calculate: plainly, if an employee is denied a promotion on an improper basis, the date of the `act of discrimination' is the date of that denial.\" <i>Ocean Spray,</i> 441 Mass. at 641, 808 N.E.2d 257.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In an EPA action, it is appropriate to compare the plaintiff-employee's compensation to that of her immediate (and non-immediate) successors and predecessors<i>See Broadus v.

Finding no error, we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brink's is a nationwide corporation whose core business is providing secure, armored transportation of valuables. Brink's operates from local, largely autonomous branches that vary widely in size from five to hundreds of employees. Branches are administered by a branch manager with the assistance of an assistant branch manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram worked at Brink's for nearly three years. She was hired in September 1998 and resigned in May 2001. Although her work was exemplary, she claims that she was passed over for a number of promotions between 1998 and early 2001. The fatal problem for Ingram's discrimination claims, however, is her failure to file suit until August 2001, by which time her earlier grievances were time barred. The only relevant hiring decision during the applicable limitations period was the decision to fill the Lawrence assistant branch manager position, but that decision was favorable to Ingram as she was offered the job. But she rejected it for a better paying one outside the company. Although Ingram goes to great lengths to describe a pattern of sex-based discrimination during her first two years with the company, without a showing of an adverse employment action within the limitations period, Ingram cannot make out even the minimal prima facie case of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the Equal Pay Act claim, Ingram alleges that there were two male employees in the Lawrence branch and several male employees throughout the company who were paid more than she was paid for performing comparable work. But the only two employees that Ingram names &#8212; David Hardy and Jeffrey Hosfeld &#8212; were assistant branch managers. Ingram never formally held that position; she turned it down when it was offered to her. Nor did she effectively perform the same duties while she was in other positions. Without more, her pay discrimination claim cannot prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Ingram's Employment from September 1998 through December 2000</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram took her first position at Brink's in September 1998 as Chief Office Employee of its Lawrence, Massachusetts branch at an hourly wage of $11.50. The job was largely administrative and clerical. By November 1998, according to the branch manager, Ingram had become \"a great asset\" to the Lawrence branch, and was reclassified from an hourly employee to a salaried employee earning $28,000 per year. Her new job title was \"branch supervisor,\" a rare, non-managerial position with flexible duties depending on the needs of the individual branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that Ingram was hired, the Lawrence branch had no assistant branch manager. In December 1998, two months after she began working at Brink's, the assistant manager position was posted. Ingram applied, although she conceded in her application that a co-worker deserved the promotion because of his longer tenure with the company. Neither was hired; the assistant branch manager position was not filled, and the company stopped recruiting applicants until 2000 when the vacancy was posted again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1999 Ingram became pregnant. She claims no adverse employment consequence attributable to her pregnancy except for a dispute about the painting of the Lawrence branch.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> While on maternity leave, in January 2000, the assistant branch manager position in Lawrence was posted once again. For the first time, the posting stated that the assistant branch manager will be required \"to learn every run and make recommendations for route restructuring.\" And it included a new requirement for on-call availability seven days per week, which Ingram, as a new mother, found to be virtually impossible. She nevertheless expressed an interest in the position to David Weinstock, the Lawrence branch manager at the time. He responded that she needed \"more armored experience.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that Ingram had never worked in the armored vehicle industry before her employment with Brink's, and had no experience working on the armored trucks even within Brink's, Weinstock had never before mentioned the need for her to gain \"armored experience.\" Indeed, notwithstanding this supposed deficiency, Weinstock rated her as \"outstanding\" in seventeen out of twenty categories on her February 2000 performance review. And in the section assessing areas in which Ingram needed to improve, Weinstock made no mention of the need for armored experience. In any event, when Ingram returned from maternity leave in March 2000 she set out to obtain armored experience by accompanying drivers and messengers on runs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2000, Brink's appointed Jeffrey Hosfeld to the assistant branch manager position that had then been vacant for over two years. Hosfeld was a former corrections officer and had previously served as a Brink's branch supervisor in another branch, the same title that Ingram had, where he earned $4,000 more per year than Ingram despite what Ingram describes as comparable experience and job responsibilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In support of her challenge to Hosfeld being promoted instead of her, Ingram also claims &#8212; contradicting herself &#8212; that Hosfeld had no experience in the administrative side of business operations prior to his appointment as assistant branch manager. In any case, Hosfeld apparently had extensive experience in the field working on armored trucks, as required by the assistant branch manager job posting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Weinstock was promoted to regional management, leaving the Lawrence branch without a branch manager. Brink's posted the branch manager position, specifying that it required a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. Ingram expressed an interest in the position. Weinstock recommended her to his supervisor, Thomas Szczepanski. Szczepanski disagreed and chose a male, Mark Albright, on the ground that Albright was more qualified because he had a bachelor's degree and Ingram did not. However, Szczepanski offered Ingram a branch manager position at a smaller branch in Rochester, New York, although he acknowledged that she probably was not interested in moving in light of her recent maternity. Ingram did not pursue the Rochester position. In June 2000, Albright was appointed to the branch manager position, replacing Weinstock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2000, Ingram was promoted to the position of \"Operations Manager.\" Her salary was raised to $37,000 per year from $28,000 per year.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter Albright left the Lawrence branch manager position and the vacancy was posted yet again. Ingram again expressed an interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In early-October 2000, Szczepanski appointed Tim Messner, the Syracuse branch manager, as interim manager of the Lawrence branch while a more thorough search for a permanent branch manager could be conducted. As interim branch manager, Messner split his time between the Syracuse and Lawrence branches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Position At Issue &#8212; Assistant Branch Manager</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-October 2000, Hosfeld, then the Lawrence assistant branch manager, transferred to another branch, leaving vacant both the assistant branch manager and branch manager positions. Ingram applied for the former. In her letter of application, Ingram acknowledged that she did not feel ready for the branch manager position, but was \"unequivocally prepared to successfully function in the capacity of Assistant Manager.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ingram applied, Jim Gaherity, Szczepanski's replacement as regional manager, informed Ingram that he was keeping the assistant branch manager position open until the branch manager position was filled. He wanted the new branch manager to be involved in the selection of his staff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram then expressed an interest in the branch manager's position despite her admission only weeks earlier that she was not qualified for it. Gaherity, the regional manager, rejected Ingram, appointing Daniel Harrington in her stead. Harrington had worked at Brink's since February 1999, six months after Ingram was hired. Although at the time of his appointment to branch manager, Harrington was working as a messenger in the Lawrence branch, Harrington had spent over fifteen years in management positions in the trucking and delivery field before joining Brink's. In contrast, before her employment with Brink's, Ingram had no experience in the trucking and delivery field.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Ingram, after interviewing her for the branch manager position, Gaherity told her that she was well-suited for an assistant branch manager position. Indeed, even the new branch manager, Harrington, agreed and expressly recommended Ingram for the position. But Gaherity hesitated, reporting to Harrington that Ingram lacked the requisite experience and qualifications. Gaherity proposed that someone from outside the company be hired instead &#8212; David Hardy, the eventual hire for the position. Harrington rejected Hardy because he had no experience in the armored car industry, and because Hardy had explicitly stated his concerns about the job's safety hazards during his interview with Harrington. As of December 2000, the assistant branch manager position remained vacant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram delivered her second child on February 22, 2001, and took maternity leave through April 2001, although she continued to come to work once a week. In March 2001, Harrington assured Ingram that he would relate to Gaherity that she was still his pick for assistant manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Ingram saw the assistant branch manager position advertised in a local newspaper. When she confronted Harrington, he told her that Gaherity was resisting her promotion. Then, in mid-April 2001, Harrington showed Ingram an email message stating that Brink's was eliminating the assistant branch manager title in favor of the operations manager title, the very title that she already held. According to Brink's, the title was changed to more accurately reflect the duties of the position. The internal posting for the position was changed to reflect the title change, but was otherwise identical to the prior posting. It is unclear from the record what the relationship was between the title change and Ingram's existing job title and duties. What is clear is that, by this juncture, Ingram was convinced that the company had no intention of promoting her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, 2001, Harrington resigned without warning. Gaherity visited the Lawrence branch the following day, and he and Ingram had an emotional confrontation. Ingram expressed her anger at being passed over for promotion several times. Gaherity told Ingram that she could have the promotion to assistant branch manager, and that he would make a phone call to accomplish her promotion \"in an hour.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Gaherity did send an email to his supervisor, Jim Tingley, requesting that Ingram be appointed to the assistant branch manager/operations manager position, with an accompanying salary increase to $45,000, an $8,000 increase over Ingram's salary at the time and $3,000 more than Hosfeld made as assistant branch manager. The next morning, Tingley forwarded the email, along with a strong endorsement of his own, to Senior Vice President Greg Hanno. On May 18, 2001, Hanno approved the request. Weinstock, who was assisting with the management of the Lawrence branch in the face of Harrington's sudden resignation, called Ingram at home to formally offer her the promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By this time, however, Ingram was on medical leave on the advice of her doctor. After not hearing back from Gaherity to confirm her promotion after their confrontation on May 1, Ingram reports leaving the office \"a wreck, a total wreck.\" She visited her doctor who told her to take medical leave for stress. She was still on medical leave on May 18, 2001, when Harrington called to offer her the promotion. Ingram told him that she would think about the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Ingram looked for another job.

One could even conclude that Ingram was qualified for the assistant branch manager position, as Brink's apparently believed. The problem is with respect to the third prong of the test &#8212; an adverse employment action. Ingram finally got the promotion that she wanted and she turned it down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ingram argues that three events occurring after February 8, 2001 can be construed as a de facto rejection of her for the assistant manager position &#8212; (1) the April 2001 advertisement for the assistant manager position, notwithstanding earlier assurances that the job was her's, (2) the elimination in April 2001 of the assistant branch manager position in favor of operations manager, the title Ingram held, and (3) Gaherity's unfulfilled promise to secure Ingram the assistant manager position \"within an hour\" on May 2, 2001. But these events, while they surely may have been frustrating to Ingram, comprise nothing more than delays in the decision making process which are not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly found that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the first or second occasion amounted to a rejection. The process of finding a candidate for the assistant manager position continued; no one else was hired. After Ingram brought the newspaper advertisement to Harrington's attention, he told her that Gaherity was \"resisting\" his recommendation, not that Gaherity had conclusively rejected Ingram for the position. And, in the second instance, the change in title from \"assistant branch manager\" to \"operations manager\" was nothing more than an upper-management decision to change the title of the position to more accurately reflect its role and responsibilities. While the significance of the title change is not at all clear, it surely did not spell rejection for Ingram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court characterized the third instance &#8212; Gaherity's failed promise to secure Ingram the promotion \"in an hour\" &#8212; as a closer call, and then passed on the question, finding no need to decide whether this instance amounted to a rejection because Ingram's claim failed at another point in the <i>McDonnell</i> test, namely Brink's ability to rebut a prima facie showing of discrimination with legitimate non-discriminatory motives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to construe Gaherity's actions on May 2, 2001, as a rejection. Indeed, after boasting to Ingram that he could secure her the promotion within the hour, Gaherity left the Lawrence branch and promptly drafted an email to his supervisor emphatically recommending Ingram for the assistant manager/operations manager position. Gaherity's email set the hiring process in motion, and, only two weeks later, Ingram was offered the promotion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Gaherity's initial assurances about how quickly he could effect her promotion were nothing more than a boast. But his empty boasts hardly amounted to a rejection. On the contrary, Ingram was offered the promotion within a relatively short time thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without establishing that she was rejected for the promotion within the actionable time frame, Ingram cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination and her failure-to-promote claim falters. Central to the first stage of the <i>McDonnell</i> framework, is evidence of an adverse employment decision. To be sure, the favorable decision did not come as quickly as Ingram would have liked, and she had her hopes dashed on more than one occasion. But in the final analysis, she got the job and she chose not to take it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Such a showing is harder to make than the prima facie showing under the <i>McDonnell</i> framework because it requires the plaintiff to identify specific employees of the opposite sex holding positions requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility under similar working positions who were more generously compensated. <i>Petsch-Schmid v.

But Ingram was never paid less than Hardy for the same job &#8212; she never took the job &#8212; and Hardy was offered more after Ingram had already left the company (quite possibly because the company got the message that they were not offering enough).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Ingram alleges that Hosfeld was paid $4000 more per year than she was paid while he was the Lawrence assistant manager. Based on the record, however, Hosfeld and Ingram performed distinct duties. Hosfeld's responsibilities included \"learning more of the operation of the branch, learning more of budgeting, being available 24 hours, seven days a week, overall supervision of the facility, opening and closing, staffing, dispatching, scheduling the runs, scheduling the personnel,\" and on and on. Meanwhile, by her own description, Ingram's responsibilities as operations manager were largely administrative, including maintaining billing records, preparing monthly financial reports, handling customer service issues related to billing, and performing vault audits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, both of the male employees that she alleges were being paid more for performing equal responsibilities were paid as assistant managers, a position that she never held either in title or substance. By all accounts, their duties and responsibilities were distinctly more demanding, requiring more skill breadth and training, than Ingram's duties as branch supervisor or operations manager. Without more, Ingram has failed to show that Brink's compensated certain male employees at higher rates for performing jobs requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, the district court's entry of summary judgment for Defendant-Appellee Brink's is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At least two members of Brink's management testified that they had never heard of the branch supervisor position before this lawsuit commenced</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Ingram presented the branch manager with a note from her doctor indicating that no painting should take place in her immediate work areas, and suggesting that an air purifier be installed.

Regs. &#167; 1.03(2), recognizing that \"some claims of discrimination involve a series of related events that have to be viewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and impact.\"<i>Cuddyer v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></span>, 531, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span> (2001). For the continuing violation exception to apply, the plaintiff must prove that (1) at least one discriminatory act occurred within the six-month limitations period, (2) the alleged timely discriminatory act has a substantial relationship to the alleged untimely discriminatory act(s), and (3) earlier violations outside the six-month limitations period did not trigger the plaintiff's awareness and duty to assert her rights. <i>Desrosiers v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399562/desrosiers-v-great-atlantic-pacific-tea-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Failure-to-hire claims, like Ingram's, generally do not fit into the exception because the discriminatory act alleged is discrete and cabined, as opposed to hostile work environment claims in which the discrimination alleged is itself a culmination of ongoing workplace attributes. Indeed, in interpreting the meaning of \"act of discrimination\" as it appears in the applicable statute of limitations, the SJC noted that \"[i]n some instances, the precise moment of the `act of discrimination' is easy to calculate: plainly, if an employee is denied a promotion on an improper basis, the date of the `act of discrimination' is the date of that denial.\" <i>Ocean Spray,</i> 441 Mass. at 641, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In an EPA action, it is appropriate to compare the plaintiff-employee's compensation to that of her immediate (and non-immediate) successors and predecessors<i>See Broadus v.
