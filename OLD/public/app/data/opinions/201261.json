Zuckermann, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                          September 29, 2004\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f            PER CURIAM.      On August 22, 2001, Defendant-Appellant\n\nSilverio Cordoza-Estrada, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted of\n\nsimple assault in New Hampshire state district court for punching\n\na man in the face, breaking his nose.            He was sentenced to twelve\n\nmonths of imprisonment with ten months suspended.             Following this\n\nconviction, Cordoza-Estrada was deported.             Two years later, he was\n\narrested at his place of work in Hudson, New Hampshire.                 After\n\npleading guilty to a one-count information, Cordoza-Estrada was\n\nconvicted of re-entering the United States after being deported, in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1326(a) and 1326(b)(2), and sentenced to\n\neighteen months of imprisonment and three years of supervised\n\nrelease.     He now appeals his sentence, arguing that his prior\n\nconviction    for   a   simple   assault   was    a   misdemeanor   under   New\n\nHampshire law and should not have been treated as an “aggravated\n\nfelony” under § 1326(b)(2) or U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n(“U.S.S.G.”) § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) (Nov. 2002).             Appellant also argues\n\nthat his sentence is invalid under Blakely v. Washington, 124 S.\n\nCt. 2531 (2004).\n\n     1.    Aggravated Felony\n\n     We review whether the conviction is an aggravated felony de\n\nnovo.     United States v. Santos, 363 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nSubsection 1326(b)(2) provides that an alien removed “subsequent to\n\na conviction for a commission of an aggravated felony” shall be\n\nfined or imprisoned for not more than twenty years, up from two\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fyears for simple illegal re-entry under § 1326(a).   The definition\n\nof “aggravated felony” is found in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F), which\n\nstates that the term includes “a crime of violence . . . for which\n\nthe term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.”    The definition\n\nof “term of imprisonment” in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(B) is “the\n\nperiod of incarceration . . . ordered by a court of law regardless\n\nof any suspension of the imposition or execution of that . . .\n\nsentence in whole or in part.”\n\n     The Sentencing Guideline applicable to unlawfully re-entering\n\nor remaining in the United States under § 1326 provides that the\n\nbase offense level of eight is increased by eight levels for a\n\ndefendant who was deported after a “conviction for an aggravated\n\nfelony.”   U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).   Application Note 2 states:\n\n“For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C) ‘aggravated felony’ has the\n\nmeaning given that term in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), without regard\n\nto the date of conviction of the aggravated felony.”\n\n     Appellant argues that the statutory definition of “aggravated\n\nfelony” is ambiguous because it encompasses crimes traditionally\n\nregarded as misdemeanors, as well as felonies, and urges that under\n\nthe rule of lenity, he should not have been subject to the enhanced\n\npenalty provision in § 1326(b)(2).1      He cites two dissenting\n\n\n     1\n          “Crime of violence,” as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16(a),\nincludes an offense that has “as an element, the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another.”   Appellant does not dispute that the New\nHampshire assault misdemeanor falls within this definition.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fopinions to support his argument.         See United States v. Pacheco,\n\n225 F.3d 148, 158 (2d Cir. 2000) (Straub, J., dissenting) (“To\n\ninclude misdemeanors within the definition of ‘aggravated felony’\n\nturns the plain meaning of the word ‘aggravated’ entirely on its\n\nhead, since in addition to not being felonies in the first place,\n\nmisdemeanors are conventionally understood as being less severe\n\nthan felonies, as well.”), cert. denied, 533 U.S. 904 (2001);\n\nUnited States v. Gonzales-Vela, 276 F.3d 763, 768 (6th Cir. 2001)\n\n(Merritt, J., dissenting) (same).\n\n     We    agree   with   the   phalanx   of   circuit   courts   that   have\n\nrejected similar challenges and held that the statutory definition\n\nof the term “aggravated felony” in § 1101(a)(43) is a term of art\n\nthat includes within its ambit certain misdemeanors under state law\n\nthat carry a sentence of at least one year.         See Pacheco, 225 F.3d\n\nat 154-55; United States v. Graham, 169 F.3d 787, 792 (3d Cir.\n\n1999); Wireko v. Reno, 211 F.3d 833 (4th Cir. 2000); United States\n\nv. Urias-Escobar, 281 F.3d 165, 167-68 (5th Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Gonzales-Vela, 276 F.3d 763, 767-68 (6th Cir. 2001);\n\nGuerrero-Perez v. INS, 242 F.3d 727, 734-37 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Tamariz, 310 F.3d 1168, 1170-71 (9th Cir.\n\n2002); United States v. Saenz-Mendoza, 287 F.3d 1011, 1014-15 (10th\n\nCir. 2002); United States v. Christopher, 239 F.3d 1191, 1193-94\n\n(11th Cir. 2001).\n\n          Under this caselaw, the pivotal question is not whether a\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcrime is labeled a felony or a misdemeanor under state law, or\n\nwhether it has conventionally been considered a misdemeanor, but\n\nwhether the crime meets the explicit definition of “aggravated\n\nfelony” under § 1101(a)(43)(F).       The rule of lenity does not apply\n\nsimply because a statute requires interpretation.             See United\n\nStates v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2002) (“It is only when\n\nno reasonably clear meaning can be gleaned from the text of a\n\nstatute, leaving courts to guess at what Congress intended, that\n\nthe rule of lenity comes into play.”).           Because Appellant was\n\nsentenced to “at least one year” for the assault, he was convicted\n\nof an “aggravated felony” as defined under federal law.\n\n     Appellant similarly argues that U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) is\n\nambiguous    because   his   simple    assault   conviction   meets   the\n\ndefinition of a misdemeanor in Application Note 3(A), which defines\n\n“misdemeanor” as “any federal, state or local offense punishable by\n\na term of imprisonment of one year or less,” and does not fall\n\nwithin the definition of “felony” in Application Note 1(B)(iv),\n\nwhich defines “felony” as “any federal, state, or local offense\n\npunishable by a term exceeding one year.”             That argument is\n\nunpersuasive in light of Application Note 2, which specifically\n\ndefines     “aggravated   felony”     in   U.S.S.G.   §   2L1.2(b)(1)(C)\n\nequivalently with 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).         Accord Saenz-Mendoza,\n\n287 F.3d at 1013-14; cf. United States v. Simpson, 319 F.3d 81, 85-\n\n87 (2d Cir. 2002) (discussing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B)).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f      Some courts have suggested that it is nonsensical for a single\n\none-year sentence involving a crime of violence to be treated as an\n\naggravated felony, bringing an eight-level increase, whereas three\n\none-year misdemeanors that are crimes of violence could entail only\n\na four-level increase under U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(E).              See United\n\nStates v. Ponce-Casalez, 212 F. Supp. 2d 43, 45-47 (D.R.I. 2003);\n\nPacheco, 225 F.3d at 150 (Straub, J., dissenting) (“Moreover, if\n\n‘aggravated felony’ is read to include misdemeanor crimes of\n\nviolence, the incongruous result would follow that the commission\n\nof three or more misdemeanors involving ‘crimes against the person’\n\nis punishable by a prison term up to 10 years, while the commission\n\nof   just   one   misdemeanor     involving   a   ‘crime   of    violence’   is\n\npunishable by a prison term up to 20 years.”).                  Nonetheless, §\n\n2L1.2(b)(1) instructs the court to “Apply the Greatest” sentencing\n\nenhancement.      Thus, the crime must be treated as an aggravated\n\nfelony subject to an eight-level increase.           See Simpson, 319 F.3d\n\nat 87.\n\n\n\n      2.    Blakely\n\n      The   day   before   oral   argument,   Appellant     filed    a   letter\n\npursuant to Local Rule 28(j) arguing that the sentence was unlawful\n\non the ground that Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004),\n\nand Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), undermine the\n\nSupreme Court’s ruling in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fU.S. 224, 235 (1998), which held that the prior “aggravated felony”\n\nlanguage    of   8   U.S.C.   §   1326(b)(2)     refers   to     a   sentencing\n\nenhancement, not to an element of the offense.                 The letter also\n\nadvocated    that    Appellant    should   be   resentenced     because   post-\n\nBlakely, the Federal Guidelines are merely advisory.\n\n     Since Appellant’s argument depends upon a decision that did\n\nnot exist at the time of briefing, a 28(j) letter is a perfectly\n\nappropriate avenue by which to present it –- such letters are\n\nintended to provide the court with new authority.               See Freeman v.\n\nBarnhart, 274 F.3d 606, 609 (1st Cir. 2001) (accepting Rule 28(j)\n\nletter making new arguments where they could not have been made\n\nbefore and the relevant statute permitted court to order new\n\nevidence taken at any time).         The Government does not argue that\n\nthe issue was raised in an untimely manner and has filed a Rule\n\n28(j) letter in response.\n\n     The parties agree that the standard is plain error. Under the\n\nplain error test, an appellant “‘bears the burden of demonstrating\n\n(1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial\n\nrights (i.e., the error was not harmless), and (4) that seriously\n\nundermines    the    fairness,    integrity,    and   public    reputation   of\n\njudicial proceedings.’”       United States v. McCormack, 371 F.3d 22,\n\n29 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. Fazal-Ur-Raheman-\n\nFazal, 355 F.3d 40, 48 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n     In Apprendi, the Supreme Court stated: “Other than the fact of\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fa prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\n\nbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”        530 U.S. at 490\n\n(emphasis added).   Blakely did not disturb the distinction between\n\n“the fact of a prior conviction” and other facts that “increase the\n\npenalty for a crime beyond a prescribed maximum.”    Blakely, 124 S.\n\nCt. at 2536 (quoting and applying the Apprendi rule stated above).\n\nAccordingly, there was no error in the trial judge’s consideration\n\nof the prior conviction.      Even if there were such an error,\n\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate that it   affected substantial\n\nrights of his because there is no dispute that he had a conviction.\n\nSee United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 632 (2002) (in a review\n\nof an Apprendi error, holding that the “third inquiry usually means\n\nthat the error must have affected the outcome of the district\n\ncourt’s proceedings”).\n\n     Appellant has also launched a broadside attack on the validity\n\nof the Sentencing Guidelines under the Sixth Amendment.     Even if\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines as a whole are ultimately declared\n\ninvalid, we must decide whether any error in applying them was\n\n“plain.”   Compare United States v. Duncan, __ F.3d __, 2004 WL\n\n1838020, at *3-*5 (11th Cir. August 18, 2004) (holding that any\n\nBlakely error was not “plain” under the plain error standard of\n\nreview) with United States v. Ameline, 376 F.3d 967, 978 (9th Cir.\n\n2004) (holding the contrary).\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f     In determining whether the error was plain, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explained: “Where the law at the time of trial was settled and\n\nclearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal[,] it is enough\n\nthat an error be ‘plain’ at the time of appellate consideration.”\n\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 468 (1997).              The question\n\nof the continuing validity of the Sentencing Guidelines is an issue\n\nthat has roiled the federal courts, and split circuits. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir. 2004) (Posner, J.)\n\n(holding   the    Guidelines     unconstitutional)       (Easterbrook,        J.,\n\ndissenting), cert. granted, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2004 WL 1713654; United\n\nStates v. Hammoud, ___ F.3d ___, 2004 WL 2005622 (4th Cir. Sept. 8,\n\n2004) (en banc) (upholding the Guidelines) (Wilkinson, J., Shedd,\n\nJ., Widener, J., concurring; Motz, J., Michael, J., Gregory, J.,\n\ndissenting); United States v. Koch, ___ F.3d ___, 2004 WL 1899930\n\n(6th Cir. Aug. 26, 2004) (en banc) (upholding the Guidelines)\n\n(Martin,   J.,   Daughtrey,    J.,   Moore,    J.,    Cole,    J.,   Clay,    J.,\n\ndissenting). Whatever the outcome, the answer is neither plain nor\n\nobvious at the time of this appeal.\n\n     Because     the   trial   judge’s     sentence   was     consistent     with\n\nprecedent, and the current law is unsettled, we conclude that there\n\nis no plain error.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

Two years later, he was arrested at his place of work in Hudson, New Hampshire.

He now appeals his sentence, arguing that his prior conviction for a simple assault was a misdemeanor under New Hampshire law and should not have been treated as an \"aggravated felony\" under &#167; 1326(b)(2) or U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) (Nov.2002).

The definition of \"aggravated felony\" is found in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F), which states that the term includes \"a crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\" The definition of \"term of imprisonment\" in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(B) is \"the period of incarceration... ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that ... sentence in whole or in part.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guideline applicable to unlawfully re-entering or remaining in the United States under &#167; 1326 provides that the base offense level of eight is increased by eight levels for a defendant who was deported after a \"conviction for an aggravated felony.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).

Accordingly, there was no error in the trial judge's consideration of the prior conviction.

He was sentenced to twelve months of imprisonment with ten months suspended. Following this conviction, Cordoza-Estrada was deported. Two years later, he was arrested at his place of work in Hudson, New Hampshire. After pleading guilty to a one-count information, Cordoza-Estrada was convicted of re-entering the United States after being deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(a) and 1326(b)(2), and sentenced to eighteen months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He now appeals his sentence, arguing that his prior conviction for a simple assault was a misdemeanor under New Hampshire law and should not have been treated as an \"aggravated felony\" under &#167; 1326(b)(2) or U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) (Nov.2002).

The definition of \"aggravated felony\" is found in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F), which states that the term includes \"a crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\" The definition of \"term of imprisonment\" in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(B) is \"the period of incarceration... ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that ... sentence in whole or in part.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guideline applicable to unlawfully re-entering or remaining in the United States under &#167; 1326 provides that the base offense level of eight is increased by eight levels for a defendant who was deported after a \"conviction for an aggravated felony.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).

Accordingly, there was no error in the trial judge's consideration of the prior conviction.
