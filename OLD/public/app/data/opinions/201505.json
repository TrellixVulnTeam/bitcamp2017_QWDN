Fox for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Dulce\nDonovan, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 29, 2005\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.          Defendant Randolph Carpenter\n\nappeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the\n\ndistrict court.      While on patrol in November 2001, two Providence\n\npolice officers stopped a speeding vehicle driven by Carpenter.\n\nWhen one of the officers walked up to the passenger-side window of\n\nthe   vehicle,      he    observed    Carpenter   was   holding     a   handgun.\n\nCarpenter promptly sped off, and the police pursued a high-speed\n\nchase, which abruptly ended when Carpenter then ran into a jersey\n\nbarrier.     Carpenter fled on foot, then crossed a busy interstate\n\nhighway, where       he    was   apprehended   and   arrested.      The   police\n\ndiscovered    the    handgun     on   the   passenger   seat   of   Carpenter’s\n\nvehicle, and seized a small bag of marijuana.              After waiving his\n\nMiranda rights in writing, Carpenter admitted that he had bought\n\nthe handgun for protection two weeks earlier from one Dennis\n\nMorrow.\n\n           In due course, Carpenter was indicted for possessing a\n\nfirearm following a felony conviction, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g),\n\nwhich requires proof of the following elements:            (i) the defendant\n\nis a convicted felon; (ii) who knowingly possessed a firearm; and\n\n(iii) the firearm was in or affected interstate commerce.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Liranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 69 n.2 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 637 (2004).          Carpenter stipulated to the first\n\nand third elements of the offense, preserving for trial solely the\n\nissue as to whether he had actual or constructive possession of the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffirearm seized from the vehicle which he was driving.                        See id.\n\nActual possession may be established, inter alia, with evidence\n\nthat the defendant had either an ownership or a possessory interest\n\nin the firearm, whereas constructive possession can be based upon\n\nevidence that the defendant knowingly had the ability, as well as\n\nthe intent, to exercise dominion and control over either the\n\nfirearm, or the area wherein the firearm was located.                    See United\n\nStates v. Carlos Cruz, 352 F.3d 499, 510 (1st Cir. 2003), cert.\n\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 176 (2004).\n\n             At trial, the prosecution presented evidence of actual\n\npossession as well as constructive possession, consisting of (i)\n\nOfficer MacGregor’s testimony that he had seen Carpenter holding\n\nthe gun in his hand at the time of the traffic stop, and (ii)\n\nCarpenter’s post-arrest confession that he was the owner of the\n\ngun.       Defense    counsel    sought    to    counteract     that    evidence    by\n\ncontending that the police officers lied, and by noting that no\n\nfingerprints had been found on the gun.1\n\n             The     government’s      constructive    possession        theory    was\n\npremised primarily upon the eventual retrieval of the weapon from\n\nthe    passenger-side     seat    of     the    vehicle,   an   area     over   which\n\nCarpenter     unquestionably       had    exercised    dominion        and   control.\n\n\n\n       1\n      To counter Carpenter’s contention about the absence of\nfingerprints on the weapon, the government adduced expert testimony\nto the effect that it is exceedingly difficult to lift viable\nfingerprints from the surfaces of this particular weapon.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDefense counsel    contended   that   the   police    had   found    the   gun\n\nelsewhere in the car, then planted the gun on the passenger-side\n\nseat in an effort to frame Carpenter, and that the government had\n\nnot established that Carpenter owned the vehicle he was driving\n\n(and hence the handgun).\n\n          During its deliberations, the jury transmitted a note to\n\nthe court, inquiring whether “it is possible to find [out] the\n\nidentity of the owner of the [vehicle].” The court first responded\n\nthat the government had adduced no evidence as to ownership of the\n\nvehicle, then added that “it doesn’t matter who the owner was,”\n\nbecause “[t]he important thing is that this defendant was driving\n\nthe car, the vehicle, at the time.”         After the jury resumed its\n\ndeliberations,    defense   counsel   objected,      contending     that   the\n\ncourt’s supplemental jury instruction improperly prejudiced the\n\ndefense by suggesting that the jury should not consider a critical\n\ncomponent of the defense theory against “constructive possession”\n\n– viz., the fact that the government had not adduced evidence as to\n\nthe identity of the owner of the vehicle.             The district court\n\noverruled the objection, and the jury subsequently returned its\n\nverdict of guilty.\n\n          On appeal, Carpenter contends that the district court's\n\njury instruction constitutes an abuse of discretion.2               We agree\n\n\n     2\n      Carpenter does not contend on appeal that the district court\nerred in instructing the jury that there was no dispute that\nCarpenter had been driving the vehicle. See, e.g., United States\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthat it would have done better had the district court simply\n\nresponded to the specific question posed by the jury – viz., had it\n\ninstructed that the government had adduced no evidence as to the\n\nidentity of the vehicle’s owner – and refrained from further\n\ncomment regarding its import vel non.   See United States v. Shay,\n\n57 F.3d 126, 134 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that excluding evidence\n\ncannot be considered harmless error where it “went to heart of the\n\ndefense”); United States v. Ouimette, 753 F.2d 188, 193 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (same); see also Perez v. United States, 297 F.2d 12, 16 (5th\n\nCir. 1961) (noting that jury instructions should “not unduly\n\nemphasize the theory of the prosecution, thereby deemphasizing\n\nproportionally the defendant’s theory”).3   Even assuming arguendo\n\nthat the challenged instruction was erroneous, however, any error\n\nwas harmless. See United States v. Gray, 199 F.3d 547, 550 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n          “The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that\n          the damaging potential of the . . . [excluded\n          evidence] were fully realized, a reviewing\n          court might nonetheless say that the error was\n          harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether\n          such error is harmless in a particular case\n          depends upon a host of factors, all readily\n          accessible to reviewing courts. These factors\n\n\nv. Sabetta, 373 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.) (“A district court must use\nextreme caution in answering questions from juries so as not to\nusurp the jury’s fact finding role.”), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 433\n(2004). Hence, we need not address the matter.\n     3\n      The government has not argued on appeal that Carpenter failed\nto adduce enough evidence of his defense theory to require its\nsubmission to the jury in the first instance.\n\n                               -5-\n\f              include the importance of the witness'\n              testimony in the prosecution's case, whether\n              the testimony was cumulative, the presence or\n              absence   of   evidence    corroborating    or\n              contradicting the testimony of the witness on\n              material     points,     the     extent     of\n              cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of\n              course,   the   overall   strength    of   the\n              prosecution's case.”\n\nDolinger v. Hall, 302 F.3d 5, 12 n.6 (1st                  Cir.       2002) (citation\n\nomitted).      The burden of persuasion rests with the government to\n\ndemonstrate harmless error, see United States v. Ventura-Cruel, 356\n\nF.3d    55,    64   (1st       Cir.   2003),    and   we    may       not    declare    a\n\nconstitutional         error    harmless    where     there      is    a    \"reasonable\n\npossibility\" that it influenced the verdict, see United States v.\n\nMulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d 983, 992 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n              First,     we     determine      what   impact          the    challenged\n\ninstruction on the vehicle’s ownership may have had on the defense.\n\nThe    ownership    issue       was   relevant   both      (i)    to       refuting    the\n\ngovernment’s evidence that Carpenter had constructive possession of\n\nthe gun, and (ii) to the defense theory that the arresting officers\n\nframed Carpenter.        More specifically, the defense invited the jury\n\nto adopt the following theory of the case:                 The government did not\n\nadduce evidence of the vehicle’s ownership because the vehicle did\n\nnot belong to Carpenter.          The gun – which belonged to the owner                 of\n\nthe vehicle and of which Carpenter had no prior knowledge – was\n\noriginally located somewhere in the vehicle, other than on the\n\npassenger seat.         The police officers did not find the gun until\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthey conducted a post-arrest search of the vehicle, and planted it\n\non   the   vehicle’s    passenger      seat   to   bolster   their      perjurious\n\ntestimony that Carpenter had handled the gun during the initial\n\ntraffic stop and the car chase.\n\n              We conclude that the district court’s instruction was\n\nharmless, beyond a reasonable doubt, for two principal reasons.\n\nFirst, the court did not instruct the jury to disregard positive\n\nevidence that the vehicle did not belong to Carpenter, but rather\n\nto disregard the fact that the government introduced no evidence –\n\neither way – as to its ownership.             Even now, Carpenter makes no\n\ncontention that he did not own the vehicle.              Hence, the jury could\n\nonly   have    speculated   as    to   its    ownership,     surely     a   dubious\n\nlaunching pad for the attenuated defense theory.\n\n              Second,   vehicle   ownership        was   simply   the    prefatory\n\nelement in the defense theory, and even if the jury were to have\n\nassumed from the government’s failure of proof that Carpenter did\n\nnot own the vehicle, it would not have adopted the defense theory\n\nwithout first having made an additional series of attenuated\n\ninferences: (i) the gun also belonged to the vehicle’s owner, not\n\nthe vehicle’s current user/driver (viz., Carpenter); (ii) Carpenter\n\nneither knew of the gun’s presence in the vehicle, nor intended to\n\nexercise control or dominion over it; and (iii) the police had not\n\nonly the opportunity to “frame” Carpenter (viz., the presence of a\n\n“hidden” gun in the vehicle not belonging to Carpenter), but the\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fmotive.    From the verdict, we conclude that the jury decided not to\n\ndisbelieve the police officers’ account of the traffic stop,\n\nCarpenter’s brandishing of the gun, nor the results of the ensuing\n\nvehicle inspection, and that therefore, there is no \"reasonable\n\npossibility\" that the district court’s instruction influenced the\n\njury verdict.     See Mulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d at 992.\n\n            Carpenter’s   undisputed    conduct   tended   to   belie   any\n\ndefense contention that he did not know the gun was in the car.\n\nBesides the gun, the only incriminating evidence seized from the\n\nvehicle was a small amount of marijuana, and the jury would have\n\nhad to draw the implausible inference that Carpenter recklessly\n\nwould have fled a traffic stop, run from his wrecked vehicle, and\n\nengaged the police in a life-threatening foot pursuit across a busy\n\ninterstate highway, all to avoid relatively minor drug possession\n\ncharges.    See United States v. Otero-Mendez, 273 F.3d 46, 53 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (“‘Evidence of a defendant's flight . . . may be\n\npresented at trial as probative of a guilty mind if there is an\n\nadequate factual predicate creating an inference of guilt of the\n\ncrime   charged.’”)   (emphasis   added;    citation   omitted).        The\n\ndesperation of Carpenter's flight affords persuasive support for\n\nthe inference that he knowingly possessed the handgun.\n\n            Any putative instructional error was harmless in light of\n\nthe overall strength of the government’s case.         See Dolinger, 302\n\nF.3d at 12 n.6.    The vehicle’s ownership was relevant only to the\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fconstructive possession issue, not actual possession, and the\n\ndetail and consistency of the police officers’ accounts vouched for\n\ntheir credibility.      See, e.g., United States v. Salimonu, 182 F.3d\n\n63, 71 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that witnesses’ testimony was\n\n“detailed    and     basically   consistent,”      affording    the     jury\n\n“substantial evidence of [defendant’s] guilt”).              For example,\n\nOfficer MacGregor testified, that Carpenter did not put his vehicle\n\ninto park when he was pulled over (viz., “[t]he reverse lights did\n\nnot flicker on”), which suggested to MacGregor that Carpenter might\n\ndrive away while MacGregor walked up to his vehicle.            MacGregor\n\ndescribed how Carpenter was looking back in his side-view mirror at\n\nthe parked police cruiser, and how the gun that he observed in\n\nCarpenter’s hand was “black, unique,” “an old style gun” which “had\n\ntwo round cylinders in the rear.” He testified that, when he made\n\neye   contact    with   Carpenter,   Carpenter   looked   “startled,”    and\n\nimmediately sped off.       Finally, the account given by MacGregor’s\n\nfellow officer, Sion, is entirely consistent with that provided by\n\nMacGregor.      If the jury credited this testimony, the ownership of\n\nthe vehicle was comparatively irrelevant.4\n\n\n      4\n      We can ascribe no conclusive significance to the fact that\nthe jury chose to ask this particular question. Although Carpenter\nargues that this demonstrates that the jury had rejected the\ngovernment’s evidence of actual possession, and was considering an\nacquittal with respect to constructive possession, it is no less\nplausible that the jury had decided that the government had proven\nactual and/or constructive possession beyond a reasonable doubt,\nand inquired about the vehicle’s ownership merely to determine\nwhether that evidence was adduced at trial and if so, was\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            The government also adduced evidence of Carpenter’s post-\n\narrest oral confession that he had purchased the gun two weeks\n\nearlier.5     His confession was quite detailed (viz., including the\n\nname of the person from whom he bought the gun, and his need for\n\nthe gun), and it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the jury\n\nwould accord it considerable weight in determining the issue of\n\npossession.    See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 296 (1991)\n\n(“‘[T]he defendant’s own confession is probably the most probative\n\nand damaging evidence that can be admitted against him. . . .\n\nCertainly, confessions have a profound impact on the jury.’”)\n\n(citation omitted); Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d at 64 (“‘Confessions\n\nare by nature highly probative and likely to be at the center of\n\nthe jury's attention.’”) (citation omitted); Lufkins v. Leapley,\n\n965 F.2d 1477, 1482 (8th Cir. 1992) (finding trial error harmless\n\non the ground that “[a] detailed confession is the most probative\n\nof all evidence. . [and] a full confession by a defendant has an\n\nextraordinary impact on a finder of fact”). Although Carpenter did\n\nnot sign a written confession, given its detail, the jury likely\n\n\nconsistent with its decision to convict.\n     5\n      Notwithstanding the fact that police gave Carpenter Miranda\nwarnings before he confessed, he attempted to argue at trial that\nthe police beat him after his arrest, thus inviting an inference\nthat his confession might have been coerced. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Bezanson-Perkins, 390 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2004). Not\nonly does the record contain no evidence supporting this argument,\nthe government adduced hospital records reflecting that Carpenter\nbore no indication of having been the victim of a post-arrest\nbeating.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcredited the testimony of the police officer who took the oral\n\nconfession.    See United States v. Flores, 63 F.3d 1342, 1377 (5th\n\nCir.   1995)   (“When    the   evidentiary     value    of   an   out-of-court\n\nconfession depends on the credibility of the officer who repeats\n\nit, the court correctly allows the jury to make this call.”).\n\n           The defense does not contend – let alone adduce any\n\nevidence   –   that    the   vehicle    belonged   to   someone      other   than\n\nCarpenter, nor that the facts elaborated in his oral confession\n\nwere the product of a police fabrication. Accordingly, we conclude\n\nthat any error in the district court instruction was harmless.\n\n           Carpenter further argues that the district court plainly\n\nerred by imposing a sentence which violates the recent decision in\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), which held that the\n\nSentencing Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 74 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nWe review his argument for plain error, and it is his burden to\n\ndemonstrate that he was prejudiced by the district court sentence,\n\nin that there is a “reasonable probability” that the court would\n\nhave imposed a lesser sentence if the sentence had been after\n\nBooker, viz., if the district court had known that the Guidelines\n\ndid not mandate the sentence it imposed.           See id. at 75.     Carpenter\n\ncannot   satisfy      this   burden.     The   district      court   stated   at\n\nsentencing:\n\n                This defendant is a danger to the\n           community. . . . I give him the longest\n\n                                       -11-\n\f          sentence I can give him for the protection of\n          society.   In this case it’s ten years, 120\n          months, to be served consecutively to the\n          state sentences he is now serving.    I don’t\n          think I have discretion to do otherwise. Even\n          if I did, this is what I would do in order to\n          separate him from society.\n\n(Emphasis added.) The district court thus made clear that there is\n\nno reasonable probability that it would have imposed a lesser\n\nsentence under the Booker rubric.   See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n81 (“[I]f the district judge has said at sentencing that he would\n\nhave reached the same result regardless of the mandatory nature of\n\nthe Guidelines, that is a powerful argument against remand.”).   As\n\nCarpenter could gain nothing from a Booker remand, the sentence\n\nproperly imposed by the district court must be affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

While on patrol in November 2001, two Providence police officers stopped a speeding vehicle driven by Carpenter. When one of the officers walked up to the passenger-side window of the vehicle, he observed Carpenter was holding a handgun. Carpenter promptly sped off, and the police pursued a high-speed chase, which abruptly ended when Carpenter then ran into a jersey barrier.

[excluded evidence] were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was <i>cumulative,</i> the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution's case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dolinger v. Hall,</i> 302 F.3d 5, 12 n. 6 (1st Cir.2002) (citation omitted). The burden of persuasion rests with the government to demonstrate harmless error, <i>see United States v. Ventura-Cruel,</i> 356 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir.2003), and we may not declare a constitutional error harmless where there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that it influenced the verdict, <i>see United States v. Mulinelli-Navas,</i> 111 F.3d 983, 992 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we determine what impact the challenged instruction on the vehicle's ownership may have had on the defense. The ownership issue was relevant both (i) to refuting the government's evidence that Carpenter had constructive possession of the gun, and (ii) to the defense theory that the arresting officers framed Carpenter. More specifically, the defense invited the jury to adopt the following theory of the case: The government did not adduce evidence of the vehicle's ownership because the vehicle did not belong to Carpenter. The gun &#8212; which belonged to the owner of the vehicle and of which Carpenter had no prior knowledge &#8212; was originally located somewhere in the vehicle, other than on the passenger seat. The police officers did not find the gun until they conducted a post-arrest search of the vehicle, and planted it on the vehicle's passenger seat to bolster their perjurious testimony that Carpenter had handled the gun during the initial traffic stop and the car chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court's instruction was harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt, for two principal reasons. First, the court did not instruct the jury to disregard positive evidence that the vehicle did not belong to Carpenter, but rather to disregard the fact that the government introduced no evidence &#8212; either way &#8212; as to its ownership. Even now, Carpenter makes no contention that he did not own the vehicle. Hence, the jury could only have speculated as to its ownership, surely a dubious launching pad for the attenuated defense theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, vehicle ownership was simply the prefatory element in the defense theory, and even if the jury were to have assumed from the government's failure of proof that Carpenter did not own the vehicle, it would not have adopted the defense theory without first having made an additional series of attenuated inferences: (i) the gun also belonged to the vehicle's owner, not the vehicle's current user/driver (<i>viz.,</i> Carpenter); (ii) Carpenter neither knew of the gun's presence in the vehicle, nor intended to exercise control or dominion over it; and (iii) the police had not only the <i>opportunity</i> to \"frame\" Carpenter (<i>viz.,</i> the presence of a \"hidden\" gun in the vehicle not belonging to Carpenter), but the <i>motive.</i> From the verdict, we conclude that the jury decided not to disbelieve the police officers' account of the traffic stop, Carpenter's brandishing of the gun, nor the results of the ensuing vehicle inspection, and that therefore, there is no \"reasonable possibility\" that the district court's instruction influenced the jury verdict. <i>See Mulinelli-Navas,</i> 111 F.3d at 992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter's undisputed conduct tended to belie any defense contention that he did not know the gun was in the car. Besides the gun, the only incriminating evidence seized from the vehicle was a small amount of marijuana, and the jury would have had to draw the implausible inference that Carpenter recklessly would have fled a traffic stop, run from his wrecked vehicle, and engaged the police in a life-threatening foot pursuit across a busy interstate highway, all to avoid relatively minor drug possession charges. <i>See United States v. Otero-Mendez,</i> 273 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.2001) (\"`Evidence of a defendant's flight ... may be presented at trial as probative of a guilty mind if there is an adequate factual predicate creating an inference of guilt of the <i>crime charged.</i>'\") (emphasis added; citation omitted). The desperation of Carpenter's flight affords persuasive support for the inference that he knowingly possessed the handgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any putative instructional error was harmless in light of the overall strength of the government's case. <i>See Dolinger,</i> 302 F.3d at 12 n. 6. The vehicle's ownership was relevant only to the constructive possession issue, not actual possession, and the detail and consistency of the police officers' accounts vouched for their credibility. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Salimonu,</i> 182 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that witnesses' testimony was \"detailed and basically consistent,\" affording the jury \"substantial evidence of [defendant's] guilt\"). For example, Officer MacGregor testified, that Carpenter did not put his vehicle into park when he was pulled over (<i>viz.,</i>\"[t]he reverse lights did not flicker on\"), which suggested to MacGregor that Carpenter might drive away while MacGregor walked up to his vehicle. MacGregor described how Carpenter was looking back in his side-view mirror at the parked police cruiser, and how the gun that he observed in Carpenter's hand was \"black, unique,\" \"an old style gun\" which \"had two round cylinders in the rear.\" He testified that, when he made eye contact with Carpenter, Carpenter looked \"startled,\" and immediately sped off. Finally, the account given by MacGregor's fellow officer, Sion, is entirely consistent with that provided by MacGregor. If the jury credited this testimony, the ownership of the vehicle was comparatively irrelevant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also adduced evidence of Carpenter's post-arrest oral confession that he had purchased the gun two weeks earlier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His confession was quite detailed (<i>viz.,</i> including the name of the person from whom he bought the gun, and his need for the gun), and it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the jury would accord it considerable weight in determining the issue of possession. <i>See Arizona v. Fulminante,</i> 499 U.S. 279, 296, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (\"`[T]he defendant's own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.... Certainly, confessions have a profound impact on the jury.'\") (citation omitted); <i>Ventura-Cruel,</i> 356 F.3d at 64 (\"`Confessions are by nature highly probative and likely to be at the center of the jury's attention.'\") (citation omitted); <i>Lufkins v. Leapley,</i> 965 F.2d 1477, 1482 (8th Cir.1992) (finding trial error harmless on the ground that \"[a] detailed confession is the most probative of all evidence.... [and] a full confession by a defendant has an extraordinary impact on a finder of fact\"). Although Carpenter did not sign a written confession, given its detail, the jury likely credited the testimony of the police officer who took the oral confession. <i>See United States v. Flores,</i> 63 F.3d 1342, 1377 (5th Cir.1995) (\"When the evidentiary value of an out-of-court confession depends on the credibility of the officer who repeats it, the court correctly allows the jury to make this call.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense does not contend &#8212; let alone adduce any evidence &#8212; that the vehicle belonged to someone other than Carpenter, nor that the facts elaborated in his oral confession were the product of a police fabrication. Accordingly, we conclude that any error in the district court instruction was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter further argues that the district court plainly erred by imposing a sentence which violates the recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 74 (1st Cir.2005). We review his argument for plain error, and it is his burden to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the district court sentence, in that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence if the sentence had been after <i>Booker, viz.,</i> if the district court had known that the Guidelines did not mandate the sentence it imposed. <i>See id.</i> at 75. Carpenter cannot satisfy this burden. The district court stated at sentencing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This defendant is a danger to the community.... I give him the longest sentence I can give him for the protection of society. In this case it's ten years, 120 months, to be served consecutively to the state sentences he is now serving. I don't think I have discretion to do otherwise. <i>Even if I did, this is what I would do in order to separate him from society.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) The district court thus made clear that there is no reasonable probability that it would have imposed a lesser sentence under the <i>Booker</i> rubric. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 81 (\"[I]f the district judge has said at sentencing that he would have reached the same result regardless of the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, that is a powerful argument against remand.\"). As Carpenter could gain nothing from a <i>Booker</i> remand, the sentence properly imposed by the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To counter Carpenter's contention about the absence of fingerprints on the weapon, the government adduced expert testimony to the effect that it is exceedingly difficult to lift viable fingerprints from the surfaces of this particular weapon</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Carpenter does not contend on appeal that the district court erred in instructing the jury that there was no dispute that Carpenter had been driving the vehicle<i>See, e.g., United States v.

Although Carpenter argues that this demonstrates that the jury had rejected the government's evidence of actual possession, and was considering an acquittal with respect to constructive possession, it is no less plausible that the jury had decided that the government had proven actual and/or constructive possession beyond a reasonable doubt, and inquired about the vehicle's ownership merely to determine whether that evidence was adduced at trial and if so, was consistent with its decision to convict</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the fact that police gave Carpenter<i>Miranda</i> warnings before he confessed, he attempted to argue at trial that the police beat him after his arrest, thus inviting an inference that his confession might have been coerced. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bezanson-Perkins,</i> 390 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2004). Not only does the record contain no evidence supporting this argument, the government adduced hospital records reflecting that Carpenter bore no indication of having been the victim of a post-arrest beating.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

These factors include the importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was <i>cumulative,</i> the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution's case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Dolinger v.

The burden of persuasion rests with the government to demonstrate harmless error, <i>see United States v.

Mulinelli-Navas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739903\"><a href=\"/opinion/739903/united-states-v-mara-mulinelli-navas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span>, 992 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we determine what impact the challenged instruction on the vehicle's ownership may have had on the defense. The ownership issue was relevant both (i) to refuting the government's evidence that Carpenter had constructive possession of the gun, and (ii) to the defense theory that the arresting officers framed Carpenter. More specifically, the defense invited the jury to adopt the following theory of the case: The government did not adduce evidence of the vehicle's ownership because the vehicle did not belong to Carpenter. The gun &#8212; which belonged to the owner of the vehicle and of which Carpenter had no prior knowledge &#8212; was originally located somewhere in the vehicle, other than on the passenger seat. The police officers did not find the gun until they conducted a post-arrest search of the vehicle, and planted it on the vehicle's passenger seat to bolster their perjurious testimony that Carpenter had handled the gun during the initial traffic stop and the car chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court's instruction was harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt, for two principal reasons. First, the court did not instruct the jury to disregard positive evidence that the vehicle did not belong to Carpenter, but rather to disregard the fact that the government introduced no evidence &#8212; either way &#8212; as to its ownership. Even now, Carpenter makes no contention that he did not own the vehicle. Hence, the jury could only have speculated as to its ownership, surely a dubious launching pad for the attenuated defense theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, vehicle ownership was simply the prefatory element in the defense theory, and even if the jury were to have assumed from the government's failure of proof that Carpenter did not own the vehicle, it would not have adopted the defense theory without first having made an additional series of attenuated inferences: (i) the gun also belonged to the vehicle's owner, not the vehicle's current user/driver (<i>viz.,</i> Carpenter); (ii) Carpenter neither knew of the gun's presence in the vehicle, nor intended to exercise control or dominion over it; and (iii) the police had not only the <i>opportunity</i> to \"frame\" Carpenter (<i>viz.,</i> the presence of a \"hidden\" gun in the vehicle not belonging to Carpenter), but the <i>motive.</i> From the verdict, we conclude that the jury decided not to disbelieve the police officers' account of the traffic stop, Carpenter's brandishing of the gun, nor the results of the ensuing vehicle inspection, and that therefore, there is no \"reasonable possibility\" that the district court's instruction influenced the jury verdict. <i>See Mulinelli-Navas,</i> 111 F.3d at 992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter's undisputed conduct tended to belie any defense contention that he did not know the gun was in the car. Besides the gun, the only incriminating evidence seized from the vehicle was a small amount of marijuana, and the jury would have had to draw the implausible inference that Carpenter recklessly would have fled a traffic stop, run from his wrecked vehicle, and engaged the police in a life-threatening foot pursuit across a busy interstate highway, all to avoid relatively minor drug possession charges. <i>See United States v. Otero-Mendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775757\"><a href=\"/opinion/775757/united-states-v-jose-a-otero-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2001) (\"`Evidence of a defendant's flight ... may be presented at trial as probative of a guilty mind if there is an adequate factual predicate creating an inference of guilt of the <i>crime charged.</i>'\") (emphasis added; citation omitted). The desperation of Carpenter's flight affords persuasive support for the inference that he knowingly possessed the handgun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any putative instructional error was harmless in light of the overall strength of the government's case. <i>See Dolinger,</i> 302 F.3d at 12 n. 6. The vehicle's ownership was relevant only to the constructive possession issue, not actual possession, and the detail and consistency of the police officers' accounts vouched for their credibility. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Salimonu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198544\"><a href=\"/opinion/198544/united-states-v-salimonu/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that witnesses' testimony was \"detailed and basically consistent,\" affording the jury \"substantial evidence of [defendant's] guilt\"). For example, Officer MacGregor testified, that Carpenter did not put his vehicle into park when he was pulled over (<i>viz.,</i>\"[t]he reverse lights did not flicker on\"), which suggested to MacGregor that Carpenter might drive away while MacGregor walked up to his vehicle. MacGregor described how Carpenter was looking back in his side-view mirror at the parked police cruiser, and how the gun that he observed in Carpenter's hand was \"black, unique,\" \"an old style gun\" which \"had two round cylinders in the rear.\" He testified that, when he made eye contact with Carpenter, Carpenter looked \"startled,\" and immediately sped off. Finally, the account given by MacGregor's fellow officer, Sion, is entirely consistent with that provided by MacGregor. If the jury credited this testimony, the ownership of the vehicle was comparatively irrelevant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also adduced evidence of Carpenter's post-arrest oral confession that he had purchased the gun two weeks earlier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His confession was quite detailed (<i>viz.,</i> including the name of the person from whom he bought the gun, and his need for the gun), and it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the jury would accord it considerable weight in determining the issue of possession. <i>See Arizona v. Fulminante,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 296, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

[and] a full confession by a defendant has an extraordinary impact on a finder of fact\"). Although Carpenter did not sign a written confession, given its detail, the jury likely credited the testimony of the police officer who took the oral confession. <i>See United States v. Flores,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702508\"><a href=\"/opinion/702508/united-states-v-manuel-flores-united-states-of-america-v-juan-raul-garza/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1342</span></a></span>, 1377 (5th Cir.1995) (\"When the evidentiary value of an out-of-court confession depends on the credibility of the officer who repeats it, the court correctly allows the jury to make this call.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense does not contend &#8212; let alone adduce any evidence &#8212; that the vehicle belonged to someone other than Carpenter, nor that the facts elaborated in his oral confession were the product of a police fabrication. Accordingly, we conclude that any error in the district court instruction was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carpenter further argues that the district court plainly erred by imposing a sentence which violates the recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory. <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2005). We review his argument for plain error, and it is his burden to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the district court sentence, in that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence if the sentence had been after <i>Booker, viz.,</i> if the district court had known that the Guidelines did not mandate the sentence it imposed. <i>See id.</i> at 75. Carpenter cannot satisfy this burden. The district court stated at sentencing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This defendant is a danger to the community.... I give him the longest sentence I can give him for the protection of society. In this case it's ten years, 120 months, to be served consecutively to the state sentences he is now serving. I don't think I have discretion to do otherwise. <i>Even if I did, this is what I would do in order to separate him from society.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) The district court thus made clear that there is no reasonable probability that it would have imposed a lesser sentence under the <i>Booker</i> rubric. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 81 (\"[I]f the district judge has said at sentencing that he would have reached the same result regardless of the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, that is a powerful argument against remand.\"). As Carpenter could gain nothing from a <i>Booker</i> remand, the sentence properly imposed by the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To counter Carpenter's contention about the absence of fingerprints on the weapon, the government adduced expert testimony to the effect that it is exceedingly difficult to lift viable fingerprints from the surfaces of this particular weapon</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Carpenter does not contend on appeal that the district court erred in instructing the jury that there was no dispute that Carpenter had been driving the vehicle<i>See, e.g., United States v.

Hence, we need not address the matter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The government has not argued on appeal that Carpenter failed to adduce enough evidence of his defense theory to require its submission to the jury in the first instance</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We can ascribe no conclusive significance to the fact that the jury chose to ask this particular question. Although Carpenter argues that this demonstrates that the jury had rejected the government's evidence of actual possession, and was considering an acquittal with respect to constructive possession, it is no less plausible that the jury had decided that the government had proven actual and/or constructive possession beyond a reasonable doubt, and inquired about the vehicle's ownership merely to determine whether that evidence was adduced at trial and if so, was consistent with its decision to convict</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the fact that police gave Carpenter<i>Miranda</i> warnings before he confessed, he attempted to argue at trial that the police beat him after his arrest, thus inviting an inference that his confession might have been coerced. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Not only does the record contain no evidence supporting this argument, the government adduced hospital records reflecting that Carpenter bore no indication of having been the victim of a post-arrest beating.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
