Opert, Opert &amp; Shandler on brief for appellee.\n                                      \n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n\n     Per Curiam.    The question  before  us is  whether  the\n               \n\ndistrict court order granting defendant's motion to dismiss a\n\npetition for removal  is appealable.  We conclude  that it is\n\nnot.\n\n     In  October 1992,  plaintiff-appellee,  Datcom, Inc.,  a\n\nMassachusetts corporation, filed  suit in Middlesex  Superior\n\nCourt   in  Cambridge,   Massachusetts,  against   defendant-\n\nappellant,   Integrated   Technology,    Inc.,   a   Delaware\n\ncorporation, with its  principal place of business  in Salem,\n\nNew Hampshire.  The suit sought in excess of $300,000 damages\n\nfor tortious  interference  with  contractual  relations  and\n\nunfair  and deceptive  business practices.    On January  20,\n\n1993,  a   default  order   was  issued  against   Integrated\n\nTechnology pursuant to Mass. R.  Civ. P. 55(a) because of its\n\nfailure to plead  or otherwise defend  itself as required  by\n\nMass. R. Civ. P. 12(a).  On January 22, Integrated Technology\n\nfiled a  petition to remove  the matter to the  United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts on the basis\n\nof diversity jurisdiction.  In response, Datcom, Inc. filed a\n\nmotion  to dismiss contending  that the petition  for removal\n\nhad not been timely filed since a default had already entered\n\nin state  court prior to  the filing of the  remand petition.\n\nOn  February 10, 1993, the district  court allowed the motion\n\nto  dismiss, noting  that the  case was  in default  in state\n\ncourt  when  the  petition  for removal  was  filed.   Datcom\n\n                             -2-\n\nappeals the  district court's  order dismissing  its petition\n\nfor removal.\n\n                          Discussion\n\n     Integrated Technology contends  first that the  order of\n\nthe district court  dismissing its petition for removal was a\n\ndismissal of  its action and not a remand to the state court.\n\nIt notes that  the word \"remand\" was never used  in the order\n\nand  that  no certified  remand  order appears  to  have been\n\nmailed to the  state court clerk as  required by 28  U.S.C.  \n\n1447(c).   Integrated  Technology  further asserts  that  the\n\norder is  thus directly appealable as a  final order pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C.   1291.\n\n     While not  expressly called  such, the  order dismissing\n\nthe  petition  for removal  was  in  effect  a remand.    The\n\ndistrict  court  docket  sheet  indicates  an  \"intradistrict\n\ntransfer\" of  the case to  state court on February  12, 1993.\n\nMoreover,  the docket sheet  of the Middlesex  Superior Court\n\nindicates  on June  3, 1993,  a  \"[r]etransfer to  Sup[erior]\n\nC[ou]rt from U.S.  District Court of Mass.\"   The record also\n\nshows  that  the  case  is  now  proceeding  in  state court.\n\nIntegrated  Technology's contention  that the  district court\n\norder was a dismissal rather than a remand is without merit.\n\n     Given that the  district court order  was a remand,  the\n\nnext question is whether the  order was issued pursuant to 28\n\n                             -3-\n\nU.S.C.   1447(c).  If it were, 28 U.S.C.   1447(d)  precludes\n\nappellate review of  the order \"whether erroneous  or not and\n\nwhether review is sought by appeal or by extraordinary writ.\"\n\nThermtron  Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 343\n                                          \n\n(1976).  \n\n     Section 1447(c) provides  that a court may remand a case\n\nto state  court either \"on the basis of any defect in removal\n\nprocedures\" or if \"it  appears that the district court  lacks\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\"    The order in  this case does\n\nnot refer to section 1447(c)  nor does it indicate that there\n\nwas  either  a defect  in  removal  procedure  or a  lack  of\n\njurisdiction.1   \n\n     While the district court did not make explicit the basis\n\nfor its remand order, it  appears to have acted on the  basis\n\nof a perceived  defect in removal procedure.  Datcom's motion\n\nto  dismiss the petition  for removal  was predicated  on its\n\nclaim that,  because the petition was filed after the default\n\norder had issued  in state court,  the \"Petition for  Removal\n\nwas not  timely filed.\"   \"[A]n untimely  notice of  removal\"\n\nqualifies as a procedural defect under section 1447(c).  FDIC\n                                                             \n\nv. Cabral, 989 F.2d 525, 525 (1st  Cir. 1992).  As such, this\n         \n\ncourt  is precluded  from  considering  whether the  district\n\ncourt was correct in its remand decision.  Id.\n                                             \n\n                    \n\n1.  The order simply  states that the  \"Motion to Dismiss  is\nallowed, as case was in  default in State Court when Petition\n       \nfor Removal was filed.\"\n\n                             -4-\n\n     Moreover,  even if  we were  to  find that  the district\n\ncourt  remand was  not on  the basis  of section  1447(c), we\n\nstill would not disturb the remand order.  \n\n     An order remanding a removed case is not appealable as a\n\nfinal judgment.  Garcia v. Island Program Designers,  No. 92-\n                                                   \n\n1853,  slip op. at 6-8 (1st  Cir. Sept. 14, 1993); Doughty v.\n                                                          \n\nUnderwriters at Lloyds, London, et al, Nos. 93-1174, slip op.\n                                     \n\nat 7-11 (1st Cir. Oct. 18, 1993).  \n\n     Nor  does  the  remand order  in  this  case qualify  as\n\nappealable under the collateral doctrine order.  See Cohen v.\n                                                          \n\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337  U.S. 541, 546 (1949). \n                               \n\nTo qualify under  the Cohen test, a remand  order must, inter\n                                                             \n\nalia, decide a  \"salient legal question that  stands separate\n    \n\nand  apart  from the  merits  in  th[e]  case, that  is,  [a]\n\n'collateral' issue.\"  Doughty, slip op. at 12.  In this case,\n                             \n\nthe  \"collateral\" issue  is which  forum  should resolve  the\n\ndispute.   However, \"[d]etermining whether a state or federal\n\ncourt  is  to  resolve an  issue  constitutes  the definitive\n\nresolution   of  a   collateral  matter  only   when  special\n\ncircumstances  exist.\"     Id.  at  13.     No  such  special\n                             \n\ncircumstances exist in the present case.  \n\n     Finally, this is not a proper case for the issuance of a\n\nwrit  of mandamus requiring the district  court to vacate the\n\nremand order and to accept jurisdiction of the case.  For one\n\nthing, appellant  has  not asked  us to  issue a  prerogative\n\n                             -5-\n\nwrit.   For another  thing, mandamus relief  is discretionary\n\nwith  this  court, Kerr  v.  United  States Dist.  Court  for\n                                                             \n\nNorthern Dist.,  426 U.S. 394,  403 (1975), and will  only be\n             \n\ngranted when the  challenged order is palpably  erroneous and\n                                                             \n\nwhen the petitioner has shown that he faces a special risk of\n\nirreparable harm, In re Pearson, 990 F.2d 653, 656 &amp; n.4 (1st\n                               \n\nCir.  1993) (collecting  cases).   \"Interlocutory  procedural\n\norders .  . .  rarely will  satisfy  th[e] preconditions  for\n\nmandamus relief.\"  In re  Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000,\n                                            \n\n1006  (1st Cir.  1988).   The mere  fact that  petitioner may\n\nprefer  a  federal  forum  is  insufficient  to  establish  a\n\nlikelihood  that petitioner  will suffer irreparable  harm by\n\nhaving its case litigated in the state system.

On January 20, 1993, a default order was issued against Integrated Technology pursuant to Mass.  R. Civ. P. 55(a) because of its failure to plead or otherwise defend itself as required by Mass.  R. Civ. P. 12(a).  On January 22, Integrated Technology filed a petition to remove the matter to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  In response, Datcom, Inc. filed a motion to dismiss contending that the petition for removal had not been timely filed since a default had already entered in state court prior to the filing of the remand petition.  On February 10, 1993, the district court allowed the motion to dismiss, noting that the case was in default in state court when the petition for removal was filed.  Datcom appeals the district court's order dismissing its petition for removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrated Technology contends first that the order of the district court dismissing its petition for removal was a dismissal of its action and not a remand to the state court.  It notes that the word \"remand\" was never used in the order and that no certified remand order appears to have been mailed to the state court clerk as required by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447(c).  Integrated Technology further asserts that the order is thus directly appealable as a final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While not expressly called such, the order dismissing the petition for removal was in effect a remand.  The district court docket sheet indicates an \"intradistrict transfer\" of the case to state court on February 12, 1993.  Moreover, the docket sheet of the Middlesex Superior Court indicates on June 3, 1993, a \"[r]etransfer to Sup[erior] C[ou]rt from U.S. District Court of Mass.\"  The record also shows that the case is now proceeding in state court.  Integrated Technology's contention that the district court order was a dismissal rather than a remand is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the district court order was a remand, the next question is whether the order was issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec.  1447(c).  If it were, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1447(d) precludes appellate review of the order \"whether erroneous or not and whether review is sought by appeal or by extraordinary writ.\"   Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 343 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1447(c) provides that a court may remand a case to state court either \"on the basis of any defect in removal procedures\" or if \"it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\"  The order in this case does not refer to section 1447(c) nor does it indicate that there was either a defect in removal procedure or a lack of jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court did not make explicit the basis for its remand order, it appears to have acted on the basis of a perceived defect in removal procedure.  Datcom's motion to dismiss the petition for removal was predicated on its claim that, because the petition was filed after the default order had issued in state court, the \"Petition for Removal was not timely filed.\"  \"[A]n untimely notice of removal\" qualifies as a procedural defect under section 1447(c).   FDIC v. Cabral, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603501\"><a href=\"/opinion/603501/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-receiver-for-new-bank-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, 525 (1st Cir. 1992).  As such, this court is precluded from considering whether the district court was correct in its remand decision.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if we were to find that the district court remand was not on the basis of section 1447(c), we still would not disturb the remand order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An order remanding a removed case is not appealable as a final judgment.  Garcia v. Island Program Designers, No. 92-1853, slip op. at 6-8 (1st Cir.  Sept. 14, 1993);  Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyds, London, et al, Nos. 93-1174, slip op. at 7-11 (1st Cir.  Oct. 18, 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the remand order in this case qualify as appealable under the collateral doctrine order.   See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span>, 546 (1949).  To qualify under the Cohen test, a remand order must, inter alia, decide a \"salient legal question that stands separate and apart from the merits in th[e] case, that is, [a] 'collateral' issue.\"  Doughty, slip op. at 12.  In this case, the \"collateral\" issue is which forum should resolve the dispute.  However, \"[d]etermining whether a state or federal court is to resolve an issue constitutes the definitive resolution of a collateral matter only when special circumstances exist.\"  Id. at 13.  No such special circumstances exist in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this is not a proper case for the issuance of a writ of mandamus requiring the district court to vacate the remand order and to accept jurisdiction of the case.  For one thing, appellant has not asked us to issue a prerogative writ.  For another thing, mandamus relief is discretionary with this court,  Kerr v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span>, 403 (1975), and will only be granted when the challenged order is palpably erroneous and when the petitioner has shown that he faces a special risk of irreparable harm,  In re Pearson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604120\"><a href=\"/opinion/604120/in-re-donald-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 656 &amp; n.4 (1st Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).  \"Interlocutory procedural orders ... rarely will satisfy th [e] preconditions for mandamus relief.\"   In re Recticel Foam Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513181\"><a href=\"/opinion/513181/in-re-recticel-foam-corporation-in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1006 (1st Cir. 1988).  The mere fact that petitioner may prefer a federal forum is insufficient to establish a likelihood that petitioner will suffer irreparable harm by having its case litigated in the state system.
