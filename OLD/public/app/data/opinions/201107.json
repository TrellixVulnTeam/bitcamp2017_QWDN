James R. Muirhead, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Porfilio, Senior Circuit Judge,*\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Christopher M. Johnson for appellant.\n\n     Jonathan V. Gallo, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Peter\nW. Heed, Attorney General, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           July 8, 2004\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.   Randy Lavallee appeals from the\n\ndenial of his habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.\n\n          In early 1998, Lavallee was convicted in New Hampshire\n\nstate court of multiple counts of sexual assault against his step-\n\ndaughter, who was between the ages of twelve and fourteen at the\n\ntimes of the assaults.   He was sentenced to twenty-two and a half\n\nto forty-five years confinement in New Hampshire state prison.\n\n          Before his state criminal trial started, Lavallee asked\n\nthe state court judge to order the disclosure of files concerning\n\nhis step-daughter that were in the possession of the New Hampshire\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Division of Children,\n\nYouth, and Families (DCYF).   DCYF had initiated abuse and neglect\n\nproceedings against Lavallee and neglect proceedings against the\n\nstep-daughter's mother (Lavallee's wife) after the step-daughter\n\nhad made allegations of sexual abuse by Lavallee to the police.\n\nDCYF files are confidential under New Hampshire's Child Protection\n\nAct, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 169-C:25, III, and absent a court\n\norder, even the prosecution may not access them, see State v.\n\nGagne, 612 A.2d 899, 899-900 (N.H. 1992) (\"neither the prosecution\n\nnor the defendant ha[s] access to the DCY[F] file\").     The court\n\nallowed Lavallee's motion, and DCYF provided the file materials to\n\nthe prosecutor, who gave them to the defense.\n\n          After the jury began deliberations, but before it reached\n\na verdict, a DCYF employee notified the prosecutor that some\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fportions of the step-daughter's DCYF files had inadvertently been\n\nomitted when the materials had been produced earlier.   The omitted\n\nmaterials detail a DCYF caseworker's contacts with the step-\n\ndaughter, her family, and her foster-care providers beginning\n\nshortly after the accusations against Lavallee were made and\n\ncontinuing through the time of trial.   The prosecution immediately\n\ngave the new materials to the defense, and before a verdict was\n\nreached, Lavallee moved to dismiss all of the charges because of\n\nthe late production of the documents. The trial judge reviewed the\n\nnew file materials that the defense said were pertinent, heard\n\narguments, and denied the motion.\n\n          The belatedly-produced materials from the DCYF files now\n\nform the heart of Lavallee's habeas corpus claim.   Lavallee argues\n\nthat the failure to disclose the complete file materials violated\n\nthe rule of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), which requires\n\nthe government to produce to defendants exculpatory and impeachment\n\nevidence that is within its custody, possession, or control, id. at\n\n87; see also Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972).   To\n\nconstitute a Brady violation, \"[t]he evidence at issue must be\n\nfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\n\nbecause it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed\n\nby the State, either whether willfully or inadvertently; and\n\nprejudice must have ensued.\"   Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263,\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f281-82 (1994); United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 153 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n           For purposes of the analysis here, we can assume that the\n\nomitted file materials were favorable to Lavallee and focus on the\n\nstate court's handling of the second and third components of the\n\ntest.   The second component is present only if the exculpatory or\n\nimpeaching evidence at issue (here, the omitted file materials) is\n\nthe type of evidence covered by the Brady rule; exculpatory or\n\nimpeaching evidence is so-called \"Brady material\" only if it is\n\nwithin the government's custody, possession, or control.               See\n\nJosleyn, 206 F.3d at 151-53; see also Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280-\n\n81.   The third component captures the so-called \"Brady materiality\n\nrequirement\"    and   is   satisfied   where   there   is   a   reasonable\n\nprobability that the evidence would have changed the result.           See\n\nJosleyn, 206 F.3d at 151-52; see also Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280.\n\n           If Lavallee's Brady claim \"was adjudicated on the merits\n\nin State court proceedings,\" then we must accept the state's legal\n\nruling on that claim unless it is \"contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"           28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 2254(d)(1).    If his claim was not adjudicated on the merits in\n\nthe state court proceedings, then we review the claim de novo.         See\n\nNorton v. Spencer, 351 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003); Fortini v.\n\nMurphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            The Brady claim formed the basis of Lavallee's motion to\n\ndismiss to the state trial court.      As noted, the state trial judge\n\nreviewed the newly-produced DCYF materials and denied the motion\n\nfor dismissal.     The trial judge ruled that the materials were not\n\nwithin the scope of Brady, and, in any event, that they did not\n\nmeet Brady's materiality requirement.      The late production of the\n\nDCYF materials then became one of the two bases for Lavallee's\n\ndirect appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.            State v.\n\nLavallee, 765 A.2d 671, 672 (N.H. 2000).     That court also rejected\n\nthe Brady claim.    The court held that the DCYF files were not the\n\ntype of evidence covered by Brady-type disclosure rules under the\n\nNew Hampshire Constitution, because neither the investigating law\n\nenforcement agency nor the prosecution was in possession of them.\n\nId. at 672-73.      The court also implicitly concluded that the\n\nevidence was not covered under the Brady rule, reasoning that the\n\nprotections concerning Brady material under the New Hampshire\n\nConstitution are at least as broad as those under the federal\n\nconstitution.    Id.   As a result, the New Hampshire Supreme Court\n\ndid not reach the issue of Brady materiality, unlike the state\n\ntrial judge.\n\n            In April 2002, Lavallee filed a federal habeas corpus\n\npetition.   It was heard by a magistrate judge in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Hampshire.     Contrary to the\n\nNew Hampshire trial court and the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\ffederal court determined that the DCYF files were within the scope\n\nof Brady.    Lavallee v. Coplan, 239 F. Supp. 2d 140, 145-47 (D.N.H.\n\n2003).     In a subsequent order, the district court turned to the\n\nquestions of whether the files met the standard for materiality\n\nunder Brady and whether the state trial court's decision that the\n\nundisclosed evidence was not material was \"contrary to, or involved\n\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" under 28\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2254(d)(1).      The federal court reviewed the state court\n\nrecord and determined that the DCYF files did not meet the Brady\n\nmateriality requirement.      Accordingly, it denied the petition.\n\n            Under conventional Brady doctrine, the New Hampshire\n\nSupreme Court and trial court were correct in their respective\n\nconclusions that the DCYF files did not trigger a duty under Brady\n\nbecause they were not within the custody, possession, or control of\n\nthe prosecution.      Whether we engage in deferential review or, as\n\nLavallee seeks, de novo review, the outcome would be the same: the\n\nDCYF files are not the type of evidence covered under conventional\n\nBrady doctrine.    See United States v. Bender, 304 F.3d 161, 163-64\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (Brady doctrine does not require a prosecutor to\n\nseek out and disclose exculpatory or impeaching material not in the\n\nprosecution's possession).        The files were self-evidently not\n\nwithin the    custody   or   possession   of    the   prosecution,   so   the\n\nquestion    becomes   whether   they     were   nonetheless    within     the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fprosecutor's control.      There is no claim that the prosecutor had\n\nany reason to think that the original files turned over from DCYF\n\nwere incomplete. And while prosecutors may be held accountable for\n\ninformation known to police investigators, Kyles v. Whitley, 514\n\nU.S. 419, 437-38 (1995), DCYF is neither the police nor the\n\nequivalent of the police in assisting the prosecution.             DCYF was\n\nnot the prosecuting agency and is independent of both the police\n\ndepartment and the prosecutor's office. Indeed, in its decision on\n\nLavallee's direct appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that\n\nDCYF shared no special relationship with the prosecutor or the\n\npolice.1   Lavallee, 765 A.2d at 673.\n\n           There is a wrinkle, though, and it lies in the Supreme\n\nCourt's 1987 opinion in Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39\n\n(1987). In Ritchie, a defendant in state criminal court sought the\n\nproduction   of   files    from   a   state   child   protection    agency,\n\nequivalent to DCYF.       480 U.S. at 43-44.    The agency pointed to a\n\nstate statute that made its files confidential, subject to certain\n\nexceptions, and refused to produce the files, which concerned the\n\nalleged victim of sexual abuse by the defendant.          Id.   The trial\n\n\n     1\n          Lavallee argues that there are a number of \"connections\"\nbetween DCYF and the police and prosecution and that those\nconnections support treating DCYF files as Brady material.\nLavallee points out, for example, that police officers had some\ncontact with DCYF and with the step-daughter while she was in\nfoster care and that members of the prosecutor's office had some\ncontact with DCYF workers.     However, the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt clearly resolved the issue against him and that determination\nis entirely sound.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fcourt judge refused to order the disclosure of the files, the\n\ndefendant was convicted, and he appealed.             Id. at 44-45.       An\n\nintermediate state appellate court vacated the conviction and\n\nremanded on the ground that the failure to disclose the agency\n\nfiles violated due process.     Id. at 45.       The state appealed, and\n\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed that the conviction had to\n\nbe vacated and the case remanded to determine if a new trial was\n\nnecessary in light of the information in the agency files.          Id. at\n\n46.   The court also held that the defendant was entitled to review\n\nthe entirety of the agency's files to search for any useful\n\nevidence.     Id.   On review of that ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nnoted   the   government's   duty   \"to   turn    over   evidence   in   its\n\npossession that is both favorable to the accused and material to\n\nguilt or punishment,\" citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97\n\n(1976), and Brady.      480 U.S. at 57.     The Court did not ask the\n\nquestion that usually begins the Brady analysis -- namely, whether\n\nthe agency file at issue was within the custody, possession, or\n\ncontrol of the prosecutor. The Court upheld the vacatur and remand\n\nand held, under the Due Process Clause, that the defendant was\n\nentitled to have the agency file reviewed by the trial court to\n\ndetermine whether it contained information \"that probably would\n\nhave changed the outcome of his trial.\"          Id. at 58.   However, the\n\nCourt reversed the state supreme court's ruling to the extent that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fit allowed the defendant immediate access to the entirety of the\n\nagency's files.       Id. at 61.\n\n              Because of our sense that there is some ambiguity about\n\nthe relationship between Ritchie and Brady, we would be very\n\nhesitant to conclude, as the magistrate judge did, that the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court opinion, which analyzed the Brady claim in\n\nclassic terms, was nonetheless \"contrary to\" the holding in Ritchie\n\nor    that    the   particular   doctrine     invoked     here    was     \"clearly\n\nestablished\" as a Brady doctrine.            Moreover, petitioner did not\n\ncite Ritchie to the New Hampshire Supreme Court on his appeal; he\n\ncited it for the first time in his motion to that court for\n\nreconsideration, so he may not have sufficiently raised it in state\n\ncourt.       In any case, the answer to those questions need not be\n\nresolved because Lavallee's petition fails for other reasons.\n\n              Ritchie required that a state judge review the agency\n\nfile and determine whether it contained information that probably\n\nwould have changed the outcome of defendant's trial. That was done\n\nhere.    The trial judge here concluded, pre-verdict, that even if\n\nthe   documents     were   within   the    scope   of   Brady,    there    was   no\n\nreasonable probability of a different result if they had been\n\nproduced earlier (i.e., they failed the Brady materiality test).\n\nThe   court    accepted    the   defense    argument    that     the    additional\n\ndocuments were pertinent in two ways to the defense theory that the\n\nvictim had fabricated her allegations of abuse against her step-\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffather in order to be with her boyfriend, Brad.         Defense counsel,\n\nacknowledging that the victim had already testified that she was\n\nstill in love with Brad and still maintaining contact with him at\n\nthe time of trial, argued that the new documents would support the\n\ndefense theme that her strong, ongoing relationship with Brad had\n\ncolored her testimony and led to false accusations against her\n\nfather.   He also argued that some of the notes in the newly-\n\nproduced DCYF   materials   could   be   used   to   undercut   the   step-\n\ndaughter's credibility as to her testimony about whether she had\n\nmade certain phone calls to Brad and whether she had told her\n\nmother about the alleged abuse.      The trial judge, citing Brady,\n\nruled that \"[b]y and large, the material is cumulative and really\n\ndoesn't add a heck of a lot with regard to the Brad issue beyond\n\nwhat is already in evidence.\"   As to the impeachment value of the\n\nevidence, the trial judge found it to be \"not so weighty as to\n\nproduce a reasonable probability of a different result if there\n\nwere a guilty verdict on one or more of the charges.\"           Even were\n\nthose sound determinations before us on direct review and not on\n\nhabeas, we would affirm.      The new material, which was largely\n\ncumulative of what the jury had already heard, would have added\n\nlittle to the defense theme.\n\n          We affirm the denial of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f",

In a subsequent order, the district court turned to the questions of whether the files met the standard for materiality under <i>Brady</i> and whether the state trial court's decision that the undisclosed evidence was not material was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).

The files were self-evidently not within the custody or possession of the prosecution, so the question becomes whether they were nonetheless within the prosecutor's control. There is no claim that the prosecutor had any reason to think that the original files turned over from DCYF were incomplete. And while prosecutors may be held accountable for information known to police investigators, <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 437-38, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), DCYF is neither the police nor the equivalent of the police in assisting the prosecution. DCYF was not the prosecuting agency and is independent of both the police department and the prosecutor's office. Indeed, in its decision on Lavallee's direct appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that DCYF shared no special relationship with the prosecutor or the police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Lavallee,</i> 765 A.2d at 673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a wrinkle, though, and it lies in the Supreme Court's 1987 opinion in <i>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). In <i>Ritchie,</i> a defendant in state criminal court sought the production of files from a state child protection agency, equivalent to DCYF. 480 U.S. at 43-44, 107 S.Ct. 989. The agency pointed to a state statute that made its files confidential, subject to certain exceptions, and refused to produce the files, which concerned the alleged victim of sexual abuse by the defendant. <i>Id.</i> The trial court judge refused to order the disclosure of the files, the defendant was convicted, and he appealed. <i>Id.</i> at 44-45, 107 S.Ct. 989. An intermediate state appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded on the ground that the failure to disclose the agency files violated due process. <i>Id.</i> at 45, 107 S.Ct. 989. The state appealed, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed that the conviction had to be vacated and the case remanded to determine if a new trial was necessary in light of the information in the agency files. <i>Id.</i> at 46, 107 S.Ct. 989. The court also held that the defendant was entitled to review the entirety of the agency's files to search for any useful evidence. <i>Id.</i> On review of that ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court noted the government's duty \"to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment,\" citing <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), and <i>Brady.</i> 480 U.S. at 57, 107 S.Ct. 989. The Court did not ask the question that usually begins the <i>Brady</i> analysis &#8212; namely, whether the agency file at issue was within the custody, possession, or control of the prosecutor. The Court upheld the vacatur and remand and held, under the Due Process Clause, that the defendant was entitled to have the agency file reviewed by the trial court to determine whether it contained information \"that probably would have changed the outcome of his trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58, 107 S.Ct. 989. However, the Court reversed the state supreme court's ruling to the extent that it allowed the defendant immediate access to the entirety of the agency's files. <i>Id.</i> at 61, 107 S.Ct. 989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of our sense that there is some ambiguity about the relationship between <i>Ritchie</i> and <i>Brady,</i> we would be very hesitant to conclude, as the magistrate judge did, that the New Hampshire Supreme Court opinion, which analyzed the <i>Brady</i> claim in classic terms, was nonetheless \"contrary to\" the holding in <i>Ritchie</i> or that the particular doctrine invoked here was \"clearly established\" as a <i>Brady</i> doctrine. Moreover, petitioner did not cite <i>Ritchie</i> to the New Hampshire Supreme Court on his appeal; he cited it for the first time in his motion to that court for reconsideration, so he may not have sufficiently raised it in state court. In any case, the answer to those questions need not be resolved because Lavallee's petition fails for other reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ritchie</i> required that a state judge review the agency file and determine whether it contained information that probably would have changed the outcome of defendant's trial. That was done here. The trial judge here concluded, pre-verdict, that even if the documents were within the scope of <i>Brady,</i> there was no reasonable probability of a different result if they had been produced earlier (i.e., they failed the <i>Brady</i> materiality test). The court accepted the defense argument that the additional documents were pertinent in two ways to the defense theory that the victim had fabricated her allegations of abuse against her step-father in order to be with her boyfriend, Brad. Defense counsel, acknowledging that the victim had already testified that she was still in love with Brad and still maintaining contact with him at the time of trial, argued that the new documents would support the defense theme that her strong, ongoing relationship with Brad had colored her testimony and led to false accusations against her father. He also argued that some of the notes in the newly-produced DCYF materials could be used to undercut the step-daughter's credibility as to her testimony about whether she had made certain phone calls to Brad and whether she had told her mother about the alleged abuse. The trial judge, citing <i>Brady,</i> ruled that \"[b]y and large, the material is cumulative and really doesn't add a heck of a lot with regard to the Brad issue beyond what is already in evidence.\" As to the impeachment value of the evidence, the trial judge found it to be \"not so weighty as to produce a reasonable probability of a different result if there were a guilty verdict on one or more of the charges.\" Even were those sound determinations before us on direct review and not on habeas, we would affirm. The new material, which was largely cumulative of what the jury had already heard, would have added little to the defense theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the denial of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lavallee argues that there are a number of \"connections\" between DCYF and the police and prosecution and that those connections support treating DCYF files as<i>Brady</i> material.

DCYF had initiated abuse and neglect proceedings against Lavallee and neglect proceedings against the step-daughter's mother (Lavallee's wife) after the step-daughter had made allegations of sexual abuse by Lavallee to the police. DCYF files are confidential under New Hampshire's Child Protection Act, N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 169-C:25, III, and absent a court order, even the prosecution may not access them, <i>see State v.

The omitted materials detail a DCYF caseworker's contacts with the step-daughter, her family, and her foster-care providers beginning shortly after the accusations against Lavallee were made and continuing through the time of trial. The prosecution immediately gave the new materials to the defense, and before a verdict was reached, Lavallee moved to dismiss all of the charges because of the late production of the documents.

The second component is present only if the exculpatory or impeaching evidence at issue (here, the omitted file materials) is the type of evidence covered by the <i>Brady</i> rule; exculpatory or impeaching evidence is so-called \"<i>Brady</i> material\" only if it is within the government's custody, possession, or control. <i>See Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d at 151-53; <i>see also Strickler,</i> 527 U.S. at 280-81, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An intermediate state appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded on the ground that the failure to disclose the agency files violated due process. <i>Id.</i> at 45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>. The state appealed, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed that the conviction had to be vacated and the case remanded to determine if a new trial was necessary in light of the information in the agency files. <i>Id.</i> at 46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>. The court also held that the defendant was entitled to review the entirety of the agency's files to search for any useful evidence. <i>Id.</i> On review of that ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court noted the government's duty \"to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment,\" citing <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109506\"><a href=\"/opinion/109506/united-states-v-agurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109506\"><a href=\"/opinion/109506/united-states-v-agurs/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span> (1976), and <i>Brady.</i> 480 U.S. at 57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>. The Court did not ask the question that usually begins the <i>Brady</i> analysis &#8212; namely, whether the agency file at issue was within the custody, possession, or control of the prosecutor. The Court upheld the vacatur and remand and held, under the Due Process Clause, that the defendant was entitled to have the agency file reviewed by the trial court to determine whether it contained information \"that probably would have changed the outcome of his trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>. However, the Court reversed the state supreme court's ruling to the extent that it allowed the defendant immediate access to the entirety of the agency's files. <i>Id.</i> at 61, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, petitioner did not cite <i>Ritchie</i> to the New Hampshire Supreme Court on his appeal; he cited it for the first time in his motion to that court for reconsideration, so he may not have sufficiently raised it in state court. In any case, the answer to those questions need not be resolved because Lavallee's petition fails for other reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ritchie</i> required that a state judge review the agency file and determine whether it contained information that probably would have changed the outcome of defendant's trial. That was done here. The trial judge here concluded, pre-verdict, that even if the documents were within the scope of <i>Brady,</i> there was no reasonable probability of a different result if they had been produced earlier (i.e., they failed the <i>Brady</i> materiality test). The court accepted the defense argument that the additional documents were pertinent in two ways to the defense theory that the victim had fabricated her allegations of abuse against her step-father in order to be with her boyfriend, Brad. Defense counsel, acknowledging that the victim had already testified that she was still in love with Brad and still maintaining contact with him at the time of trial, argued that the new documents would support the defense theme that her strong, ongoing relationship with Brad had colored her testimony and led to false accusations against her father. He also argued that some of the notes in the newly-produced DCYF materials could be used to undercut the step-daughter's credibility as to her testimony about whether she had made certain phone calls to Brad and whether she had told her mother about the alleged abuse. The trial judge, citing <i>Brady,</i> ruled that \"[b]y and large, the material is cumulative and really doesn't add a heck of a lot with regard to the Brad issue beyond what is already in evidence.\" As to the impeachment value of the evidence, the trial judge found it to be \"not so weighty as to produce a reasonable probability of a different result if there were a guilty verdict on one or more of the charges.\" Even were those sound determinations before us on direct review and not on habeas, we would affirm. The new material, which was largely cumulative of what the jury had already heard, would have added little to the defense theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the denial of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Lavallee argues that there are a number of \"connections\" between DCYF and the police and prosecution and that those connections support treating DCYF files as<i>Brady</i> material. Lavallee points out, for example, that police officers had some contact with DCYF and with the step-daughter while she was in foster care and that members of the prosecutor's office had some contact with DCYF workers. However, the New Hampshire Supreme Court clearly resolved the issue against him and that determination is entirely sound.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
