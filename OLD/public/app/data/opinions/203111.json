SICUSO, Individually,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Lynch, Lipez, and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Mitchell J. Notis for appellant.\n     Sarah M. Joss, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Martha\nCoakley, Attorney General, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        January 22, 2008\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            Andrew Chmielinski, the Chief\n\nProbation Officer of the Milford, Massachusetts, District Court,\n\nwas fired by the Commissioner of Probation after a hearing on\n\ncharges he had abused his office.          That termination was upheld on\n\nadministrative appeal to the Chief Justice for Administration and\n\nManagement (\"CJAM\") of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Trial\n\nCourt and then to the Trial Court's Advisory Committee on Personnel\n\nStandards.\n\n          Chmielinski    filed   a    civil    rights   action   in   federal\n\ndistrict court alleging that his procedural due process rights had\n\nbeen violated. The district court dismissed the action for failure\n\nto state a claim.   We affirm the dismissal, although our take on\n\nthe case is different.    We focus on whether the initial hearing,\n\nwhich did not involve full trial rights, violated due process\n\nguarantees and conclude it did not.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          Because this appeal comes to us on a motion to dismiss,\n\nwe accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as\n\ntrue and view all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n\nRucker v. Lee Holding Co., 471 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Chmielinski started working as a temporary Probation\n\nOfficer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Trial Court in 1976.\n\nHe became a permanent Probation Officer in 1979 and worked in the\n\nDorchester District Court until 1996.         In 1996, he was promoted to\n\n                                     -2-\n\fbe the Chief Probation Officer in the Milford District Court and\n\ncontinued in that role until his discharge on February 20, 2004.\n\nA.           Pre-termination Proceedings\n\n             On    April     15,   2003,   Chmielinski         learned   that   his\n\nsupervisors had complaints regarding his work performance, but he\n\ndid not become aware of the specific nature of the complaints.                  The\n\nsame day, he received a letter from defendant Anthony J. Sicuso,\n\nthe   Deputy      Commissioner/Legal       Counsel   of   the     Office   of   the\n\nCommissioner of Probation, stating that allegations of misconduct\n\nhad   been     made   against      Chmielinski.1     At    a     meeting   between\n\nChmielinski and Sicuso on May 13, 2003, Sicuso reiterated that\n\nallegations had been made, but refused to provide any specifics to\n\nChmielinski or his counsel.\n\n             On May 16, 2003, Sicuso provided Chmielinski with a\n\nletter    stating     that    he   had   been   placed    on    involuntary     paid\n\nadministrative leave effective immediately.               This letter still did\n\nnot describe what the allegations were, but it informed Chmielinski\n\nthat while the allegations had not been proved, Sicuso believed\n\n\n\n      1\n          Unfortunately, the defendants in their motion to dismiss\nfailed to provide copies of the documents referred to in the\ncomplaint, which would have provided more context. In reviewing a\nRule 12(b)(6) motion, we may consider \"documents the authenticity\nof which are not disputed by the parties; . . . documents central\nto plaintiffs' claim; [and] documents sufficiently referred to in\nthe complaint.\" Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993);\nsee also Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17\n(1st Cir. 1998) (considering document attached to defendant's\nmotion to dismiss).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthey were \"plausible.\"       The letter also set out \"directives\" with\n\nwhich Chmielinski was ordered to comply on penalty of further\n\ndisciplinary action, including that he not appear at the premises\n\nof the Milford District Court, not contact any employees or former\n\nemployees of the Milford District Court, and that he \"[r]efrain\n\nfrom all conflict, intimidating/retaliatory behavior and from any\n\nbehavior which creates the appearance of conflict, of intimidation\n\nor   retaliation.\"         From    the     prohibitions   in    this      letter,\n\nChmielinski received some warning of the nature and sources of the\n\nclaims against him.\n\n           During May and June 2003, a representative of the Trial\n\nCourt/Commissioner of Probation investigated the allegations of\n\nmisconduct against Chmielinski, which led to a report drafted by\n\nRegional Supervisor Elizabeth Slaney, at Sicuso's direction.                 This\n\nreport contained \"embedded hearsay.\"             The complaint alleges the\n\ninvestigation was improper.\n\n           After     the     report        was    completed,        the     Trial\n\nCourt/Commissioner of Probation, by letter dated September 4, 2003,\n\ncharged Chmielinski with multiple acts of misconduct: (1) that\n\nChmielinski had shoplifted on September 12, 2002; (2) that he\n\nimproperly obtained a \"blue light permit\" and mounted the light in\n\nhis personal vehicle; (3) that he made improper disclosures of\n\ncourt   records;   (4)   that     activities     undertaken    by   Chmielinski\n\nrelating to a speeding ticket of his brother created the appearance\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fof impropriety; (5) that he carried a firearm while on duty\n\napproximately four years earlier; and (6) that he was involved in\n\nimproper interactions with other employees.\n\n            A two-day hearing on the allegations was conducted on\n\nJanuary 12, 2004, and January 21, 2004, four months after the\n\ncharges were made.   Defendant John J. O'Brien, the Commissioner of\n\nProbation, presided over the hearing. At this hearing, Chmielinski\n\nand his counsel presented evidence on Chmielinski's own behalf and\n\nhad the opportunity to question the evidence against him.        The\n\ncomplaint alleges this was the only hearing which took place before\n\nhis termination, and his only opportunity to \"present evidence on\n\nhis behalf or to question, other than through oral argument or\n\nwritten argument, the evidence, conclusions or findings\" against\n\nhim.2\n\n            On February 20, 2004, O'Brien issued his decision on the\n\ncharges made against Chmielinski.        While he found in favor of\n\nChmielinski on some of the charges, he found against him on others,\n\nand ordered Chmielinski be terminated effective immediately.\n\nB.          Chmielinski's Post-termination Appeals\n\n            On March 1, 2004, Chmielinski appealed O'Brien's decision\n\nto the CJAM pursuant to Massachusetts state law and the Trial\n\nCourt's human resources policy.        See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211B,\n\n        2\n          Chmielinski alleges that at the end of the hearing it was\nagreed that Chmielinski's counsel would be allowed to submit a\nwritten summary of the evidence and a closing argument after\nreceiving the transcripts of the hearing.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fยง 9(xxviii) (\"[T]he chief justice for administration and management\n\nshall    review       all   appointments         and    dismissals      governed     by\n\n[applicable personnel] standards . . . for noncompliance with such\n\nstandards and shall rescind any such appointment or dismissal that\n\ndoes not comply with said standards.\"); Policies and Procedures\n\nManual of the Human Resources Department of the Administrative\n\nOffice   of    the    Trial   Court    ยง   16.600       [hereinafter     Trial   Court\n\nPolicies and Procedures] (\"Disciplinary Process For Complaints\n\nAgainst Probation Officers\").\n\n              In his written appeal, Chmielinski alleged that the\n\ndecision      was    arbitrary   and   capricious,         and   that    the    process\n\nviolated his rights.            He asserted that the failure to hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing on appeal was itself a violation of his rights.\n\nAs to his termination hearing, he argued that his rights were\n\nviolated on multiple grounds: there was no pre-hearing discovery;\n\nwitnesses were not sworn; witnesses were not sequestered; various\n\ncategories of evidence were improperly admitted; Sicuso's letter\n\nprohibiting contact with any coworkers resulted in preventing\n\nChmielinski     from    conducting     an    investigation        and    preparing   a\n\ndefense; leading questions were asked of witnesses; certain of his\n\nevidence was ignored by O'Brien; the result of his hearing was\n\npredetermined;        O'Brien    lunched         with   counsel    for    the    Trial\n\nCourt/Office of the Commissioner on one of the hearing days, which\n\nwas indicative of bias; and, O'Brien issued his decision only one\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fday after Chmielinski's counsel received a copy of the transcript\n\nof the hearing preventing counsel from making a written submission\n\nafter the hearing.          On August 19, 2004, the CJAM denied the appeal\n\nand upheld the termination decision.\n\n              Chmielinski then exercised his statutory right to appeal\n\nfurther the termination decision to the Trial Court's Advisory\n\nCommittee on Personnel Standards.                  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211B, ยง 8\n\n(\"[If an] employee has served three full years in [an] [applicable]\n\nposition, . . . he shall have the right to appear personally before\n\nthe committee before said committee reaches its decision as to\n\nwhether or not to affirm his removal.\").                  Oral argument was held\n\nbefore the Advisory Committee on November 19, 2004, at which\n\nChmielinski        presented       again     his    allegations       of   procedural\n\ninadequacies.\n\n              The Advisory Committee affirmed Chmielinski's termination\n\nand    informed     the     CJAM    by     letter    dated    November     23,    2004.\n\nChmielinski, through his counsel, was made aware of the Advisory\n\nCommittee's affirmance by a letter dated November 29, 2004.\n\nC.            Federal Lawsuit\n\n              On July 6, 2005, Chmielinski brought suit under 42 U.S.C.\n\nยง    1983   in    federal    district      court    against   the     Office     of   the\n\nCommissioner of Probation, the Trial Court, and O'Brien and Sicuso\n\nin    their      individual    capacities,         alleging    that    Chmielinski's\n\ntermination violated his right to procedural due process.                             He\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fsought    compensatory   and    punitive     damages   from   the   individual\n\ndefendants    and    reinstatement      to    his   former    position       plus\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages from the Commonwealth defendants.\n\n            The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon\n\nwhich relief can be granted.         The motion to dismiss was referred to\n\na magistrate judge, who recommended that the suit be dismissed\n\nbecause Chmielinski, even on the most favorable reading of the\n\ncomplaint, had received constitutionally adequate process.3                   The\n\ndistrict court accepted and adopted the magistrate's recommendation\n\ngranting the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Chmielinski appeals the district court's dismissal of his\n\ndamages    claims   against    the   individual     defendants,     Sicuso   and\n\nO'Brien; he does not appeal the dismissal of his claims against the\n\n\n     3\n          The    magistrate   judge   rejected    the   defendants'\njurisdictional arguments: that the Trial Court's termination\ndecision was a state court judgment and barred from review by the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine and that the plaintiff had not exhausted\nhis administrative remedies. The magistrate did find that Eleventh\nAmendment immunity barred the claims against the Commonwealth\nagencies.\n          The magistrate also rejected Sicuso's and O'Brien's\ncontentions that they were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, but\nnonetheless found that the plaintiff had failed to state a due\nprocess claim.     The magistrate determined that Chmielinski's\nallegations fell within the ambit of the Parratt-Hudson doctrine,\nwhich provides that when a deprivation of a property interest\noccurs due to random and unauthorized conduct, a court must examine\nonly the adequacy of the post-deprivation remedies.       Here, the\nmagistrate found adequate the appeals process that Chmielinski\nreceived after his termination.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fCommonwealth agencies. Our review of the district court's granting\n\nof the motion to dismiss is de novo.              Rodrรญguez-Ortiz v. Margo\n\nCaribe, Inc., 490 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2007).            In order to survive\n\na    motion   to   dismiss,    the   complaint   must   allege    \"a   plausible\n\nentitlement to relief.\"         Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n\n127 S. Ct. 1955, 1967 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA.            Jurisdiction and Immunity\n\n              The defendants made a jurisdictional argument, which was\n\ncorrectly     rejected    by   the    district   court.     The    defendants'\n\njurisdictional argument was that the district court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction because the Trial Court's termination decision\n\nwas a decision of a Massachusetts court and thus is reviewable only\n\nby the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n\n              In terminating Chmielinski's employment, the Trial Court\n\nwas acting as an employer, not as a judicial body.           Chmielinski was\n\nan employee of the Trial Court, not a litigant, and at no time was\n\nhis employment an issue in an action pending before the Trial\n\nCourt. The Trial Court's decision to terminate Chmielinski was the\n\nresult of an administrative proceeding held in its capacity as an\n\nemployer, and was not the \"final judgment[] of a state court in [a]\n\njudicial proceeding[].\" D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S.\n\n462, 482 (1983).         Therefore, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which\n\nbars lower federal courts from reviewing the decisions of state\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fcourts, does not apply to the state court's decision.            See id.;\n\nRooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 416 (1923).\n\n           Defendants' argument that jurisdiction was inappropriate\n\nbecause the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies\n\nin the sense of pursuing a further appeal in the state court system\n\nhas no merit.   The Supreme Court has made clear that exhaustion of\n\nstate administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to filing an\n\naction under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.      Patsy v. Bd. of Regents, 457 U.S.\n\n496, 516 (1982); see also Borges Colรณn v. Romรกn-Abreu, 438 F.3d 1,\n\n19 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio,\n\n140 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 1998)).4\n\nB.         Due Process\n\n           It is agreed that state law gave Chmielinski, a twenty-\n\nfive-year employee of the probation office with certain statutory\n\nprotections,    a   protected   property   interest   in   his   continued\n\nemployment. See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-78\n\n(1972).   He could not be discharged without due process, including\n\na hearing before his termination.        See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538โ42 (1985).\n\n     4\n          The plaintiff's claims against the Commonwealth agencies\nwere dismissed. The Eleventh Amendment renders states immune from\nsuits in federal court by private citizens. See Seminole Tribe of\nFla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Edelman v. Jordan, 415\nU.S. 651, 662-64 (1974).      This situation would not preclude\nprospective injunctive relief against O'Brien and Sicuso if in fact\nplaintiff's due process rights were violated. Ex parte Young, 209\nU.S. 123, 155-56 (1908).      Here, the plaintiff did not seek\nprospective injunctive relief against the individual defendants.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           1.     Inapplicability of the Parratt-Hudson Doctrine\n\n           The Parratt-Hudson doctrine exists to protect states from\n\nneedlessly defending the adequacy of state law process when the\n\nalleged due process violation results from a deviation from that\n\nprocess.   See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984) (holding\n\nthat when alleged due process violations stem from \"random and\n\nunauthorized conduct,\" review is limited solely to the adequacy of\n\nthe post-deprivation remedies); Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527\n\n(1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S.\n\n327, 330-31 (1986).     In instances of \"random and unauthorized\n\nconduct\" by state officials, \"additional pre-deprivation safeguards\n\nwould have little value in preventing an erroneous deprivation of\n\nthe protected [property] interest.\"     Mard v. Town of Amherst, 350\n\nF.3d 184, 193 (1st Cir. 2003).     Thus, \"[w]hen a deprivation of a\n\nproperty interest is occasioned by random and unauthorized conduct\n\nby state officials, . . . the [Supreme] Court has repeatedly\n\nemphasized that the due process inquiry is limited to the issue of\n\nthe adequacy of postdeprivation remedies provided by the state.\"\n\nOโNeill v. Baker, 210 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Lowe v.\n\nScott, 959 F.2d 323, 340 (1st Cir. 1992)) (alteration in original).\n\n           Before invoking the Parratt-Hudson doctrine, however,\n\ncourts must give a hard look at allegations that conduct is \"random\n\nand unauthorized.\" See Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 138 (1990)\n\n(finding that conduct could not be said to be \"unauthorized\" when\n\n                                 -11-\n\fstate had delegated broad discretion to state officials); O'Neill,\n\n210 F.3d at 50 (\"Zinermon [requires] that 'courts scrutinize\n\ncarefully the assertion . . . that [state officials'] conduct is\n\n\"random and unauthorized . . . .\"'\" (quoting Lowe, 959 F.2d at\n\n341)).\n\n               Chmielinski's allegations all concern his January 2004\n\ntermination hearing, a hearing that was conducted in accordance\n\nwith a state-law statutory and regulatory scheme.           Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Laws, chapter 276, section 98 grants the Commissioner of\n\nProbation \"executive control and supervision over the probation\n\nservice,\" under the approval and direction of the CJAM.          The Trial\n\nCourt has promulgated regulations pursuant to that statute which\n\nallow    the    Commissioner   of   Probation   to   initiate   and   impose\n\ndiscipline (including discharge) on probation officers, Trial Court\n\nPolicies and Procedures ยง 16.600, and require that an informal\n\nhearing be held before discipline be imposed, id. ยง 16.300(B).\n\nNeither the statute nor the regulations set out any procedural\n\nrequirements, providing only that the hearing be \"informal.\" Thus,\n\nthe hearing that Chmielinski received cannot be characterized as a\n\ndeviation from the state law; it was not random and unauthorized.\n\n               2.     Adequacy of the Termination Hearing\n\n               Instead, this case is governed by the initial question of\n\nwhether the termination hearing violated due process.           See, e.g.,\n\nMarrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 2007);\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fCepero-Rivera v. Fagundo, 414 F.3d 124, 134-35 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nMard, 350 F.3d at 189-93; O'Neill, 210 F.3d at 48-50.          The Supreme\n\nCourt made clear in Loudermill that when an employee is entitled to\n\nsome process after termination, the purpose of the termination\n\nhearing is solely to serve as \"an initial check against mistaken\n\ndecisions -- essentially, a determination of whether there are\n\nreasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee\n\nare true and support the proposed action.\"         470 U.S. at 545-46.    It\n\n\"need not be elaborate\" as long as an employee receives (1) \"oral\n\nor written notice of the charges against him,\" (2) \"an explanation\n\nof the employer's evidence,\" and (3) \"an opportunity to present his\n\nside of the story.\"        Id.\n\n           Chmielinski does not contest that he received adequate\n\nnotice here or that he was given an explanation of the employer's\n\ncase.   He was first made aware that there were allegations against\n\nhim a full nine months before the hearing, and he was given the\n\nspecific details of the allegations four months before the hearing\n\ntook place.      See Cepero-Rivera, 414 F.3d at 134 (finding less than\n\nthree   weeks'    notice    of   hearing   sufficient);   Torres-Rosado   v.\n\nRotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding two-and-a-\n\nhalf months' notice sufficient); O'Neill, 210 F.3d at 45, 48-49\n\n(finding notice of hearing given only six days before hearing\n\nsufficient when employee had understood nature of allegations\n\nagainst her for the prior three months).            Chmielinski was aware\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthat the hearing concerned discipline, as he had been suspended,\n\nand he appeared at the hearing with counsel and presented evidence\n\non his own behalf.    See Torres-Rosado, 335 F.3d at 10 (finding that\n\n\"far more than the minimum elements\" of due process were met when\n\nplaintiff was accompanied by counsel at hearing, testified, and had\n\nopportunity to present evidence).\n\n            Rather,   Chmielinski's    allegations      of   procedural   due\n\nprocess all concern the adequacy of the hearing he was provided.\n\nThe standard the defendant must meet here is not high: the U.S.\n\nConstitution requires only \"some pretermination opportunity to\n\nrespond.\"    Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542.\n\n            Most of Chmielinski's allegations are a call to transpose\n\nthe procedural protections of a court of law into his termination\n\nhearing:    his desire for pre-hearing discovery, his request that\n\nthe witnesses be sworn and sequestered, and his assertion of\n\nvarious    improprieties   in   the   admission   and    consideration     of\n\nevidence.   These are easily dismissed.     The termination hearing is\n\nnot a court of law, and the same level of process is not required.5\n\nThe U.S. Constitution requires only that Chmielinski was provided\n\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, a requirement that\n\nwas clearly met on the facts of this case.           \"[T]he Constitution\n\n     5\n          \"An agency's failure to follow its own rules may be\nsignificant in administrative law, but the federal Due Process\nClause does not incorporate the particular procedural structures\nenacted by state or local governments; these claims should be\npursued, if at all, under [state] law.\" Torres-Rosado, 334 F.3d at\n10 (citing O'Neill, 210 F.3d at 49 n.9).\n\n                                  -14-\n\frequires only an initial check against erroneous decisions, not\n\nthat the state follow best practices.\"       O'Neill, 210 F.3d at 49\n\nn.10.\n\n          Chmielinski argues he had no meaningful opportunity to\n\nrespond because he was not provided pre-hearing discovery. So long\n\nas he had adequate notice, the state was not required to give him\n\npre-hearing   discovery.    His   real   claim   is   that   his   employer\n\ndeprived him of the opportunity to do his own investigation to\n\nbolster his defense.    He argues the letter he received from Sicuso\n\nordering him to stay away from the Milford District Court and to\n\nrefrain from contacting court employees precluded his attorney from\n\ncontacting people.\n\n          There are several responses.      The first is that each of\n\nthe allegations involved Chmielinski's own conduct, known to him.\n\nFrom this he could testify and assemble a defense. Second, nothing\n\non the face of the letter prevented Chmielinski's counsel from\n\ncontacting witnesses.      If Chmielinski had some doubt about the\n\nscope of the prohibition, he should have, but did not, seek\n\nclarification before the hearing.\n\n          Regardless, Chmielinski makes an argument that he was\n\nunable to respond meaningfully to the charges against him, citing\n\nlanguage from a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court opinion, In re\n\nTobin, 628 N.E.2d 1268, 1271 (Mass. 1994): \"There is authority for\n\nthe proposition that an administrative agency must grant discovery\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fto a party in a contested case regardless of whether the enabling\n\nstatute or agency rules provide for it, if refusal to grant\n\ndiscovery would so prejudice the party as to amount to a denial of\n\ndue process.\"     Tobin recognizes, however, that it is an unusual\n\ncase in which due process concerns are raised, as parties \"are not\n\nentitled to pretrial discovery as a constitutional right.\"      Id.;\n\nsee also P.S.C. Res., Inc. v. NLRB, 576 F.2d 380, 387 (1st Cir.\n\n1978) (\"Although [barring pre-hearing discovery in] a particular\n\nunusual situation might result in gross injustice and call for some\n\nmodification, the instant case is surely not such a situation.\");\n\nKelly v. U.S. EPA, 203 F.3d 519, 523 (7th Cir. 2000); Alexander v.\n\nPathfinder, Inc., 189 F.3d 735, 741 (8th Cir. 1999).        Whatever\n\nimpediment was placed on Chmielinski's ability to investigate, it\n\nwas outweighed by the defendants' interests in protecting those who\n\ncomplained, and it certainly did not violate due process.\n\n          Chmielinski makes a separate set of claims that the\n\noutcome of the hearing was predetermined and the hearing officer\n\nwas biased.     In this sense, he says, his opportunity to be heard\n\nwas not meaningful.      We first look at the nature of the bias\n\nallegations.     He argues there was bias when O'Brien issued his\n\ndecision only one day after Chmielinski's counsel received the\n\ntranscripts of the termination hearing, contrary to an agreement\n\nmade with O'Brien at the hearing that the plaintiff would be\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fallowed    to   make   a    written     submission    after   receiving   the\n\ntranscripts.      This does not show bias.\n\n           The most troubling of Chmielinski's allegations raising\n\nquestions of the appearance of bias involves O'Brien, the hearing\n\nofficer, having lunch with the opposing attorney in the very\n\nproceedings against Chmielinski on one of the hearing days.               The\n\nstate maintains that even if O'Brien was biased, Chmielinski had no\n\nstate-law right to an unbiased hearing officer, nor a federal\n\nright.    It is true that pertinent regulations do not say that the\n\nhearing officer needs to be unbiased.\n\n           We do not think the issue of bias can be addressed with\n\nan abstract broad statement that the due process standard of\n\nLoudermill either always or never requires that the hearing officer\n\nbe   unbiased.6     There    is,   to    start,   a    distinction   between\n\n     6\n          If there were a requirement of an unbiased decisionmaker\nunder state law, the plaintiff would have an argument that\nO'Brien's purported bias was a random and unauthorized act. See\nCronin v. Town of Amesbury, 81 F.3d 257, 260 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996).\nIn that instance, the adequacy of the post-termination procedures\nbecome relevant. See, e.g., McKinney v. Pate, 20 F.3d 1550, 1562\n(11th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (\"[D]ue process [does not] require the\nstate to provide an impartial decisionmaker at the pre-termination\nhearing. The state is obligated only to make available 'the means\nby which [the employee] can receive redress for the deprivations.'\"\n(quoting Schaper v. City of Huntsville, 813 F.2d 709, 715-16 (5th\nCir. 1987) (second alteration in original) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see also McDaniels v. Flick, 59 F.3d 446, 460 (3d\nCir. 1995) (\"We also find most persuasive the application of\nParratt v. Taylor to claims that pretermination decisionmakers were\nnot impartial.\").    Here, those post-termination procedures were\nobviously adequate.     Plaintiff could and did complain about\nO'Brien's supposed bias in his administrative appeal. He makes no\nclaim that his post-termination decisionmakers were biased. For\nthese reasons as well as the reasons in the text, Chmielinski's\n\n                                      -17-\n\fimpartiality and degrees of bias.              We have held that there is no\n\nrequirement that the hearing officer be impartial; indeed, the\n\nterminating     employer         may    preside.         Acosta-Sepulveda        v.\n\nHernandez-Purcell, 889 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1989).                    We have also\n\nheld    that   there      need    not    be    a   formal     hearing    at     all.\n\nFeliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nBut that impartiality is not demanded does not itself determine\n\nwhether bias can be so severe as to interfere with due process at\n\nthe hearing itself.\n\n            A key concern in Loudermill was that the employee have an\n\nopportunity to present his side of things to correct errors of fact\n\non which the termination decision is based.                 See Loudermill, 470\n\nU.S. at 545-46.      In theory at least, a decisionmaker could be so\n\nutterly biased as to deprive an employee of even that error-\n\ncorrection ability.        But there is no allegation of that in this\n\ncase, even if we were to infer from Chmielinski's allegations that\n\nO'Brien had some bias.           Chmielinski's complaint does not allege\n\nanywhere that any alleged bias on O'Brien's part deprived him of\n\nthe    opportunity   to    put    his   version    of   the   facts    before   the\n\ndecisionmaker, or that there was any error of primary facts in the\n\ngrounds used for termination that could be explained only by bias.\n\nChmielinski may disagree with the exercise of judgment which led to\n\n\n\n\nclaim fails in any event.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fthe imposed penalty of termination of his employment, but that does\n\nnot state a due process concern arising out of the hearing itself.\n\n                               III.\n\n          Because the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief could be granted, the district court appropriately granted\n\nthe motion to dismiss.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

Notis for appellant.</p>\n<p>Sarah M. Joss, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Martha Coakley, Attorney General, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, LIPEZ, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Andrew Chmielinski, the Chief Probation Officer of the Milford, Massachusetts, District Court, was fired by the Commissioner of Probation after a hearing on charges he had abused his office. That termination was upheld on administrative appeal to the Chief Justice for Administration and Management (\"CJAM\") of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Trial Court and then to the Trial Court's Advisory Committee on Personnel Standards.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski filed a civil rights action in federal district court alleging that his procedural due process rights had been violated. The district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim. We affirm the dismissal, although our take on the case is different. We focus on whether the initial hearing, which did not involve full trial rights, violated due process guarantees and conclude it did not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because this appeal comes to us on a motion to dismiss, we accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and view all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. <i>Rucker v. Lee Holding Co.,</i> 471 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Chmielinski started working as a temporary Probation Officer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Trial Court in 1976. He became a permanent Probation Officer in 1979 and worked in the Dorchester District Court until 1996. In 1996, he was promoted to be the Chief Probation Officer in the Milford District Court and continued in that role until his discharge on February 20, 2004.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Pre-termination Proceedings</i></p>\n<p>On April 15, 2003, Chmielinski learned that his supervisors had complaints regarding his work performance, but he did not become aware of the specific nature of the complaints. The same day, he received a letter from defendant Anthony J. Sicuso, the Deputy Commissioner/Legal Counsel of the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, stating that allegations of misconduct had been made against Chmielinski.<sup>[1]</sup> At a meeting between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> Chmielinski and Sicuso on May 13, 2003, Sicuso reiterated that allegations had been made, but refused to provide any specifics to Chmielinski or his counsel.</p>\n<p>On May 16, 2003, Sicuso provided Chmielinski with a letter stating that he had been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave effective immediately. This letter still did not describe what the allegations were, but it informed Chmielinski that while the allegations had not been proved, Sicuso believed they were \"plausible.\" The letter also set out \"directives\" with which Chmielinski was ordered to comply on penalty of further disciplinary action, including that he not appear at the premises of the Milford District Court, not contact any employees or former employees of the Milford District Court, and that he \"rdefrain from all conflict, intimidating/retaliatory behavior and from any behavior which creates the appearance of conflict, of intimidation or retaliation.\" From the prohibitions in this letter, Chmielinski received some warning of the nature and sources of the claims against him.</p>\n<p>During May and June 2003, a representative of the Trial Court/Commissioner of Probation investigated the allegations of misconduct against Chmielinski, which led to a report drafted by Regional Supervisor Elizabeth Slaney, at Sicuso's direction. This report contained \"embedded hearsay.\" The complaint alleges the investigation was improper.</p>\n<p>After the report was completed, the Trial Court/Commissioner of Probation, by letter dated September 4, 2003, charged Chmielinski with multiple acts of misconduct: (1) that Chmielinski had shoplifted on September 12, 2002; (2) that he improperly obtained a \"blue light permit\" and mounted the light in his personal vehicle; (3) that he made improper disclosures of court records; (4) that activities undertaken by Chmielinski relating to a speeding ticket of his brother created the appearance of impropriety; (5) that he carried a firearm while on duty approximately four years earlier; and (6) that he was involved in improper interactions with other employees.</p>\n<p>A two-day hearing on the allegations was conducted on January 12, 2004, and January 21, 2004, four months after the charges were made. Defendant John J. O'Brien, the Commissioner of Probation, presided over the hearing. At this hearing, Chmielinski and his counsel presented evidence on Chmielinski's own behalf and had the opportunity to question the evidence against him. The complaint alleges this was the only hearing which took place before his termination, and his only opportunity to \"present evidence on his behalf or to question, other than through oral argument or written argument, the evidence, conclusions or findings\" against him.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On February 20, 2004, O'Brien issued his decision on the charges made against Chmielinski. While he found in favor of Chmielinski on some of the charges, he found against him on others, and ordered Chmielinski be terminated effective immediately.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Chmielinski's Post-termination Appeals</i></p>\n<p>On March 1, 2004, Chmielinski appealed O'Brien's decision to the CJAM pursuant to Massachusetts state law and the Trial Court's human resources policy. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch, 211B, ยง 9(xxviii) (\"[T]he chief justice for administration and management shall review all appointments and dismissals governed by [applicable personnel] standards . . . for noncompliance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> with such standards and shall rescind any such appointment or dismissal that does not comply with said standards.\"); Policies and Procedures Manual of the Human Resources Department of the Administrative Office of the Trial Court ยง 16.600 [hereinafter Trial Court Policies and Procedures] (\"Disciplinary Process For Complaints Against Probation Officers\").</p>\n<p>In his written appeal, Chmielinski alleged that the decision was arbitrary and capricious, and that the process violated his rights. He asserted that the failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on appeal was itself a violation of his rights. As to his termination hearing, he argued that his rights were violated on multiple grounds: there was no pre-hearing discovery; witnesses were not sworn; witnesses were not sequestered; various categories of evidence were improperly admitted; Sicuso's letter prohibiting contact with any co-workers resulted in preventing Chmielinski from conducting an investigation and preparing a defense; leading questions were asked of witnesses; certain of his evidence was ignored by O'Brien; the result of his hearing was predetermined; O'Brien lunched with counsel for the Trial Court/Office of the Commissioner on one of the hearing days, which was indicative of bias; and, O'Brien issued his decision only one day after Chmielinski's counsel received a copy of the transcript of the hearing preventing counsel from making a written submission after the hearing. On August 19, 2004, the CJAM denied the appeal and upheld the termination decision.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski then exercised his statutory right to appeal further the termination decision to the Trial Court's Advisory Committee on Personnel Standards. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211B, ยง 8 (\"[If an] employee has served three full years in [an] [applicable] position, . . . he shall have the right to appear personally before the committee before said committee reaches its decision as to whether or not to affirm his removal.\"). Oral argument was held before the Advisory Committee on November 19, 2004, at which Chmielinski presented again his allegations of procedural inadequacies.</p>\n<p>The Advisory Committee affirmed Chmielinski's termination and informed the CJAM by letter dated November 23, 2004. Chmielinski, through his counsel, was made aware of the Advisory Committee's affirmance by a letter dated November 29, 2004.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Federal Lawsuit</i></p>\n<p>On July 6, 2005, Chmielinski brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in federal district court against the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, the Trial Court, and O'Brien and Sicuso in their individual capacities, alleging that Chmielinski's termination violated his, right to procedural due process. He sought compensatory and punitive damages from the individual defendants and reinstatement to his former position plus compensatory and punitive damages from the Commonwealth defendants.</p>\n<p>The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the suit be dismissed because Chmielinski, even on the most favorable reading of, the complaint, had received constitutionally adequate process.<sup>[3]</sup> The district court accepted and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> adopted the magistrate's recommendation granting the defendants' motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Chmielinski appeals the district court's dismissal of his damages claims against the individual defendants, Sicuso and O'Brien; he does not appeal the dismissal of his claims against the Commonwealth agencies. Our review of the district court's granting of the motion to dismiss is de novo. <i>Rodriguez-Ortiz v. Margo Caribe, Inc.,</i> 490 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.2007). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must allege \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1967, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A. <i>Jurisdiction and Immunity</i></p>\n<p>The defendants made a jurisdictional argument, which was correctly rejected by the district court. The defendants' jurisdictional argument was that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Trial Court's termination decision was a decision of a Massachusetts court and thus is reviewable only by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p>In terminating Chmielinski's employment, the Trial Court was acting as an employer, not as a judicial body. Chmielinski was an employee of the Trial Court, not a litigant, and at no time was his. employment an issue in an action pending before the Trial Court. The Trial Court's decision to terminate Chmielinski was the result of an administrative proceeding held in its capacity as an employer, and was not the \"final judgment[ ] of a state court in [a] judicial proceeding[ ].\" <i>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman,</i> 460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Therefore, the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, which bars lower federal courts from reviewing the decisions of state courts, does not apply to the state court's decision. <i>See id.; </i><i>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,</i> 263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n<p>Defendants' argument that jurisdiction was inappropriate because the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies in the sense of pursuing a further appeal in the state court system has no merit. The Supreme Court has made clear that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to filing an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. <i>Patsy v. Bd. of Regents,</i> 457 U.S. 496, 516, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982); <i>see also Borges Colon Roman-Abreu,</i> 438 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>Baez-Cruz v. Municipality of Comerio,</i> 140 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir.1998)).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*315</span> B. <i>Due Process</i></p>\n<p>It is agreed that state law gave Chmielinski, a twenty-five-year employee of the probation office with certain statutory protections, a protected property interest in his continued employment. <i>See </i><i>Bd. of Regents v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 576-78, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). He could not be discharged without due process, including a hearing before his termination. <i>See </i><i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 538-42, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).</p>\n<p>1. <i>Inapplicability of the</i> Parratt-Hudson <i>Doctrine</i></p>\n<p>The <i>Parratt-Hudson</i> doctrine exists to protect states from needlessly defending the adequacy of state law process when the alleged due process violation results from a deviation from that process. <i>See </i><i>Hudson v. Palmer,</i> 468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (holding that when alleged due process violations stem from \"random and unauthorized con duct,\" review is limited solely to the adequacy of the post-deprivation remedies); <i>Parrott v. Taylor,</i> 451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Daniels v. Williams,</i> 474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). In instances of \"random and unauthorized conduct\" by state officials, \"additional pre-deprivation safeguards would have little value in preventing an erroneous deprivation of the protected [property] interest.\" <i>Mard v. Town of Amherst,</i> 350 F.3d 184, 193 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, \"[w]hen a deprivation of a property interest is occasioned by random and unauthorized conduct by state officials, . . . the [Supreme] Court has repeatedly emphasized that the due process inquiry is limited to the issue of the adequacy of postdeprivation remedies provided by the state.\" <i>O'Neill v. Baker,</i> 210 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Lowe v. Scott,</i> 959 F.2d 323, 340 (1st Cir.1992)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p>Before invoking the <i>Parratt-Hudson</i> doctrine, however, courts must give a hard look at allegations that conduct is \"random and unauthorized.\" <i>See </i><i>Zinermon v. Burch,</i> 494 U.S. 113, 138, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990) (finding that conduct could not be said to be \"unauthorized\" when state had delegated broad discretion to state officials); <i>O'Neill,</i> 210 F.3d at 50 (\"<i>Zinermon</i> [requires] that `courts scrutinize carefully the assertion . . . that [state officials'] conduct is \"random and unauthorized. . . .\"'\" (quoting <i>Lowe,</i> 959 F.2d at 341)).</p>\n<p>Chmielinski's allegations all concern his January 2004 termination hearing, a hearing that was conducted in accordance with a state-law statutory and regulatory scheme. Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 276, section 98 grants the Commissioner of Probation \"executive control and supervision over the probation service,\" under the approval and direction of the CJAM. The Trial Court has promulgated regulations pursuant to that statute which allow the Commissioner of Probation to initiate and impose discipline (including discharge) on, probation officers, <i>Trial Court Policies and Procedures</i> ยง 16.600, and require that an informal hearing be held before discipline be imposed, <i>id.</i> ยง 16.300(B). Neither the statute nor the regulations set out any procedural requirements, providing only that the hearing be \"informal.\" Thus, the hearing that Chmielinski received cannot be characterized as a deviation from the state law; it, was not random and unauthorized.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Adequacy of the Termination Hearing</i></p>\n<p>Instead, this case is governed by the initial question of whether the termination hearing violated due process. <i>See,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> <i>e.g., </i><i>Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina,</i> 491 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Cepero-Rivera v. Fagundo,</i> 414 F.3d 124, 134-35 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>Mard,</i> 350 F.3d at 189-93; <i>O'Neill,</i> 210 F.3d at 48-50. The Supreme Court made clear in <i>Loudermill</i> that when an employee is entitled to some process after termination, the purpose of the termination hearing is solely to serve as \"an initial check against mistaken decisionsย essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.\" 470 U.S. at 545-46, 105 S.Ct. 1487. It \"need not be elaborate\" as long as an employee receives (1) \"oral or written notice of the charges against him,\" (2) \"an explanation of the employer's evidence,\" and (3) \"an opportunity to present his side of the story.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Chmielinski does not contest that he received adequate notice here or that he was given an explanation of the employer's case. He was first made aware that there were allegations against him a full nine months before the hearing, and he was given the specific details of the allegations four months before the hearing took place. <i>See </i><i>Cepero-Rivera,</i> 414 F.3d at 134 (finding less than three weeks' notice of hearing sufficient); <i>Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 335 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003) (finding two-and-a-half months' notice sufficient); <i>O'Neill,</i> 210 F.3d at 45, 48-49 (finding notice of hearing given only six days before hearing sufficient when employee had. understood nature of allegations against her for the prior three months). Chmielinski was aware that the hearing concerned discipline, as he had been suspended, and he appeared at the hearing with counsel and presented evidence on his own behalf. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Rosado,</i> 335 F.3d at 10 (finding that \"far more than the minimum elements\" of due process were met when plaintiff was accompanied by counsel at hearing, testified, and had opportunity to present evidence).</p>\n<p>Rather, Chmielinski's allegations of procedural due process all concern the adequacy of the hearing he was provided. The standard the defendant must meet here is not high: the U.S. Constitution requires only \"some pretermination opportunity to respond.\" <i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487.</p>\n<p>Most of Chmielinski's allegations are a call to transpose the procedural protections of a court of law into his termination hearing: his desire for pre-hearing discovery, his request that the witnesses be sworn and sequestered, and his assertion of various improprieties in the admission and consideration of evidence. These are easily dismissed. The termination hearing is not a court of law, and the same level of process is not required.<sup>[5]</sup> The U.S. Constitution requires only that Chmielinski was provided notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, a requirement that was clearly met on the facts of this case. \"[Title Constitution requires only an initial check against erroneous decisions, not that the state follow best practices.\" <i>O'Neill,</i> 210 F.3d at 49 n. 10.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski argues he had no meaningful opportunity to respond because he was not provided pre-hearing discovery. So long as he had adequate notice, the state was not required to give him pre-hearing discovery. His real claim is that his employer deprived him of the opportunity to do his own investigation to bolster his defense. He argues the letter he received <span class=\"star-pagination\">*317</span> from Sicuso ordering him to stay away from the Milford District Court and to refrain from contacting court employees precluded his attorney from contacting people.</p>\n<p>There are several responses. The first is that each of the allegations involved Chmielinski's own conduct, known to him. From this he could testify and assemble a defense. Second, nothing on the face of the letter prevented Chmielinski's counsel from contacting witnesses. If Chmielinski had some doubt about the scope of the prohibition, he should have, but did not, seek clarification before the hearing.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Chmielinski makes an argument that he was unable to respond meaningfully to the charges against him, citing language from a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court opinion, <i>In re Tobin,</i> 417 Mass. 81, 628 N.E.2d 1268, 1271 (Mass. 1994): \"There is authority for the proposition that an administrative agency must grant discovery to a party in a contested case regardless of whether the enabling statute or agency rules provide for it, if refusal to grant discovery would so prejudice the party as to amount to a denial of due process.\" <i>Tobin</i> recognizes, however, that it is an unusual case in which due process concerns are raised, as parties \"are not entitled to pretrial discovery as a constitutional right.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>P.S.C. Res., Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 576 F.2d 380, 387 (1st Cir.1978) (\"Although [barring pre-hearing discovery in] a particular unusual situation might result in gross injustice and call for some modification, the instant case is surely not such a situation.\"); <i>Kelly v. U.S. EPA,</i> 203 F.3d 519, 523 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Alexander v. Pathfinder, Inc.,</i> 189 F.3d 735, 741 (8th Cir.1999). Whatever impediment was placed on Chmielinski's ability to investigate, it was outweighed by the defendants' interests in protecting those who complained, and it certainly did not violate due process.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski makes a separate set of claims that the outcome of the hearing was predetermined and the hearing officer was biased. In this sense, he says, his opportunity to be heard was not meaning ful. We first look at the nature of the bias allegations. He argues there was bias when O'Brien issued his decision only one day after Chmielinski's counsel received the transcripts of the termination hearing, contrary to an agreement made with O'Brien at the hearing that the plaintiff would be allowed to make a written submission after receiving the transcripts. This does not show bias.</p>\n<p>The most troubling of Chmielinski's allegations raising questions of the appearance of bias involves O'Brien, the hearing officer, having lunch with the opposing attorney in the very proceedings against Chmielinski on one of the hearing days. The state maintains that even if O'Brien was biased, Chmielinski had no state-law right to an unbiased hearing officer, nor a federal right. It is true that pertinent regulations do not say that the hearing officer needs to be unbiased.</p>\n<p>We do not think the issue of bias can be addressed with an abstract broad statement that the due process standard of <i>Loudermill</i> either always or never requires that the hearing officer be unbiased.<sup>[6]</sup> There is, to start, a distinction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span> between impartiality and degrees of bias. We have held that there is no requirement that the hearing officer be impartial; indeed, the terminating employer may preside. <i>Acosta-Sepulveda v. Hernandez-Purcell,</i> 889 F.2d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1989). We have also held that there need not be a formal hearing at all. <i>Feliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 858 F.2d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 1988). But that impartiality is not demanded does not itself determine whether bias can be so severe as to interfere with due process at the hearing itself.</p>\n<p>A key concern in <i>Loudermill</i> was that the employee have an opportunity to present his side of things to correct errors of fact on which the termination decision is based. <i>See </i><i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 545-46, 105 S.Ct. 1487. In theory at least, a decisionmaker could be so utterly biased as to deprive an employee of even that error-correction ability. But there is no allegation of that in this case, even if we were to infer from Chmielinski's allegations that O'Brien had some bias. Chmielinski's complaint does not allege anywhere that any alleged bias on O'Brien's part deprived him of the opportunity to put his version of the facts before the decisionmaker, or that there was any error of primary facts in the grounds used for termination that could be explained only by bias. Chmielinski may disagree with the exercise of judgment which led to the imposed penalty of termination of his employment, but that does not state a due process concern arising out of the hearing itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court appropriately granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Unfortunately, the defendants in their motion to dismiss failed to provide copies of the documents referred to in the complaint, which would have provided more context. In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we may consider \"documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; . . . documents central to plaintiffs' claim; [and] documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint.\" <i>Watterson v. Page,</i> 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir, 1993); <i>see also </i><i>Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1998) (considering document attached to defendant's motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p>[2]  Chmielinski alleges that at the end of the hearing it was agreed that Chmielinski's counsel would be allowed to submit a written summary of the evidence and a closing argument after receiving the transcripts of the hearing.</p>\n<p>[3]  The magistrate judge rejected the defendants' jurisdictional arguments: that the Trial Court's termination decision was a state court judgment and barred from review by the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine and that the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies. The magistrate did find that Eleventh Amendment immunity barred the claims against the Commonwealth agencies.\n</p>\n<p>The magistrate also rejected Sicuso's and O'Brien's contentions that they were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, but nonetheless found that the plaintiff had failed to state a due process claim. The magistrate determined that Chmielinski's allegations fell within the ambit of the <i>Parratt-Hudson</i> doctrine, which provides that when a deprivation of a property interest occurs due to random and unauthorized conduct, a court must examine only the adequacy of the post-deprivation remedies. Here, the magistrate found adequate the appeals process that Chrnielinski received after his termination.</p>\n<p>[4]  The plaintiff's claims against the Commonwealth agencies were dismissed. The Eleventh Amendment renders states immune from suits in federal court by private citizens. <i>See </i><i>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,</i> 517 U.S. 44, 54, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996); <i>Edelman v. Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651, 662-64, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). This situation would not preclude prospective injunctive relief against O'Brien and Sicuso if in fact plaintiff's due process rights were violated. <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 155-56, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Here, the plaintiff did not seek prospective injunctive relief against the individual defendants.</p>\n<p>[5]  \"An agency's failure to follow its own rules may be significant in administrative law, but the federal Due Process Clause does not incorporate the particular procedural structures enacted by state or local governments; these claims should be pursued, if at all, under [state] law.\" <i>Torres-Rosado,</i> 335 F.3d at 10 (citing <i>O'Neill,</i> 210 F.3d at 49 n. 9).</p>\n<p>[6]  If there were a requirement of an unbiased decisionmaker under state law, the plaintiff would have an argument that O'Brien's purported bias was a random and unauthorized act. <i>See </i><i>Cronin v. Town of Amesbury,</i> 51 F.3d 257, 260 n. 2 (1st Cir.1996). In that instance, the adequacy of the post-termination procedures become relevant. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McKinney v. Pate,</i> 20 F.3d 1550, 1562 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (\"[D]ue process [does not] require the state to provide an impartial decisionmaker at the pre-termination hearing. The state is obligated only to make available `the means by which [the employee] can receive redress for the deprivations.'\" (quoting <i>Schaper v. City of Huntsville,</i> 813 F.2d 709, 715-16 (5th Cir.1987) (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>see also </i><i>McDaniels v. Flick,</i> 59 F.3d 446, 460 (3d Cir.1995) (\"We also find most persuasive the application of <i>Parratt v. Taylor</i> to claims that pretermination decisionmakers were not impartial.\"). Here, those post-termination procedures were obviously adequate. Plaintiff could and did complain about O'Brien's supposed bias in his administrative appeal. He makes no claim that his post-termination decisionmakers were biased. For these reasons as well as the reasons in the text, Chmielinski's claim fails in any event.</p>\n\n</div>",

That termination was upheld on administrative appeal to the Chief Justice for Administration and Management (\"CJAM\") of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Trial Court and then to the Trial Court's Advisory Committee on Personnel Standards.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski filed a civil rights action in federal district court alleging that his procedural due process rights had been violated. The district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim. We affirm the dismissal, although our take on the case is different. We focus on whether the initial hearing, which did not involve full trial rights, violated due process guarantees and conclude it did not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because this appeal comes to us on a motion to dismiss, we accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and view all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. <i>Rucker v.

He became a permanent Probation Officer in 1979 and worked in the Dorchester District Court until 1996. In 1996, he was promoted to be the Chief Probation Officer in the Milford District Court and continued in that role until his discharge on February 20, 2004.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Pre-termination Proceedings</i></p>\n<p>On April 15, 2003, Chmielinski learned that his supervisors had complaints regarding his work performance, but he did not become aware of the specific nature of the complaints. The same day, he received a letter from defendant Anthony J. Sicuso, the Deputy Commissioner/Legal Counsel of the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, stating that allegations of misconduct had been made against Chmielinski.<sup>[1]</sup> At a meeting between <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> Chmielinski and Sicuso on May 13, 2003, Sicuso reiterated that allegations had been made, but refused to provide any specifics to Chmielinski or his counsel.</p>\n<p>On May 16, 2003, Sicuso provided Chmielinski with a letter stating that he had been placed on involuntary paid administrative leave effective immediately. This letter still did not describe what the allegations were, but it informed Chmielinski that while the allegations had not been proved, Sicuso believed they were \"plausible.\" The letter also set out \"directives\" with which Chmielinski was ordered to comply on penalty of further disciplinary action, including that he not appear at the premises of the Milford District Court, not contact any employees or former employees of the Milford District Court, and that he \"rdefrain from all conflict, intimidating/retaliatory behavior and from any behavior which creates the appearance of conflict, of intimidation or retaliation.\" From the prohibitions in this letter, Chmielinski received some warning of the nature and sources of the claims against him.</p>\n<p>During May and June 2003, a representative of the Trial Court/Commissioner of Probation investigated the allegations of misconduct against Chmielinski, which led to a report drafted by Regional Supervisor Elizabeth Slaney, at Sicuso's direction. This report contained \"embedded hearsay.\" The complaint alleges the investigation was improper.</p>\n<p>After the report was completed, the Trial Court/Commissioner of Probation, by letter dated September 4, 2003, charged Chmielinski with multiple acts of misconduct: (1) that Chmielinski had shoplifted on September 12, 2002; (2) that he improperly obtained a \"blue light permit\" and mounted the light in his personal vehicle; (3) that he made improper disclosures of court records; (4) that activities undertaken by Chmielinski relating to a speeding ticket of his brother created the appearance of impropriety; (5) that he carried a firearm while on duty approximately four years earlier; and (6) that he was involved in improper interactions with other employees.</p>\n<p>A two-day hearing on the allegations was conducted on January 12, 2004, and January 21, 2004, four months after the charges were made. Defendant John J. O'Brien, the Commissioner of Probation, presided over the hearing. At this hearing, Chmielinski and his counsel presented evidence on Chmielinski's own behalf and had the opportunity to question the evidence against him. The complaint alleges this was the only hearing which took place before his termination, and his only opportunity to \"present evidence on his behalf or to question, other than through oral argument or written argument, the evidence, conclusions or findings\" against him.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On February 20, 2004, O'Brien issued his decision on the charges made against Chmielinski. While he found in favor of Chmielinski on some of the charges, he found against him on others, and ordered Chmielinski be terminated effective immediately.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Chmielinski's Post-termination Appeals</i></p>\n<p>On March 1, 2004, Chmielinski appealed O'Brien's decision to the CJAM pursuant to Massachusetts state law and the Trial Court's human resources policy. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch, 211B, ยง 9(xxviii) (\"[T]he chief justice for administration and management shall review all appointments and dismissals governed by [applicable personnel] standards . . . for noncompliance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*313</span> with such standards and shall rescind any such appointment or dismissal that does not comply with said standards.\"); Policies and Procedures Manual of the Human Resources Department of the Administrative Office of the Trial Court ยง 16.600 [hereinafter Trial Court Policies and Procedures] (\"Disciplinary Process For Complaints Against Probation Officers\").</p>\n<p>In his written appeal, Chmielinski alleged that the decision was arbitrary and capricious, and that the process violated his rights. He asserted that the failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on appeal was itself a violation of his rights. As to his termination hearing, he argued that his rights were violated on multiple grounds: there was no pre-hearing discovery; witnesses were not sworn; witnesses were not sequestered; various categories of evidence were improperly admitted; Sicuso's letter prohibiting contact with any co-workers resulted in preventing Chmielinski from conducting an investigation and preparing a defense; leading questions were asked of witnesses; certain of his evidence was ignored by O'Brien; the result of his hearing was predetermined; O'Brien lunched with counsel for the Trial Court/Office of the Commissioner on one of the hearing days, which was indicative of bias; and, O'Brien issued his decision only one day after Chmielinski's counsel received a copy of the transcript of the hearing preventing counsel from making a written submission after the hearing. On August 19, 2004, the CJAM denied the appeal and upheld the termination decision.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski then exercised his statutory right to appeal further the termination decision to the Trial Court's Advisory Committee on Personnel Standards. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 211B, ยง 8 (\"[If an] employee has served three full years in [an] [applicable] position, . . . he shall have the right to appear personally before the committee before said committee reaches its decision as to whether or not to affirm his removal.\"). Oral argument was held before the Advisory Committee on November 19, 2004, at which Chmielinski presented again his allegations of procedural inadequacies.</p>\n<p>The Advisory Committee affirmed Chmielinski's termination and informed the CJAM by letter dated November 23, 2004. Chmielinski, through his counsel, was made aware of the Advisory Committee's affirmance by a letter dated November 29, 2004.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Federal Lawsuit</i></p>\n<p>On July 6, 2005, Chmielinski brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in federal district court against the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, the Trial Court, and O'Brien and Sicuso in their individual capacities, alleging that Chmielinski's termination violated his, right to procedural due process. He sought compensatory and punitive damages from the individual defendants and reinstatement to his former position plus compensatory and punitive damages from the Commonwealth defendants.</p>\n<p>The defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The motion to dismiss was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the suit be dismissed because Chmielinski, even on the most favorable reading of, the complaint, had received constitutionally adequate process.<sup>[3]</sup> The district court accepted and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*314</span> adopted the magistrate's recommendation granting the defendants' motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Chmielinski appeals the district court's dismissal of his damages claims against the individual defendants, Sicuso and O'Brien; he does not appeal the dismissal of his claims against the Commonwealth agencies. Our review of the district court's granting of the motion to dismiss is de novo. <i>Rodriguez-Ortiz v.

The defendants' jurisdictional argument was that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Trial Court's termination decision was a decision of a Massachusetts court and thus is reviewable only by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p>In terminating Chmielinski's employment, the Trial Court was acting as an employer, not as a judicial body. Chmielinski was an employee of the Trial Court, not a litigant, and at no time was his. employment an issue in an action pending before the Trial Court. The Trial Court's decision to terminate Chmielinski was the result of an administrative proceeding held in its capacity as an employer, and was not the \"final judgment[ ] of a state court in [a] judicial proceeding[ ].\" <i>D.C.

Therefore, the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrine, which bars lower federal courts from reviewing the decisions of state courts, does not apply to the state court's decision. <i>See id.; </i><i>Rooker v.

Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 276, section 98 grants the Commissioner of Probation \"executive control and supervision over the probation service,\" under the approval and direction of the CJAM. The Trial Court has promulgated regulations pursuant to that statute which allow the Commissioner of Probation to initiate and impose discipline (including discharge) on, probation officers, <i>Trial Court Policies and Procedures</i> ยง 16.600, and require that an informal hearing be held before discipline be imposed, <i>id.</i> ยง 16.300(B). Neither the statute nor the regulations set out any procedural requirements, providing only that the hearing be \"informal.\" Thus, the hearing that Chmielinski received cannot be characterized as a deviation from the state law; it, was not random and unauthorized.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Adequacy of the Termination Hearing</i></p>\n<p>Instead, this case is governed by the initial question of whether the termination hearing violated due process. <i>See,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*316</span> <i>e.g., </i><i>Marrero-Gutierrez v.

The Supreme Court made clear in <i>Loudermill</i> that when an employee is entitled to some process after termination, the purpose of the termination hearing is solely to serve as \"an initial check against mistaken decisionsย essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.\" 470 U.S. at 545-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He was first made aware that there were allegations against him a full nine months before the hearing, and he was given the specific details of the allegations four months before the hearing took place. <i>See </i><i>Cepero-Rivera,</i> 414 F.3d at 134 (finding less than three weeks' notice of hearing sufficient); <i>Torres-Rosado v.

Chmielinski was aware that the hearing concerned discipline, as he had been suspended, and he appeared at the hearing with counsel and presented evidence on his own behalf. <i>See </i><i>Torres-Rosado,</i> 335 F.3d at 10 (finding that \"far more than the minimum elements\" of due process were met when plaintiff was accompanied by counsel at hearing, testified, and had opportunity to present evidence).</p>\n<p>Rather, Chmielinski's allegations of procedural due process all concern the adequacy of the hearing he was provided. The standard the defendant must meet here is not high: the U.S. Constitution requires only \"some pretermination opportunity to respond.\" <i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 542, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Most of Chmielinski's allegations are a call to transpose the procedural protections of a court of law into his termination hearing: his desire for pre-hearing discovery, his request that the witnesses be sworn and sequestered, and his assertion of various improprieties in the admission and consideration of evidence. These are easily dismissed. The termination hearing is not a court of law, and the same level of process is not required.<sup>[5]</sup> The U.S. Constitution requires only that Chmielinski was provided notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, a requirement that was clearly met on the facts of this case. \"[Title Constitution requires only an initial check against erroneous decisions, not that the state follow best practices.\" <i>O'Neill,</i> 210 F.3d at 49 n. 10.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski argues he had no meaningful opportunity to respond because he was not provided pre-hearing discovery. So long as he had adequate notice, the state was not required to give him pre-hearing discovery. His real claim is that his employer deprived him of the opportunity to do his own investigation to bolster his defense. He argues the letter he received <span class=\"star-pagination\">*317</span> from Sicuso ordering him to stay away from the Milford District Court and to refrain from contacting court employees precluded his attorney from contacting people.</p>\n<p>There are several responses. The first is that each of the allegations involved Chmielinski's own conduct, known to him. From this he could testify and assemble a defense. Second, nothing on the face of the letter prevented Chmielinski's counsel from contacting witnesses. If Chmielinski had some doubt about the scope of the prohibition, he should have, but did not, seek clarification before the hearing.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Chmielinski makes an argument that he was unable to respond meaningfully to the charges against him, citing language from a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court opinion, <i>In re Tobin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></span>, 1271 (Mass. 1994): \"There is authority for the proposition that an administrative agency must grant discovery to a party in a contested case regardless of whether the enabling statute or agency rules provide for it, if refusal to grant discovery would so prejudice the party as to amount to a denial of due process.\" <i>Tobin</i> recognizes, however, that it is an unusual case in which due process concerns are raised, as parties \"are not entitled to pretrial discovery as a constitutional right.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>P.S.C.

Whatever impediment was placed on Chmielinski's ability to investigate, it was outweighed by the defendants' interests in protecting those who complained, and it certainly did not violate due process.</p>\n<p>Chmielinski makes a separate set of claims that the outcome of the hearing was predetermined and the hearing officer was biased. In this sense, he says, his opportunity to be heard was not meaning ful. We first look at the nature of the bias allegations. He argues there was bias when O'Brien issued his decision only one day after Chmielinski's counsel received the transcripts of the termination hearing, contrary to an agreement made with O'Brien at the hearing that the plaintiff would be allowed to make a written submission after receiving the transcripts. This does not show bias.</p>\n<p>The most troubling of Chmielinski's allegations raising questions of the appearance of bias involves O'Brien, the hearing officer, having lunch with the opposing attorney in the very proceedings against Chmielinski on one of the hearing days. The state maintains that even if O'Brien was biased, Chmielinski had no state-law right to an unbiased hearing officer, nor a federal right. It is true that pertinent regulations do not say that the hearing officer needs to be unbiased.</p>\n<p>We do not think the issue of bias can be addressed with an abstract broad statement that the due process standard of <i>Loudermill</i> either always or never requires that the hearing officer be unbiased.<sup>[6]</sup> There is, to start, a distinction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*318</span> between impartiality and degrees of bias. We have held that there is no requirement that the hearing officer be impartial; indeed, the terminating employer may preside. <i>Acosta-Sepulveda v. Hernandez-Purcell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531869\"><a href=\"/opinion/531869/edna-acosta-sepulveda-v-pedro-hernandez-purcell/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1989). We have also held that there need not be a formal hearing at all. <i>Feliciano-Angulo v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512377\"><a href=\"/opinion/512377/richard-feliciano-angulo-v-hon-hector-rivera-cruz-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir. 1988). But that impartiality is not demanded does not itself determine whether bias can be so severe as to interfere with due process at the hearing itself.</p>\n<p>A key concern in <i>Loudermill</i> was that the employee have an opportunity to present his side of things to correct errors of fact on which the termination decision is based. <i>See </i><i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 545-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></a></span>. In theory at least, a decisionmaker could be so utterly biased as to deprive an employee of even that error-correction ability. But there is no allegation of that in this case, even if we were to infer from Chmielinski's allegations that O'Brien had some bias. Chmielinski's complaint does not allege anywhere that any alleged bias on O'Brien's part deprived him of the opportunity to put his version of the facts before the decisionmaker, or that there was any error of primary facts in the grounds used for termination that could be explained only by bias. Chmielinski may disagree with the exercise of judgment which led to the imposed penalty of termination of his employment, but that does not state a due process concern arising out of the hearing itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Because the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court appropriately granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Unfortunately, the defendants in their motion to dismiss failed to provide copies of the documents referred to in the complaint, which would have provided more context.

The magistrate did find that Eleventh Amendment immunity barred the claims against the Commonwealth agencies.\n</p>\n<p>The magistrate also rejected Sicuso's and O'Brien's contentions that they were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, but nonetheless found that the plaintiff had failed to state a due process claim. The magistrate determined that Chmielinski's allegations fell within the ambit of the <i>Parratt-Hudson</i> doctrine, which provides that when a deprivation of a property interest occurs due to random and unauthorized conduct, a court must examine only the adequacy of the post-deprivation remedies. Here, the magistrate found adequate the appeals process that Chrnielinski received after his termination.</p>\n<p>[4]  The plaintiff's claims against the Commonwealth agencies were dismissed.

Taylor</i> to claims that pretermination decisionmakers were not impartial.\"). Here, those post-termination procedures were obviously adequate. Plaintiff could and did complain about O'Brien's supposed bias in his administrative appeal. He makes no claim that his post-termination decisionmakers were biased. For these reasons as well as the reasons in the text, Chmielinski's claim fails in any event.</p>\n\n</div>",
