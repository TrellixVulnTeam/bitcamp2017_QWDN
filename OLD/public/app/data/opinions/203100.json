Mukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzáles as the respondent herein.\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.       The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed, per curiam, an Immigration Judge's (IJ's)\n\ndenial of Ghosn Saliba's claims for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Saliba,\n\na native and citizen of Lebanon, now petitions this court for a\n\nreview of the BIA's denial of his claims.    Because this court lacks\n\njurisdiction over the asylum claim, and because a reasonable fact-\n\nfinder would not be compelled to conclude that Saliba has met his\n\nburden of proof for the additional relief he seeks, we deny\n\nSaliba's petition for review.\n\n                          I.    BACKGROUND\n\n          The IJ found Saliba credible.      Therefore, we relate the\n\nfacts of the case as he testified to them.\n\n          Before leaving Lebanon in May 1993, Saliba, a Greek\n\nOrthodox Christian, worked as a commercial fisherman.     During this\n\ntime, Lebanon was partially occupied by the Syrian army.       Saliba\n\npreferred to sell his fish in the Christian section of the city of\n\nAnfeh, as the mixed-religion area in which he lived was too poor to\n\nprovide a good market.   When Saliba attempted to haul his catch to\n\nthe Christian section, Syrian officials at the pier would demand\n\none or two kilograms of his fish before letting him pass.1     Saliba\n\n\n     1\n      It is unclear precisely how many times Saliba encountered\nsuch difficulties.   Some of his testimony, set out more fully\nbelow, indicates that he was detained on four specific occasions.\nOther portions of his testimony suggest, however, that he was\n\n                                 -2-\n\ftestified that he assumed that the guards took a portion of his\n\ncatch because he was Christian, based on the fact that the Syrians\n\n\"used to kill people\" and \"do abnormal things to people\" and also\n\nbecause they confiscated the fish when he wished to cross over to\n\nthe Christian section of the city.\n\n          Between 1991 and 1993, Saliba was detained by members of\n\nthe Syrian army on several occasions when he attempted to travel to\n\nthe Christian section of Anfeh to sell his fish.    Each detention\n\noccurred after the officers reviewed Saliba's identification card,\n\nwhich revealed his last name \"Saliba,\" which he claims means\n\n\"cross\" in Arabic.     The Syrian officers would then proceed to\n\ndetain him in a \"very dark room\" for \"two [or] three hours\" before\n\nreleasing him.   He testified that, at times, the conditions were\n\nvery uncomfortable.    He claimed that, during these episodes, the\n\nguards would slap his face and say \"very bad words\" to him, some of\n\nwhich related to his Christian faith.   Although Saliba's relatives\n\nreported the incidents, he was unable to obtain any assistance to\n\nstop the harassment.\n\n          Saliba arrived in the United States on May 15, 1993, on\n\na nonimmigrant visa for pleasure travel, with authorization to\n\nremain for a period not to exceed sixty days.   Saliba neglected to\n\nleave and failed to file for asylum within the one-year time limit.\n\n\n\nharassed less severely on a more frequent basis. The IJ's findings\ndo not explicate the matter.\n\n                                -3-\n\fOn January 9, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\ncharged Saliba with remaining in the United States longer than\n\npermitted and informed him that he was subject to removal.                In\n\nresponse, Saliba admitted the allegations and conceded removability\n\nas charged but sought relief in the form of asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           At    the   merits    hearing   before   the   IJ,   Saliba   also\n\ntestified that, based on his previous experiences, he is afraid to\n\nreturn to Lebanon, for fear that the Syrian military will hurt or\n\narrest him.      In order to rebut the grounds for Saliba's claimed\n\napprehension, the government introduced evidence indicating that\n\nthe   Syrian    military   has   withdrawn   from   the   country.   Saliba\n\nmaintains that, despite such reports, the Syrian military remains\n\npresent in Lebanon to some degree, intelligence which he apparently\n\nacquired from watching television.         Additionally, some documentary\n\nevidence in the record supports this position.              During Saliba's\n\npresence in the United States, his wife and four children have\n\nremained in Lebanon, and he admitted to the IJ that they have not\n\nbeen subjected to any problems.\n\n           The IJ denied Saliba's asylum application and other\n\nattendant claims, finding that, while credible, Saliba failed to\n\napply for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States,\n\nfailed to present a sufficient basis to substantiate a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution, and had not shown he would be tortured\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fif returned to Lebanon.           Saliba now seeks review of the BIA's\n\ndecision adopting the IJ's findings.\n\n                                II.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Asylum\n\n            We review the BIA's denial of asylum for substantial\n\nevidence    and   accept   the    BIA's     findings    of   fact   if   they   are\n\nsupported by \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"             Njenga v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d\n\n335, 338 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                      We will\n\nreverse factual determinations contained in the decision below only\n\nif \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to\n\nthe contrary.\"       8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).         Where, as here, \"the BIA\n\nadopts an IJ's decision, we review the relevant portion of the IJ's\n\nopinion as though it were the decision of the BIA.\"                 Guillaume v.\n\nGonzáles, 504 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            An application for asylum must be filed within one year\n\nof   the   alien's    arrival    in   the   United     States,   absent   changed\n\ncircumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary\n\ncircumstances relating to the delay in filing.                      See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(2)(B).         In this case, it is undisputed that Saliba\n\nresided in the United States for more than nine years before he\n\nfiled for asylum. The IJ rejected Saliba's contention that changed\n\nor extraordinary circumstances exist warranting wavier of this time\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\flimit.2     We lack jurisdiction to review this determination.                 See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); Sharari v. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (explaining that we lack jurisdiction to review the\n\nBIA's findings regarding compliance with the one-year time limit as\n\nwell as whether there are extraordinary or changed circumstances\n\nsufficient to merit an exception).\n\n             Saliba concedes, as he must, that \"the judicial review\n\nbar of § 1158(a)(3) does not represent a due process violation.\"\n\nHana v. Gonzáles, 503 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 2007).                     Simply put,\n\n\"[d]ue process rights do not accrue to discretionary forms of\n\nrelief, and asylum is a discretionary form of relief.\"                   Id. at 43\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Ticoalu v. Gonzáles, 472 F.3d 8,\n\n11   (1st     Cir.     2006))     (internal    quotation       marks     omitted).\n\nNevertheless,        he    maintains    that    the     application       of    the\n\njurisdictional bar to review, in the instant case, violates his\n\nprocedural due process rights under the United States Constitution.\n\nThe vast majority of Saliba's briefing on this subject, however,\n\nfocuses on general, prudential concerns related to the wisdom of\n\nvesting     review    of    decisions   rendered       under    §   1158(a)(2)(B)\n\nexclusively     with       the   executive    branch    of     government,     thus\n\ninsulating it from external review of its own decisions.                  Whatever\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Saliba argued that conditions in Lebanon grew worse during\nhis time in the United States and that he belatedly discovered the\navailability of the asylum process.\n\n                                        -6-\n\ftheir merits, these arguments are more properly addressed to\n\nCongress.\n\n            Saliba's attempt to circumvent the jurisdictional bar is\n\nlikewise    unavailing.      He     argues   that,   notwithstanding     the\n\nconstitutionality of § 1158(a)(3), \"the failure of the IJ to make\n\nan individualized analysis [of the relevant issues] was a violation\n\nof due process . . . .\"        He maintains that the IJ should have\n\n\"explore[d] the reasons for [Saliba's] late filing,\" but that\n\n\"there is no evidence that the IJ outside of his oral decision or\n\nthe BIA ever undertook such an exploration.\"         Thus, Saliba reasons\n\nthat the IJ and the BIA violated his right to a fair and efficient\n\nprocedure to evaluate his asylum claim.\n\n            It is true that we retain jurisdiction to consider\n\n\"constitutional claims or questions of law raised [in compliance\n\nwith the statute].\"    8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).       Nevertheless, \"[a]\n\npetitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to\n\nremove simply by cloaking an . . . argument in constitutional\n\ngarb.\"     Mehilli v. Gonzáles, 433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246\n\nF.3d   1267,   1271   (9th   Cir.   2001))   (internal   quotation     marks\n\nomitted).   \"[T]o invoke our jurisdiction, a petitioner must allege\n\nat least a colorable constitutional violation.\" Id. (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Torres-Aguilar, 246 F.3d at 1271) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).         Thus, \"the putative constitutional or\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\flegal challenge must be more than a disguised challenge to factual\n\nfindings.\"    Pan v. Gonzáles, 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007); see\n\nalso Mehilli, 433 F.3d at 94 (holding that arguments relating to\n\nwhether an IJ properly weighs or even considers a petitioner's\n\nevidence fail to raise constitutional concerns).\n\n            Here, Saliba's contention fails for two reasons.        First,\n\nthe essence of the argument is simply that the IJ did not consider\n\nthe evidence of changed or extraordinary circumstances to the\n\nextent deemed appropriate by Saliba.       Even if true, such an error\n\nrelates to the IJ's discretion in formulating his findings and,\n\nthus, is unreviewable by this court because it does not implicate\n\nthe Constitution.       See Hana, 503 F.3d at 43-44; De Araujo v.\n\nGonzáles, 457 F.3d 146, 153-55 (1st Cir. 2006); Mehilli, 433 F.3d\n\nat 93-94.\n\n            Second, Saliba's premise is factually incorrect.        In his\n\noral opinion, the IJ specifically examined the issue of whether any\n\nchanged or extraordinary circumstances warranted application of an\n\nexception    to   the   one-year   time   limit   (as   Saliba   seems   to\n\nacknowledge in his appellate brief).       A petitioner is not entitled\n\nto have every contour and minor detail of his nonmeritorious\n\nargument painstakingly explored to his own satisfaction. See Karim\n\nv. Gonzáles, 424 F.3d 109, 111 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"The obligation to\n\nexplain and articulate depends importantly on the strength of the\n\nposition being urged.     Where no plausible reason is offered for a\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\frequest, the word 'no' is plainly sufficient.\").     Moreover, at the\n\nmerits hearing, the IJ actually importuned counsel for Saliba to\n\naddress his client's purported entitlement to an exception from the\n\none-year requirement more thoroughly due to his obvious recognition\n\nthat the issue was potentially dispositive.        Thus, the IJ paid\n\nample regard to any constitutional rights to which Saliba might\n\nconceivably be entitled.    Accordingly, Saliba's claim for asylum\n\nwas properly denied.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal and Protection Under the CAT\n\n           Alternatively, Saliba argues that he is entitled to\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT.      To qualify\n\nfor withholding of removal, Saliba must establish that his \"life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened in [Lebanon] because of [his] race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\n\npolitical opinion.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).   A petitioner \"has\n\nthe burden of proving that it is more likely than not that his life\n\nor freedom will be threatened on account of one of [these] five\n\nprotected grounds were he to be repatriated.\"      Segran v. Mukasey,\n\n___ F.3d ___, ___, 2007 WL 4171217, at *5 (1st Cir. Nov. 27, 2007)\n\n(citing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)).       \"This 'more likely than not'\n\nstandard is harder for an alien to satisfy than the 'reasonable\n\npossibility' standard for showing a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution in asylum cases.\"    Pan, 489 F.3d at 86.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f             As with asylum, however, \"[a]n applicant for withholding\n\nmay . . . create a rebuttable presumption that his life or liberty\n\nwould be threatened upon return to his home country by proving that\n\nhe suffered past persecution there.\"          Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50,\n\n54 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)).               Moreover,\n\n\"[a]n alien's credible testimony, standing alone, may sustain his\n\nburden of proving eligibility for withholding of removal.\"               Pan,\n\n489 F.3d at 86.\n\n             The IJ found that Saliba was likely targeted for abuse\n\nfor financial reasons rather than his religion and that, even were\n\nthis not the case, Saliba did not show that he would be persecuted\n\nupon returning to Lebanon because the Syrian army, the source of\n\nthe alleged persecution, had withdrawn from the country.             Both of\n\nthese findings are supported by substantial evidence.              Based on\n\nSaliba's testimony, it was permissible for the IJ to infer that the\n\nSyrian officers who demanded part of Saliba's catch were motivated\n\nby   greed   rather   than    anti-Christian     sentiment.      See,   e.g.,\n\nFerdinandus v. Gonzáles, 504 F.3d 61, 63 (1st Cir. 2007) (affirming\n\ndecision denying withholding of removal where it was ambiguous\n\nwhether   the   rioters      who   robbed   petitioner   were   animated   by\n\nreligious or pecuniary motives).            Thus, Saliba cannot show past\n\npersecution on one of the five enumerated grounds and is not\n\nentitled to a presumption of future persecution.              See Guillaume,\n\n504 F.3d at 72-73.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            Similarly, while the parties adduced conflicting evidence\n\nconcerning whether the Syrian army had completely withdrawn from\n\nLebanon, the IJ was not compelled to find that the Syrian army\n\npresented a continuing or future threat to Christians in Lebanon\n\nsuch as Saliba.    See Chahid Hayek v. Gonzáles, 445 F.3d 501, 508-09\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (holding that current State Department reports did\n\nnot support the notion of widespread persecution and torture of\n\nMaronite Christians in Indonesia). The IJ's determination that the\n\nSyrian military has withdrawn from Lebanon is plausible in light of\n\nthe available documents, including the 2004 Country Report on\n\nLebanon and an International Religious Freedom Report issued by the\n\nUnited    States   Department   of   State,   news   articles,   and   other\n\nanalyses of the region. Our deferential standard of review forbids\n\nfurther inquiry.     See Pan, 489 F.3d at 87 n.6 (explaining that \"the\n\nfactfinder's choice among plausible but conflicting inferences\n\ncannot be clearly erroneous\") (paraphrasing United States v. Ruiz,\n\n905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990)).           Additionally, we note that\n\nSaliba's wife and children continue to reside safely in Lebanon,\n\nseverely undercutting his claim that he will suffer persecution if\n\nrepatriated to his country of origin. Ferdinandus, 504 F.3d at 63.\n\n            Finally, we turn to Saliba's claim for relief under the\n\nCAT.     \"An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the\n\nburden of establishing that 'it is more likely than not that he or\n\nshe would be tortured if removed to the proposed country.'\"            Hana,\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f503 F.3d at 44 (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2)).        The IJ's\n\npermissible finding that the Syrian military no longer maintains a\n\npresence in Lebanon precludes relief on this ground, as Saliba\n\npresented no evidence of any other likely persecutor.   Nor did he\n\npresent any evidence of the likelihood of torture if he returned.\n\nThus, Saliba has not demonstrated that he is entitled to protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny Saliba's petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

Because this court lacks\n\njurisdiction over the asylum claim, and because a reasonable fact-\n\nfinder would not be compelled to conclude that Saliba has met his\n\nburden of proof for the additional relief he seeks, we deny\n\nSaliba's petition for review.\n\n                          I.    BACKGROUND\n\n          The IJ found Saliba credible.      Therefore, we relate the\n\nfacts of the case as he testified to them.\n\n          Before leaving Lebanon in May 1993, Saliba, a Greek\n\nOrthodox Christian, worked as a commercial fisherman.     During this\n\ntime, Lebanon was partially occupied by the Syrian army.       Saliba\n\npreferred to sell his fish in the Christian section of the city of\n\nAnfeh, as the mixed-religion area in which he lived was too poor to\n\nprovide a good market.   When Saliba attempted to haul his catch to\n\nthe Christian section, Syrian officials at the pier would demand\n\none or two kilograms of his fish before letting him pass.1     Saliba\n\n\n     1\n      It is unclear precisely how many times Saliba encountered\nsuch difficulties.   Some of his testimony, set out more fully\nbelow, indicates that he was detained on four specific occasions.\nOther portions of his testimony suggest, however, that he was\n\n                                 -2-\n\ftestified that he assumed that the guards took a portion of his\n\ncatch because he was Christian, based on the fact that the Syrians\n\n\"used to kill people\" and \"do abnormal things to people\" and also\n\nbecause they confiscated the fish when he wished to cross over to\n\nthe Christian section of the city.\n\n          Between 1991 and 1993, Saliba was detained by members of\n\nthe Syrian army on several occasions when he attempted to travel to\n\nthe Christian section of Anfeh to sell his fish.    Each detention\n\noccurred after the officers reviewed Saliba's identification card,\n\nwhich revealed his last name \"Saliba,\" which he claims means\n\n\"cross\" in Arabic.     The Syrian officers would then proceed to\n\ndetain him in a \"very dark room\" for \"two [or] three hours\" before\n\nreleasing him.   He testified that, at times, the conditions were\n\nvery uncomfortable.    He claimed that, during these episodes, the\n\nguards would slap his face and say \"very bad words\" to him, some of\n\nwhich related to his Christian faith.   Although Saliba's relatives\n\nreported the incidents, he was unable to obtain any assistance to\n\nstop the harassment.\n\n          Saliba arrived in the United States on May 15, 1993, on\n\na nonimmigrant visa for pleasure travel, with authorization to\n\nremain for a period not to exceed sixty days.   Saliba neglected to\n\nleave and failed to file for asylum within the one-year time limit.\n\n\n\nharassed less severely on a more frequent basis. The IJ's findings\ndo not explicate the matter.\n\n                                -3-\n\fOn January 9, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\ncharged Saliba with remaining in the United States longer than\n\npermitted and informed him that he was subject to removal.                In\n\nresponse, Saliba admitted the allegations and conceded removability\n\nas charged but sought relief in the form of asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the CAT.\n\n           At    the   merits    hearing   before   the   IJ,   Saliba   also\n\ntestified that, based on his previous experiences, he is afraid to\n\nreturn to Lebanon, for fear that the Syrian military will hurt or\n\narrest him.      In order to rebut the grounds for Saliba's claimed\n\napprehension, the government introduced evidence indicating that\n\nthe   Syrian    military   has   withdrawn   from   the   country.   Saliba\n\nmaintains that, despite such reports, the Syrian military remains\n\npresent in Lebanon to some degree, intelligence which he apparently\n\nacquired from watching television.         Additionally, some documentary\n\nevidence in the record supports this position.              During Saliba's\n\npresence in the United States, his wife and four children have\n\nremained in Lebanon, and he admitted to the IJ that they have not\n\nbeen subjected to any problems.\n\n           The IJ denied Saliba's asylum application and other\n\nattendant claims, finding that, while credible, Saliba failed to\n\napply for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States,\n\nfailed to present a sufficient basis to substantiate a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution, and had not shown he would be tortured\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fif returned to Lebanon.           Saliba now seeks review of the BIA's\n\ndecision adopting the IJ's findings.\n\n                                II.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.

He     argues   that,   notwithstanding     the\n\nconstitutionality of § 1158(a)(3), \"the failure of the IJ to make\n\nan individualized analysis [of the relevant issues] was a violation\n\nof due process . . . .\"        He maintains that the IJ should have\n\n\"explore[d] the reasons for [Saliba's] late filing,\" but that\n\n\"there is no evidence that the IJ outside of his oral decision or\n\nthe BIA ever undertook such an exploration.\"         Thus, Saliba reasons\n\nthat the IJ and the BIA violated his right to a fair and efficient\n\nprocedure to evaluate his asylum claim.\n\n            It is true that we retain jurisdiction to consider\n\n\"constitutional claims or questions of law raised [in compliance\n\nwith the statute].\"    8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).

First,\n\nthe essence of the argument is simply that the IJ did not consider\n\nthe evidence of changed or extraordinary circumstances to the\n\nextent deemed appropriate by Saliba.       Even if true, such an error\n\nrelates to the IJ's discretion in formulating his findings and,\n\nthus, is unreviewable by this court because it does not implicate\n\nthe Constitution.

In his\n\noral opinion, the IJ specifically examined the issue of whether any\n\nchanged or extraordinary circumstances warranted application of an\n\nexception    to   the   one-year   time   limit   (as   Saliba   seems   to\n\nacknowledge in his appellate brief).       A petitioner is not entitled\n\nto have every contour and minor detail of his nonmeritorious\n\nargument painstakingly explored to his own satisfaction. See Karim\n\nv.

Moreover, at the\n\nmerits hearing, the IJ actually importuned counsel for Saliba to\n\naddress his client's purported entitlement to an exception from the\n\none-year requirement more thoroughly due to his obvious recognition\n\nthat the issue was potentially dispositive.        Thus, the IJ paid\n\nample regard to any constitutional rights to which Saliba might\n\nconceivably be entitled.    Accordingly, Saliba's claim for asylum\n\nwas properly denied.\n\nB.

To qualify\n\nfor withholding of removal, Saliba must establish that his \"life or\n\nfreedom would be threatened in [Lebanon] because of [his] race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\n\npolitical opinion.\"    8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).

Moreover,\n\n\"[a]n alien's credible testimony, standing alone, may sustain his\n\nburden of proving eligibility for withholding of removal.\"               Pan,\n\n489 F.3d at 86.\n\n             The IJ found that Saliba was likely targeted for abuse\n\nfor financial reasons rather than his religion and that, even were\n\nthis not the case, Saliba did not show that he would be persecuted\n\nupon returning to Lebanon because the Syrian army, the source of\n\nthe alleged persecution, had withdrawn from the country.             Both of\n\nthese findings are supported by substantial evidence.              Based on\n\nSaliba's testimony, it was permissible for the IJ to infer that the\n\nSyrian officers who demanded part of Saliba's catch were motivated\n\nby   greed   rather   than    anti-Christian     sentiment.      See,   e.g.,\n\nFerdinandus v.

See Chahid Hayek v.

Ferdinandus, 504 F.3d at 63.\n\n            Finally, we turn to Saliba's claim for relief under the\n\nCAT.     \"An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the\n\nburden of establishing that 'it is more likely than not that he or\n\nshe would be tortured if removed to the proposed country.'\"            Hana,\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f503 F.3d at 44 (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2)).        The IJ's\n\npermissible finding that the Syrian military no longer maintains a\n\npresence in Lebanon precludes relief on this ground, as Saliba\n\npresented no evidence of any other likely persecutor.   Nor did he\n\npresent any evidence of the likelihood of torture if he returned.\n\nThus, Saliba has not demonstrated that he is entitled to protection\n\nunder the CAT.\n\n                         III.
