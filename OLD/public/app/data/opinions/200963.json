Before    us     are   a   pair   of\n\ninterlocutory appeals in a criminal case.                Both grow out of a 23-\n\ncount federal indictment filed on October 17, 2001, charging Paul\n\nA. DeCologero and six associates with criminal racketeering in\n\nviolation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act\n\n(\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2000),1 conspiracy to violate RICO,\n\nid. § 1962(d) and an array of related crimes.               We refer to Paul A.\n\nDeCologero as \"DeCologero\" even though several co-defendants have\n\nthe same last name.\n\n             The government alleged that DeCologero headed a criminal\n\nenterprise (\"the DeCologero crew\") that used brutal tactics to gain\n\ncontrol     of   a   portion   of    Boston's   drug     trade   and   murdered    a\n\nnineteen-year-old woman (Aislin Silva) when the members thought she\n\nmight betray them.       In addition to the RICO counts, the indictment\n\nspecified a number of federal crimes charged in separate counts\n\ninvolving drugs, guns, robberies, and--in the case of the slain\n\nwoman--murder for the purpose of witness tampering.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides:\n\n              It shall be unlawful for any person employed\n              by or associated with any enterprise engaged\n              in, or the activities of which affect,\n              interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\n              participate, directly or indirectly, in the\n              conduct of such enterprise's affairs through\n              a pattern of racketeering activity or\n              collection of unlawful debt.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            RICO violations require not only participation in a\n\ncriminal   enterprise   but   also   participation   in   a   \"pattern    of\n\nracketeering activity,\" which in turn requires proof of at least\n\ntwo of a list of specified federal or state crimes (e.g., murder,\n\nextortion, robbery, drug trafficking).      18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), (5)\n\n(2000).    In jargon, such acts are called \"predicate acts\" or\n\n\"racketeering acts\" (\"RAs\"), and, in this indictment, a number of\n\nthe acts charged as federal crimes in separate counts of the\n\nindictment were restated as RAs in support of the RICO counts.             A\n\ntable listing the RAs is attached to this decision.\n\n           Nominally the indictment identified fourteen separate\n\nRAs, but several had subparts, each constituting a sufficient\n\npredicate act under RICO; for example, the attempted and ultimately\n\nsuccessful murder of the woman was expressed in RA 1 as five\n\nseparate crimes (e.g., subpart 1 was conspiracy to murder under\n\nstate law, subpart 2 was attempt to murder under state law).             The\n\nindictment thus effectively contained thirty-eight predicate acts\n\nonly partly overlapping with the substantive counts because some\n\ncounts were not RAs and some RAs (e.g., state crimes) were not\n\ncounts.    Different defendants were implicated in different RAs;\n\nonly Paul A. DeCologero was implicated in all.\n\n           Four years before the present indictment was filed,\n\nDeCologero had been acquitted of RICO violations in United States\n\nv. Carrozza, Crim. No. 97-40009-NMG (D. Mass. 1999). Following the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fpresent indictment, DeCologero moved to dismiss the new RICO\n\ncharges against him (and one drug conspiracy count) on double\n\njeopardy grounds.   The district court rejected this claim, finding\n\nthat the RICO violations alleged in Carrozza were different than\n\nthose charged in the current case.      DeCologero now appeals from\n\nthis ruling under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (2000), the denial of a double\n\njeopardy defense being immediately appealable.        Abney v. United\n\nStates, 431 U.S. 651, 662 (1977).\n\n          At one of the pre-trial hearings, the district court had\n\nexpressed concern that the scope of the case--the number of counts,\n\nRAs and criminal offenses--made \"charging a jury and having them\n\nunderstand virtually impossible.\"      Then, in an oral ruling at a\n\nfurther conference, the district court without further explanation\n\nsua sponte divided the case (as described immediately below) into\n\ntwo   separate   trials.    On   motion    by   the   government   for\n\nreconsideration, the court entered a written order adhering to the\n\nseparation, saying:\n\n          [I]t is necessary to divide this case into\n          separate trials, pursuant to this Court's\n          inherent \"authority and responsibility for\n          managing . . . trials before it so as to\n          protect the interests of the parties and the\n          public in just determination of a criminal\n          proceeding with 'simplicity in procedure,\n          fairness in administration and the elimination\n          of unjustifiable expense and delay.'\" United\n          States v. Shea, 750 F. Supp. 46, 49 (D. Mass.\n          1990) (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 2).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f           The district court's ruling divided the charges in the\n\nindictment     into   two   separate     trials,   ordering   that   three\n\nsubstantive counts involving robberies and unlawful possession of\n\nfirearms be postponed until a second trial at some unspecified\n\ndate.2   Further, the court ordered that four of the fourteen\n\nracketeering acts that the government included as predicate acts\n\nfor the RICO charges be postponed until this second trial.             See\n\nattached chart. This left ten RAs and seventeen substantive counts\n\nfor the first trial (the government had voluntarily dismissed three\n\nfirearms counts).\n\n           The government then filed a cross-appeal from the court's\n\ndecision to postpone four of the RAs until a later trial, arguing\n\nthat this order effectively dismissed and foreclosed the four\n\npostponed RAs since double jeopardy doctrine would prevent the\n\ngovernment from bringing RICO charges based on these RAs in a later\n\ntrial.   Alternatively, the government said that the order exceeded\n\nthe district court's case management authority. The district court\n\nstayed trial pending the resolution of the appeals.\n\n             Before us now are three difficult questions:      the merits\n\nof DeCologero’s double jeopardy claim (which is clearly appealable\n\nnow under Abney, 431 U.S. at 662); whether we have jurisdiction\n\n\n\n     2\n      The court did not invoke Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 and \"sever\" the\ndeferred counts into a separate case with a separate docket number;\ninstead, it merely postponed their trial until a second phase of\nthe same case.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fover the government's cross-appeal contesting the case management\n\norder (the defendants dispute jurisdiction); and, if so, whether\n\nthe district court exceeded its authority in its division of the\n\ncase insofar as it limited the RAs available to the government in\n\nthe first trial.    We address the questions in that order.\n\n            Double Jeopardy.    DeCologero argues that, having been\n\nacquitted of the RICO charges in Carrozza, he is shielded by the\n\nConstitution's prohibition of double jeopardy from the RICO charges\n\n(although not necessarily from the non-RICO counts) in the present\n\ncase.     This is so if, but only if, the RICO charges in the two\n\ncases are \"the same.\"     U.S. Const. amd. V; see, e.g., United States\n\nv. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 39 (1st Cir. 2002).        Based on a comparison\n\nof the two indictments as drafted and the proffer of evidence by\n\nthe government, we conclude that the new RICO charges are not\n\nbarred.\n\n            The Carrozza indictment charged nine defendants with\n\nconducting the affairs of \"the Patriarca Family of La Cosa Nostra\"\n\nthrough a pattern of racketeering. La Cosa Nostra is the notorious\n\ncrime syndicate also known as the mafia.      The \"Patriarca Family,\"\n\na New England branch of this organization, was headed by Raymond J.\n\nPatriarca until 1990, at which point Francis P. Salemme was the\n\nheir-apparent.      The    Carrozza   defendants    were   charged   with\n\nattempting \"to usurp control of the Patriarca Family\" from Salemme\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fafter Patriarca's death.    See Marino, 277 F.3d at 19-21 (detailing\n\nevidence in Carrozza case).\n\n           The Carrozza indictment covered the period from 1989 to\n\n1994, although evidence of events occurring through 1998 was\n\npresented at trial.     DeCologero was charged in eight substantive\n\ncounts, including RICO and RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit\n\nmurder and attempted murder, various firearms charges, and a\n\ncocaine distribution conspiracy.          The RICO counts listed him as a\n\nparticipant in only three of the fourteen RAs: conspiracy to murder\n\nfourteen individuals, attempted murder, and conspiracy to possess\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute. He was acquitted of all charges\n\nin 1999.\n\n           The   present   indictment      charges     the   defendants   with\n\nparticipating in a nominally different enterprise--the \"DeCologero\n\nCrew\"--said by the government to be \"a separate entity from the\n\nPatriarca La Cosa Nostra ('LCN') Family, yet . . . structured in a\n\nsimilar manner to a crew or regime of La Cosa Nostra\" and \"aligned\n\nwith\" the Carrozza faction of the Patriarca Family.             According to\n\nthe   charge,    the   DeCologero    Crew's      aim     was   \"controlling,\n\nsupervising,     and   financing    illegal      activities,\"      including\n\ngenerating money through robbery and drug sales \"for the personal\n\nuse of members . . . and to build up a war chest of firearms,\n\nweapons, and ammunition which was to be used, in part, to support\n\nthe\" Carrozza faction.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f             If the double jeopardy problem turned solely on whether\n\nthe two cases involved the same enterprise, we would be faced with\n\na hard question.    The RICO statute loosely defines an \"enterprise\"\n\nto include not only any legal entity (e.g., a corporation) but also\n\n\"any union or group of individuals associated in fact.\"    18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1961(4).     Although the DeCologero indictment alleges that the\n\nCarrozza faction and DeCologero crew were separate enterprises, the\n\nproffered evidence could support the view that both were part of a\n\nvertically organized endeavor, with DeCologero somewhere in the\n\nmiddle of the organizational pyramid.\n\n             Past cases have stressed that conspiracies cannot be\n\nartificially broken up for the purpose of bringing separate cases,\n\nsee Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 53 (1942), and there\n\nis no reason why the rule should be any different for RICO\n\nenterprises.    But whether there was one enterprise or two need not\n\nbe resolved.     Every circuit to have examined the issue has agreed\n\nthat double jeopardy only bars successive RICO charges involving\n\nboth the same enterprise and the same pattern of racketeering\n\nactivity.3     In our view the current RICO charges do involve a\n\ndifferent pattern than the old.\n\n\n     3\n      See United States v. Ciancaglini, 858 F.2d 923, 928-29 (3d\nCir. 1988); United States v. Langella, 804 F.2d 185, 188-89 (2d\nCir. 1986); United States v. Ruggiero, 754 F.2d 927, 931 (11th\nCir.), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1127 (1985); United States v.\nRussotti, 717 F.2d 27, 33 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S.\n1022 (1984); United States v. Dean, 647 F.2d 779, 787-88 (8th Cir.\n1981).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          In deciding whether two patterns are \"the same\" for\n\ndouble jeopardy purposes, other circuits all employ some variation\n\nof a \"totality of the circumstances\" analysis, using factors akin--\n\nalthough not necessarily identical--to those used in evaluating the\n\nidentity of conspiracies.      See United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911\n\nF.2d 847, 860 (1st Cir. 1990) (conspiracy), cert. denied, 498 U.S.\n\n1074 (1991); United States v. Dean, 647 F.2d 779, 788 (8th Cir.\n\n1981) (RICO).     These factors include the time, the place, the\n\npeople, and the nature and scope of the activities involved in each\n\nindictment.\n\n          Here,     little   overlap   exists   in   the   type   of   crimes\n\ncentrally charged as racketeering acts in the two cases.                 The\n\nCarrozza indictment RAs focused on the systematic murder of rival\n\nmafia members--a pattern of murders and attempted murders of\n\nmembers of the Salemme faction (including attempted murder of\n\nFrancis Salemme) to seize control of the Patriarca crime family.\n\nThe specific RAs alleged include conspiracy to murder fourteen\n\npeople, attempted murder of six, and successful murder of two, as\n\nwell as a cocaine conspiracy and several gambling-related charges.\n\nIn the present indictment, the only murder alleged was committed\n\nsimply as part of a failed cover-up attempt incident to the crew’s\n\nmain activities.4\n\n\n     4\n      According to the indictment and the government's summary of\nevidence, Silva permitted crew members to store weapons at her\napartment; the police raided the apartment on a tip; and, afraid\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           The murder aside, the RAs alleged in the current case\n\ncentered on robbery and drug trafficking, primarily the former. By\n\ncontrast, not a single Carrozza RA involved robbery.              Thus, while\n\nthe pattern in Carrozza could be viewed primarily as murders\n\nconnected by an aim to secure power, the pattern in the present\n\ncase appears to be a more conventional collection of robberies and\n\ndrug trafficking offenses, the single murder being merely a means\n\nof protecting the conspiracy from the police.\n\n           The   other   factors--similarity       of   persons,       time, and\n\nplace--are less clear-cut but do not preclude the conclusion that\n\nthe two patterns are different. The Carrozza indictment identified\n\neight defendants; Paul is the only member of the DeCologero crew\n\nwho was charged in Carrozza, there as a subordinate member of the\n\nCarrozza faction rather than as a leader of his own crew.                 Still,\n\nthe   Carrozza   indictment   named   one   \"FNU    [first      name    unknown]\n\nDeCologero\" among the thirty unindicted co-conspirators, so at\n\nleast one (and perhaps more) of the other defendants in the current\n\ncase may have been involved.\n\n           As for time and place, the locations involved in the two\n\nindictments are basically the same--the greater Boston area--but\n\nthe time periods overlap only slightly.        The Carrozza indictment\n\nalleged RICO violations that ran from 1989 though 1994, although at\n\n\n\nSilva might testify, crew        members    acting      under    orders     from\nDeCologero killed Silva.\n\n                                  -11-\n\ftrial the government offered proof that the conspiracy to obtain\n\npower continued through January 1998.        The present indictment\n\nalleges that the DeCologero crew operated from 1995 through the\n\nbeginning of 1997.    Again, this is consistent with the view that\n\nthere may have been one enterprise but does not disturb the\n\nconclusion that there were two patterns.\n\n          In summary, all of the incidents constituting substantive\n\nnon-RICO crimes and all of the RAs in the present indictment are\n\ndifferent from those charged in the Carrozza case.       Whether the\n\nenterprise in the two cases is \"the same\" may be open to debate,\n\nbut \"the pattern\" is different, which defeats the double jeopardy\n\nclaim. Whether any of the background evidence offered in the first\n\ntrial is relevant and admissible in the second is a matter for the\n\ndistrict judge.\n\n          DeCologero argues alternatively that collateral estoppel\n\nprohibits the present RICO charges against him or at the very least\n\nprecludes the government from making any reference to the \"war\" for\n\ncontrol of the Patriarca family.       See Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S.\n\n436, 443-44 (1970).   Our authority on DeCologero’s appeal is based\n\non his double jeopardy claim and we decline to consider other\n\nissues even if we could.   See Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514\n\nU.S. 35, 50-51 (1995).     The district court can consider in due\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fcourse what effect, if any, collateral estoppel doctrine may have.5\n\n              Appeal of the scheduling order.        The government's cross-\n\nappeal is directed to the scheduling order issued sua sponte by the\n\ntrial    court,    citing    the     court's      \"inherent    authority      and\n\nresponsibility for managing trials.\"           The court ordered that three\n\nsubstantive counts and four racketeering acts be postponed until a\n\nsecond trial at some unspecified later date; the rest of the case\n\nwould be tried at the first trial.             The government’s motion for\n\nreconsideration was denied.\n\n              On its interlocutory appeal, the government does not\n\nformally contest the postponement of substantive counts to a second\n\ntrial, but only the exclusion of four RAs.                The government says\n\nthat if this court orders the four RAs to be reinstated for the\n\nfirst trial, the district court may well decide to reinstate the\n\npostponed counts directed to the same acts; obviously, it would do\n\nlittle   to    reduce   complexity    at    the   trial   if   the   counts   are\n\npostponed but the RAs remain to be proven by the same evidence.\n\n              An order severing or deferring counts is generally not\n\nimmediately appealable.      See United States v. Bloom, 149 F.3d 649,\n\n657 (7th Cir. 1998).      By contrast, the court’s treatment of the RAs\n\npresents a puzzle on both scores--appealability and the merits--and\n\n\n     5\n      If the Carrozza verdict was a general one, DeCologero may\nwell have considerable difficulty showing what factual findings\nunderlay his earlier acquittal. United States v. Morris, 99 F.3d\n476, 481 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957\nF.2d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 1992); Russotti, 717 F.2d at 35.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fwe start naturally with the former.              To understand just what the\n\ndistrict   court   did   and       how    it    matters    requires     additional\n\nbackground--pertinent both to the jurisdictional question and to\n\nthe merits.\n\n           As explained earlier, the original indictment listed\n\nfourteen RAs but, with subparts, amounted effectively to thirty-\n\neight different acts.6       DeCologero was charged in all fourteen of\n\nthe RAs; of the other defendants, one was named in nine, one in\n\nseven, and the remaining two defendants were named in four each.\n\nSee attached    chart.       The    RAs    not   only     involved    thirty-eight\n\nseparate   criminal   acts     but       were   violations    of     over   a   dozen\n\ndifferent federal and state statutes (e.g., murder, robbery) each\n\nof which would require instructions to the jury as to the elements\n\nof the crime.\n\n           Before making her sua sponte ruling, the district judge\n\nexpressed fear that the level of complexity of the case \"makes\n\ncharging a jury and having them understand virtually impossible,\"\n\nand noted that she had a \"fervent desire to try a piece of the case\n\nfirst.\"    In her later ruling, she selected two specific RAs--\n\nnumbers 6 and 8 on the attached chart--to be \"postponed\" until some\n\nunspecified later date (presumably the same time as the trial of\n\n\n     6\n      The district court stressed that there were thirty-eight, but\ngovernment's grouping of the predicate acts into fourteen sets may\nmore accurately reflect the level of factual complexity because the\nRAs in each group all relate to the same criminal episode (e.g., a\nparticular robbery), albeit fragmented into different crimes.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthe severed substantive counts).       Both excluded RAs involved\n\nrobberies in violation of the same state and federal statutes as\n\nthe robberies charged in RAs 4 and 5, which were not postponed.\n\n            The court also ordered the government to select two more\n\nRAs to be postponed, listing four from which to choose--three of\n\nthese RAs involved robberies and one involved conspiracy to collect\n\ncredit by extortionate means.   The criterion for exclusion of both\n\ncounts and RAs appeared to be how closely related they were to the\n\nmurder of Ms. Silva; the district judge repeatedly asked the\n\ngovernment to explain how the counts and RAs related to Silva, and\n\n(for instance) stated that two specific counts would be included in\n\nthe first trial \"on the representation that those are guns in\n\nSilva's apartment.    If they are not, then those counts do not go\n\nforward.\"\n\n            The statute governing appeals by the United States in\n\ncriminal cases, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3731 (2003), allows interlocutory\n\nappeals in specified situations, two of which are invoked by the\n\ngovernment in this case. The first paragraph of the statute allows\n\n(in pertinent part) an appeal from a district court’s dismissal of\n\nan indictment \"as to any one or more counts, or any part thereof\"--\n\nthe \"any part\" language having been added in 2002 in part to\n\nresolve a circuit split about the appealability of dismissed RAs.\n\nSee Pub. L. No. 107-273, div. B, tit. III, § 3004, 116 Stat. 1758\n\n(2002); H.R. Rep. No. 107-685, § 3004 (2002).\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f          The second paragraph of the statute permits inter alia an\n\nappeal from a district court order \"suppressing or excluding\n\nevidence,\" if made before trial (specifically, \"not after the\n\ndefendant has been put in jeopardy\").         18 U.S.C. § 3731.     The most\n\nfamiliar target of such appeals are pre-trial orders suppressing\n\nevidence as unlawfully seized; but the provision equally allows\n\nappeal from in limine orders excluding evidence on any ground\n\n(e.g., because prejudice outweighs probative value under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403).    United States v. King, 827 F.2d 864, 866-67 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n          At first blush, the statute's first paragraph appears to\n\ncover the district court's order excluding RAs as dismissal of\n\n\"part\" of a count.     Of course, the district court here did not\n\npurport to \"dismiss\" the RAs but--as with the three substantive\n\ncounts--only   to   \"postpone\"   them    to   a   second   trial.    On   the\n\nprinciple that substance rather than form should prevail, this\n\nlabeling would not bar appeal under the first paragraph if the\n\npostponement were effectively a dismissal.           See United States v.\n\nZabawa, 39 F.3d 279, 283 (10th Cir. 1994); United States v.\n\nNakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 550 (2d Cir. 1987).\n\n          In our own case, the deferred substantive counts were not\n\nformally dismissed but explicitly reserved for a second trial, and\n\ncould in fact be tried later.           The opportunity to employ the\n\ncounterpart acts as RAs in a second RICO prosecution is more\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fdoubtful.      Under the RICO statute, predicate acts are offered to\n\nsatisfy the \"pattern of racketeering\" element of the crime. On the\n\ngovernment’s     premise     that   all   of    the   predicate   acts   charged\n\ncomprised the same pattern, a second RICO prosecution based on the\n\npostponed acts would arguably itself be barred by double jeopardy\n\nprinciples, the \"acts\" being different but the \"pattern\" being the\n\nsame.      If so, deferral was effectively dismissal.\n\n              The defendants have sought to defeat this basis for\n\nappeal by agreeing in writing, shortly before oral argument in this\n\ncourt, to waive double jeopardy protection as to the severed RAs so\n\nfar   as    necessary   to   negate   the      government's   double     jeopardy\n\nargument. Whether this (post-appeal) waiver should be accepted and\n\nwhether if accepted it fully answers the government’s claim that\n\nthe postponed RAs have effectively been dismissed are interesting\n\nquestions; but we by-pass them (the waiver is surely a rare\n\nsituation) because the second paragraph of section 3731 is adequate\n\nto support the appeal.\n\n              Indeed, while both paragraphs might apply to the same\n\norder, the second paragraph is a more apt basis here because the\n\nreal concern of the parties has little to do with any possible--and\n\nhighly theoretical--second trial for the postponed RAs.                  Rather,\n\nboth sides are mainly interested in the postponement’s effect on\n\nthe first trial--the government because it wants the four RAs to be\n\navailable to the jury and the defense because it wants them not to\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fbe available.   Consonantly, the second paragraph's own concern is\n\nwith the exclusion of evidence in the instant trial (without regard\n\nto whether there will ever be another trial).\n\n          But have the postponed RAs been \"excluded\" from evidence\n\nin the first trial?   The district court’s order and statements are\n\noblique; the RAs were relegated to a second case without a clear\n\nstatement of the effect on the first, but we think that the\n\ndistrict court has in substance told the government that it may\n\nrely only upon ten RAs in order to prove the necessary RICO pattern\n\nand not the fourteen listed in the indictment.\n\n          Defendants say that the excluded RAs might still be\n\nadmissible for other purposes (such as proving the existence of the\n\nenterprise) or perhaps even on a limited basis as to particular\n\ndefendants, but of course \"exclusion\" within the meaning of section\n\n3731 need not be a complete exclusion.       Cf. United States v.\n\nCeccolini, 435 U.S. 268, 271-2, 275 (1978) (jurisdiction to review\n\nsuppression of evidence under § 3731 even though the evidence would\n\nstill be admissible for impeachment and other purposes).\n\n          Such an exclusion of charged RAs to prove the pattern is\n\nin our view an exclusion of evidence within the meaning of the\n\nsecond paragraph of section 3731. See United States v. Mobley, 193\n\nF.3d 492, 495 (7th Cir. 1999) (finding jurisdiction under section\n\n3731's second paragraph to review an exclusion of overt acts\n\noffered to prove a conspiracy).   It does not mean that the pattern\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fcould not be proved through other RAs--there are at least two un-\n\nexcluded RAs charged against every defendant--but it does mean that\n\nthe government would be deprived of factual episodes that it would\n\notherwise offer to establish the pattern.         The RAs are evidence of\n\nthe pattern, and section 3731 permits an appeal of an order\n\nsuppressing evidence even if there remains other evidence of the\n\ncrime.\n\n            What little case law exists in this circuit supports our\n\nconclusion.     See King, 827 F.2d at 866 (jurisdiction to review a\n\ndistrict court order excluding evidence of a specific racketeering\n\nact); see also United States v. Levasseur, 846 F.2d 786, 787 n.2\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (suggesting possibility).         And, whether or not the\n\ndistrict court’s order was a formal exclusion, \"pretrial orders\n\nthat have the practical effect of excluding material evidence at\n\ntrial     are   appealable     under   section     3731,   regardless   of\n\nnomenclature.\"      United States v. Brooks, 145 F.3d 446, 454 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            The merits of the exclusion.         The most important issue\n\nbefore us is the district court’s claim of authority to sculpt the\n\ngovernment’s case by limiting the charged RAs that can be proved in\n\nthis case. The government portrays this as a naked encroachment on\n\nthe     Executive   Branch’s   constitutional     authority   to   conduct\n\nprosecutions; the defense, as a simple house-keeping matter no\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fdifferent than limiting the number of witnesses or the order of\n\npresentation.      We think both claims are overstated.\n\n            Had the district court purported to exclude the evidence\n\nbecause    (for    example)    it     thought   the   acts    not   worthy    of\n\nprosecution, it might well be ultra vires, cf. United States v.\n\nArmstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996), but the court's concern here\n\nwas with trial management and jury comprehension.               Supreme Court\n\ncases contain broad statements supporting orders to these ends.\n\nSee, e.g., Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80, 86-87 (1976).\n\nRoutinely, courts sever counts that the government bundled, limit\n\nrepetitive witnesses that the government sought to offer, and\n\nexclude pieces of its evidence as unduly prejudicial or like\n\nreasons.\n\n            Similarly, this case differs from those in which, finding\n\nthat   counts     had   been   needlessly     multiplied,    district      courts\n\ndeferred trial on some of the counts merely to save time.               In those\n\nsituations, admittedly on aggravated facts, two circuits have said\n\nfirmly that trial courts have no authority to carve down the\n\ngovernment’s case for the court’s own convenience because the judge\n\nregarded it as overcharged.         See Zabawa, 39 F.3d at 284-85; United\n\nStates v.    Giannattasio,      979    F.2d   98,   100-01   (7th   Cir.   1992)\n\n(Posner, J.).       In our own circuit, dicta in United States v.\n\nLeichter, 160 F.3d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir. 1998), assumes that the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\ftrial court has authority to postpone excessive counts but does not\n\ndeal with the exclusion of evidence.\n\n                  In our view, telling the government that in order to\n\nsimplify the trial it cannot prove RICO acts for which it has\n\nsecured an indictment (and which are otherwise proper under the\n\nstatute and rules of evidence) is more than mere house-keeping.\n\nTrue, limits on the time allowed to each side, or the number of\n\nwitnesses, can have the effect of restricting each side’s proof;\n\nand such orders have been upheld, usually relying upon a district\n\ncourt's inherent authority.7              But in such cases each side still\n\nretains control of what it will prove in the time available.\n\n                  Even courts generous in allowing other trammels have been\n\ncautious about intruding on counsel's ability to shape the case;\n\none court said that \"while courts certainly should have flexibility\n\nin reassessing imposed time limits, they ordinarily should allow a\n\nparty to fill its allotment with whatever evidence that party deems\n\nappropriate.\"            Duquesne Light Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 66\n\nF.3d       604,    610    (3rd   Cir.   1995);   see   also   United   States   v.\n\nHildebrand, 928 F. Supp.\n\n\n\n       7\n      E.g., Geders, 425 U.S. at 86-87; Duquesne Light Co. v.\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp., 66 F.3d 604, 609-10 (3d Cir. 1995); MCI\nCommunications Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1171\n(7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891 (1983). Sometimes courts\nrely upon Fed. R. Evid. 403 rather than inherent authority,\nalthough inherent authority appears a slightly better fit where the\nissue is the contours of the trial rather than the inherent quality\nof a piece of evidence.\n\n                                          -21-\n\f 841, 848 (N.D. Iowa 1996).               This concern may be especially sharp\n\nin a criminal case.\n\n                  Our own case illustrates the potential impact of such\n\nexclusions.         As to DeCologero the government had a fair number of\n\npredicate acts to offer even after the district court order, but as\n\nto other defendants it had only three, four, or five remaining\n\nafter the exclusion.               While two is the absolute minimum for a\n\nconviction,         not     just   any    two     predicate    acts   will    do:    the\n\nrelationship between the acts must form a \"pattern\" based on\n\nelusive criteria.8           If the district court's order was given effect,\n\nthe jury might find that the government had proven the remaining\n\nacts and yet the case still fail for want of the necessary\n\nrelationship that an excluded act would have supplied.\n\n                  In this respect, the present order's treatment of RAs\n\ngoes       well    beyond    those    that,     like   the   orders   in    Zabawa and\n\nGiannattasio,         postpone       or   sever    counts;    although     denying   the\n\ngovernment the forensic benefit of multiplying counts in a single\n\ntrial, those orders still preserved the government's right to\n\nproceed on the stricken charges in a second proceeding.                               By\n\n\n       8\n      H.J. Inc. v. N.W. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 238 (1989)\n(\"[T]here is something to a RICO pattern beyond simply the number\nof predicate acts involved . . . . [T]he mere fact that there are\na number of predicates is no guarantee that they fall into any\narrangement or order. It is not the number of predicates but the\nrelationship that they bear to each other or to some external\norganizing principle that renders them 'ordered' or 'arranged.'\");\nSedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 497 n.14 (1985).\n\n\n                                            -22-\n\fcontrast, the outright exclusion of individual RAs substantially\n\nweakens the charges that remain in the first trial.                    By limiting\n\nthe blocks of evidence that the government may use, this exclusion\n\ncan deprive the public permanently of rightful convictions.                      This\n\nloss   of   evidence    is       not   necessarily     offset    by    the   dubious\n\npossibility of a second trial, also on truncated evidence.\n\n            Seeking a solution for a problem with little direct\n\ncircuit precedent, we are led to this answer:               in a RICO case, the\n\nexclusion of an RA or other criminal episode in order to make the\n\ntrial comprehensible for a jury may not be wholly beyond the\n\ndistrict court’s inherent authority (we need not decide the issue\n\ndefinitively); but it would have to be a last resort where no more\n\nconventional method existed to assure a fair trial and where the\n\nexclusion rested on detailed and compelling findings. The test, in\n\nshort, would be one not of convenience but of last-ditch necessity.\n\n            Was    there    in    this   case   an    adequately      detailed    and\n\nsupportable       finding    of    last-resort       necessity   for    the    order\n\nexcluding RAs?       The district judge said that it was \"virtually\n\nimpossible\" to instruct the jury, and that \"to run a reasonable\n\ntrial the jurors can understand that is fair to both sides requires\n\na break up of these wide ranging charges.\"                But these conclusions\n\nare not supported with any detailed explanation and whether the\n\njudge meant that the RAs had to be excluded because there was no\n\nother way to provide a fair trial is unclear.\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f             On this record we are unwilling to impute to the judge\n\nsuch a finding of last-resort necessity and, absent some further\n\nunderpinning, would be unable to uphold it. The present indictment\n\nbefore the order took effect covered six defendants, twenty-three\n\ncounts, and thirty-eight predicate acts (some overlapping with\n\ncounts).    This is admittedly quite a wingspan, even though most of\n\nthe crimes were familiar rather than esoteric and the focus is upon\n\na single alleged criminal gang operating in one geographic area\n\nover a limited time period.\n\n             Yet indictments of comparable or greater complexity are\n\nregularly tried. See, e.g., United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230,\n\n236 (1st Cir. 1990) (seven-defendant, fifty-seven-count indictment\n\nruled not so large that a jury was incapable of understanding);\n\nUnited   States   v.    Shea,   211    F.3d   658   (1st    Cir.   2000).     The\n\ngovernment here estimated that the trial would take about two\n\nmonths--a figure far less than the duration of other gangland\n\ncases.     E.g., United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149-50\n\n(2d Cir. 1989) (rejecting arguments that a 17-month trial was too\n\ncomplex for the jury to comprehend).\n\n             There are potentially limits to the complexity that a\n\njury can handle:       in United States v. Andrews, 754 F. Supp. 1161,\n\n1180   (N.D.   Ill.    1990),   the    district     court   was    faced   with   a\n\nstaggering     RICO     case--a       305-page,     175-count,      38-defendant\n\nindictment--and the court broke up the case as part of its formal\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fRule 14 severance of trials of particular defendants.           But our own\n\ncase is a fraction of this size and, when the Andrews court had\n\ndivided the mammoth indictment into separate trials, those units\n\nwere (on a crude assessment) each about the same size as the entire\n\nDeCologero indictment.\n\n            While Andrews may have been facially unmanageable (the\n\nSeventh Circuit never reviewed this question), this case is not,\n\nand so in our view it was insufficient for the district court\n\nmerely to recite the number of counts, RAs, and different criminal\n\nstatutes involved and then announce a conclusion.                As already\n\nnoted, the district court stressed that there were thirty-eight\n\npredicate acts, but this overstates the number of criminal episodes\n\ninvolved, see note 6, above; in this case the criminal statutes\n\nother    than   RICO   are   not   esoteric;   and   the   district   court's\n\nexclusion of RAs did not significantly reduce the number on which\n\njury instructions would be required--at most, it reduced the number\n\nby one.9\n\n            Further, there is no showing that the district court had\n\nexhausted more conventional means to cope with the case.              Rule 14\n\ngives the district judge wide authority to sever defendants,\n\ncounts, or both, upon a showing of prejudice.          Cf. United States v.\n\n\n\n     9\n      If the government elected to postpone RA 14 (collection of\ncredit by extortionate means), the court would not have to instruct\nthe jury on 18 U.S.C. § 894(a). Otherwise, the elimination of four\nRAs would not affect the number of statutes involved.\n\n                                     -25-\n\fBartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 678 (1st Cir. 1997).     In principle, the\n\ndistrict court could require that DeCologero be tried alone and\n\nsolely upon the two RICO counts and the RAs applicable to him,\n\nsevering all other defendants and counts for a future trial or\n\ntrials.   Similarly, limits on witnesses and the time allowed to\n\neach side are permissible measures. Duquesne Light Co., 66 F.3d at\n\n609-10; Sec'y of Labor v. DeSisto, 929 F.2d 789, 796 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n          In this case the district judge did not make findings, or\n\nnegate alternatives, that would justify the extreme remedy of\n\nexcluding otherwise properly charged RAs from the initial trial.\n\nIn so ruling, we intend no criticism whatever of the experienced\n\nand distinguished trial judge who was trying to bring more order\n\ninto a complex trial. The limits of trial management authority are\n\ninherently uncertain, and existing circuit case law here and\n\nelsewhere is virtually a stranger to the precise problem in this\n\ncase.\n\n          For the reasons stated, the order rejecting the double\n\njeopardy defense is affirmed, the trial management order is vacated\n\ninsofar as it excluded from the indictment or evidence the four\n\nindividual RAs in question in order to simplify proceedings, and\n\nthe matter remanded for further proceedings.

Before    us     are   a   pair   of\n\ninterlocutory appeals in a criminal case.                Both grow out of a 23-\n\ncount federal indictment filed on October 17, 2001, charging Paul\n\nA. DeCologero and six associates with criminal racketeering in\n\nviolation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act\n\n(\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2000),1 conspiracy to violate RICO,\n\nid. § 1962(d) and an array of related crimes.               We refer to Paul A.\n\nDeCologero as \"DeCologero\" even though several co-defendants have\n\nthe same last name.\n\n             The government alleged that DeCologero headed a criminal\n\nenterprise (\"the DeCologero crew\") that used brutal tactics to gain\n\ncontrol     of   a   portion   of    Boston's   drug     trade   and   murdered    a\n\nnineteen-year-old woman (Aislin Silva) when the members thought she\n\nmight betray them.       In addition to the RICO counts, the indictment\n\nspecified a number of federal crimes charged in separate counts\n\ninvolving drugs, guns, robberies, and--in the case of the slain\n\nwoman--murder for the purpose of witness tampering.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides:\n\n              It shall be unlawful for any person employed\n              by or associated with any enterprise engaged\n              in, or the activities of which affect,\n              interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\n              participate, directly or indirectly, in the\n              conduct of such enterprise's affairs through\n              a pattern of racketeering activity or\n              collection of unlawful debt.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            RICO violations require not only participation in a\n\ncriminal   enterprise   but   also   participation   in   a   \"pattern    of\n\nracketeering activity,\" which in turn requires proof of at least\n\ntwo of a list of specified federal or state crimes (e.g., murder,\n\nextortion, robbery, drug trafficking).      18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(1), (5)\n\n(2000).    In jargon, such acts are called \"predicate acts\" or\n\n\"racketeering acts\" (\"RAs\"), and, in this indictment, a number of\n\nthe acts charged as federal crimes in separate counts of the\n\nindictment were restated as RAs in support of the RICO counts.             A\n\ntable listing the RAs is attached to this decision.\n\n           Nominally the indictment identified fourteen separate\n\nRAs, but several had subparts, each constituting a sufficient\n\npredicate act under RICO; for example, the attempted and ultimately\n\nsuccessful murder of the woman was expressed in RA 1 as five\n\nseparate crimes (e.g., subpart 1 was conspiracy to murder under\n\nstate law, subpart 2 was attempt to murder under state law).             The\n\nindictment thus effectively contained thirty-eight predicate acts\n\nonly partly overlapping with the substantive counts because some\n\ncounts were not RAs and some RAs (e.g., state crimes) were not\n\ncounts.    Different defendants were implicated in different RAs;\n\nonly Paul A. DeCologero was implicated in all.\n\n           Four years before the present indictment was filed,\n\nDeCologero had been acquitted of RICO violations in United States\n\nv. Carrozza, Crim. No. 97-40009-NMG (D. Mass. 1999). Following the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fpresent indictment, DeCologero moved to dismiss the new RICO\n\ncharges against him (and one drug conspiracy count) on double\n\njeopardy grounds.   The district court rejected this claim, finding\n\nthat the RICO violations alleged in Carrozza were different than\n\nthose charged in the current case.      DeCologero now appeals from\n\nthis ruling under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (2000), the denial of a double\n\njeopardy defense being immediately appealable.        Abney v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 662 (1977).\n\n          At one of the pre-trial hearings, the district court had\n\nexpressed concern that the scope of the case--the number of counts,\n\nRAs and criminal offenses--made \"charging a jury and having them\n\nunderstand virtually impossible.\"      Then, in an oral ruling at a\n\nfurther conference, the district court without further explanation\n\nsua sponte divided the case (as described immediately below) into\n\ntwo   separate   trials.    On   motion    by   the   government   for\n\nreconsideration, the court entered a written order adhering to the\n\nseparation, saying:\n\n          [I]t is necessary to divide this case into\n          separate trials, pursuant to this Court's\n          inherent \"authority and responsibility for\n          managing . . . trials before it so as to\n          protect the interests of the parties and the\n          public in just determination of a criminal\n          proceeding with 'simplicity in procedure,\n          fairness in administration and the elimination\n          of unjustifiable expense and delay.'\" United\n          States v.

P. 2).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f           The district court's ruling divided the charges in the\n\nindictment     into   two   separate     trials,   ordering   that   three\n\nsubstantive counts involving robberies and unlawful possession of\n\nfirearms be postponed until a second trial at some unspecified\n\ndate.2   Further, the court ordered that four of the fourteen\n\nracketeering acts that the government included as predicate acts\n\nfor the RICO charges be postponed until this second trial.             See\n\nattached chart. This left ten RAs and seventeen substantive counts\n\nfor the first trial (the government had voluntarily dismissed three\n\nfirearms counts).\n\n           The government then filed a cross-appeal from the court's\n\ndecision to postpone four of the RAs until a later trial, arguing\n\nthat this order effectively dismissed and foreclosed the four\n\npostponed RAs since double jeopardy doctrine would prevent the\n\ngovernment from bringing RICO charges based on these RAs in a later\n\ntrial.   Alternatively, the government said that the order exceeded\n\nthe district court's case management authority. The district court\n\nstayed trial pending the resolution of the appeals.\n\n             Before us now are three difficult questions:      the merits\n\nof DeCologero’s double jeopardy claim (which is clearly appealable\n\nnow under Abney, 431 U.S. at 662); whether we have jurisdiction\n\n\n\n     2\n      The court did not invoke Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 and \"sever\" the\ndeferred counts into a separate case with a separate docket number;\ninstead, it merely postponed their trial until a second phase of\nthe same case.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fover the government's cross-appeal contesting the case management\n\norder (the defendants dispute jurisdiction); and, if so, whether\n\nthe district court exceeded its authority in its division of the\n\ncase insofar as it limited the RAs available to the government in\n\nthe first trial.    We address the questions in that order.\n\n            Double Jeopardy.    DeCologero argues that, having been\n\nacquitted of the RICO charges in Carrozza, he is shielded by the\n\nConstitution's prohibition of double jeopardy from the RICO charges\n\n(although not necessarily from the non-RICO counts) in the present\n\ncase.     This is so if, but only if, the RICO charges in the two\n\ncases are \"the same.\"     U.S. Const. amd. V; see, e.g., United States\n\nv. Marino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (1st Cir. 2002).        Based on a comparison\n\nof the two indictments as drafted and the proffer of evidence by\n\nthe government, we conclude that the new RICO charges are not\n\nbarred.\n\n            The Carrozza indictment charged nine defendants with\n\nconducting the affairs of \"the Patriarca Family of La Cosa Nostra\"\n\nthrough a pattern of racketeering. La Cosa Nostra is the notorious\n\ncrime syndicate also known as the mafia.      The \"Patriarca Family,\"\n\na New England branch of this organization, was headed by Raymond J.\n\nPatriarca until 1990, at which point Francis P. Salemme was the\n\nheir-apparent.      The    Carrozza   defendants    were   charged   with\n\nattempting \"to usurp control of the Patriarca Family\" from Salemme\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fafter Patriarca's death.    See Marino, 277 F.3d at 19-21 (detailing\n\nevidence in Carrozza case).\n\n           The Carrozza indictment covered the period from 1989 to\n\n1994, although evidence of events occurring through 1998 was\n\npresented at trial.     DeCologero was charged in eight substantive\n\ncounts, including RICO and RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit\n\nmurder and attempted murder, various firearms charges, and a\n\ncocaine distribution conspiracy.          The RICO counts listed him as a\n\nparticipant in only three of the fourteen RAs: conspiracy to murder\n\nfourteen individuals, attempted murder, and conspiracy to possess\n\ncocaine with intent to distribute. He was acquitted of all charges\n\nin 1999.\n\n           The   present   indictment      charges     the   defendants   with\n\nparticipating in a nominally different enterprise--the \"DeCologero\n\nCrew\"--said by the government to be \"a separate entity from the\n\nPatriarca La Cosa Nostra ('LCN') Family, yet . . . structured in a\n\nsimilar manner to a crew or regime of La Cosa Nostra\" and \"aligned\n\nwith\" the Carrozza faction of the Patriarca Family.             According to\n\nthe   charge,    the   DeCologero    Crew's      aim     was   \"controlling,\n\nsupervising,     and   financing    illegal      activities,\"      including\n\ngenerating money through robbery and drug sales \"for the personal\n\nuse of members . . . and to build up a war chest of firearms,\n\nweapons, and ammunition which was to be used, in part, to support\n\nthe\" Carrozza faction.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f             If the double jeopardy problem turned solely on whether\n\nthe two cases involved the same enterprise, we would be faced with\n\na hard question.

Although the DeCologero indictment alleges that the\n\nCarrozza faction and DeCologero crew were separate enterprises, the\n\nproffered evidence could support the view that both were part of a\n\nvertically organized endeavor, with DeCologero somewhere in the\n\nmiddle of the organizational pyramid.\n\n             Past cases have stressed that conspiracies cannot be\n\nartificially broken up for the purpose of bringing separate cases,\n\nsee Braverman v.

These factors include the time, the place, the\n\npeople, and the nature and scope of the activities involved in each\n\nindictment.\n\n          Here,     little   overlap   exists   in   the   type   of   crimes\n\ncentrally charged as racketeering acts in the two cases.                 The\n\nCarrozza indictment RAs focused on the systematic murder of rival\n\nmafia members--a pattern of murders and attempted murders of\n\nmembers of the Salemme faction (including attempted murder of\n\nFrancis Salemme) to seize control of the Patriarca crime family.\n\nThe specific RAs alleged include conspiracy to murder fourteen\n\npeople, attempted murder of six, and successful murder of two, as\n\nwell as a cocaine conspiracy and several gambling-related charges.\n\nIn the present indictment, the only murder alleged was committed\n\nsimply as part of a failed cover-up attempt incident to the crew’s\n\nmain activities.4\n\n\n     4\n      According to the indictment and the government's summary of\nevidence, Silva permitted crew members to store weapons at her\napartment; the police raided the apartment on a tip; and, afraid\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           The murder aside, the RAs alleged in the current case\n\ncentered on robbery and drug trafficking, primarily the former. By\n\ncontrast, not a single Carrozza RA involved robbery.              Thus, while\n\nthe pattern in Carrozza could be viewed primarily as murders\n\nconnected by an aim to secure power, the pattern in the present\n\ncase appears to be a more conventional collection of robberies and\n\ndrug trafficking offenses, the single murder being merely a means\n\nof protecting the conspiracy from the police.\n\n           The   other   factors--similarity       of   persons,       time, and\n\nplace--are less clear-cut but do not preclude the conclusion that\n\nthe two patterns are different. The Carrozza indictment identified\n\neight defendants; Paul is the only member of the DeCologero crew\n\nwho was charged in Carrozza, there as a subordinate member of the\n\nCarrozza faction rather than as a leader of his own crew.                 Still,\n\nthe   Carrozza   indictment   named   one   \"FNU    [first      name    unknown]\n\nDeCologero\" among the thirty unindicted co-conspirators, so at\n\nleast one (and perhaps more) of the other defendants in the current\n\ncase may have been involved.\n\n           As for time and place, the locations involved in the two\n\nindictments are basically the same--the greater Boston area--but\n\nthe time periods overlap only slightly.        The Carrozza indictment\n\nalleged RICO violations that ran from 1989 though 1994, although at\n\n\n\nSilva might testify, crew        members    acting      under    orders     from\nDeCologero killed Silva.\n\n                                  -11-\n\ftrial the government offered proof that the conspiracy to obtain\n\npower continued through January 1998.        The present indictment\n\nalleges that the DeCologero crew operated from 1995 through the\n\nbeginning of 1997.    Again, this is consistent with the view that\n\nthere may have been one enterprise but does not disturb the\n\nconclusion that there were two patterns.\n\n          In summary, all of the incidents constituting substantive\n\nnon-RICO crimes and all of the RAs in the present indictment are\n\ndifferent from those charged in the Carrozza case.       Whether the\n\nenterprise in the two cases is \"the same\" may be open to debate,\n\nbut \"the pattern\" is different, which defeats the double jeopardy\n\nclaim. Whether any of the background evidence offered in the first\n\ntrial is relevant and admissible in the second is a matter for the\n\ndistrict judge.\n\n          DeCologero argues alternatively that collateral estoppel\n\nprohibits the present RICO charges against him or at the very least\n\nprecludes the government from making any reference to the \"war\" for\n\ncontrol of the Patriarca family.       See Ashe v.

The government's cross-\n\nappeal is directed to the scheduling order issued sua sponte by the\n\ntrial    court,    citing    the     court's      \"inherent    authority      and\n\nresponsibility for managing trials.\"           The court ordered that three\n\nsubstantive counts and four racketeering acts be postponed until a\n\nsecond trial at some unspecified later date; the rest of the case\n\nwould be tried at the first trial.             The government’s motion for\n\nreconsideration was denied.\n\n              On its interlocutory appeal, the government does not\n\nformally contest the postponement of substantive counts to a second\n\ntrial, but only the exclusion of four RAs.                The government says\n\nthat if this court orders the four RAs to be reinstated for the\n\nfirst trial, the district court may well decide to reinstate the\n\npostponed counts directed to the same acts; obviously, it would do\n\nlittle   to    reduce   complexity    at    the   trial   if   the   counts   are\n\npostponed but the RAs remain to be proven by the same evidence.\n\n              An order severing or deferring counts is generally not\n\nimmediately appealable.

To understand just what the\n\ndistrict   court   did   and       how    it    matters    requires     additional\n\nbackground--pertinent both to the jurisdictional question and to\n\nthe merits.\n\n           As explained earlier, the original indictment listed\n\nfourteen RAs but, with subparts, amounted effectively to thirty-\n\neight different acts.6       DeCologero was charged in all fourteen of\n\nthe RAs; of the other defendants, one was named in nine, one in\n\nseven, and the remaining two defendants were named in four each.\n\nSee attached    chart.       The    RAs    not   only     involved    thirty-eight\n\nseparate   criminal   acts     but       were   violations    of     over   a   dozen\n\ndifferent federal and state statutes (e.g., murder, robbery) each\n\nof which would require instructions to the jury as to the elements\n\nof the crime.\n\n           Before making her sua sponte ruling, the district judge\n\nexpressed fear that the level of complexity of the case \"makes\n\ncharging a jury and having them understand virtually impossible,\"\n\nand noted that she had a \"fervent desire to try a piece of the case\n\nfirst.\"    In her later ruling, she selected two specific RAs--\n\nnumbers 6 and 8 on the attached chart--to be \"postponed\" until some\n\nunspecified later date (presumably the same time as the trial of\n\n\n     6\n      The district court stressed that there were thirty-eight, but\ngovernment's grouping of the predicate acts into fourteen sets may\nmore accurately reflect the level of factual complexity because the\nRAs in each group all relate to the same criminal episode (e.g., a\nparticular robbery), albeit fragmented into different crimes.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthe severed substantive counts).       Both excluded RAs involved\n\nrobberies in violation of the same state and federal statutes as\n\nthe robberies charged in RAs 4 and 5, which were not postponed.\n\n            The court also ordered the government to select two more\n\nRAs to be postponed, listing four from which to choose--three of\n\nthese RAs involved robberies and one involved conspiracy to collect\n\ncredit by extortionate means.   The criterion for exclusion of both\n\ncounts and RAs appeared to be how closely related they were to the\n\nmurder of Ms. Silva; the district judge repeatedly asked the\n\ngovernment to explain how the counts and RAs related to Silva, and\n\n(for instance) stated that two specific counts would be included in\n\nthe first trial \"on the representation that those are guns in\n\nSilva's apartment.    If they are not, then those counts do not go\n\nforward.\"\n\n            The statute governing appeals by the United States in\n\ncriminal cases, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3731 (2003), allows interlocutory\n\nappeals in specified situations, two of which are invoked by the\n\ngovernment in this case. The first paragraph of the statute allows\n\n(in pertinent part) an appeal from a district court’s dismissal of\n\nan indictment \"as to any one or more counts, or any part thereof\"--\n\nthe \"any part\" language having been added in 2002 in part to\n\nresolve a circuit split about the appealability of dismissed RAs.\n\nSee Pub. L. No. 107-273, div. B, tit. III, § 3004, 116 Stat. 1758\n\n(2002); H.R. Rep.

The most\n\nfamiliar target of such appeals are pre-trial orders suppressing\n\nevidence as unlawfully seized; but the provision equally allows\n\nappeal from in limine orders excluding evidence on any ground\n\n(e.g., because prejudice outweighs probative value under Fed.

Of course, the district court here did not\n\npurport to \"dismiss\" the RAs but--as with the three substantive\n\ncounts--only   to   \"postpone\"   them    to   a   second   trial.    On   the\n\nprinciple that substance rather than form should prevail, this\n\nlabeling would not bar appeal under the first paragraph if the\n\npostponement were effectively a dismissal.

The opportunity to employ the\n\ncounterpart acts as RAs in a second RICO prosecution is more\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fdoubtful.      Under the RICO statute, predicate acts are offered to\n\nsatisfy the \"pattern of racketeering\" element of the crime. On the\n\ngovernment’s     premise     that   all   of    the   predicate   acts   charged\n\ncomprised the same pattern, a second RICO prosecution based on the\n\npostponed acts would arguably itself be barred by double jeopardy\n\nprinciples, the \"acts\" being different but the \"pattern\" being the\n\nsame.      If so, deferral was effectively dismissal.\n\n              The defendants have sought to defeat this basis for\n\nappeal by agreeing in writing, shortly before oral argument in this\n\ncourt, to waive double jeopardy protection as to the severed RAs so\n\nfar   as    necessary   to   negate   the      government's   double     jeopardy\n\nargument. Whether this (post-appeal) waiver should be accepted and\n\nwhether if accepted it fully answers the government’s claim that\n\nthe postponed RAs have effectively been dismissed are interesting\n\nquestions; but we by-pass them (the waiver is surely a rare\n\nsituation) because the second paragraph of section 3731 is adequate\n\nto support the appeal.\n\n              Indeed, while both paragraphs might apply to the same\n\norder, the second paragraph is a more apt basis here because the\n\nreal concern of the parties has little to do with any possible--and\n\nhighly theoretical--second trial for the postponed RAs.                  Rather,\n\nboth sides are mainly interested in the postponement’s effect on\n\nthe first trial--the government because it wants the four RAs to be\n\navailable to the jury and the defense because it wants them not to\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fbe available.   Consonantly, the second paragraph's own concern is\n\nwith the exclusion of evidence in the instant trial (without regard\n\nto whether there will ever be another trial).\n\n          But have the postponed RAs been \"excluded\" from evidence\n\nin the first trial?   The district court’s order and statements are\n\noblique; the RAs were relegated to a second case without a clear\n\nstatement of the effect on the first, but we think that the\n\ndistrict court has in substance told the government that it may\n\nrely only upon ten RAs in order to prove the necessary RICO pattern\n\nand not the fourteen listed in the indictment.\n\n          Defendants say that the excluded RAs might still be\n\nadmissible for other purposes (such as proving the existence of the\n\nenterprise) or perhaps even on a limited basis as to particular\n\ndefendants, but of course \"exclusion\" within the meaning of section\n\n3731 need not be a complete exclusion.

See United States v. Mobley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766388\"><a href=\"/opinion/766388/united-states-v-callie-mobley-and-jimmie-mobley/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (7th Cir. 1999) (finding jurisdiction under section\n\n3731's second paragraph to review an exclusion of overt acts\n\noffered to prove a conspiracy).   It does not mean that the pattern\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fcould not be proved through other RAs--there are at least two un-\n\nexcluded RAs charged against every defendant--but it does mean that\n\nthe government would be deprived of factual episodes that it would\n\notherwise offer to establish the pattern.

The most important issue\n\nbefore us is the district court’s claim of authority to sculpt the\n\ngovernment’s case by limiting the charged RAs that can be proved in\n\nthis case. The government portrays this as a naked encroachment on\n\nthe     Executive   Branch’s   constitutional     authority   to   conduct\n\nprosecutions; the defense, as a simple house-keeping matter no\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fdifferent than limiting the number of witnesses or the order of\n\npresentation.      We think both claims are overstated.\n\n            Had the district court purported to exclude the evidence\n\nbecause    (for    example)    it     thought   the   acts    not   worthy    of\n\nprosecution, it might well be ultra vires, cf.

As to DeCologero the government had a fair number of\n\npredicate acts to offer even after the district court order, but as\n\nto other defendants it had only three, four, or five remaining\n\nafter the exclusion.               While two is the absolute minimum for a\n\nconviction,         not     just   any    two     predicate    acts   will    do:    the\n\nrelationship between the acts must form a \"pattern\" based on\n\nelusive criteria.8           If the district court's order was given effect,\n\nthe jury might find that the government had proven the remaining\n\nacts and yet the case still fail for want of the necessary\n\nrelationship that an excluded act would have supplied.\n\n                  In this respect, the present order's treatment of RAs\n\ngoes       well    beyond    those    that,     like   the   orders   in    Zabawa and\n\nGiannattasio,         postpone       or   sever    counts;    although     denying   the\n\ngovernment the forensic benefit of multiplying counts in a single\n\ntrial, those orders still preserved the government's right to\n\nproceed on the stricken charges in a second proceeding.

By limiting\n\nthe blocks of evidence that the government may use, this exclusion\n\ncan deprive the public permanently of rightful convictions.                      This\n\nloss   of   evidence    is       not   necessarily     offset    by    the   dubious\n\npossibility of a second trial, also on truncated evidence.\n\n            Seeking a solution for a problem with little direct\n\ncircuit precedent, we are led to this answer:               in a RICO case, the\n\nexclusion of an RA or other criminal episode in order to make the\n\ntrial comprehensible for a jury may not be wholly beyond the\n\ndistrict court’s inherent authority (we need not decide the issue\n\ndefinitively); but it would have to be a last resort where no more\n\nconventional method existed to assure a fair trial and where the\n\nexclusion rested on detailed and compelling findings. The test, in\n\nshort, would be one not of convenience but of last-ditch necessity.\n\n            Was    there    in    this   case   an    adequately      detailed    and\n\nsupportable       finding    of    last-resort       necessity   for    the    order\n\nexcluding RAs?       The district judge said that it was \"virtually\n\nimpossible\" to instruct the jury, and that \"to run a reasonable\n\ntrial the jurors can understand that is fair to both sides requires\n\na break up of these wide ranging charges.\"                But these conclusions\n\nare not supported with any detailed explanation and whether the\n\njudge meant that the RAs had to be excluded because there was no\n\nother way to provide a fair trial is unclear.\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f             On this record we are unwilling to impute to the judge\n\nsuch a finding of last-resort necessity and, absent some further\n\nunderpinning, would be unable to uphold it. The present indictment\n\nbefore the order took effect covered six defendants, twenty-three\n\ncounts, and thirty-eight predicate acts (some overlapping with\n\ncounts).    This is admittedly quite a wingspan, even though most of\n\nthe crimes were familiar rather than esoteric and the focus is upon\n\na single alleged criminal gang operating in one geographic area\n\nover a limited time period.\n\n             Yet indictments of comparable or greater complexity are\n\nregularly tried.

But our own\n\ncase is a fraction of this size and, when the Andrews court had\n\ndivided the mammoth indictment into separate trials, those units\n\nwere (on a crude assessment) each about the same size as the entire\n\nDeCologero indictment.\n\n            While Andrews may have been facially unmanageable (the\n\nSeventh Circuit never reviewed this question), this case is not,\n\nand so in our view it was insufficient for the district court\n\nmerely to recite the number of counts, RAs, and different criminal\n\nstatutes involved and then announce a conclusion.                As already\n\nnoted, the district court stressed that there were thirty-eight\n\npredicate acts, but this overstates the number of criminal episodes\n\ninvolved, see note 6, above; in this case the criminal statutes\n\nother    than   RICO   are   not   esoteric;   and   the   district   court's\n\nexclusion of RAs did not significantly reduce the number on which\n\njury instructions would be required--at most, it reduced the number\n\nby one.9\n\n            Further, there is no showing that the district court had\n\nexhausted more conventional means to cope with the case.
