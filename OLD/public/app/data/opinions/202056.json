Plaintiffs Iseut G. Vélez-\n\nRivera (\"Vélez\") and Fernando Peña-Castro (\"Peña\") brought action\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive relief and compensatory and\n\npunitive damages against defendants Juan Agosto-Alicea (\"Agosto\")\n\nin his official and personal capacities, Alba Caballero-Fuentes\n\n(\"Caballero\"),    Lilliam   Jiménez-Montijo   (\"Jiménez\"),    and   the\n\nGovernment Development Bank of Puerto Rico (\"GDB\").1         Plaintiffs\n\nallege that their employment with GDB was unlawfully terminated as\n\na result of their political affiliation with the New Progressive\n\nParty (\"NPP\"), in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n            On February 19, 2004, the magistrate judge issued a\n\nReport and Recommendation denying defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment.   On August 24, 2005, the district court dismissed all of\n\nplaintiffs' federal claims with prejudice and granted summary\n\njudgment. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration which\n\nthe district court denied on June 9, 2005.    Plaintiffs now appeal.\n\n            Because we find that the district court properly granted\n\nsummary judgment against both Vélez and Peña, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Plaintiff Vélez brought suit against all defendants, but\nPlaintiff Peña only brought suit against GDB and Agosto.       The\ndistrict judge dismissed all claims against GDB and against Agosto\nin his official capacity on Eleventh Amendment grounds. Plaintiffs\nhave not raised this issue on appeal and so we consider it to be\nwaived. Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 358 F.3d 110, 114\nn.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                                  I.\n\n             In the general elections of November 2000, the incumbent\n\nNPP was defeated by the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").       As part\n\nof the transition to the new administration, Agosto was appointed\n\npresident of GDB on January 2, 2001.      Upon taking office, Agosto\n\nhired defendant Caballero, an independent contractor in the field\n\nof human resources, to investigate all employment actions executed\n\nat GDB between July 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000 to assess their\n\nlegality.2    Vélez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea, 334 F. Supp. 2d 72, 90-\n\n91 (D.P.R. 2004).\n\n             On September 7, 2000 -- one day before the commencement\n\nof the moratorium period -- plaintiff Vélez had been promoted to\n\nDeputy Director of Human Resources at GDB, subject to a six-month\n\nprobationary period that was scheduled to expire on March 6, 2001.\n\nId. at 83.     Although Vélez maintains that her performance was at\n\nall times satisfactory, she received notice on February 15, 2001\n\nthat her probation period had been extended for three additional\n\nmonths so that her qualifications could be reviewed.      Id.    Vélez\n\nclaims that at one point defendant Jiménez, GDB's Human Resources\n\n\n\n2\n   As we have noted previously, \"[u]nder Puerto Rico law, there is\na period of time, called the electoral moratorium period (\"veda\nelectoral\"), during which no 'movement[s] of personnel' are to take\nplace absent emergencies.\" Sánchez-López v. Fuentes-Pujols, 375\nF.3d 121, 126 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1337). The\nmoratorium period extends from two months prior to the election to\ntwo months afterward.       In 2000, the moratorium began on\nSeptember 8.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fand Labor Relations Director, warned her that \"she would soon be\n\ndismissed because she was a New Progressive Party Member.\"       On\n\nJune 15, 2001, Jiménez presided over an informal hearing in which\n\nit was determined that Vélez did not comply with the minimum\n\nrequirements of her position at the time of her promotion.   Vélez-\n\nRivera, 334 F. Supp. 2d at 91.     On July 12, 2001, Agosto sent a\n\nletter to Vélez informing her that her appointment was null and\n\nvoid and terminating her employment.   Id. at 83.\n\n          Vélez insists that she was terminated because of unlawful\n\npolitical discrimination.   Defendants claim -- and the district\n\ncourt agreed -- that Vélez did not meet the requirements for the\n\nposition of Deputy Director of Human Resources in September 2000\n\nand thus that her termination was appropriate because her promotion\n\nviolated GDB personnel regulations and the \"merit principle.\"3\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The electoral moratorium was implemented \"[f]or the purpose of\nguaranteeing the faithful application of the merit principle in\npublic service during the period before and after elections\" 3 P.R.\nLaws Ann. § 1337.\n\n   The \"merit principle\" is the requirement under Puerto Rico law\nthat\n     [t]he agencies of the personnel system are bound to offer\n     the opportunity to compete to any qualified person\n     interested in participating in public service in our\n     country. This participation shall be established on the\n     candidate's merit without discrimination on account of\n     race, color, sex, place of birth, age, origin or social\n     condition, physical or mental disability, or political or\n     religious beliefs.\n\n3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1333.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            On February 4, 1999, plaintiff Peña signed a contract\n\nwith GDB for services including \"consulting in the sale of equity\n\nand debts of hotels, specifically, Mr. Peña [would] contribute his\n\nexperience and education in areas such as valuation, negotiation\n\nand legal structuring of different transactions\" Vélez-Rivera, 334\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 86.          On September 7, 1999, Peña signed another\n\nservice order expanding the scope of his services to \"consulting in\n\nthe area of privatization.\"       Id.    He signed similar service orders\n\nin December 1999 and July 2000, none of which were limited by\n\nexpiration dates.     Id.     On November 21, 2000, Peña signed a final\n\nservice order that was to replace all previous orders and that\n\nspecified an effectiveness period of November 1, 2000 to June 30,\n\n2001. Id.    On February 9, 2001, Peña was informed of the premature\n\ncancellation of his service order.         Id.\n\n            Peña alleges that his contract was terminated because of\n\npolitical discrimination.        His four previous service orders had\n\nbeen renewed without complaint, and Peña claims that he was given\n\nno explanation when he was fired and \"replaced with two PDP members\n\nwho now perform the same services that he performed while employed\n\nwith the GDB.\"    Brief for Appellants at 10.         He also claims that\n\nGDB's executive vice president stated publicly that \"all service\n\norders   with   NPP   members    would    be   cancelled.\"   Id.   at   11.\n\nDefendants maintain that Peña's contract was not terminated because\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fof political discrimination, and that, as a contract employee, he\n\nhad no legitimate expectation of continued employment with GDB.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing\n\nall   reasonable   inferences   in    favor    of   the   non-moving   party.\n\nZapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    Summary judgment is properly granted if the movant can\n\ndemonstrate that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\n\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).      In the summary judgment context, we\n\nhave construed \"genuine\" to mean \"that the evidence about the fact\n\nis such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of\n\nthe nonmoving party\"    United States v. One Parcel of Real Prop.,\n\n960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir. 1992).         Similarly, a fact is \"material\"\n\nif it is \"one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the\n\ngoverning law.\"    Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank of Puerto Rico, 27 F.3d\n\n746, 748 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n                                      A.\n\n            The first issue before us is whether, as plaintiffs\n\ncontend, the district court applied the wrong pleading standard\n\nwhen it granted defendants' motion for summary judgment.                This\n\nclaim is meritless.    Plaintiffs rely on our opinion in Gorski v.\n\nNew Hampshire Dep't of Corrections, 290 F.3d 466, 473 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f2002),     to    remind      us      that      \"complaints       alleging      employment\n\ndiscrimination need only satisfy 'the simple requirements of Rule\n\n8(a).'\"4    Id. (quoting Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506,\n\n512 (2002)).         Although they have correctly stated the applicable\n\nlaw, plaintiffs have completely misapplied the principle to the\n\nfacts of their case.              Swierkiewicz specifically invalidated the\n\nrequirement, formerly recognized in some circuits including this\n\none,5 that plaintiffs plead facts establishing a prima facie case\n\nin order to survive a motion to dismiss.                  Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at\n\n511.     Instead,      Swierkiewicz         requires      only    a    short    and   plain\n\nstatement       to   \"give     the      defendant    fair    notice       of    what    the\n\nplaintiff's      claim    is      and    the    grounds    upon       which    it   rests.\"\n\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).                        Id. at 512.\n\n            Plaintiffs allege that the district court applied the\n\nheightened pleading standard in two separate instances.                               First,\n\nwhen it granted summary judgment for Agosto because Peña had failed\n\nto allege any material fact showing \"deliberate indifference,\" an\n\nelement of \"supervisory liability.\"                  Brief for Appellants at 21.\n\nSecond, when the district court found that Agosto was protected\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Rule 8(a) requires only that a pleading should entail \"a short\nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\nentitled to relief\". Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).\n5\n   Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 15 (1st Cir.\n1989).\n\n                                            -8-\n\funder the doctrine of qualified immunity because his actions with\n\nregard to Vélez were \"objectively reasonable.\"\n\n          We see no evidence that the heightened pleading standard\n\nwas applied.     Under the overruled standard, the district court\n\nwould have required heightened specificity at the pleading stage,\n\nwhich did not occur in this case.      By contrast, the district court\n\ncorrectly applied the appropriate standard of review to defendants'\n\nsummary judgment motion when it found no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact.   The court's analysis of supervisory liability and\n\nqualified immunity relied upon the appropriate standards because,\n\nalthough specificity is not required at the pleading stage, it is\n\nrequired at the summary judgment stage.     Swierkiewicz specifically\n\ndistinguished the two doctrines, explaining that \"[t]his simplified\n\nnotice pleading standard relies on liberal discovery rules and\n\nsummary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to\n\ndispose of unmeritorious claims.\"      Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 512.\n\nIn other words, notice pleading is sufficient for a claim to\n\nsurvive a motion to dismiss, but plaintiffs bear a heavier burden\n\nat the summary judgment stage.\n\n                                 B.\n\n          The second issue before us is whether there is a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to defendants' liability under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 that would make a grant of summary judgment inappropriate in\n\nthis case.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          Plaintiffs    bring   this     action   pursuant   to   42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, alleging unlawful political discrimination resulting in\n\nloss of employment, in violation of their First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights.     In order to establish liability under § 1983,\n\nplaintiffs \"must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1)\n\nthe challenged conduct was attributable to a person acting under\n\ncolor of state law; and (2) the conduct deprived the plaintiff of\n\nrights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"\n\nJohnson v. Mahoney, 424 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                       Political Discrimination\n\n          Both     plaintiffs   allege    political      discrimination   in\n\nviolation of their First Amendment rights.          It is axiomatic that\n\n\"the First Amendment protects 'non-policymaking' public employees\n\nfrom   adverse    employment    actions     based   on    their   political\n\naffiliation or opinion.\" González-Piña v. Rodríguez, 407 F.3d 425,\n\n431 (1st Cir. 2005).      Under Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977), allegations of political\n\ndiscrimination in employment are judged according to a burden-\n\nshifting regime.    Plaintiffs bear the initial burden to show that\n\n\"political discrimination was the substantial or motivating factor\n\nin a defendant's employment decision.\"        Cepero-Rivera v. Fagundo,\n\n414 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal citation and quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     Defendants then must demonstrate that (i) they\n\nwould have taken the same action in any event; and (ii) they would\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fhave taken such action for reasons that are not unconstitutional.\n\nSee Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 286-87.\n\n           Vélez asserts that defendants were \"well aware\" of her\n\naffiliation with NPP.          Vélez-Rivera, 334 F. Supp. 2d at 83.                   She\n\nmaintains that she was qualified for her promotion, that her\n\nperformance as Deputy Director of Human Resources was at all times\n\n\"exemplary,\"     and    that    she   was    never     given        a    satisfactory\n\nexplanation for the prolongation of her probation. Id. She claims\n\nfurther   that   defendant      Jiménez     warned    her    that       she   would   be\n\ndismissed because of her NPP affiliation.              Id. at 91.        However, she\n\nacknowledged     in    her   deposition     that     she    never       mentioned     her\n\npolitical beliefs to anyone at GDB, and that she did not know how\n\nanyone at GDB had become aware of them. Nevertheless, she inferred\n\nsuch knowledge because of a general feeling that she was treated\n\n\"differently\" by co-workers.          Id. at 84.       She also admitted that\n\nshe had no knowledge of any organization of pro-NPP GDB employees.\n\nId.\n\n           Drawing all inferences for Vélez, we do not find the\n\nfacts to weigh heavily in her favor. Nevertheless, we assume,\n\narguendo, that she has made a prima facie case for political\n\ndiscrimination in order to consider defendants' explanation for her\n\ntermination within the Mt. Healthy framework.\n\n           Defendants maintain that they would have reached the same\n\ndecision to terminate Vélez absent any political discrimination\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fbecause she was unqualified for her promotion.                       The formal job\n\nannouncement       for    Deputy    Director      of     Human   Resources,      posted\n\nAugust 9, 2000, required that applicants possess a masters degree\n\nand   at    least        five   years'      experience      in     human   resources\n\nadministration, two of which must have been supervisory, and one of\n\nwhich must have pertained to \"personnel transactions.\"                           Vélez-\n\nRivera, 334 F. Supp. 2d at 84.             Vélez maintains that she was judged\n\nqualified    for    her     promotion      by    the   GDB's     Classification     and\n\nCompensation Specialist in 2000.                  Id. at 89.         However, after\n\ncareful examination of her employment history, the district court\n\nfound that Vélez did not meet the minimum requirements.                       Vélez's\n\nemployment     history      reflects       that    the    majority    of   her     work\n\nexperience    was    in     the    field    of    labor    relations,      not    human\n\nresources.    Vélez does not dispute defendants' claim that the two\n\nfields are categorically different and entail different activities.\n\nAt the time of her promotion, her relevant qualifications for her\n\npromotion included only the following: one year, five months, and\n\n27 days as a human resources administrator at the Puerto Rican\n\nAssociation for the Well-Being of the Family; and an additional\n\neight months in the field of human resources as Director of\n\nAdministration at the Office of the Governor, where she served in\n\na supervisory capacity.            Id. at 84-85.       The district judge found,\n\nand Vélez does not dispute, that she had no other experience\n\nrelevant to the formal requirements of the position of Deputy\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fDirector of Human Resources at GDB. By our calculations, her years\n\nspent in the field of human resources amount to less than half of\n\nwhat was required by the formal job announcement for her position.\n\n            After   defendants   have    put   forth   a    nondiscriminatory\n\njustification for the challenged action, \"the plaintiff[s] may\n\ndiscredit    the     proffered    nondiscriminatory          reason,   either\n\ncircumstantially or directly\".          Padilla-García v. José Guillermo\n\nRodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir. 2000).                Accordingly, Vélez\n\nalleges that the district court failed to address \"the facts that\n\ndiscredit the defendants' proffered nondiscriminatory reason\" for\n\nterminating her.      From her perspective, those facts include the\n\nstatement by defendant Jiménez to Vélez that she would \"soon be\n\ndismissed because she was an NPP member\" and the GDB Classification\n\nand   Compensation     Specialist's      classification        of   Vélez   as\n\n\"qualified\" at the time of her promotion.         Only the first of these\n\nwarrants discussion.     Despite the fact that Jiménez presided over\n\nVélez's informal hearing, she was not the decisionmaker with regard\n\nto Vélez's employment. Jiménez's employment at GDB began five days\n\nafter Vélez was first notified of her impending dismissal, and\n\nregardless of any comments she might have made, the district court\n\nfound no evidence that Jiménez exercised any influence whatsoever\n\nover Vélez's dismissal.     Vélez-Rivera,       334 F. Supp. 2d at 91-92.\n\n            The second prong of a successful Mt. Healthy defense\n\nrequires an additional showing -- that defendants \"would have\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\freached the same decision\" as to her termination even \"in the\n\nabsence of the protected conduct.\"           Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.\n\n           In Sánchez-López, we held that even if an employment\n\naction was illegal, the second prong of Mt. Healthy was only\n\nsatisfied \"[i]f defendants demonstrated that they in fact have a\n\npractice of taking corrective action against all employees [whose\n\nappointments violate Puerto Rico law] or could otherwise show that\n\nthey would have taken the corrective action anyway.\"               375 F.3d at\n\n131.\n\n           However, recently in Cepero-Rivera, we found both prongs\n\nof the Mt. Healthy defense to be satisfied where an employee of the\n\nPuerto    Rican   Highway        Authority     (PRHA)    alleged       political\n\ndiscrimination      and     defendants         offered     the      legitimate\n\nnondiscriminatory    explanation      that     the   employee    had    violated\n\ncertain PRHA regulations.        414 F.3d at 132-33.       It was clear that\n\ndefendants would have reached the same decision in the absence of\n\ndiscrimination because under the circumstances, \"it is difficult to\n\nsee how a supervisor . . . could have done anything less\" than\n\norder an investigation leading to his termination. Id. at 133.\n\n           Similarly, in Texas v. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18 (1999), the\n\nSupreme   Court   held    that    defendants    were    entitled   to    summary\n\njudgment where a student alleged a discriminatory basis for the\n\ndenial of his admission to a graduate program and defendants put\n\nforth a defense, under Mt. Healthy, that his grades, test scores,\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fand recommendations were not as strong as those of successful\n\napplicants. Id. at 19. Sánchez-López distinguishes Lesage because\n\nthere, \"it was undisputed that the plaintiff did not otherwise meet\n\nthe admission criteria.\"   Sánchez-López, 375 F.3d at 132.\n\n          The facts in this case are similarly clear-cut, placing\n\nVélez squarely in Lesage and Cepero-Rivera territory.        It is\n\nundisputed that Vélez was dramatically underqualified for her\n\npromotion. It is undisputed that Caballero was hired to assess the\n\nlegality of all personnel transactions that occurred between July 1\n\nand December 31, 2000.     Plaintiffs characterize this audit as\n\n\"selective\" because they claim that each of the relevant employment\n\nactions involved NPP members, but this allegation is entirely\n\nunsupported and it is, in any event, of no moment.   Even if all of\n\nthe personnel actions during the relevant period involved NPP\n\nmembers, official review of such employment decisions does not\n\nsupport a claim of discrimination.    As we have observed,\n\n          [i]f uniformly applied personnel practices,\n          predicated on legitimate reasons, result in\n          terminations, those terminations are not\n          unconstitutional because those affiliated with\n          one political party are disproportionately\n          impacted. It is in the nature of a change in\n          administrations that job actions by the new\n          party in power will have a disparate impact on\n          members of the outgoing party.\n\nId. at 140.   We conclude that defendants have discharged their\n\nburden under the second prong of Mt. Healthy by demonstrating that\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fthey would have reached the same conclusion with regard to her\n\nemployment in the absence of discrimination.\n\n           Defendants have mounted a successful Mt. Healthy defense\n\nwith regard to Vélez and we affirm the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment with regard to her First Amendment claim.\n\n           Plaintiff   Peña   also   alleges    politically-motivated\n\nemployment termination in violation of his First Amendment rights.\n\nSpecifically, he claims that his employment service contract was\n\nprematurely terminated because of his political affiliation with\n\nthe NPP.    Peña claims that defendants knew of his political\n\naffiliation in part because he was the leader of an association of\n\nNPP-affiliated GDB employees. Vélez-Rivera, 334 F. Supp. 2d at 86.\n\nHe claims that he was given no explanation for the cancellation of\n\nhis contract and that such cancellation was arbitrary because his\n\nservice orders had been renewed four times previously.       Id.   He\n\nalso alleges that GDB Executive Vice President José V. Pagán\n\npublicly and privately stated that all service order contracts with\n\nNPP members would be cancelled.        Id.   Finally, he claims that\n\nsubsequent to his termination, he was \"replaced\" by two PDP members\n\nwho now perform substantially the same tasks that he performed\n\nwhile employed by the GDB.    Brief for Appellants at 10.\n\n           The district court found, and Peña does not disagree,\n\nthat several of Peña's allegations are unsubstantiated by the\n\nevidence on record.    Peña stated in his deposition that he never\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fdirectly heard Pagán say anything about cancelling contracts with\n\nNPP members, but rather he admits that he \"heard a 'rumor' from his\n\nsupervisor, who supposedly heard it from someone else.\"                           Id.\n\nSimilarly, although Peña claims to have been a leader of NPP\n\nmembers at GDB, his deposition reflects that he does not know which\n\nemployees are members or what the group's activities might be. Id.\n\nFinally, Peña has provided no support for his allegation that two\n\nPDP-affiliated individuals replaced him at GDB.\n\n            In our review of a grant of summary judgment, \"we do not\n\nconsider    conclusory      allegations,         improbable         inferences,     and\n\nunsupported speculation.\" Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters,\n\nLocal Union No. 25, 426 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal\n\ncitation    and    quotation     marks    omitted).          Peña    has   failed    to\n\nchallenge the district court's analysis and characterization of the\n\nevidence regarding his allegations of political discrimination, and\n\nhe   has   not    demonstrated    that     political     discrimination        was      a\n\nsubstantial       or   motivating    factor       in   his    premature     contract\n\ntermination.      We do not find his allegations to be persuasive, and\n\nthus we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment with\n\nregard to Peña's First Amendment claim.\n\n                                    Due Process\n\n            Both plaintiffs also allege the deprivation of their\n\nproperty interests in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment\n\nrights to the due process of law.               The threshold question we must\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\ffirst address is whether each had a property interest in their\n\nemployment. We have held that while the process \"due\" a government\n\nemployee is determined by federal law, the preliminary inquiry as\n\nto the existence of a property interest is determined by state or\n\ncommonwealth law.         Rivera-Flores v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 64 F.3d\n\n742, 750 (1st Cir. 1995).               To determine whether an employment\n\ninterest is a property interest in Puerto Rico, we normally first\n\nask whether the position in question is a \"trust position\"6 or a\n\n\"career position.\"          Career positions are considered permanent and\n\nthus \"career employees have a property interest in their continued\n\nemployment.\"     González-De-Blasini v. Family Dept., 377 F.3d 81, 86\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).          By contrast, Puerto Rico law establishes that\n\ntrust employees \"shall be of free selection and removal,\" i.e.,\n\nremovable with or without cause.           3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350; see also\n\nLaureano-Agosto v. García-Caraballo, 731 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n            Defendants       do   not    suggest    that    Vélez   was    a   trust\n\nemployee. Rather, they contend -- and the district court agreed --\n\nthat   because      she   was   promoted   in   violation     of    GDB   personnel\n\npolicies,     she     had    no   reasonable       expectation      of    continued\n\nemployment.      We have previously held that \"under Puerto Rico law\n\nany property right associated with a career position is rendered\n\n\n\n6\n    \"Trust positions\"           are   sometimes    also    called   \"confidential\npositions.\"\n\n                                         -18-\n\fnull and void if a violation of the Personnel Act attends the\n\nfilling of such a position.\"            Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 841\n\nF.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir. 1988).              The district judge found that GDB\n\nemployment regulations are subject to the Puerto Rico Personnel\n\nAct, and that therefore a violation of GDB personnel policies\n\nconstitutes a violation of the Puerto Rico Personnel Act.                     Vélez-\n\nRivera, 334 F. Supp. 2d at 89.                     Vélez does not challenge this\n\nfinding, and we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment as to her Fourteenth Amendment claim.\n\n            Peña also alleges a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment\n\nright to due process.         The parties do not dispute that his contract\n\nwas terminated prematurely.                However, we have long distinguished\n\nbetween    garden-variety          contract         breach   and   those    property\n\ndeprivations that rise to the Constitutional level. Redondo-Borges\n\nv. U.S. Dept. of Hous. and Urban Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); Jiménez v. Almodóvar, 650 F.2d 363, 370 (1st Cir. 1981)\n\n(\"mere breach of contractual right is not a deprivation of property\n\nwithout constitutional due process of law . . . . Otherwise,\n\nvirtually every controversy involving an alleged breach of contract\n\nby   a   government    or     a   governmental        institution   or     agency   or\n\ninstrumentality       would       be   a    constitutional     case.\")     (internal\n\ncitation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The district court held that because Peña has not made a\n\ncolorable claim for political discrimination, the termination of\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fhis contract was a garden-variety contract breach \"for which Puerto\n\nRico law provides a sufficient and adequate remedy.\" Vélez-Rivera,\n\n334 F. Supp. 2d at 89.           We disagree with the district court's\n\nanalysis on this point, but we are in agreement as to the result.\n\n               There can be no doubt that \"[u]nder the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, a state is prohibited from discharging a public employee\n\nwho possesses a property interest in continued employment without\n\ndue process of law.\"          Santana v. Calderón, 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).       We have held that a contractual agreement can give\n\nrise to a property interest.           Id. at 24 (\"A legitimate expectation\n\nof continued employment may derive from a statute, a contract\n\nprovision, or an officially sanctioned rule of the workplace.\").\n\nThus, the relevant question is whether Peña's contract did in fact\n\ncreate such a protected interest.\n\n               Peña's fixed term contract was set to expire on June 20,\n\n2001.    He received notice of termination on February 9, 2001.                   At\n\nthat    time    he   was    contractually      entitled     to   more   than    five\n\nadditional months of employment.             In Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S.\n\n593 (1972), the Supreme Court held that an interest in a benefit is\n\na property interest \"if there are such rules or mutually explicit\n\nunderstandings       that   support    his     claim   of   entitlement    to   the\n\nbenefit.\"       Id. at 601.     At least one of our sister circuits has\n\nfound   a   legitimate      interest    in     continued    employment    where    a\n\ncontract provides for a fixed term of employment services. See San\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fBernardino Physicians' Servs. Med. Group, Inc. v. County of San\n\nBernardino,         825   F.2d   1404,    1408     (9th   Cir.    1987).         Property\n\ninterests are not created by the Constitution, but rather \"they are\n\ncreated and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or\n\nunderstandings that stem from an independent source such as state\n\nlaw.\" Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577\n\n(1972).       We need not reach this issue, because even if Peña did\n\nhave a property interest in his employment for the remaining five\n\nmonths       on     his   contract,    his    claim   fails      as    to   the    second\n\nrequirement for a prima facie case under § 1983 -- that his rights\n\nwere violated by state officials acting under color of state law.\n\nCamilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                  It is well-established that \"only those individuals who\n\nparticipated in the conduct that deprived the plaintiff of his\n\nrights can be held liable.\"              Cepero-Rivera, 414 F.3d at 129.                Peña\n\nclaims       that    Agosto    canceled      his   contract.          However,     in    his\n\ndeposition, Peña admitted that the letter terminating his contract\n\nwas not signed by Agosto.             The letter was in fact signed by Amaury\n\nDíaz, Finance Director of GDB.               Peña has not alleged any facts to\n\nsubstantiate his claim that Agosto was directly involved with his\n\ncontract termination.            Thus, Agosto could only be liable to Peña\n\nunder    a    theory      of   supervisory     liability.        In     §   1983   cases,\n\n\"supervisors are not automatically liable for the misconduct of\n\nthose under their command. A plaintiff must show an affirmative\n\n\n                                           -21-\n\flink between the subordinate officer and the supervisor, whether\n\nthrough direct participation or through conduct that amounts to\n\ncondonation or tacit authorization.\"     Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d\n\n124, 132 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal citation and quotation marks\n\nomitted).   In this case, Peña has failed to allege any link between\n\nAgosto and whoever canceled his contract, whether Díaz or another,\n\nunnamed individual.\n\n             Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment as to Peña's claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                 III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment as to all claims brought under § 1983 by\n\nboth Vélez and Peña.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f",

Summary judgment is properly granted if the movant can demonstrate that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In the summary judgment context, we have construed \"genuine\" to mean \"that the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party\" <i>United States v.

This claim is meritless. Plaintiffs rely on our opinion in <i>Gorski v. New Hampshire Dep't of Corrections,</i> 290 F.3d 466, 473 (1st Cir.2002), to remind us that \"complaints alleging employment discrimination need only satisfy `the simple requirements of Rule 8(a).'\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002)). Although they have correctly stated the applicable law, plaintiffs have completely misapplied the principle to the facts of their case. <i>Swierkiewicz</i> specifically invalidated the requirement, formerly recognized in some circuits including this one,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that plaintiffs plead facts establishing a prima facie case in order to survive a motion to dismiss. <i>Swierkiewicz,</i> 534 U.S. at 511, 122 S.Ct. 992. Instead, <i>Swierkiewicz</i> requires only a short and plain statement to \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). <i>Id.</i> at 512, 122 S.Ct. 992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs allege that the district court applied the heightened pleading standard in two separate instances. First, when it granted summary judgment for Agosto because Pe&#241;a had failed to allege any material fact showing \"deliberate indifference,\" an element of \"supervisory liability.\" Brief for Appellants at 21. Second, when the district court found that Agosto was protected under the doctrine of qualified immunity because his actions with regard to V&#233;lez were \"objectively reasonable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no evidence that the heightened pleading standard was applied. Under the overruled standard, the district court would have required heightened specificity at the pleading stage, which did not occur in this case. By contrast, the district court correctly applied the appropriate standard of review to defendants' summary judgment motion when it found no genuine issue as to any material fact. The court's analysis of supervisory liability and qualified immunity relied upon the appropriate standards because, although specificity is not required at the pleading stage, it is required at the summary judgment stage. <i>Swierkiewicz</i> specifically distinguished the two doctrines, explaining that \"[t]his simplified notice pleading standard relies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose of unmeritorious claims.\" <i>Swierkiewicz,</i> 534 U.S. at 512, 122 S.Ct. 992. In other words, notice pleading is sufficient for a claim to survive a motion to dismiss, but plaintiffs bear a heavier burden at the summary judgment stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue before us is whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to defendants' liability under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 that would make a grant of summary judgment inappropriate in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging unlawful political discrimination resulting in loss of employment, in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), allegations of political discrimination in employment are judged according to a burden-shifting regime. Plaintiffs bear the initial burden to show that \"political discrimination was the substantial or motivating factor in a defendant's employment decision.\" <i>Cepero-Rivera v. Fagundo,</i> 414 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir.2005) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Defendants then must demonstrate that (i) they would have taken the same action in any event; and (ii) they would have taken such action for reasons that are not unconstitutional. <i>See Mt.

She maintains that she was qualified for her promotion, that her performance as Deputy Director of Human Resources was at all times \"exemplary,\" and that she was never given a satisfactory explanation for the prolongation of her probation. <i>Id.</i> She claims further that defendant Jim&#233;nez warned her that she would be dismissed because of her NPP affiliation. <i>Id.</i> at 91. However, she acknowledged in her deposition that she never mentioned her political beliefs to anyone at GDB, and that she did not know how anyone at GDB had become aware of them. Nevertheless, she inferred such knowledge because of a general feeling that she was treated \"differently\" by co-workers. <i>Id.</i> at 84.

The formal job announcement for Deputy Director of Human Resources, posted August 9, 2000, required that applicants possess a masters degree and at least five years' experience in human resources administration, two of which must have been supervisory, and one of which must have pertained to \"personnel transactions.\" <i>V&#233;lez-Rivera,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d at 84. V&#233;lez maintains that she was judged qualified for her promotion by the GDB's Classification and Compensation Specialist in 2000. <i>Id.</i> at 89. However, after careful examination of her employment history, the district court found that V&#233;lez did not meet the minimum requirements. V&#233;lez's employment history reflects that the majority of her work experience was in the field of labor relations, not human resources. V&#233;lez does not dispute defendants' claim that the two fields are categorically different and entail different activities. At the time of her promotion, her relevant qualifications for her promotion included only the following: one year, five months, and 27 days as a human resources administrator at the Puerto Rican Association for the Well-Being of the Family; and an additional eight months in the field of human resources as Director of Administration at the Office of the Governor, where she served in a supervisory capacity. <i>Id.</i> at 84-85. The district judge found, and V&#233;lez does not dispute, that she had no other experience relevant to the formal requirements of the position of Deputy Director of Human Resources at GDB. By our calculations, her years spent in the field of human resources amount to less than half of what was required by the formal job announcement for her position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After defendants have put forth a nondiscriminatory justification for the challenged action, \"the plaintiff[s] may discredit the proffered nondiscriminatory reason, either circumstantially or directly\". <i>Padilla-Garc&#237;a v. Jos&#233; Guillermo Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 77 (1st Cir.2000). Accordingly, V&#233;lez alleges that the district court failed to address \"the facts that discredit the defendants' proffered nondiscriminatory reason\" for terminating her. From her perspective, those facts include the statement by defendant Jim&#233;nez to V&#233;lez that she would \"soon be dismissed because she was an NPP member\" and the GDB Classification and Compensation Specialist's classification of V&#233;lez as \"qualified\" at the time of her promotion. Only the first of these warrants discussion. Despite the fact that Jim&#233;nez presided over V&#233;lez's informal hearing, she was not the decisionmaker with regard to V&#233;lez's employment. Jim&#233;nez's employment at GDB began five days <i>after</i> V&#233;lez was first notified of her impending dismissal, and regardless of any comments she might have made, the district court found no evidence that Jim&#233;nez exercised any influence whatsoever over V&#233;lez's dismissal. <i>V&#233;lez Rivera,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d at 91-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of a successful <i>Mt.

It was clear that defendants would have reached the same decision in the absence of discrimination because under the circumstances, \"it is difficult to see how a supervisor . . . could have done anything less\" than order an investigation leading to his termination. <i>Id.</i> at 133.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in <i>Texas v. Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. 18, 120 S.Ct. 467, 145 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999), the Supreme Court held that defendants were entitled to summary judgment where a student alleged a discriminatory basis for the denial of his admission to a graduate program and defendants put forth a defense, under <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> that his grades, test scores, and recommendations were not as strong as those of successful applicants. <i>Id.</i> at 19. <i>S&#225;nchez L&#243;pez</i> distinguishes <i>Lesage</i> because there, \"it was undisputed that the plaintiff did not otherwise meet the admission criteria.\" <i>S&#225;nchez L&#243;pez,</i> 375 F.3d at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in this case are similarly clear-cut, placing V&#233;lez squarely in <i>Lesage</i> and <i>Cepero-Rivera</i> territory. It is undisputed that V&#233;lez was dramatically underqualified for her promotion. It is undisputed that Caballero was hired to assess the legality of <i>all</i> personnel transactions that occurred between July 1 and December 31, 2000. Plaintiffs characterize this audit as \"selective\" because they claim that each of the relevant employment actions involved NPP members, but this allegation is entirely unsupported and it is, in any event, of no moment. Even if all of the personnel actions during the relevant period involved NPP members, official review of such employment decisions does not support a claim of discrimination.

Specifically, he claims that his employment service contract was prematurely terminated because of his political affiliation with the NPP. Pe&#241;a claims that defendants knew of his political affiliation in part because he was the leader of an association of NPP-affiliated GDB employees. <i>V&#233;lez Rivera,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d at 86. He claims that he was given no explanation for the cancellation of his contract and that such cancellation was arbitrary because his service orders had been renewed four times previously. <i>Id.</i> He also alleges that GDB Executive Vice President Jos&#233; V. Pag&#225;n publicly and privately stated that all service order contracts with NPP members would be cancelled. <i>Id.</i> Finally, he claims that subsequent to his termination, he was \"replaced\" by two PDP members who now perform substantially the same tasks that he performed while employed by the GDB.

Pe&#241;a stated in his deposition that he never directly heard Pag&#225;n say anything about cancelling contracts with NPP members, but rather he admits that he \"heard a `rumor' from his supervisor, who supposedly heard it from someone else.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, although Pe&#241;a claims to have been a leader of NPP members at GDB, his deposition reflects that he does not know which employees are members or what the group's activities might be. <i>Id.</i> Finally, Pe&#241;a has provided no support for his allegation that two PDP-affiliated individuals replaced him at GDB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our review of a grant of summary judgment, \"we do not consider conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\" <i>Emmanuel v.

Pe&#241;a has failed to challenge the district court's analysis and characterization of the evidence regarding his allegations of political discrimination, and he has not demonstrated that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in his premature contract termination.

The threshold question we must first address is whether each had a property interest in their employment. We have held that while the process \"due\" a government employee is determined by federal law, the preliminary inquiry as to the existence of a property interest is determined by state or commonwealth law. <i>Rivera-Flores v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co.,</i> 64 F.3d 742, 750 (1st Cir.1995). To determine whether an employment interest is a property interest in Puerto Rico, we normally first ask whether the position in question is a \"trust position\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> or a \"career position.\" Career positions are considered permanent and thus \"career employees have a property interest in their continued employment.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 86 (1st Cir.2004). By contrast, Puerto Rico law establishes that trust employees \"shall be of free selection and removal,\" i.e., removable with or without cause. 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1350; <i>see also Laureano-Agosto v. Garc&#237;a-Caraballo,</i> 731 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants do not suggest that V&#233;lez was a trust employee. Rather, they contend &#8212; and the district court agreed &#8212; that because she was promoted in violation of GDB personnel policies, she had no reasonable expectation of continued employment. We have previously held that \"under Puerto Rico law any property right associated with a career position is rendered null and void if a violation of the Personnel Act attends the filling of such a position.\" <i>Kauffman v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir.1988). The district judge found that GDB employment regulations are subject to the Puerto Rico Personnel Act, and that therefore a violation of GDB personnel policies constitutes a violation of the Puerto Rico Personnel Act. <i>V&#233;lez Rivera,</i> 334 F.Supp.2d at 89.

The parties do not dispute that his contract was terminated prematurely. However, we have long distinguished between garden-variety contract breach and those property deprivations that rise to the Constitutional level. <i>Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dept. of Hous. and Urban Dev.,</i> 421 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Jim&#233;nez v.

We have held that a contractual agreement <i>can</i> give rise to a property interest. <i>Id.</i> at 24 (\"A legitimate expectation of continued employment may derive from a statute, a contract provision, or an officially sanctioned rule of the workplace.\"). Thus, the relevant question is whether Pe&#241;a's contract <i>did</i> in fact create such a protected interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pe&#241;a's fixed term contract was set to expire on June 20, 2001. He received notice of termination on February 9, 2001. At that time he was contractually entitled to more than five additional months of employment. In <i>Perry v. Sindermann,</i> 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), the Supreme Court held that an interest in a benefit is a property interest \"if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit.\" <i>Id.</i> at 601. At least one of our sister circuits has found a legitimate interest in continued employment where a contract provides for a fixed term of employment services. <i>See San Bernardino Physicians' Servs. Med. Group, Inc. v. County of San Bernardino,</i> 825 F.2d 1404, 1408 (9th Cir.1987). Property interests are not created by the Constitution, but rather \"they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). We need not reach this issue, because even if Pe&#241;a did have a property interest in his employment for the remaining five months on his contract, his claim fails as to the second requirement for a prima facie case under &#167; 1983 &#8212; that his rights were violated by state officials acting under color of state law. <i>Camilo-Robles v. Zapata,</i> 175 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that \"only those individuals who participated in the conduct that deprived the plaintiff of his rights can be held liable.\" <i>Cepero-Rivera,</i> 414 F.3d at 129. Pe&#241;a claims that Agosto canceled his contract. However, in his deposition, Pe&#241;a admitted that the letter terminating his contract was not signed by Agosto. The letter was in fact signed by Amaury D&#237;az, Finance Director of GDB. Pe&#241;a has not alleged any facts to substantiate his claim that Agosto was directly involved with his contract termination. Thus, Agosto could only be liable to Pe&#241;a under a theory of supervisory liability. In &#167; 1983 cases, \"supervisors are not automatically liable for the misconduct of those under their command.

Under the overruled standard, the district court would have required heightened specificity at the pleading stage, which did not occur in this case. By contrast, the district court correctly applied the appropriate standard of review to defendants' summary judgment motion when it found no genuine issue as to any material fact. The court's analysis of supervisory liability and qualified immunity relied upon the appropriate standards because, although specificity is not required at the pleading stage, it is required at the summary judgment stage. <i>Swierkiewicz</i> specifically distinguished the two doctrines, explaining that \"[t]his simplified notice pleading standard relies on liberal discovery rules and summary judgment motions to define disputed facts and issues and to dispose of unmeritorious claims.\" <i>Swierkiewicz,</i> 534 U.S. at 512, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district judge found, and V&#233;lez does not dispute, that she had no other experience relevant to the formal requirements of the position of Deputy Director of Human Resources at GDB.

Only the first of these warrants discussion. Despite the fact that Jim&#233;nez presided over V&#233;lez's informal hearing, she was not the decisionmaker with regard to V&#233;lez's employment.

To determine whether an employment interest is a property interest in Puerto Rico, we normally first ask whether the position in question is a \"trust position\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> or a \"career position.\" Career positions are considered permanent and thus \"career employees have a property interest in their continued employment.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-De-Blasini v.
