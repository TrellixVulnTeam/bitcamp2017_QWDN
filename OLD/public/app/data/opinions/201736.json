We have substituted him for John Ashcroft,\nprevious holder of that office, as the respondent. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f               Per Curiam.        Pro se petitioner Xu Yang (\"Yang\") seeks\n\nreview    of     a    final   order     of   removal      issued    by    the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which affirmed, without opinion, the\n\ndecision       of      the    Immigration         Judge    (\"IJ\")    denying       Yang's\n\napplications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\nunder the Convention against Torture.                      Yang's only argument on\n\nappeal is that the IJ erred in finding him not credible.                        The main\n\nreason     the       IJ    discounted    Yang's      testimony      was     because     of\n\ndiscrepancies, which the IJ recounted, between Yang's testimony at\n\nthe hearing and his affidavit in support of his application for\n\nasylum.    We have examined the record and find substantial evidence\n\nto   support         the   IJ's   finding    of    discrepancies         between   Yang's\n\ntestimony and affidavit.              These discrepancies are significant and\n\nmajor, relating to dates and events that go to the heart of Yang's\n\nasylum claim.          They amply support the IJ's determination that Yang\n\nwas not a credible witness.              See Bojorques-Villanueva v. INS, 194\n\nF.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1999) (upholding adverse credibility finding\n\nbased on multiple inconsistencies going to central facts of claim).\n\n               The BIA's order is affirmed.               The petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f",
