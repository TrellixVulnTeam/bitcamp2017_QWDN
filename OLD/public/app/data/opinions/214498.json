Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                 Torruella, Lipez, and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Harry Anduze Montaño, with whom José Morales Boscio and Harry\nAnduze Montaño Law Office were on brief, for appellant.\n     John Fitzpatrick Vannucci, with whom the Law Office of John\nFitzpatrick Vannucci was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 12, 2011\n\f           THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.    This is a diversity-based\n\npersonal-injury case.    A jury returned a $450,000 verdict for\n\nPaloma Rodríguez against Señor Frog's de la Isla, Inc. (\"Señor\n\nFrog,\" for short) in Puerto Rico's federal district court.     Señor\n\nFrog now appeals, challenging nearly every aspect of the district\n\njudge's performance.    Unable to find any reversible error in the\n\njudge's actions, we affirm.\n\n                         How It All Began1\n\n           San Juan, Puerto Rico, early in the pre-dawn morning of\n\nDecember 5, 2004.   Cruising in her Mazda 323 on the Muñoz Rivera\n\nExpressway, 21-year-old Rodríguez hit a pothole – a collision that\n\ncost her two tires and killed the engine.    But the worst was yet to\n\ncome.\n\n           Turning her hazards on, Rodríguez somehow got her car to\n\nthe side of the road, completely out of the way of oncoming\n\ntraffic.   A police officer patrolling that stretch of highway\n\nspotted her and pulled over. He left the cruiser's flashing lights\n\non.   A tow-truck driver also showed up, parked his truck in front\n\nof Rodríguez's car, activated the truck's flashing lights, pointed\n\na spotlight on the work area, and put out cones to caution drivers\n\npassing by.   As the truck driver lowered the truck's platform,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       We narrate the facts in the light most favorable to the\njury's verdict. See, e.g., Bielunas v. F/V Misty Dawn, Inc., 621\nF.3d 72, 74 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                                -2-\n\fRodríguez got back into the Mazda either to grab some personal\n\nitems or to do something to help out with the towing process.\n\n           That is when Carlos Estrada closed in, speeding in a\n\nMitsubishi Mirage registered to Señor Frog.     His headlights were\n\noff.   He had a blood-alcohol level nearly double the legal limit in\n\nPuerto Rico.   And he smashed that Mitsubishi right into the rear of\n\nRodríguez's Mazda.    Rodríguez was hurt, and apparently hurt badly.\n\n\"She was thrown inside the vehicle,\" the officer later said.\n\nCovered in blood, she had no vital signs – \"she appeared to be\n\ndead.\"   But she survived and sued Señor Frog in district court\n\nunder diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332, alleging\n\nnegligence and negligent entrustment.     She sued other defendants\n\ntoo (including Estrada), but they were later dismissed for reasons\n\nthat are not important here, so we skip them.\n\n                     The Twists And Turns Of Trial\n\n           We fast-forward to the trial, where hard-charging counsel\n\npulled out all the stops.    For starters, Rodríguez's lawyer moved\n\nin limine to prevent Señor Frog from showing or arguing that\n\nEstrada had owned the Mitsubishi or that Rodríguez had drunk a beer\n\nor two hours before the crash.    The judge granted the motion.\n\n           Also, Rodríguez's counsel told the jurors during his\n\nopening statement that the evidence would compel them to return a\n\n$450,000 verdict in his client's favor.    Señor Frog's lawyer asked\n\nfor a mistrial but instead got a cautionary instruction telling\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjurors that they (not the lawyers) would decide the damage amount\n\ndue Rodríguez (if any).\n\n           The attorneys later sparred over whether the parties were\n\nof   diverse   citizenship,   and    the    judge   ruled    that    they   were,\n\nfollowing an evidentiary hearing convened after Rodríguez had\n\nrested her case.      They also battled over the jury instructions.\n\nAnd the judge seemingly sided with Rodríguez when she apparently\n\nrefused to instruct the jurors on contributory or comparative\n\nnegligence.      We hedge with \"seemingly\" and \"apparently\" because\n\nSeñor Frog failed to give us a transcript of the judge's final\n\ncharge – a misstep that affects our analysis in several respects,\n\nas we discuss later in more detail.\n\n           The fighting spilled over into closing arguments too.\n\nRodríguez's counsel said that his client sought damages for lost\n\nwages, which he conceded were not much, given that she was a\n\ncollege   student/waitress    when     injured.        But   she    also    sought\n\ncompensation for pain and suffering, which he put at \"six figures.\"\n\nSeñor   Frog's    lawyer   objected,       and   the   judge   sustained      the\n\nobjection.     But she declined to tell the jury right then and there\n\nto disregard the value comment.        \"I will instruct the jury at the\n\nend,\" she said, though we do not know if she did because, again,\n\nthe record on appeal contains no transcript of the final charge.\n\nRodríguez's attorney then mentioned a process that the jury could\n\nuse to fix damages:    her pain was worth \"$9.00 a day,\" he said, and\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fshe should live \"55 more years,\" so she should get over $178,000.\n\nThe judge sustained an objection to this statement, adding that the\n\n\"jury   will    be    able       to   evaluate   what   compensation,       if   any,\"\n\nRodríguez is due.           Sparks flew too when Rodríguez's lawyer said\n\nthat    his    client      had    found   herself    under    \"attack\"      at   trial\n\n(objection sustained) and that Estrada had been deported to Mexico\n\nas part of a plea agreement in a criminal case arising from the\n\ncrash (objection overruled).\n\n              Finding Señor Frog liable, the jury awarded Rodríguez\n\n$450,000.      The verdict does not distinguish between the types of\n\ndamages.      But the parties (who agree on little else) concur that\n\nthe bulk of this represented pain and suffering.\n\n              In any event, Señor Frog timely moved for a new trial or\n\nremittitur.          The     new-trial     portion      of   its   motion    blasted\n\nRodríguez's lawyer for his comments during opening or closing\n\nstatements that suggested a specific damage number, accused the\n\ndefense of attacking his client, and noted that authorities had\n\nshipped Estrada back to Mexico pursuant to a plea agreement.                      The\n\nremittitur section called the jury's award grossly excessive.\n\nUltimately, the judge denied the motion in an unexplained order.\n\n              Having set the stage, we turn to the legal issues on\n\nappeal, noting further facts as needed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                   The Diverse-Citizenship Issue\n\n          The   diversity-jurisdiction   statute   empowers   federal\n\ncourts to hear and decide suits between citizens of different\n\nstates, provided the amount in controversy is more than $75,000.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).   Puerto Rico is a state for diversity-\n\njurisdiction purposes.   See id. § 1332(e).    And Señor Frog is a\n\ncitizen of Puerto Rico, see id. § 1332(c)(1), so Rodríguez's suit\n\nis untenable if she was a Puerto Rico citizen when she filed her\n\nDecember 1, 2005 complaint, see, e.g., Hall v. Curran, 599 F.3d 70,\n\n72 (1st Cir. 2010) (per curiam).   Señor Frog argues that she was,\n\nthough it did not press this argument until after Rodríguez had\n\nrested her case.   Cf. generally Valentin v. Hospital Bella Vista,\n\n254 F.3d 358, 362 (1st Cir. 2001) (calling a pre-answer motion to\n\ndismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) the \"proper vehicle for\n\nchallenging a court's subject-matter jurisdiction\").    But after an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the judge deemed Rodríguez a citizen of\n\nCalifornia when she sued, and this conclusion survives clear-error\n\nreview. See, e.g., Padilla-Mangual v. Pavía Hosp., 516 F.3d 29, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (noting that a district judge's determination in\n\nthis area is \"a mixed question of law and fact,\" which we review\n\nunder the \"clearly erroneous\" rubric) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); Cantellops v. Alvaro-Chapel, 234 F.3d 741, 742 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (similar).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          Citizenship   for   diversity   purposes   is   domicile,   and\n\ndomicile is the place where one is present and intends to stay.\n\nSee, e.g., Padilla-Mangual, 516 F.3d at 31 (explaining that \"[a]\n\nperson's domicile is the place where he has his true, fixed home\n\nand principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent,\n\nhe has the intention of returning\") (quoting Rodríguez-Díaz v.\n\nSierra-Martínez, 853 F.2d 1027, 1029 (1st Cir. 1988) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); García Pérez v. Santaella, 364 F.3d 348,\n\n350 (1st Cir. 2004) (similar); see also Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El\n\nComandante, 598 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1979) (adding that we\n\nrequire \"no minimum period of residency\").     As the party invoking\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, Rodríguez had to prove domicile by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., Padilla-Mangual, 516 F.3d\n\nat 31; García Pérez, 364 F.3d at 350 – and she did just that,\n\npresenting enough evidence to show that she was a domiciliary (and\n\nthus a citizen) of California.\n\n          Rodríguez was the only witness at the hearing on the\n\ndiversity issue – Señor Frog called no one.      Rodríguez testified\n\nthat she had moved from Puerto Rico to California in September\n\n2005, roughly three months before she filed this suit.          She was\n\npregnant, and she and her boyfriend Adrian Peralta wanted to start\n\ntheir lives together in the Golden State.        Since they had very\n\nlittle money, the couple lived in a San Francisco Bay area home\n\nowned by Peralta's grandmother.     And by the time she sued Señor\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fFrog, she had fully relocated from Puerto Rico to California:   she\n\nwas physically present in California (with her clothes, books,\n\nfurniture, household items, etc.), had opened up a California bank\n\naccount (she had no money in any Puerto Rico banks), had gotten a\n\nCalifornia driver's license and job, and had hired a California\n\nlawyer to fight on her behalf.   And though she had not registered\n\nto vote in California (actually, she was not registered to vote\n\nanywhere) and did not attend church there, she had settled on\n\nliving in the Golden State permanently.   Cf. Bank One, Texas, N.A.\n\nv. Montle, 964 F.2d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that factors\n\nthat can help an inquiring court determine a party's intent include\n\nwhere the party exercises civil and political rights, pays taxes,\n\nhas real and personal property, has a driver's or other license,\n\nhas bank accounts, has a job or owns a business, attends church,\n\nand has club memberships – for simplicity we call these the \"Bank\n\nOne factors\").\n\n           Post-complaint events cast no doubt on the earnestness of\n\nRodríguez's intent either. See generally García Pérez, 364 F.3d at\n\n351 (holding that, even though they \"are not part of the primary\n\ncalculus,\" post-suit happenings \"may bear on the sincerity of a\n\nprofessed intention to remain\"). Rodríguez told the judge that she\n\ngave birth to a baby boy in California, turned to a California\n\npediatrician to treat him, and put him in a California daycare for\n\na spell.   She also enrolled in three California community college\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcourses and got a cell phone with a California area code (she may\n\nhave acquired the cell phone pre-complaint, but we cannot tell for\n\ncertain).     True,     starting    in   2007,    Rodríguez     spent   several\n\nsemesters at the InterAmerican University in Puerto Rico (she could\n\nget her bachelor's degree faster if she studied there, she said),\n\nand she was still taking classes there at the time of trial.                But\n\nshe made clear that she returned to California whenever school was\n\nnot in session (during winter, spring, and summer breaks, for\n\nexample), and she provided copies of plane tickets to prove that\n\npoint. She also reaffirmed that she intended to live in California\n\nfor the rest of her life (she hoped to land a teaching job there\n\nonce she got her degree).\n\n            Having    the   exclusive    ability       to   assess   Rodríguez's\n\ndemeanor and tone, the district judge was best positioned to\n\nseparate true from false testimony.            See, e.g., Padilla-Mangual,\n\n516 F.3d at 33-34.      The judge found Rodríguez credible, and after\n\ncarefully   canvassing      the   testimony,     she    meticulously    detailed\n\nfindings of fact, which she supported with specific references to\n\nthe evidence.        Because we cannot say that these findings were\n\nclearly erroneous, her ruling that there was diverse citizenship\n\nmust stand.\n\n            Undaunted, Señor Frog insists that the district judge\n\nbotched her ruling in several respects.                For openers, Señor Frog\n\nprotests that Rodríguez did not have enough Bank One factors on her\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fside, given that she had not registered to vote in California and\n\nhad no religious affiliation there.    Also, Rodríguez produced no\n\ndocumentary evidence – no bank statements, driving records, college\n\ntranscripts, etc. – to support key claims, and, given the best-\n\nevidence rule, see Fed. R. Evid. 1002, the judge had no business\n\naccepting her \"self-serving\" comments about her intent to stay in\n\nCalifornia indefinitely.   Searching for a \"gotcha!\" moment, Señor\n\nFrog notes too that Rodríguez said at trial that she \"lived in\n\nMayaguez,\" Puerto Rico, \"all my life\" – testimony it says should\n\nhave caused the judge to dismiss the case for lack of diversity\n\njurisdiction straightaway, without bothering with an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n            We cannot buy into these arguments.   For one thing, a\n\nparty need not check off every Bank One factor to satisfy her\n\nburden, see, e.g., Padilla-Mangual, 516 F.3d at 33, and, in any\n\nevent, Rodríguez checked off more than enough of them – the\n\nCalifornia bank account, driver's license, job, and personal-\n\nproperty location sync up nicely with key Bank One factors.\n\n            For another thing, the district judge did not blindly\n\naccept Rodríguez's statement that she intended to make California\n\nher home.   Rather, the judge sifted the testimony and grounded her\n\nruling in facts that confirmed Rodríguez's intent claim. And Señor\n\nFrog's best-evidence theory changes nothing.   With exceptions not\n\nrelevant here, the best-evidence rule requires a party trying to\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fprove the \"content\" of a written document to introduce the document\n\nitself.    See Fed. R. Evid. 1002.      Think of a will contest where the\n\nwill is not in evidence and            a witness tries to discuss the\n\ndocument's words from memory – that is the sort of situation that\n\nthe rule was designed to address.           See generally United States v.\n\nDiaz-Lopez, 625 F.3d 1198, 1201-02 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting leading\n\ntreatises on the subject).         But that is not our case.         Rodríguez\n\nnever tried to give the exact terms of her California bank account,\n\ndriver's license, or college transcripts.              She simply tried to\n\nprove, through her own direct testimony, certain facts that she had\n\ndirect knowledge of – that she had opened a California bank\n\naccount,    acquired     a    California    license,   and   taken     several\n\nCalifornia community-college courses pre-complaint. Consequently,\n\nthis case falls outside the compass of the best-evidence rule. See\n\nR & R Assocs., Inc. v. Visual Scene, Inc., 726 F.2d 36, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 1984) (commenting that \"[n]o evidentiary rule . . . prohibits\n\na witness from testifying to a fact simply because the fact can be\n\nsupported by written documentation\"); see also Simas v. First\n\nCitizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 51 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v. Grossman, 614 F.2d 295, 298 n.1 (1st Cir. 1980).\n\n            Last but not least, Rodríguez's trial testimony in no way\n\nshort-circuited    her       diverse-citizenship   claim.     Consider    the\n\ncontext.    Thrilled beyond words that his daughter had survived the\n\ncollision, Rodríguez's father hosted a Christmas Day party at his\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fMayaguez home in 2004 – roughly three weeks after Estrada had rear-\n\nended   Rodríguez   and     one    year   before      she    filed    this    action.\n\nRodríguez was deeply depressed, he said, and he thought a small\n\nsoirée with family and friends might lift her spirits.                   At trial,\n\nRodríguez's counsel asked her whether any party-goers had come from\n\nSan Juan (we are not sure why this mattered).                 \"No,\" she replied,\n\n\"I lived in Mayaguez all my life, so most of my friends are from\n\nMayaguez.\" Señor Frog makes much of this language, suggesting that\n\nit proved her California-domicile claim was a lie – so, the\n\nargument goes, the judge should have kicked her case to the curb\n\nwithout   further    ado.         We   think   not.         Again,   diversity    of\n\ncitizenship is determined as of the time of suit.                   See, e.g., Bank\n\nOne, 964 F.2d at 49.       And, fairly read, Rodríguez's testimony went\n\nto her pre-suit living situation, which means that her statement\n\ncould not and did not sabotage diversity jurisdiction.\n\n           That ends this phase of the case.                 Standing by what we\n\nsaid moments ago – that we cannot call the judge's diverse-\n\ncitizenship conclusion clearly wrong – we move, finally, to the\n\nother issues before us.\n\n                           The Evidentiary Issues\n\n           Señor    Frog    criticizes     the     judge's     in    limine   ruling\n\nbarring evidence that Estrada had owned the Mitsubishi and that\n\nRodríguez had downed a couple of beers hours before the crash.                    We\n\nare unpersuaded.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f           We need not delve too deeply into the car-ownership issue\n\nbecause, just before Rodríguez rested, Señor Frog stipulated that\n\nit owned the Mitsubishi Mirage at the time of the collision.              And\n\nthe judge read the stipulation to the jury. Fact stipulations like\n\nthis speed up the trial process by eliminating \"'the need for\n\nproving   essentially    uncontested       facts,'\"   which   helps   preserve\n\nprecious judicial resources. Caban Hernandez v. Philip Morris USA,\n\nInc., 486 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Gomez v. Rivera\n\nRodriguez, 344 F.3d 103, 120 (1st Cir. 2003)).                So, obviously,\n\nstipulations of this sort are valued by litigants and judges alike,\n\nand once freely-made they bind the parties, the trial court, and\n\nthe appellate court too.       See, e.g., H. Hackfeld & Co. v. United\n\nStates, 197 U.S. 442, 446 (1905); United States ex rel. Miller v.\n\nBill Harbert Int'l Constr., Inc., 608 F.3d 871, 889 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010); Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., 861 F.2d 224, 226 (9th\n\nCir. 1988); Fisher v. First Stamford Bank and Trust Co., 751 F.2d\n\n519, 523 (2d Cir. 1984).       Consistent with these principles, Señor\n\nFrog's stipulation undercuts the line of reasoning that it seeks to\n\npursue here – in other words, having freely stipulated to a key\n\nfact,   Señor   Frog   must   now   live    with   the   consequences.     See\n\ngenerally Miller, 608 F.3d at 889 (explaining that \"one party\" to\n\na stipulation \"need offer no evidence to prove it and the other is\n\nnot allowed to disprove it\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          Nor is Señor Frog's argument about the beer evidence\n\nparticularly promising.   As we see things, its proffer reduced to\n\nthis:   from Rodríguez's drinking a beer or two hours before the\n\ncollision, a jury could infer that (a) she drove impaired, which\n\n(b) caused her to hit a pothole that blew out her tires (she would\n\nnot have hit it otherwise, apparently) and required her to pull\n\nover, which (c) put her in line to be rear-ended by Estrada as she\n\nsat in a parked car along the shoulder of the road, which,\n\nultimately, (d) put her partly at fault for her injuries.     Señor\n\nFrog's proffered evidence did not show that Rodríguez had been\n\nimpaired, her lawyer argued, or that she had any role in Estrada's\n\nslamming into her while she was parked by the side of the road,\n\ntotally out of the travel lane.   The evidence, he added, had one\n\npurpose – to convince the jury that she was a \"bad person\" for\n\nhaving a beer or two.\n\n          The judge agreed with Rodríguez's lawyer.   Rodríguez was\n\nnot driving when Estrada \"smash[ed]\" into her – she was simply\n\nsitting there in the front seat of her parked car as the tow-truck\n\ndriver worked on getting her auto towed. Rodríguez's supposed beer\n\ndrinking had no causal role, the judge ruled, so \"[a]bsent any\n\nother evidence to establish the alleged facts,\" the proffered\n\nevidence was excludable as more prejudicial than probative.    See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f          Before taking up this issue we must iron out a wrinkle\n\nconcerning our standard of review. If an in limine ruling excludes\n\nevidence unconditionally, the adversely-affected party need take no\n\nadditional steps to preserve the issue for appeal, which means\n\nabuse-of-discretion review will control.      See, e.g., Crowe v.\n\nBolduc, 334 F.3d 124, 133 (1st Cir. 2003).    But if the ruling is\n\nmerely tentative and \"clear[ly] invit[es]\" the party \"to offer the\n\nevidence at trial\" under the ruling's terms, that party must follow\n\nup on the invitation or else plain-error review will hold sway.\n\nSee id. (adding that counsel must \"clarify whether the in limine\n\nruling was final or not\" if there is any doubt).       The judge's\n\nruling here – excluding the beer evidence unless circumstances at\n\ntrial changed so that Señor Frog had to offer it again – was final\n\nenough, see id. at 134, which makes abuse of discretion the proper\n\ntest.\n\n          Rule 403 says that district judges may exclude relevant\n\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nother considerations, including unfair prejudice. Because they are\n\non the front lines, district judges are better positioned than we\n\nto strike this balance, so they get a special degree of deference:\n\nonly in extreme circumstances will we reverse their on-the-spot\n\njudgment calls. See, e.g., United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382,\n\n388 (1st Cir. 1985).   Having thoroughly considered this matter, we\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fsee no reason to second-guess the judge's ruling here.              We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n            Sitting   as   a   diversity     court,    we    must   apply    the\n\nsubstantive law of Puerto Rico. See, e.g., Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W.\n\nv. Serrano-Isern, 605 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing, among\n\nother cases, Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938)).\n\nTort liability under Puerto Rico law requires both \"'fault,'\"\n\nMarshall v. Perez Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(quoting Jimenez v. Pelegrina, 112 P.R.R. 881, 885 (1982)), and the\n\nrequisite causal connection between the wrongdoing and the damages\n\nsustained, which is just another way of saying proximate cause, see\n\nVázquez-Filippetti v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 504 F.3d 43, 49\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).      The proximate-cause concept \"limits a party's\n\nliability for hazards flowing from its negligence to those hazards\n\nthat could be '\"anticipated by a prudent person.\"'\"             Marshall, 828\n\nF.2d at 847 (quoting Pacheco v. Puerto Rico Water Res. Auth., 112\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 369, 372 (1982) (quoting Hernandez v. The\n\nCapital, 81 P.R. 998, 1005 (1960))). Foreseeability holds the key:\n\na person is liable if the consequences of her wrongdoing were\n\nimmediate   and   foreseeable,    not   if   they     were   more   remote   and\n\nunlikely.    See, e.g., Irvine v. Murad Skin Research Labs., Inc.,\n\n194 F.3d 313, 321-22 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying Puerto Rico law);\n\nMalave-Felix v. Volvo Car Corp., 946 F.2d 967, 971-72 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (applying Puerto Rico law).\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f            Clearly, then, speculation or conjecture will not cut it\n\nwhen it comes to proximate cause.                See, e.g., Malave-Felix, 946\n\nF.2d at 972 (citing Widow of Delgado v. Boston Insur. Co., 99\n\nP.R.R. 693, 703 (1971), and Saez v. Municipality, 84 P.R.R. 515,\n\n523 (1962)).       And this is where Señor Frog falters:          the proffered\n\nevidence (which we painstakingly portrayed five paragraphs ago)\n\ndepends on a chain of inferences far too strained and uncertain to\n\nhave   much       probative     worth,     and    certainly    not    enough   to\n\ncounterbalance       its      high   potential         for   unfair   prejudice.\n\nConsequently, we cannot conclude that the judge's decision was so\n\noff the mark as to be an abuse of discretion.                     See generally\n\nLussier v. Runyon, 50 F.3d 1103, 1111 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that,\n\n\"[i]n general, the abuse of discretion framework is not appellant-\n\nfriendly\"); Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1253 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(stressing that most \"appellants who consider themselves aggrieved\n\nby discretionary decisions of the district court . . . are destined\n\nto leave this court empty-handed\").\n\n                              The Instruction Issue\n\n            Señor Frog criticizes the judge for refusing to give a\n\ncontributory- or comparative-negligence instruction.                    We review\n\nthat issue de novo if properly preserved, see, e.g., Gray v.\n\nGenlyte Group, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir. 2002), reversing\n\nonly   if   the    rejected     instruction      was    substantively    correct,\n\nessential to an important issue in the case, and not substantially\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fcovered in the charge given, see, e.g., Seahorse Marine Supplies,\n\nInc. v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 295 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2002).                At the\n\npre-charge conference Señor Frog's lawyer objected with reasons\n\nwhen the judge said that she would not give either instruction,\n\nwhich means that counsel did enough to preserve the point for\n\nappellate review.   See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c) & (d); Booker\n\nv. Mass. Dep't of Pub. Health, 612 F.3d 34, 40-42 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\nBut regardless, Señor Frog's arguments have no traction.\n\n          Puerto Rico is a comparative-negligence jurisdiction, see\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141 (2008) – hence, a contributory-\n\nnegligence charge had no place here.          On top of that, we cannot\n\ntell whether the judge carried through her intention not to offer\n\neither instruction – and that is because Señor Frog failed to give\n\nus a transcript of the instructions as read to the jury.                    The\n\ntranscript it has provided ends with this:         \"AT WHICH TIME THE JURY\n\nINSTRUCTION [sic] WERE GIVEN.\"        Parties pursuing appellate review\n\nmust supply us with enough raw material so that we can do our job.\n\nSee, e.g., Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10-12 (1st Cir. 1995).             Because\n\nSeñor Frog did not meet that most basic requirement, it cannot\n\nprevail on this issue.       See, e.g., Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 94;\n\nMoore, 47 F.3d at 10-12.\n\n          We   hasten   to    add   that   even   if   it   had   given    us   a\n\ntranscript that left no doubt about what the judge actually said in\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fher final charge, Señor Frog would still lose. Señor Frog's thesis\n\nis simple: had the judge not wrongly granted Rodríguez's in limine\n\nmotion on the beer issue, the record evidence would have obliged\n\nher to deliver the requested instruction. Having already concluded\n\nthat the judge did not gaffe the in limine ruling, we easily reject\n\nthis thesis – after all, a trial judge cannot give an instruction\n\nif there is no evidence in the record to support it, see, e.g.,\n\nKelliher v. Gen. Transp. Serv. Inc., 29 F.3d 750, 754 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); Sexton v. Gulf Oil Corp., 809 F.2d 167, 169 (1st Cir 1987),\n\nand that is the case here.\n\n                       The New-Trial Issue\n\n          Señor Frog tells us that the judge also stumbled in\n\ndenying its new-trial motion.2    District judges, of course, do not\n\nhave carte blanche to ignore \"the considered verdict of a properly\n\ninstructed jury\" simply because they might have reached a different\n\nresult in a bench trial, Quinones-Pacheco v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,\n\n979 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1992) (emphasis added) – the underscored\n\nphrase is critical for reasons that we get to shortly.      Rather,\n\njudges may grant a new trial \"'only if the verdict is against the\n\nlaw, against the weight of the credible evidence, or tantamount to\n\na miscarriage of justice.'\"      Crowe v. Marchand, 506 F.3d 13, 19\n\n\n\n     2\n       As we said, the judge denied the motion without a written\nexplanation. But we can take on Señor Frog's issues anyway. See\nBielunas, 621 F.3d at 77-78 (explaining when the court can take\nthat tack).\n\n                                 -19-\n\f(1st Cir. 2007) (discussing Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a) and quoting\n\nCasillas-Díaz v. Palau, 463 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 2006)).               And we\n\nreview   the    denial    of    a   new-trial   motion   under   the   highly-\n\ndeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.           See, e.g., id.\n\n            Señor Frog attacks the judge's new-trial order on three\n\nprimary fronts.          First, it argues that Rodríguez's counsel's\n\nmention of either a lump sum or formula for computing pain-and-\n\nsuffering damages during opening and closing statements constituted\n\nreversible     error.      We   have   outlawed   both   practices     in   this\n\ncircuit.3    See Bielunas, 621 F.3d at 78-79.            But that gets Señor\n\n\n     3\n       On this issue – which is a matter of procedure and thus\ngoverned by federal law, see Davis v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc.,\n898 F.2d 836, 837 (1st Cir. 1990) – our outright ban is clearly out\nof step with the prevailing federal practice. The Second, Fourth,\nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits leave it to\ndistrict judges to decide whether and how lawyers may discuss pain-\nand-suffering damages with juries. See, e.g., Lightfoot v. Union\nCarbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898, 912 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting that\ndistrict judges have the discretion either to \"prohibit counsel\nfrom mentioning specific figures\" or to allow it with certain\nsafeguards, \"including cautionary jury instructions\"); Murphy v.\nNat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 547 F.2d 816, 818 (4th Cir. 1977)\n(stating that if the trial court, \"in its discretion, concludes\nthat the summation would not have an unduly prejudicial effect, it\nmay permit counsel to suggest a monetary figure for the award or to\nillustrate damages for a unit of time multiplied by the expected\nduration of suffering\"); Baron Tube Co. v. Transp. Ins. Co., 365\nF.2d 858, 861, 864-65 (5th Cir. 1966) (en banc) (holding that\ncounsel can argue \"for damages for pain and suffering on a so-\ncalled 'unit of time' formula,\" provided there are safeguards in\nplace, e.g., cautionary instructions, though \"whether to allow such\nan argument and the protective features to be employed are matters\nvested, in the end, in the sound discretion of the trial court\");\nPa. R.R. Co. v. McKinley, 288 F.2d 262, 266 (6th Cir. 1961)\n(refusing to reverse where counsel \"suggested a per diem figure for\npain suffered at various periods of time,\" concluding that district\njudges possess substantial discretion to control \"the style and\n\n                                       -20-\n\fFrog only so far.        To succeed, Señor Frog must also show that the\n\nerror was harmful – i.e., that the error affected its \"substantial\n\nrights,\" which in turn depends on whether the error \"substantially\n\nswayed\" the jury's verdict.        See Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera,\n\n133   F.3d   92,   102    (1st   Cir.    1997)    (internal   quotation   marks\n\nomitted); see also Seahorse Marine Supplies, Inc., 295 F.3d at 82.\n\nCertainly the fact that the jury gave Rodríguez exactly what her\n\nlawyer asked for suggests prejudice.             But that does not tell us all\n\nwe need to know.     The key here lies in the jury instructions.            Did\n\nthe judge tell the jury to disregard the lawyer's suggested numbers\n\nas she had promised?       If yes, were her words strong enough to draw\n\nall the sting from counsel's comments?              See Bielunas, 621 F.3d at\n\n79 (noting that such an instruction might be a sufficient salve in\n\n\n\ncontent of counsel's argument\"); Waldron v. Hardwick, 406 F.2d 86,\n89 (7th Cir. 1969) (concluding \"that an inflexible rule treating\nper diem argument as reversible error is not advisable,\" adding\nthat \"the question should be left largely to the discretion of the\ntrial judge as are other matters dealing with the style and content\nof argument\"); Vanskike v. ACF Indus., Inc., 665 F.2d 188, 211 (8th\nCir. 1981) (stressing that \"limitation of counsel's argument to the\njury on computation of damages is within the discretion of the\ndistrict judge,\" adding that \"[a]lthough we continue to condemn\n[jury] instructions requiring per diem mathematical calculations,\nwe do not disapprove of per diem closing arguments [provided] such\narguments are carefully controlled by the district court\");\nMcDonald v. United Airlines, Inc., 365 F.2d 593, 595 (10th Cir.\n1966) (indicating that whether to permit \"a per diem damages\nargument . . . by counsel to the jury\" is a \"matter[] within the\ndiscretion of the trial judge\"). As far as we can tell, only the\nThird Circuit stands with us. See, e.g., Waldorf v. Shuta, 896\nF.2d 723, 744 (3d Cir. 1990) (holding that lawyers may not \"request\na specific dollar amount for pain and suffering in [their] closing\nremarks\").\n\n                                        -21-\n\fcertain situations); Río Mar Assoc., LP, SE v. UHS of P.R., Inc.,\n\n522 F.3d 159, 163 (1st Cir. 2008) (noting the presumption that\n\njurors follow the district judge's clear instructions). Also, what\n\ndid the judge tell the jury about pain-and-suffering damages under\n\nPuerto Rico law?     And viewing the record through that legal lens,\n\nwas the pain-and-suffering evidence so overwhelming that counsel's\n\nremarks mattered not in the grand scheme of things?                We can answer\n\nnone of these questions, however, because Señor Frog has not\n\npresented us with a transcript of the judge's final charge, which\n\nmeans Señor Frog loses this aspect of its new-trial bid.                       See,\n\ne.g., Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 94; Moore, 47 F.3d at 10-12.\n\n           Next, Señor Frog says that Rodríguez's counsel's closing-\n\nargument comment that his client had come under \"attack\" in court\n\nrequires a new trial.    Not so.      Assuming purely for argument's sake\n\nthat counsel's statement crossed a line (which we in no way\n\nintimate), Señor Frog has not shown any prejudice.                       See, e.g.,\n\nGonzalez-Marin v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, 845 F.2d 1140,\n\n1147   (1st   Cir.    1988)     (noting       that    district      judges     have\n\n\"considerable     discretion\"   when    it    comes    to    policing      lawyers'\n\nclosing-argument comments, stressing that \"[w]e will reverse only\n\nupon a showing of prejudice\").          Counsel's \"attack\" comment was a\n\nsmall and unrepeated part of a fairly lengthy summation.                    And the\n\njudge sustained Señor Frog's objection right away.                       The judge\n\nprobably   also   instructed    the    jury    in    the    end   that    counsels'\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fstatements in closing argument are not evidence, an instruction\n\nthat can often lessen any potential harm. See, e.g., Bielunas, 621\n\nF.3d at 79.      But we cannot double-check our hunch against the\n\ntranscript because Señor Frog did not give us what we need to carry\n\nout our review function.         Given all of the circumstances, Señor\n\nFrog's complaint goes nowhere.           See, e.g., Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d\n\nat 94; Moore, 47 F.3d at 10-11.\n\n            Finally, Señor Frog cries foul over Rodríguez's counsel's\n\nremark in closing that Estrada had been deported back to Mexico\n\nunder the terms of a plea agreement – a statement that supposedly\n\nturned the jury against Estrada.          Even if we assume for the sake of\n\ndiscussion that Rodríguez's lawyer exceeded the bounds of fair\n\nargument, we cannot see how this fleeting comment could have\n\nunfairly prejudiced Señor Frog, see Gonzalez-Marin, 845 F.2d at\n\n1147 – and, critically, Señor Frog spends no time explaining how it\n\ncould   have,   see    Casillas-Díaz,      463   F.3d   at   83   (holding   that\n\nlitigants   have      \"an   unflagging    obligation    to   spell   out     their\n\ncontentions 'squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [their]\n\npeace,'\" adding that a cursory mention of a possible argument will\n\nnot suffice) (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990)).    Ultimately, then, this new-trial argument, like the\n\nothers, cannot succeed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f                       The Remittitur Issue\n\n          Saying that most if not all of the $450,000 damage award\n\nrepresented compensation for pain and suffering, Señor Frog calls\n\nthe figure conscience-shocking and asks us to reverse the judge's\n\ndecision not to grant a remittitur.    That is a very tall order.\n\n\"Only rarely and in extraordinary circumstances\" will we nix a\n\njury's non-economic damages award. Bielunas, 621 F.3d at 80. That\n\nis especially true where, as here, the judge, \"who saw and heard\n\nthe evidence play out,\" has endorsed the award.      Id.   \"Stepping\n\nlightly,\" we only look to see if the judge abused her discretion in\n\nnot trimming the award – mindful, of course, that the defendant\n\nmust prove that the \"award is 'grossly excessive, inordinate,\n\nshocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would\n\nbe a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\"        Id. (quoting\n\nCasillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83).\n\n          Another obstacle looms large, however – one we have\n\nmentioned already, namely, the absence of a full record.         Our\n\nreview of the remittitur question is \"inescapably 'fact-bound,'\"\n\nid. (quoting Casillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83), and we must analyze\n\nthe facts \"under the legal criteria\" established by the jury\n\ncharge, id. at 80-81; see also Casillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83; Smith\n\nv. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir. 1999).   But because Señor\n\nFrog failed to furnish a transcript of the final charge, we cannot\n\nreach a reasoned decision on the remittitur issue.    Consequently,\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fSeñor Frog's remittitur challenge collapses.   See, e.g., Campos-\n\nOrrego, 175 F.3d at 94; Moore, 47 F.3d at 10-12.\n\n                         What This All Means\n\n          For the reasons recited above, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow in all respects.   Costs to Rodríguez.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f",

Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                 Torruella, Lipez, and Thompson,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Harry Anduze Montaño, with whom José Morales Boscio and Harry\nAnduze Montaño Law Office were on brief, for appellant.\n     John Fitzpatrick Vannucci, with whom the Law Office of John\nFitzpatrick Vannucci was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 12, 2011\n\f           THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.    This is a diversity-based\n\npersonal-injury case.    A jury returned a $450,000 verdict for\n\nPaloma Rodríguez against Señor Frog's de la Isla, Inc. (\"Señor\n\nFrog,\" for short) in Puerto Rico's federal district court.     Señor\n\nFrog now appeals, challenging nearly every aspect of the district\n\njudge's performance.    Unable to find any reversible error in the\n\njudge's actions, we affirm.\n\n                         How It All Began1\n\n           San Juan, Puerto Rico, early in the pre-dawn morning of\n\nDecember 5, 2004.   Cruising in her Mazda 323 on the Muñoz Rivera\n\nExpressway, 21-year-old Rodríguez hit a pothole – a collision that\n\ncost her two tires and killed the engine.    But the worst was yet to\n\ncome.\n\n           Turning her hazards on, Rodríguez somehow got her car to\n\nthe side of the road, completely out of the way of oncoming\n\ntraffic.   A police officer patrolling that stretch of highway\n\nspotted her and pulled over. He left the cruiser's flashing lights\n\non.   A tow-truck driver also showed up, parked his truck in front\n\nof Rodríguez's car, activated the truck's flashing lights, pointed\n\na spotlight on the work area, and put out cones to caution drivers\n\npassing by.   As the truck driver lowered the truck's platform,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       We narrate the facts in the light most favorable to the\njury's verdict. See, e.g., Bielunas v. F/V Misty Dawn, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                                -2-\n\fRodríguez got back into the Mazda either to grab some personal\n\nitems or to do something to help out with the towing process.\n\n           That is when Carlos Estrada closed in, speeding in a\n\nMitsubishi Mirage registered to Señor Frog.     His headlights were\n\noff.   He had a blood-alcohol level nearly double the legal limit in\n\nPuerto Rico.   And he smashed that Mitsubishi right into the rear of\n\nRodríguez's Mazda.    Rodríguez was hurt, and apparently hurt badly.\n\n\"She was thrown inside the vehicle,\" the officer later said.\n\nCovered in blood, she had no vital signs – \"she appeared to be\n\ndead.\"   But she survived and sued Señor Frog in district court\n\nunder diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332, alleging\n\nnegligence and negligent entrustment.     She sued other defendants\n\ntoo (including Estrada), but they were later dismissed for reasons\n\nthat are not important here, so we skip them.\n\n                     The Twists And Turns Of Trial\n\n           We fast-forward to the trial, where hard-charging counsel\n\npulled out all the stops.    For starters, Rodríguez's lawyer moved\n\nin limine to prevent Señor Frog from showing or arguing that\n\nEstrada had owned the Mitsubishi or that Rodríguez had drunk a beer\n\nor two hours before the crash.    The judge granted the motion.\n\n           Also, Rodríguez's counsel told the jurors during his\n\nopening statement that the evidence would compel them to return a\n\n$450,000 verdict in his client's favor.    Señor Frog's lawyer asked\n\nfor a mistrial but instead got a cautionary instruction telling\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjurors that they (not the lawyers) would decide the damage amount\n\ndue Rodríguez (if any).\n\n           The attorneys later sparred over whether the parties were\n\nof   diverse   citizenship,   and    the    judge   ruled    that    they   were,\n\nfollowing an evidentiary hearing convened after Rodríguez had\n\nrested her case.      They also battled over the jury instructions.\n\nAnd the judge seemingly sided with Rodríguez when she apparently\n\nrefused to instruct the jurors on contributory or comparative\n\nnegligence.      We hedge with \"seemingly\" and \"apparently\" because\n\nSeñor Frog failed to give us a transcript of the judge's final\n\ncharge – a misstep that affects our analysis in several respects,\n\nas we discuss later in more detail.\n\n           The fighting spilled over into closing arguments too.\n\nRodríguez's counsel said that his client sought damages for lost\n\nwages, which he conceded were not much, given that she was a\n\ncollege   student/waitress    when     injured.        But   she    also    sought\n\ncompensation for pain and suffering, which he put at \"six figures.\"\n\nSeñor   Frog's    lawyer   objected,       and   the   judge   sustained      the\n\nobjection.     But she declined to tell the jury right then and there\n\nto disregard the value comment.        \"I will instruct the jury at the\n\nend,\" she said, though we do not know if she did because, again,\n\nthe record on appeal contains no transcript of the final charge.\n\nRodríguez's attorney then mentioned a process that the jury could\n\nuse to fix damages:    her pain was worth \"$9.00 a day,\" he said, and\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fshe should live \"55 more years,\" so she should get over $178,000.\n\nThe judge sustained an objection to this statement, adding that the\n\n\"jury   will    be    able       to   evaluate   what   compensation,       if   any,\"\n\nRodríguez is due.           Sparks flew too when Rodríguez's lawyer said\n\nthat    his    client      had    found   herself    under    \"attack\"      at   trial\n\n(objection sustained) and that Estrada had been deported to Mexico\n\nas part of a plea agreement in a criminal case arising from the\n\ncrash (objection overruled).\n\n              Finding Señor Frog liable, the jury awarded Rodríguez\n\n$450,000.      The verdict does not distinguish between the types of\n\ndamages.      But the parties (who agree on little else) concur that\n\nthe bulk of this represented pain and suffering.\n\n              In any event, Señor Frog timely moved for a new trial or\n\nremittitur.          The     new-trial     portion      of   its   motion    blasted\n\nRodríguez's lawyer for his comments during opening or closing\n\nstatements that suggested a specific damage number, accused the\n\ndefense of attacking his client, and noted that authorities had\n\nshipped Estrada back to Mexico pursuant to a plea agreement.                      The\n\nremittitur section called the jury's award grossly excessive.\n\nUltimately, the judge denied the motion in an unexplained order.\n\n              Having set the stage, we turn to the legal issues on\n\nappeal, noting further facts as needed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                   The Diverse-Citizenship Issue\n\n          The   diversity-jurisdiction   statute   empowers   federal\n\ncourts to hear and decide suits between citizens of different\n\nstates, provided the amount in controversy is more than $75,000.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).   Puerto Rico is a state for diversity-\n\njurisdiction purposes.   See id. § 1332(e).    And Señor Frog is a\n\ncitizen of Puerto Rico, see id. § 1332(c)(1), so Rodríguez's suit\n\nis untenable if she was a Puerto Rico citizen when she filed her\n\nDecember 1, 2005 complaint, see, e.g., Hall v.

As the party invoking\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, Rodríguez had to prove domicile by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., Padilla-Mangual, 516 F.3d\n\nat 31; García Pérez, 364 F.3d at 350 – and she did just that,\n\npresenting enough evidence to show that she was a domiciliary (and\n\nthus a citizen) of California.\n\n          Rodríguez was the only witness at the hearing on the\n\ndiversity issue – Señor Frog called no one.      Rodríguez testified\n\nthat she had moved from Puerto Rico to California in September\n\n2005, roughly three months before she filed this suit.          She was\n\npregnant, and she and her boyfriend Adrian Peralta wanted to start\n\ntheir lives together in the Golden State.        Since they had very\n\nlittle money, the couple lived in a San Francisco Bay area home\n\nowned by Peralta's grandmother.     And by the time she sued Señor\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fFrog, she had fully relocated from Puerto Rico to California:   she\n\nwas physically present in California (with her clothes, books,\n\nfurniture, household items, etc.), had opened up a California bank\n\naccount (she had no money in any Puerto Rico banks), had gotten a\n\nCalifornia driver's license and job, and had hired a California\n\nlawyer to fight on her behalf.   And though she had not registered\n\nto vote in California (actually, she was not registered to vote\n\nanywhere) and did not attend church there, she had settled on\n\nliving in the Golden State permanently.   Cf. Bank One, Texas, N.A.\n\nv. Montle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583575\"><a href=\"/opinion/583575/bank-one-texas-na-v-paul-j-montle/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (1st Cir. 1992) (holding that factors\n\nthat can help an inquiring court determine a party's intent include\n\nwhere the party exercises civil and political rights, pays taxes,\n\nhas real and personal property, has a driver's or other license,\n\nhas bank accounts, has a job or owns a business, attends church,\n\nand has club memberships – for simplicity we call these the \"Bank\n\nOne factors\").\n\n           Post-complaint events cast no doubt on the earnestness of\n\nRodríguez's intent either. See generally García Pérez, 364 F.3d at\n\n351 (holding that, even though they \"are not part of the primary\n\ncalculus,\" post-suit happenings \"may bear on the sincerity of a\n\nprofessed intention to remain\"). Rodríguez told the judge that she\n\ngave birth to a baby boy in California, turned to a California\n\npediatrician to treat him, and put him in a California daycare for\n\na spell.   She also enrolled in three California community college\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcourses and got a cell phone with a California area code (she may\n\nhave acquired the cell phone pre-complaint, but we cannot tell for\n\ncertain).     True,     starting    in   2007,    Rodríguez     spent   several\n\nsemesters at the InterAmerican University in Puerto Rico (she could\n\nget her bachelor's degree faster if she studied there, she said),\n\nand she was still taking classes there at the time of trial.                But\n\nshe made clear that she returned to California whenever school was\n\nnot in session (during winter, spring, and summer breaks, for\n\nexample), and she provided copies of plane tickets to prove that\n\npoint. She also reaffirmed that she intended to live in California\n\nfor the rest of her life (she hoped to land a teaching job there\n\nonce she got her degree).\n\n            Having    the   exclusive    ability       to   assess   Rodríguez's\n\ndemeanor and tone, the district judge was best positioned to\n\nseparate true from false testimony.            See, e.g., Padilla-Mangual,\n\n516 F.3d at 33-34.      The judge found Rodríguez credible, and after\n\ncarefully   canvassing      the   testimony,     she    meticulously    detailed\n\nfindings of fact, which she supported with specific references to\n\nthe evidence.        Because we cannot say that these findings were\n\nclearly erroneous, her ruling that there was diverse citizenship\n\nmust stand.\n\n            Undaunted, Señor Frog insists that the district judge\n\nbotched her ruling in several respects.                For openers, Señor Frog\n\nprotests that Rodríguez did not have enough Bank One factors on her\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fside, given that she had not registered to vote in California and\n\nhad no religious affiliation there.    Also, Rodríguez produced no\n\ndocumentary evidence – no bank statements, driving records, college\n\ntranscripts, etc. – to support key claims, and, given the best-\n\nevidence rule, see Fed. R. Evid. 1002, the judge had no business\n\naccepting her \"self-serving\" comments about her intent to stay in\n\nCalifornia indefinitely.   Searching for a \"gotcha!\" moment, Señor\n\nFrog notes too that Rodríguez said at trial that she \"lived in\n\nMayaguez,\" Puerto Rico, \"all my life\" – testimony it says should\n\nhave caused the judge to dismiss the case for lack of diversity\n\njurisdiction straightaway, without bothering with an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n            We cannot buy into these arguments.   For one thing, a\n\nparty need not check off every Bank One factor to satisfy her\n\nburden, see, e.g., Padilla-Mangual, 516 F.3d at 33, and, in any\n\nevent, Rodríguez checked off more than enough of them – the\n\nCalifornia bank account, driver's license, job, and personal-\n\nproperty location sync up nicely with key Bank One factors.\n\n            For another thing, the district judge did not blindly\n\naccept Rodríguez's statement that she intended to make California\n\nher home.   Rather, the judge sifted the testimony and grounded her\n\nruling in facts that confirmed Rodríguez's intent claim. And Señor\n\nFrog's best-evidence theory changes nothing.   With exceptions not\n\nrelevant here, the best-evidence rule requires a party trying to\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fprove the \"content\" of a written document to introduce the document\n\nitself.    See Fed. R. Evid. 1002.      Think of a will contest where the\n\nwill is not in evidence and            a witness tries to discuss the\n\ndocument's words from memory – that is the sort of situation that\n\nthe rule was designed to address.           See generally United States v.\n\nDiaz-Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179021\"><a href=\"/opinion/179021/united-states-v-diaz-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201-02 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting leading\n\ntreatises on the subject).         But that is not our case.         Rodríguez\n\nnever tried to give the exact terms of her California bank account,\n\ndriver's license, or college transcripts.              She simply tried to\n\nprove, through her own direct testimony, certain facts that she had\n\ndirect knowledge of – that she had opened a California bank\n\naccount,    acquired     a    California    license,   and   taken     several\n\nCalifornia community-college courses pre-complaint. Consequently,\n\nthis case falls outside the compass of the best-evidence rule. See\n\nR & R Assocs., Inc. v.

Consider    the\n\ncontext.    Thrilled beyond words that his daughter had survived the\n\ncollision, Rodríguez's father hosted a Christmas Day party at his\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fMayaguez home in 2004 – roughly three weeks after Estrada had rear-\n\nended   Rodríguez   and     one    year   before      she    filed    this    action.\n\nRodríguez was deeply depressed, he said, and he thought a small\n\nsoirée with family and friends might lift her spirits.                   At trial,\n\nRodríguez's counsel asked her whether any party-goers had come from\n\nSan Juan (we are not sure why this mattered).                 \"No,\" she replied,\n\n\"I lived in Mayaguez all my life, so most of my friends are from\n\nMayaguez.\" Señor Frog makes much of this language, suggesting that\n\nit proved her California-domicile claim was a lie – so, the\n\nargument goes, the judge should have kicked her case to the curb\n\nwithout   further    ado.         We   think   not.         Again,   diversity    of\n\ncitizenship is determined as of the time of suit.                   See, e.g., Bank\n\nOne, 964 F.2d at 49.       And, fairly read, Rodríguez's testimony went\n\nto her pre-suit living situation, which means that her statement\n\ncould not and did not sabotage diversity jurisdiction.\n\n           That ends this phase of the case.                 Standing by what we\n\nsaid moments ago – that we cannot call the judge's diverse-\n\ncitizenship conclusion clearly wrong – we move, finally, to the\n\nother issues before us.\n\n                           The Evidentiary Issues\n\n           Señor    Frog    criticizes     the     judge's     in    limine   ruling\n\nbarring evidence that Estrada had owned the Mitsubishi and that\n\nRodríguez had downed a couple of beers hours before the crash.                    We\n\nare unpersuaded.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f           We need not delve too deeply into the car-ownership issue\n\nbecause, just before Rodríguez rested, Señor Frog stipulated that\n\nit owned the Mitsubishi Mirage at the time of the collision.              And\n\nthe judge read the stipulation to the jury.

Consistent with these principles, Señor\n\nFrog's stipulation undercuts the line of reasoning that it seeks to\n\npursue here – in other words, having freely stipulated to a key\n\nfact,   Señor   Frog   must   now   live    with   the   consequences.     See\n\ngenerally Miller, 608 F.3d at 889 (explaining that \"one party\" to\n\na stipulation \"need offer no evidence to prove it and the other is\n\nnot allowed to disprove it\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          Nor is Señor Frog's argument about the beer evidence\n\nparticularly promising.   As we see things, its proffer reduced to\n\nthis:   from Rodríguez's drinking a beer or two hours before the\n\ncollision, a jury could infer that (a) she drove impaired, which\n\n(b) caused her to hit a pothole that blew out her tires (she would\n\nnot have hit it otherwise, apparently) and required her to pull\n\nover, which (c) put her in line to be rear-ended by Estrada as she\n\nsat in a parked car along the shoulder of the road, which,\n\nultimately, (d) put her partly at fault for her injuries.     Señor\n\nFrog's proffered evidence did not show that Rodríguez had been\n\nimpaired, her lawyer argued, or that she had any role in Estrada's\n\nslamming into her while she was parked by the side of the road,\n\ntotally out of the travel lane.   The evidence, he added, had one\n\npurpose – to convince the jury that she was a \"bad person\" for\n\nhaving a beer or two.\n\n          The judge agreed with Rodríguez's lawyer.   Rodríguez was\n\nnot driving when Estrada \"smash[ed]\" into her – she was simply\n\nsitting there in the front seat of her parked car as the tow-truck\n\ndriver worked on getting her auto towed. Rodríguez's supposed beer\n\ndrinking had no causal role, the judge ruled, so \"[a]bsent any\n\nother evidence to establish the alleged facts,\" the proffered\n\nevidence was excludable as more prejudicial than probative.    See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f          Before taking up this issue we must iron out a wrinkle\n\nconcerning our standard of review. If an in limine ruling excludes\n\nevidence unconditionally, the adversely-affected party need take no\n\nadditional steps to preserve the issue for appeal, which means\n\nabuse-of-discretion review will control.      See, e.g., Crowe v.\n\nBolduc, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200534\"><a href=\"/opinion/200534/crowe-v-bolduc/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 (1st Cir. 2003).    But if the ruling is\n\nmerely tentative and \"clear[ly] invit[es]\" the party \"to offer the\n\nevidence at trial\" under the ruling's terms, that party must follow\n\nup on the invitation or else plain-error review will hold sway.\n\nSee id. (adding that counsel must \"clarify whether the in limine\n\nruling was final or not\" if there is any doubt).       The judge's\n\nruling here – excluding the beer evidence unless circumstances at\n\ntrial changed so that Señor Frog had to offer it again – was final\n\nenough, see id. at 134, which makes abuse of discretion the proper\n\ntest.\n\n          Rule 403 says that district judges may exclude relevant\n\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nother considerations, including unfair prejudice. Because they are\n\non the front lines, district judges are better positioned than we\n\nto strike this balance, so they get a special degree of deference:\n\nonly in extreme circumstances will we reverse their on-the-spot\n\njudgment calls.

Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141 (2008) – hence, a contributory-\n\nnegligence charge had no place here.          On top of that, we cannot\n\ntell whether the judge carried through her intention not to offer\n\neither instruction – and that is because Señor Frog failed to give\n\nus a transcript of the instructions as read to the jury.

To succeed, Señor Frog must also show that the\n\nerror was harmful – i.e., that the error affected its \"substantial\n\nrights,\" which in turn depends on whether the error \"substantially\n\nswayed\" the jury's verdict.

But that does not tell us all\n\nwe need to know.     The key here lies in the jury instructions.            Did\n\nthe judge tell the jury to disregard the lawyer's suggested numbers\n\nas she had promised?       If yes, were her words strong enough to draw\n\nall the sting from counsel's comments?

Also, what\n\ndid the judge tell the jury about pain-and-suffering damages under\n\nPuerto Rico law?     And viewing the record through that legal lens,\n\nwas the pain-and-suffering evidence so overwhelming that counsel's\n\nremarks mattered not in the grand scheme of things?                We can answer\n\nnone of these questions, however, because Señor Frog has not\n\npresented us with a transcript of the judge's final charge, which\n\nmeans Señor Frog loses this aspect of its new-trial bid.                       See,\n\ne.g., Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d at 94; Moore, 47 F.3d at 10-12.\n\n           Next, Señor Frog says that Rodríguez's counsel's closing-\n\nargument comment that his client had come under \"attack\" in court\n\nrequires a new trial.    Not so.      Assuming purely for argument's sake\n\nthat counsel's statement crossed a line (which we in no way\n\nintimate), Señor Frog has not shown any prejudice.                       See, e.g.,\n\nGonzalez-Marin v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505496\"><a href=\"/opinion/505496/neftali-gonzalez-marin-v-the-equitable-life-assurance-society-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1147   (1st   Cir.    1988)     (noting       that    district      judges     have\n\n\"considerable     discretion\"   when    it    comes    to    policing      lawyers'\n\nclosing-argument comments, stressing that \"[w]e will reverse only\n\nupon a showing of prejudice\").          Counsel's \"attack\" comment was a\n\nsmall and unrepeated part of a fairly lengthy summation.                    And the\n\njudge sustained Señor Frog's objection right away.                       The judge\n\nprobably   also   instructed    the    jury    in    the    end   that    counsels'\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fstatements in closing argument are not evidence, an instruction\n\nthat can often lessen any potential harm. See, e.g., Bielunas, 621\n\nF.3d at 79.      But we cannot double-check our hunch against the\n\ntranscript because Señor Frog did not give us what we need to carry\n\nout our review function.         Given all of the circumstances, Señor\n\nFrog's complaint goes nowhere.           See, e.g., Campos-Orrego, 175 F.3d\n\nat 94; Moore, 47 F.3d at 10-11.\n\n            Finally, Señor Frog cries foul over Rodríguez's counsel's\n\nremark in closing that Estrada had been deported back to Mexico\n\nunder the terms of a plea agreement – a statement that supposedly\n\nturned the jury against Estrada.          Even if we assume for the sake of\n\ndiscussion that Rodríguez's lawyer exceeded the bounds of fair\n\nargument, we cannot see how this fleeting comment could have\n\nunfairly prejudiced Señor Frog, see Gonzalez-Marin, 845 F.2d at\n\n1147 – and, critically, Señor Frog spends no time explaining how it\n\ncould   have,   see    Casillas-Díaz,      463   F.3d   at   83   (holding   that\n\nlitigants   have      \"an   unflagging    obligation    to   spell   out     their\n\ncontentions 'squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [their]\n\npeace,'\" adding that a cursory mention of a possible argument will\n\nnot suffice) (quoting United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990)).    Ultimately, then, this new-trial argument, like the\n\nothers, cannot succeed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f                       The Remittitur Issue\n\n          Saying that most if not all of the $450,000 damage award\n\nrepresented compensation for pain and suffering, Señor Frog calls\n\nthe figure conscience-shocking and asks us to reverse the judge's\n\ndecision not to grant a remittitur.    That is a very tall order.\n\n\"Only rarely and in extraordinary circumstances\" will we nix a\n\njury's non-economic damages award. Bielunas, 621 F.3d at 80. That\n\nis especially true where, as here, the judge, \"who saw and heard\n\nthe evidence play out,\" has endorsed the award.      Id.   \"Stepping\n\nlightly,\" we only look to see if the judge abused her discretion in\n\nnot trimming the award – mindful, of course, that the defendant\n\nmust prove that the \"award is 'grossly excessive, inordinate,\n\nshocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would\n\nbe a denial of justice to permit it to stand.'\"        Id. (quoting\n\nCasillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83).\n\n          Another obstacle looms large, however – one we have\n\nmentioned already, namely, the absence of a full record.         Our\n\nreview of the remittitur question is \"inescapably 'fact-bound,'\"\n\nid. (quoting Casillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83), and we must analyze\n\nthe facts \"under the legal criteria\" established by the jury\n\ncharge, id. at 80-81; see also Casillas-Díaz, 463 F.3d at 83; Smith\n\nv. Kmart Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198473\"><a href=\"/opinion/198473/smith-v-k-mart-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (1st Cir. 1999).   But because Señor\n\nFrog failed to furnish a transcript of the final charge, we cannot\n\nreach a reasoned decision on the remittitur issue.    Consequently,\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fSeñor Frog's remittitur challenge collapses.   See, e.g., Campos-\n\nOrrego, 175 F.3d at 94; Moore, 47 F.3d at 10-12.\n\n                         What This All Means\n\n          For the reasons recited above, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow in all respects.   Costs to Rodríguez.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f</pre>",
