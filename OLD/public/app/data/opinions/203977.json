The genesis of these appeals can\n\nbe traced to the gangland slaying of Edward \"Teddy\" Deegan, which\n\noccurred in 1965 in Chelsea, Massachusetts.              Initially, the murder\n\nwent unsolved.      Two years later, agents of the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation (FBI), intent on frying bigger fish, cultivated a\n\ncooperating witness, Joseph Barboza, with tight ties to organized\n\ncrime.       Barboza      thereafter   met   with    state      authorities    and\n\nimplicated several individuals in the Deegan slaying.\n\n            Based      principally      on    Barboza's         testimony,     the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts secured indictments in 1967 and\n\nconvictions the following year.           Among those convicted were Peter\n\nLimone, Sr., Enrico Tameleo, Louis Greco, Sr., and Joseph Salvati\n\n(collectively,      the    scapegoats).      All    of   them    received     stiff\n\nsentences.\n\n            Some three decades later, disturbing revelations cast\n\ngrave doubt upon the verdicts.            In December of 2000, the FBI for\n\nthe first time disclosed that all along it had possessed reliable\n\nintelligence undercutting Barboza's account of the murder and that\n\nit had suppressed this intelligence.                By the time that this\n\ninformation came to light, Tameleo and Greco had died in prison,\n\nSalvati had been paroled, and Limone was still behind bars.                  In due\n\ncourse, the convictions of all four men were vacated and Limone was\n\nreleased.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            Salvati, Limone, and the representatives of the estates\n\nof   Tameleo   and    Greco,   along     with   various   family    members\n\n(collectively, the plaintiffs), brought suit against the United\n\nStates advancing claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680.          Following a bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court found the government liable on a multitude of\n\ntheories and awarded over $100,000,000 in damages.         The government\n\nappeals, as does one of the plaintiffs.\n\n            The record evinces egregious governmental misconduct; the\n\nFBI agents responsible for handling Barboza exhibited a callous\n\ndisregard for the scapegoats' rights.             But it is our duty to\n\ninterpret and apply the law even-handedly, regardless of the\n\negregiousness of a defendant's misconduct.          Fidelity to that duty\n\nrequires us to examine and resolve several vexing issues concerning\n\nboth liability and damages. After painstaking consideration of the\n\nvoluminous record, the parties' briefs, and the district court's\n\ncarefully   crafted   rescripts,   we    affirm   the   liability   finding\n\n(albeit on grounds that differ in one significant respect from\n\nthose relied upon by the district court).\n\n            The damage awards give us pause.        Insofar as the awards\n\nembody damages for wrongful incarceration, they are considerably\n\nhigher than any one of us, if sitting on the trial court bench,\n\nwould have ordered.      We nonetheless affirm those awards.           Our\n\nproper function as appellate judges is not to second-guess the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ftrial court but, rather, to apply a very deferential standard of\n\nreview.    Adhering to that role, and testing the disputed awards\n\nonly to that extent, we conclude that the awards, though high, are\n\nnot so grossly disproportionate to the harm sustained as to either\n\nshock   our     collective      conscience      or   raise    the   specter    of   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n              These appeals have a long factual and procedural history.\n\nWe rehearse that history only insofar as is necessary to place into\n\nperspective the issues that we must decide.                  We direct the reader\n\nwho   hungers    for     more   detail    to    consult   the   district     court's\n\ncapstone opinion in Limone v. United States (Limone IV), 497 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 143 (D. Mass. 2007).\n\n              We bifurcate our account.            First, we limn the unsavory\n\nhistory of the Deegan murder and its aftermath.                 Then, we move to\n\nthe commencement and travel of the federal case.                      Because these\n\nappeals follow findings made by a district court sitting without a\n\njury, we resolve factual conflicts in favor of the district court's\n\nfindings   (to     the    extent   that    those     findings   are    not   clearly\n\nerroneous).      Jackson v. United States, 156 F.3d 230, 232-33 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n                    A.     The Murder and Its Aftermath.\n\n              On the night of March 12, 1965, Teddy Deegan's bullet-\n\nridden body was discovered in Chelsea, Massachusetts.                    Deegan had\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fbeen shot six times, and the shots had been fired from three\n\ndifferent guns.         Suspicion focused upon a group of men that\n\nincluded Barboza, Jimmy Flemmi, Roy French, Joseph Martin, and\n\nRonald Cassesso, all of whom were linked to organized crime.                        The\n\ngroup had been observed leaving a local gang hangout, the Ebb Tide\n\nLounge, earlier that evening and returning shortly after the murder\n\nwas committed.         Eyewitnesses attested that they had seen blood\n\nstains on French's clothing that night.\n\n              Despite local officers' suspicions, the trail went cold\n\nwithin    a   matter    of   weeks.     The       police    were   unable   to    gather\n\nsufficient evidence to prefer charges against anyone.\n\n              Some two years later, FBI agents H. Paul Rico and Dennis\n\nCondon started cultivating Barboza, a known killer, in hopes of\n\n\"flipping\" him; that is, developing him as a cooperating witness\n\nagainst the Italian Mafia (La Cosa Nostra or LCN).                      At the time,\n\nBarboza    was   facing      up   to   89    years    of    imprisonment     on   state\n\n\"habitual offender\" charges.            See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, § 25.\n\nBarboza indicated a willingness to deal but placed one immutable\n\ncondition on any information that he might provide: he would not\n\ninculpate his close associate, Flemmi.                     The FBI tacitly accepted\n\nthat condition.\n\n              Throughout the spring of 1967, the agents used both\n\ncarrots and sticks in their efforts to mine information from\n\nBarboza.      Barboza was in state custody, and the agents plied him\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fwith promises of favorable recommendations and a slap-on-the-wrist\n\nsentence.     They also fabricated a story that La Cosa Nostra was\n\nattempting,    by   influencing     state   prosecutors,       to    bring   about\n\nBarboza's lifetime confinement.\n\n              Barboza's cooperation was not a one-shot affair.               Over\n\nthe course of several months of interrogation, he claimed to be\n\nknowledgeable about many crimes.            Pertinently, he mentioned the\n\nDeegan murder (although in his conversations with the FBI agents he\n\nwas not forthcoming as to any details).           That crime was primarily\n\na   matter    of    state,    not   federal,     interest.           Accordingly,\n\nMassachusetts law enforcement officers sought to interview Barboza.\n\n             On September 8, 1967, two Suffolk County detectives (John\n\nDoyle and Frank Walsh) conversed with Barboza.                 Agents Rico and\n\nCondon were present, but the detectives pulled the laboring oar.\n\nUnder questioning, Barboza finally provided his account of the\n\nDeegan killing. According to that account, Limone hired Barboza to\n\nmurder     Deegan   because    Deegan   had     robbed    an    LCN-affiliated\n\nbookmaker.     Barboza then requested permission to carry out the\n\n\"hit\" from Tameleo, an LCN hierarch.           After Tameleo's blessing had\n\nbeen secured, Barboza and Greco formulated a plan.\n\n             According to Barboza, the mechanics of the plan were as\n\nfollows.      French   would    accompany      Deegan    to    the    site   of   a\n\nhypothetical burglary.        Once there, French would turn on Deegan\n\nand, assisted by Barboza, Salvati, Greco, Martin, and Cassesso,\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwould kill both Deegan and another putative participant in the\n\nburglary, Anthony Stathopoulos, Jr.      Upon learning the details of\n\nthe plan, Limone approved it and agreed to pay an additional sum\n\nbecause it involved a double murder.\n\n            During subsequent meetings with the detectives and the\n\nagents, Barboza modified his account. This modified version, which\n\ndiffered only at the margins and not at the core, formed the\n\npredicate for the indictments and convictions that followed.\n\n            At the time that Barboza unveiled his account of Deegan's\n\nmurder, the FBI possessed powerful intelligence casting grave doubt\n\non   the   account's   veracity.    Because    the   strength     of    this\n\nintelligence is of decretory significance here, we discuss it in\n\nsome detail.\n\n            In the early 1960s, the FBI ramped up its efforts to\n\nextirpate organized crime in New England.       Among other things, it\n\nsurreptitiously   installed   an   illegal   electronic   \"bug\"    at    the\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island office of Raymond L. S. Patriarca, the\n\nreputed head of La Cosa Nostra in the area.       The bug was in place\n\nfrom early 1962 through July 12, 1965.          See United States v.\n\nTaglianetti, 274 F. Supp. 220, 223 (D.R.I. 1967).            FBI agents\n\ntranscribed the conversations that it recorded, reviewed those\n\ntranscripts, and sent summaries of important information to FBI\n\nheadquarters in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f          As a parallel measure, the FBI initiated the Top Echelon\n\nCriminal Informant Program in 1961.         The aim of that program was to\n\ninduce high-ranking organized crime figures to provide intelligence\n\non a continuing, long-term basis. See United States v. Flemmi, 225\n\nF.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          In the weeks preceding and following Deegan's murder,\n\nthese two investigative tools yielded a golconda of information\n\nabout the killers.        The Patriarca bug revealed that Barboza and\n\nFlemmi had approached Patriarca and obtained his sanction for the\n\nhit.   Other information from both the bug and the FBI's then-\n\ncurrent crop of Top Echelon informants implicated five malefactors\n\n(Barboza, Flemmi, French, Martin, and Cassesso) in the murder, but\n\nnot a single source other than Barboza so much as hinted that any\n\nof the scapegoats were involved.\n\n          Despite    possessing       credible   intelligence      undermining\n\nBarboza's tale, the FBI did not turn over this intelligence to\n\nstate authorities either at the time of the murder or during\n\nBarboza's later debriefing.      To make a bad situation worse, agents\n\nRico and Condon informed the state prosecutor, Norman Zalkind, that\n\nBarboza's tale \"checked out.\"         Condon appeared as a witness at the\n\nstate-court trial and lent credence to Barboza's narrative by\n\nemphasizing   that   he    (Condon)    always    was   concerned    about   the\n\n\"purity\" of the testimony given by his informants.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            On the strength of Barboza's false testimony, the jury\n\nconvicted   the   scapegoats   on     first-degree   murder   and    murder-\n\nconspiracy charges.1     The trial judge sentenced Limone, Tameleo,\n\nand Greco to death, and sentenced Salvati to life imprisonment.\n\nThe   scapegoats'    appeals   were    unsuccessful,   but    the   capital\n\nsentences were commuted to life imprisonment after the United\n\nStates Supreme Court decided Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238\n\n(1972).\n\n            Under Massachusetts law as it stood at the time, a state\n\nprisoner convicted of first-degree murder could not be paroled\n\nabsent commutation by the governor.        See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 199 (describing parole process).        The scapegoats filed numerous\n\npetitions for commutation and parole over many years.               Although\n\nstate authorities requested all relevant information, the FBI never\n\nturned over the exculpatory information that reposed within its\n\nfiles.    On some occasions, the FBI went so far as to forward\n\ninformation that harmed the scapegoats' chances for commutation or\n\nparole.   On other occasions, it took affirmative steps to deflect\n\npossible challenges to the convictions.\n\n            Tameleo and Greco died in prison in 1985 and in 1995,\n\nrespectively.     Salvati secured a commutation from the governor and\n\nwas released in 1997.     Limone remained incarcerated.\n\n\n      1\n       French, Martin, and Cassesso also were convicted on charges\nrelated to the murder. The legitimacy of those convictions is not\nan issue here.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          In December of 2000, Special Assistant United States\n\nAttorney John Durham, responding to a request lodged by Limone,\n\nturned over five memoranda (which have come to be known as the\n\nDurham documents).       The Durham documents revealed much of the\n\nexculpatory information that the FBI had kept in its organizational\n\nbosom all along.    Upon seeing this information, the Suffolk County\n\ndistrict attorney's office moved to vacate Limone's conviction.\n\nThe state trial court granted that motion on the ground that the\n\nresult of the trial in all likelihood would have been different had\n\nthe Durham documents been disclosed in a timeous manner. Salvati's\n\nconviction was vacated on the same ground.                Shortly thereafter,\n\nstate prosecutors filed notices of abandonment of prosecution\n\n(nolle prosequi) for both Limone and Salvati based on a perceived\n\nlack of evidence.     The prosecutors later arranged for posthumous\n\nvacatur of Tameleo's and Greco's convictions and issued similar\n\nnolle prosequi notices in those cases.\n\n                          B.    The FTCA Action.\n\n          Following    the     release    of     the   Durham    documents,   the\n\nplaintiffs filed separate actions in the federal district court.\n\nThe plaintiffs' complaints adumbrated three types of causes of\n\naction: (i) claims against the United States under the FTCA;\n\n(ii)   Bivens   claims    against        Rico,     Condon,      and   other   FBI\n\nsupernumeraries, see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of FBN, 403\n\nU.S. 388, 397 (1971); and (iii) claims against Walsh and other\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fstate actors pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.             The cases were\n\nconsolidated.\n\n          The United States moved to dismiss on the ground that the\n\nclaims against it were barred by the discretionary function and\n\nintentional tort exceptions to the FTCA.       See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a),\n\n(h).   The individual defendants moved to dismiss on qualified\n\nimmunity grounds.     The district court denied these motions.      See\n\nLimone v. United States (Limone I), 271 F. Supp. 2d 345, 353-57 (D.\n\nMass. 2003) (rejecting discretionary function defense); id. at 365-\n\n66 (rejecting qualified immunity defense); Limone v. United States\n\n(Limone III), 336 F. Supp. 2d 18, 30-31 (D. Mass. 2004) (rejecting\n\nintentional tort defense).       On a limited interlocutory appeal, we\n\naffirmed the denial of qualified immunity.           Limone v. Condon\n\n(Limone II), 372 F.3d 39, 50 (1st Cir. 2004).      The plaintiffs later\n\ndropped their claims against the individual defendants (federal and\n\nstate) and proceeded only on the FTCA claims.\n\n          Following a 22-day bench trial, the district court found\n\nfor the plaintiffs (including the family members) on their claims\n\nof malicious prosecution, coercive civil conspiracy, intentional\n\ninfliction      of   emotional     distress,    negligence,   negligent\n\nsupervision, and loss of consortium.           The court awarded total\n\ndamages in excess of $100,000,000.        These timely appeals ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           On appeal, the government challenges the district court's\n\nholdings on both liability and damages.      Its argument on liability\n\nmakes three basic points: (i) that the district court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims by reason\n\nof the FTCA's discretionary function exception; (ii) that the court\n\nlacked such jurisdiction because the plaintiffs' claims arose out\n\nof intentional torts committed before Congress amended the FTCA to\n\npermit   the   maintenance   of   such   claims;   and    (iii)     that    the\n\nplaintiffs adduced insufficient evidence to prove the elements of\n\nany of the asserted torts.\n\n           In a secondary line of attack, the government assails the\n\ndistrict court's damages calculus, arguing that the court's rule-\n\nof-thumb baseline of $1,000,000 per year for each year of wrongful\n\nincarceration    is   unreasonable   and   resulted      in   a   battery   of\n\nexcessive awards.      In a cross-appeal, the son of one of the\n\nscapegoats contends that the district court erred in awarding him\n\nthe same damages as were awarded to the offspring of the other\n\nscapegoats.\n\n           In the pages that follow, we address these arguments.\n\nFor ease in exposition we deal with the second and third prongs of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthe government's challenge to liability before addressing the first\n\nprong.2\n\n            We start that discussion with what all the parties have\n\ntreated    as   the   leading    edge    of    the   government's     appeal:   its\n\nasseveration     that    the     district      court   erred    in   finding    the\n\ngovernment liable for malicious prosecution.                   While we conclude\n\nthat the government's asseveration has merit, that proves to be a\n\nhollow victory. The next most bruited theory on which the district\n\ncourt premised liability — its finding that the FBI is liable for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress — withstands scrutiny.\n\nAs to that cause of action, we also reject the government's\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence and discretionary function defenses.\n\nFinally, we uphold the damage awards in their entirety (a decision\n\nthat entails, among other things, defenestration of the cross-\n\nappeal).\n\n                        A.     Malicious Prosecution.\n\n            Federal     courts    lack    jurisdiction     over      tort   actions\n\nagainst the United States except insofar as the sovereign has\n\n\n     2\n        Because the discretionary function exception, when\napplicable, deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, some\nmight think consideration of it logically antecedent to\nconsideration of the merits. But the answer to the discretionary\nfunction inquiry depends in large measure on the nature of the\nconduct at issue. See, e.g., Fothergill v. United States, 566 F.3d\n248, 252-53 (1st Cir. 2009); Shansky v. United States, 164 F.3d\n688, 690-91 (1st Cir. 1999). In an appellate court, after a full\ntrial on the merits, the discretionary function inquiry sometimes\nis better performed at a later stage in the analysis. This is such\na case.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fconsented to be sued.       See Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 221 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2000).           The FTCA represents a\n\ngeneral waiver of federal sovereign immunity for tortious acts and\n\nomissions of federal employees. But that general waiver is subject\n\nto a litany of exceptions.\n\n             At the time that the scapegoats were charged, prosecuted,\n\nand convicted in state court, the FTCA's waiver provisions excluded\n\nclaims arising out of malicious prosecution.           See Savage v. United\n\nStates, 322 F. Supp. 33, 35 (D. Minn. 1971) (quoting former section\n\n2680(h)); Ira S. Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 276 F. Supp.\n\n518, 526 (E.D.N.Y. 1967) (same).        Congress dissolved the malicious\n\nprosecution bar with respect to federal law enforcement officers in\n\n1974, amending the FTCA to add what has come to be known as the law\n\nenforcement proviso.       See Pub. L. No. 93-253, § 2, 88 Stat. 50,\n\ncodified at 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).\n\n             The government posits that the plaintiffs' malicious\n\nprosecution     claims   arose    before   the   enactment     of     the   law\n\nenforcement proviso and, therefore, the district court lacked\n\njurisdiction over those claims.         The district court brushed aside\n\nthis argument, holding that the plaintiffs' malicious prosecution\n\nclaims did not arise until the scapegoats had received favorable\n\nterminations of the criminal charges wrongfully brought against\n\nthem   (an   eventuality   that   did    not   occur   until   2001    at   the\n\nearliest).    See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 204; Limone III, 336\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fF. Supp. 2d at 30-37; see also Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 489\n\n(1994) (indicating that cause of action for malicious prosecution\n\ndoes not accrue until favorable termination of the underlying\n\ncriminal proceeding has occurred).\n\n            The key to this riddle lies in language.                 The law\n\nenforcement proviso applies only to covered actions (like malicious\n\nprosecution) that \"aris[e]\" after its effective date.               28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2680(h).    The plaintiffs and the district court equate the word\n\n\"arise\" with the word \"accrue,\" thereby bringing into play the Heck\n\nanalysis.     The government, however, insists that the word \"arise\"\n\nrefers to the time when the prosecution itself occurred. Each view\n\nhas a patina of plausibility.     The district court's analysis makes\n\nthe case for the plaintiffs, see Limone III, 336 F. Supp. 2d at 30-\n\n37, and the government's reading of the statute finds some purchase\n\nin the case law elsewhere, see, e.g., Liuzzo v. United States, 508\n\nF. Supp. 923, 927-28 & n.2 (E.D. Mich. 1981).\n\n            This is a difficult question.              Moreover, given the\n\npassage of time, it is unlikely to recur.           Courts should take pains\n\nnot to grapple needlessly with enigmatic questions.            As we explain\n\nbelow,   it    is   unnecessary   for     us   to    answer   the   statutory\n\nconstruction question posed by the parties in this case.3\n\n\n     3\n       We recognize that the question of when a cause of action for\nmalicious prosecution arises under the law enforcement proviso of\nthe FTCA is jurisdictional in nature. We have broad discretion,\nhowever, to take issues in whatever order practicality may suggest,\nsee, e.g., Puerto Rico v. United States, 490 F.3d 50, 70 (1st Cir.\n\n                                   -16-\n\f            The FTCA looks to state law to flesh out the elements of\n\nparticular torts.        See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1); Bolduc v. United\n\nStates, 402 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2005).                    Here, both the allegedly\n\ntortious    conduct      and        the     harm       complained      of     occurred      in\n\nMassachusetts.     Massachusetts law, therefore, supplies the beacon\n\nby which we must steer.\n\n            To   prevail       on    a     malicious       prosecution        claim       under\n\nMassachusetts     law,     a    suitor          must    prove    that       the     defendant\n\n(i)   instituted      criminal            proceedings      (ii)       with     malice      and\n\n(iii) without probable cause, and (iv) that the proceedings were\n\nterminated in the accused's favor.                      Correllas v. Viveiros, 572\n\nN.E.2d 7, 10 (Mass. 1991).                Here, we can start and stop with the\n\nfirst of these four elements.\n\n            In   broad   brush,           an    individual      may   be     said    to   have\n\ninstituted criminal proceedings against another if he caused those\n\nproceedings to be initiated.               See Witham v. Gregory & Read Co., 137\n\nN.E. 752, 752 (Mass. 1923); Mason v. Jacot, 127 N.E. 331, 333\n\n(Mass. 1920); Tangney v. Sullivan, 39 N.E. 799, 799-800 (Mass.\n\n1895).     The paradigmatic example exists when a person formally\n\nswears out a criminal complaint against another person. See, e.g.,\n\nWhite v. Apsley Rubber Co., 80 N.E. 500, 501 (Mass. 1907).                                 But\n\nmalicious prosecution is by no means restricted to this paradigm.\n\n\n\n\n2007), and we exercise that discretion here.\n\n                                               -17-\n\f          If an individual induces another person (say, a police\n\nofficer or prosecutor) to lodge formal criminal charges, he may be\n\nheld to have instituted the criminal proceedings. See, e.g., Jones\n\nv. Schein, 103 N.E. 57, 58 (Mass. 1913); Tangney, 39 N.E. at 800.\n\nSo, too, if an individual either exercises a peculiar degree of\n\ncontrol over the charging official or adamantly presses that\n\nofficial to bring a criminal complaint, he may be held responsible\n\nfor the institution of the prosecution.      See, e.g., Seelig v.\n\nHarvard Coop. Soc'y, 246 N.E.2d 642, 646 (Mass. 1969); Conway v.\n\nSmerling, 635 N.E.2d 268, 271 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994).\n\n          These taxonomies are of scant solace to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe FBI neither preferred charges against the scapegoats nor swore\n\nout a complaint against them.   Moreover, there is not a shred of\n\nevidence that the FBI induced the state to pursue the murder case.\n\nThe agents' primary interest was in preserving the secrecy of their\n\nown sources.   They did not demand that state actors bring charges\n\nagainst the scapegoats; indeed, there is no evidence that they so\n\nmuch as suggested that such charges should be brought.\n\n          Finally, though the agents assisted Barboza in shoring up\n\nhis false tale when inconsistencies came to light, that subsequent\n\nassistance does not support a conclusion that the FBI \"encouraged\"\n\nstate actors to institute the Deegan prosecution.   See Correllas,\n\n572 N.E.2d at 10.    Equally as important, that evidence does not\n\nsupport the district court's findings, Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fat 210, that the FBI controlled state actors and that the Deegan\n\nprosecution was the functional equivalent of a federal prosecution.\n\nThose findings were clearly erroneous.             See Benham v. Lenox Sav.\n\nBank, 292 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The plaintiffs' best argument is at the margins.                 There\n\nis case law in Massachusetts indicating that an individual who\n\ntransmits untruthful information to an official with power to\n\ncharge sometimes may be said to have instituted an ensuing criminal\n\nproceeding     brought    by   that    official.       See,   e.g.,   Ziemba   v.\n\nFo'cs'le, Inc., 475 N.E.2d 1223, 1226 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985);\n\nCarroll v. Gillespie, 436 N.E.2d 431, 439 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982);\n\nsee also Petricca v. City of Gardner, 429 F. Supp. 2d 216, 225 (D.\n\nMass. 2006).     This does not mean, however, that every provider of\n\nfalse information, nor even every bad-faith provider of false\n\ninformation, may be said to have instituted an ensuing criminal\n\nproceeding.\n\n          The question of whether such an individual has instituted\n\na   criminal    proceeding      depends     on   the     circumstances.        The\n\ncontrolling precedent is the ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) in Correllas, 572 N.E.2d at 10.                  Under that\n\ndecision, an individual may not be held to have instituted criminal\n\nproceedings     if   he   merely      provides   false    information     to   law\n\nenforcement officials in response to these officials' queries\n\nduring an ongoing investigation.           See id.; see also Councilman v.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fAlibris, Inc., 386 F. Supp. 2d 5, 9 (D. Mass. 2005).                Instead, the\n\ninformation provider must take some initiative; that is, he must\n\nvoluntarily reach out to law enforcement officials and cause them\n\nto commence a new line of inquiry.            See Councilman, 386 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 9.\n\n            The court below concluded that the United States was\n\nresponsible    for    instituting    criminal      proceedings      against     the\n\nscapegoats on the theory that the FBI, through Barboza, had become\n\na bad-faith provider of false information. Limone IV, 497 F. Supp.\n\n2d   at    207-13.      This    conclusion      rests    principally       on   two\n\nconsiderations.      First, agents Rico and Condon recruited, vetted,\n\nand delivered Barboza to state authorities.              Id. at 206.       Second,\n\nthey knew that Barboza was not being truthful when he implicated\n\nthe scapegoats, yet they assisted Barboza in making his tale more\n\nbelievable    and    encouraged    him   to    stand    by   that   tale   through\n\nincentives such as protection, promises of leniency, and financial\n\nrewards.    Id. at 179-80, 211, 217-18.\n\n            The record leaves no doubt but that the agents conducted\n\nthemselves deplorably.         But we cannot agree that they can be said\n\nto have \"instituted\" the criminal proceedings that ensued against\n\nthe scapegoats.        The turning point is the SJC's analysis in\n\nCorrellas.\n\n            The record in this case makes pellucid that, during\n\ninterrogations conducted exclusively by Rico and Condon, Barboza\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fmade only passing reference to the Deegan homicide.                         He neither\n\nmentioned the scapegoats nor offered any specific details about the\n\nmurder or the murderers.               For their part, the agents exhibited no\n\nparticular interest in those subjects.\n\n               This void remained until state authorities began to take\n\npart in the questioning.               Barboza first offered the account that\n\nwould       form   the   basis    of    the    prosecution   during    an    interview\n\nconducted chiefly by Doyle and Walsh (Suffolk County detectives) on\n\nSeptember 8, 1967.4              That questioning came about as part of a\n\nlarger state investigation into the Deegan murder.                    By the time of\n\nthe September 8 interview, state investigators had visited Barboza\n\non at least four occasions and had asked him point-blank for\n\ninformation pertaining to the Deegan murder.5                 Even though federal\n\nagents were present during these audiences, it seems to have been\n\nthe detectives, not the FBI, who first brought up, and then kept\n\ndigging into, the Deegan murder.                 See supra note 4.\n\n               So viewed, the record compels the conclusion that Barboza\n\nfurnished the false information that led to the institution of the\n\n\n\n        4\n       The FBI report of this interview indicates that Doyle\nconducted the interview.    Moreover, the substance of that FBI\nreport consists only of a copy of Doyle's interview notes. That\ngeneral scenario is characteristic of the FBI reports of subsequent\ninterrogation sessions at which the detectives were present.\n     5\n       Although Barboza would make alterations to the fairy tale\nthat he narrated on September 8, these alterations too came about\nduring joint interview sessions led by state law enforcement\nofficers.\n\n                                              -21-\n\fprosecution while under questioning by state agents investigating\n\na state crime.   There is no evidence that the FBI brought Barboza\n\nand state authorities together specifically so that he would talk\n\non the Deegan murder; indeed, Barboza offered information to state\n\nauthorities on various matters, including another murder he would\n\nlater testify about, before he answered questions regarding Deegan.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence that the FBI knew that Barboza would\n\nconcoct the bogus story that emerged.   See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 217 (finding that Barboza had pulled \"the [scapegoats'] names\n\nout of thin air\").   Although there is evidence that the FBI helped\n\nto shore up Barboza's credibility as matters moved along, the\n\nprosecution by then already had been instituted.\n\n          There is one loose end.       The SJC has left open the\n\npossibility that an individual may be held liable for malicious\n\nprosecution if he pursues a prosecution after it has become clear\n\nto him that there is no probable cause to support it.          See\n\nGutiérrez v. MBTA, 772 N.E.2d 552, 562 (Mass. 2002); see also\n\nMitchell v. City of Boston, 130 F. Supp. 2d 201, 215 (D. Mass.\n\n2001) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 655 (1977)).   Given\n\nthe SJC's holding in Correllas, however, it is evident that the\n\nmere provision of false information cannot alone ground a malicious\n\ncontinuation finding. More is required, such as an insistence that\n\nthe prosecution go forward even after it has become clear that\n\nprobable cause is lacking.   See, e.g., Miller v. City of Boston,\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f297 F. Supp. 2d 361, 367 (D. Mass. 2003); Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts § 655 cmt. c (1977).\n\n              Here, there is no evidence that FBI agents urged state\n\nauthorities to continue the ill-starred prosecution. Patently, the\n\nagents' primary interest was in Barboza, not in prosecuting the\n\nscapegoats.     The mere fact that the agents propped up the state's\n\ncase (e.g., by bolstering Barboza's credibility) does not make the\n\nFBI a \"continuer\" of the prosecution any more than the defendant in\n\nCorrellas (who gratuitously offered false data to the authorities\n\nsubsequent to the initiation of prosecution).\n\n              To sum up, we hold that the FBI did not institute\n\ncriminal proceedings against the scapegoats.         See Correllas, 572\n\nN.E.2d at 10.     Thus, the plaintiffs have failed to prove the first\n\nelement of the tort of malicious prosecution.         Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding the United States liable for that\n\ntort. Nevertheless, this conclusion does not end our odyssey. The\n\ndistrict court also found the government liable on other theories.\n\nHence, we proceed to the most promising of those parallel theories\n\nof liability.\n\n         B.    Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.\n\n              Under Massachusetts law, an individual is liable for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress when he, \"by extreme\n\nand   outrageous    conduct   and   without   privilege,   causes   severe\n\nemotional distress to another.\"        Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 355\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fN.E.2d 315, 318 (Mass. 1976).6           The court below found that the\n\nFBI's extreme and outrageous misconduct had caused the plaintiffs\n\nto suffer severe emotional distress and, thus, imposed liability.\n\nLimone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.\n\n            The   government    does     not   contest    that   the    tort    of\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, unlike malicious\n\nprosecution, was actionable under the FTCA before the passage of\n\nthe   law   enforcement   proviso.       Instead,    it   suggests     that    the\n\ndistrict    court    lacked    subject    matter    jurisdiction       over    the\n\nplaintiffs' intentional infliction claims because those claims\n\narise out of malicious prosecution (a tort that was barred by the\n\nversion of the FTCA in effect at the time of the convictions).                  As\n\na fallback, the United States questions the factual predicate\n\nunderlying the district court's analysis. We treat these arguments\n\nsequentially.\n\n            1.    Subject Matter Jurisdiction.        As said, Congress did\n\nnot waive the federal government's immunity from actions arising\n\nout of malicious prosecution until it enacted the law enforcement\n\nproviso in 1974.     The government hypothesizes that the plaintiffs'\n\n\n      6\n       Agis is the seminal Massachusetts case recognizing a cause\nof action for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the\nabsence of an accompanying physical injury.          Although the\nscapegoats' convictions predate this decision, the United States\nhas not ascribed any relevance to this chronology. Thus, we deem\nwaived any contention that the government cannot be held liable\nunder the FTCA on a tort theory that was not firmly established in\nthe case law of the relevant state at the time of the tortious\nacts.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fintentional infliction claims arise out of a maliciously instigated\n\nprosecution that occurred before the enactment of this proviso and,\n\ntherefore, the district court lacked competence to adjudicate those\n\nclaims.    We do not accept that hypothesis.\n\n            Although courts (including this court) sometimes have\n\nreferred loosely to section 2680(h) as an \"intentional torts\"\n\nexception to the general waiver contained in the FTCA, see, e.g.,\n\nRodríguez v. United States, 54 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1995), the\n\nprovision only preserves the federal government's immunity with\n\nrespect to claims arising out of certain enumerated torts, see\n\nSantiago-Ramírez v. Sec'y of Def., 984 F.2d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nBlack v. Sheraton Corp., 564 F.2d 531, 539-40 (D.C. Cir. 1977).\n\nBecause intentional infliction of emotional distress never has been\n\non   the   roster   of   excluded   torts    listed      in    section   2680(h),\n\nintentional    infliction    claims    are   not   per    se    barred   by   that\n\nprovision.     See Estate of Trentadue ex rel. Aguilar v. United\n\nStates, 397 F.3d 840, 854-55 (10th Cir. 2005); Sabow v. United\n\nStates, 93 F.3d 1445, 1457 (9th Cir. 1996); Truman v. United\n\nStates, 26 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir. 1994); Santiago-Ramírez, 984\n\nF.2d at 20; Kohn v. United States, 680 F.2d 922, 926 (2d Cir.\n\n1982); Gross v. United States, 676 F.2d 295, 304 (8th Cir. 1982).\n\n            Be that as it may, the reach of section 2680(h) is not\n\nlimited to specifically enumerated torts.             Rather, that provision\n\ndeprives a district court of jurisdiction over a claim whenever the\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fclaim is, or arises out of, a specifically enumerated tort.      See,\n\ne.g., Snow-Erlin v. United States, 470 F.3d 804, 808-09 (9th Cir.\n\n2006) (holding particular claim arose out of false imprisonment);\n\nO'Ferrell v. United States, 253 F.3d 1257, 1265-66 (11th Cir. 2001)\n\n(holding particular claim arose out of slander).       This framework\n\napplies to claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nSee, e.g., Metz v. United States, 788 F.2d 1528, 1534-35 (11th Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n          The approach that we have outlined necessitates a fact-\n\nsensitive, case-specific inquiry.        In performing that tamisage,\n\nsubstance trumps form; an inquiring court must look past the\n\nnomenclature employed by the plaintiff and focus on the actual\n\nnature of the plaintiff's grievance.      See Jiménez-Nieves v. United\n\nStates, 682 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1982).      If that grievance rests on\n\nproof of conduct that traditionally comprises an excepted tort,\n\nsection 2680(h) precludes suit. See, e.g., Snow-Erlin, 470 F.3d at\n\n808-09; Truman, 26 F.3d at 595; Thomas-Lazear v. FBI, 851 F.2d\n\n1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n          On the other hand, if there is merely a loose connection,\n\na family resemblance, or even a partial overlap between the conduct\n\non which the asserted claim rests and that comprising an excepted\n\ntort, the claim is not barred by section 2680(h).        See Block v.\n\nNeal, 460 U.S. 289, 298 (1983).    It follows that when an element of\n\nan excepted tort is missing from the factual scenario, the claim is\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fnot pretermitted.          See Estate of Trentadue, 397 F.3d at 855\n\n(holding       intentional       infliction         claim    not    barred    by\n\nmisrepresentation exception because elements of misrepresentation,\n\nincluding reliance and pecuniary loss, were not present); Truman,\n\n26 F.3d at 596 (holding intentional infliction claim not barred by\n\nassault or battery exceptions because elements of these latter\n\ntorts were not alleged); Jiménez-Nieves, 682 F.2d at 4-5 (holding\n\nnegligence claim not barred by misrepresentation exception because\n\nreliance not present).\n\n              In the instant case, the plaintiffs failed to prove that\n\nthe FBI instituted criminal proceedings against the scapegoats, see\n\nsupra Part II(A), and thus failed to prove an essential element of\n\nthe tort of malicious prosecution.                  Furthermore, the conduct\n\nundergirding the plaintiffs' claims for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress is broader than that traditionally associated\n\nwith    the   tort   of   malicious   prosecution       in   that   it   includes\n\nmalfeasance that postdates the scapegoats' convictions, such as\n\nefforts by the FBI to cover up its misdeeds (a topic to which we\n\nshall    return).         And,   finally,     the    plaintiffs'    intentional\n\ninfliction claims require proof not only that the FBI's conduct was\n\nsomething akin to malicious, but also that it was extreme and\n\noutrageous.       Agis, 355 N.E.2d at 318.              These are substantive\n\ndistinctions.        See Foley v. Polaroid Corp., 508 N.E.2d 72, 82\n\n(Mass. 1987).\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\f            We conclude that the conduct underlying the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims for intentional infliction of emotional distress neither\n\ncomprises    malicious    prosecution     nor    arises   out     of   malicious\n\nprosecution in the requisite sense.7\n\n            The government labors to undercut this reasoning by\n\nnoting that the plaintiffs pleaded claims of malicious prosecution\n\narising out of essentially the same facts that supported their\n\nintentional    infliction     claims.      The    plaintiffs'      intentional\n\ninfliction     claims,      they   suggest,       are     barred       by   this\n\ncharacterization.\n\n            This suggestion is more cry than wool.              The plaintiffs\n\nhad the right to plead alternative theories of liability, see Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 8(d), and their exercise of that right did not debar\n\nthem from an independent review of each set of claims.                 See Dedham\n\nWater Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 889 F.2d 1146, 1157-58\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            In a related vein, the government posits that because the\n\ndistrict court found that the same damages flowed from both the\n\nalleged     malicious    prosecution    and      the    alleged    intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 245\n\n& n.208, the latter claims necessarily arise out of the former.\n\nThis is sophistry, pure and simple.             The proper inquiry focuses\n\n\n     7\n       The district court's finding of malicious prosecution does\nnot require a different result. That finding was incorrect as a\nmatter of law, see supra Part II(A), and is entitled to no weight.\n\n                                   -28-\n\fupon the actor's tortious conduct, not the plaintiff's damages.\n\nSee Truman, 26 F.3d at 595; Gross, 676 F.2d at 304; Black, 564 F.2d\n\nat 540-41; see also Rayonier Inc. v. United States, 352 U.S. 315,\n\n320 (1957) (warning against \"read[ing] exemptions into the [FTCA]\n\nbeyond those provided by Congress\").\n\n            To say more on this point would be supererogatory.             We\n\nhold that, section 2680(h) notwithstanding, the district court had\n\nsubject     matter    jurisdiction    to    adjudicate   the   claims   for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n            2.     The Merits.    To make out a claim for intentional\n\ninfliction    of     emotional   distress   under   Massachusetts   law,    a\n\nclaimant must prove:\n\n            (1) that the [defendant] intended to inflict\n            emotional distress or that he knew or should\n            have known that emotional distress was the\n            likely result of his conduct; (2) that the\n            conduct was extreme and outrageous, was beyond\n            all possible bounds of decency and was utterly\n            intolerable in a civilized community; (3) that\n            the actions of the defendant were the cause of\n            the plaintiff's distress; and (4) that the\n            emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff\n            was severe and of a nature that no reasonable\n            man could be expected to endure it.\n\nAgis, 355 N.E.2d at 318-19 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     The court below determined that the plaintiffs had\n\nproven these four elements by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nLimone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.          In the court's view, the FBI\n\nhad participated willingly in framing the scapegoats, and then\n\nscrambled to cover up the frame job by obstructing the scapegoats'\n\n                                     -29-\n\fefforts to clear their names.           Id.   The court found this conduct\n\n\"intentional,\" \"outrageous,\" \"beyond all bounds of decency,\" and to\n\nhave \"no place in a civilized community.\"               Id.    The consequent\n\nemotional distress was \"so severe and of such a nature that no\n\nreasonable person could be expected to endure it.\"              Id.\n\n              The government raises a host of record-based challenges\n\nto this series of findings.           Because these appeals follow a bench\n\ntrial, we review the lower court's factfinding for clear error.\n\nCumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.\n\n1990); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).            Consonant with that standard, we\n\nwill not \"upset findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom\n\nunless, on the whole of the record, we form a strong, unyielding\n\nbelief that a mistake has been made.\"           Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152.\n\n              As a threshold matter, the government questions whether\n\nwe should use an unadulterated standard of clear-error review.              It\n\nregards this standard as inapposite because the district court\n\nrelied principally upon documentary evidence in constructing its\n\nfindings and conclusions.        We reject that argument out of hand.\n\n              In Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, the Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether, under Rule 52(a), an appellate tribunal may\n\nreview   de    novo   findings   of    fact   not   bottomed   on   credibility\n\ndeterminations.       470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).       The Court concluded\n\nthat the clearly erroneous standard loses none of its vigor \"even\n\nwhen the [lower] court's findings do not rest on credibility\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fdeterminations, but are based instead on physical or documentary\n\nevidence or inferences from other facts.\"               Id. at 574.         The\n\napplication of clear-error review to findings drawn from a paper\n\nrecord has long been the practice in this circuit.                 See, e.g.,\n\nReliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 575, 576\n\n(1st Cir. 1989); Boroff v. Tully (In re Tully), 818 F.2d 106, 108-\n\n09 (1st Cir. 1987).      That is the practice to which we adhere today.\n\n           With the standard of review nailed down, we turn to the\n\ngovernment's      multi-faceted    critique      of    the     trial   court's\n\nfactfinding.      To begin, the government takes umbrage with the\n\ncourt's conclusion that the FBI's misconduct was extreme and\n\noutrageous.      But that conclusion seems rock-solid: it is premised\n\non the court's determination that FBI agents knowingly participated\n\nin the events leading to the wrongful indictment, prosecution,\n\nconviction, and continued incarceration of the scapegoats.                Limone\n\nIV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.           This determination rests on three\n\nbuilding blocks: that the FBI (i) knew Barboza was dissembling when\n\nhe implicated the scapegoats in Deegan's murder; (ii) assisted\n\nBarboza in selling his lies to state authorities and encouraged him\n\nto stick to them; and (iii) covered up its misdeeds post-conviction\n\nby   hindering    the   scapegoats'    efforts   to   obtain    relief.     The\n\ngovernment challenges each of these building blocks.\n\n           As an initial matter, the district court's determination\n\nthat FBI agents knew that the scapegoats were strangers to the\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fDeegan slaying is not a necessary prerequisite to its finding of\n\nextreme and outrageous conduct.      The SJC has made pellucid that\n\nsuch a finding may be grounded either on actual knowledge or on a\n\ndefendant's deliberate disregard of a substantial probability that\n\nhis actions will produce severe emotional distress.        Simon v.\n\nSolomon, 431 N.E.2d 556, 561-62 (Mass. 1982); see Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. i (1965).    Thus, the FBI may not hide\n\nbehind an assertion that it remained (wilfully) blind to the\n\nscapegoats' innocence.     And though actual knowledge is not a\n\nnecessary finding, the district court's finding of actual knowledge\n\nis obviously sufficient.\n\n          Moreover, that finding is unassailable.        The record\n\ncontains adequate evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could\n\nconclude — as did the district court — that the FBI knew that the\n\nscapegoats were not involved in the slaying.\n\n          The   district    court     painstakingly   reviewed   the\n\nintelligence in the FBI's possession at the relevant time.       See\n\nLimone IV, 497 Supp. 2d at 172-77.    In the days and months leading\n\nup to Deegan's murder, the FBI learned from the Patriarca bug and\n\nfrom its Top Echelon informants that Barboza and Flemmi — not\n\nLimone or Tameleo — had requested permission to murder Deegan and\n\nthat Patriarca (the head of the LCN) had blessed the hit.    On the\n\nday following the murder, a highly reliable Top Echelon informant\n\ntold agent Rico that Flemmi had bragged about killing Deegan with\n\n\n                               -32-\n\fthe   help   of   French,   Martin,   Cassesso,   and   Barboza.   This\n\nenumeration of the participants in the murder was repeated and\n\nconfirmed through various informants and conversations picked up by\n\nthe Patriarca bug.      Much of this information was catalogued in\n\nmemoranda, airtels, and correlator reports,8 a number of which were\n\neither authored or initialed as read by Rico and Condon.           Under\n\nthese circumstances, one would have to believe in the tooth fairy\n\nto believe that the agents did not know the identities of the real\n\nkillers.\n\n             Relatedly, Barboza's accusation that Limone and Tameleo\n\nhad orchestrated the hit did not jibe with information that the FBI\n\nhad gleaned from the Patriarca bug.       When requesting Patriarca's\n\npermission to carry out the hit, Barboza and Flemmi made no mention\n\nof any prior authorization given by Limone and Tameleo.            And,\n\ntellingly, the Patriarca bug showed that Limone, rather than\n\nordering the hit, had tried to warn Deegan that violence might be\n\nin the offing.       Rico and Condon turned a blind eye to these\n\ncontradictions.\n\n             There is other evidence as well.       When Barboza first\n\nspoke with Rico and Condon in March of 1967, he made it plain that\n\nhe would not incriminate Flemmi. The FBI had reliable intelligence\n\n\n      8\n       An airtel is an inter-office FBI communique sent between a\nlocal field office and FBI headquarters. A correlator report is a\ndocument that summarizes all the pertinent information possessed by\na field office concerning a particular person or subject.\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\flinking Flemmi to the Deegan murder; Barboza's enumeration of a\n\ncast of participants that did not include Flemmi, especially when\n\ncoupled with his avowed intent to shield Flemmi, surely should have\n\nconvinced the agents that they were not getting the whole story.\n\n            What is more, a local police officer had seen a balding\n\nindividual matching Flemmi's description in the back seat of\n\nMartin's car at around the time of the killing.       When Barboza\n\nlearned of the officer's observations, he suddenly \"remembered\"\n\nthat Salvati, whom he had previously placed in the back seat of\n\nMartin's automobile, was wearing a bald wig. Given what the agents\n\nknew, this convenient improvisation was a red flag that should have\n\ntriggered their suspicions.\n\n            Indeed, there is compelling reason to believe that FBI\n\nagents assented to the omission of Flemmi's name in order to\n\nfurther their own agenda. After all, the FBI formally targeted him\n\nas a Top Echelon informant three days prior to Deegan's murder and\n\nofficially assigned him to Rico on the very day that Deegan was\n\nkilled.   An FBI memorandum written in June of that year rated the\n\nquality of Flemmi's information as good.       Even after the FBI\n\ndropped Flemmi from the ranks of its informants in September of\n\n1965, it had a powerful incentive to keep him out of prison; his\n\nbrother, Stephen, became a Top Echelon informant around that time\n\nand remained in that status for many years.   See Flemmi, 225 F.3d\n\nat 80-82.\n\n\n                                -34-\n\f           The FBI's willingness to accept Barboza's narrative at\n\nface value is especially troubling because Barboza exhibited a\n\nsimilar lack of consistency in his account of Greco's supposed\n\ninvolvement in the crime.        When law enforcement officers were\n\nunable to corroborate Barboza's insistence that Greco was present\n\nat the Ebb Tide and had left with the rest of the men that Barboza\n\nhad fingered, Barboza reversed his field and claimed to have\n\n\"remembered\" that Greco joined the others at a later time.\n\n           From this and other information in the record, it is\n\ntransparently clear that the district court had a sturdy foundation\n\nfor its finding that the FBI knew at the time that Barboza's story\n\nwas riddled with inconsistencies.        The court was entitled to view\n\nthat knowledge in light of a wealth of FBI intelligence indicating\n\nthat the scapegoats were not part of the band of miscreants who\n\ncarried out the murder plot. Although the evidence does not compel\n\nthe   conclusion   that   the   FBI   knew   that   the   scapegoats   were\n\nuninvolved, it is enough to ground a reasonable inference to that\n\neffect.\n\n           The government likewise challenges the district court's\n\ndetermination that the FBI aided Barboza in framing the scapegoats.\n\nIn this regard, the government argues that the FBI did no more than\n\ngift-wrap Barboza and hand him over to state authorities (who then\n\nmade an independent decision to prosecute the scapegoats).             The\n\n\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\frecord supports the district court's determination regarding the\n\nFBI's culpability.\n\n            To be sure, there is no evidence that the FBI spoon-fed\n\nthe scapegoats' names to Barboza.           For aught that appears, the\n\nfictional tale sprang directly from the informant's brow.                   But\n\nthere is evidence that, once Barboza gave the scapegoats' names to\n\nthe Suffolk County detectives, the FBI assisted him in doctoring\n\nhis tale to make it seem more believable.         For example, as we have\n\nsaid,    Barboza    modified   his   initial   version   of   the   facts    to\n\naccommodate other information possessed by the authorities.                 The\n\ndistrict    court   concluded   that   Barboza   made    these   alterations\n\nbecause the FBI had made him aware of contradictory evidence in the\n\nhands of state officials.       Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 179-80.9\n\n            There was also evidence tending to show that the FBI\n\nhelped to \"sell\" Barboza's tale both to state authorities and to\n\nthe jury. The prosecutor, Zalkind, testified that the FBI had told\n\nhim that Barboza's account \"checked out.\"          Agent Condon testified\n\nat the murder trial, vouchsafing that he was careful not to impart\n\nany information about the murder investigation to Barboza because\n\n\n\n     9\n       The government seizes upon a statement in the district\ncourt's opinion suggesting that state officials may have shared in\nthe responsibility for showing Barboza their investigative files.\nSee Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 180 (\"Someone in law enforcement\nhad to have done so, either the FBI directly or state law\nenforcement in the FBI's presence.\"). But the court's opinion,\nfairly read, attributes primary responsibility for shoring up\nBarboza's testimony to the FBI. See, e.g., id. at 179, 180.\n\n                                     -36-\n\fhe (Condon) always was concerned about assuring the \"purity\" of\n\ntestimony   given    by   his    informants.     But    the    district    court\n\nrejected this testimony and supportably found that Condon knew at\n\nthe time that Barboza was spinning a yarn about the scapegoats'\n\ninvolvement in the murder.        Id. at 186.\n\n            Equally as important, the FBI interposed no disincentives\n\nthat might have deterred Barboza from standing by his bogus story.\n\nThe Bureau continued to coddle Barboza.              Among other things, the\n\nFBI pledged to bring Barboza's cooperation to the attention of\n\nrelevant authorities, extended protection to him and his family,\n\nand promised to give him money and a fresh start on the other side\n\nof the continent. The \"habitual offender\" charges that Barboza was\n\nfacing when he first began cooperating were dropped, and Barboza\n\nreceived only a one-year sentence for his role in Deegan's murder.\n\n            The     government     attempts     to     absolve     itself      of\n\nresponsibility for the scapegoats' plight by piously asserting that\n\nthe FBI turned over all relevant information to state authorities.\n\nIn this regard, it points to three memoranda.                  The first is a\n\nmemorandum from the FBI director dated March 16, 1965, which\n\ninstructs the Boston office to disclose to local authorities\n\ninformation pertaining to the Deegan murder to the extent that\n\ndivulgement   is    consistent     with   the   complete      security    of   the\n\nPatriarca bug. A handwritten notation on that memorandum indicates\n\nthat full disclosure already had taken place.                   The second, a\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fmemorandum authored by Rico on March 15, 1965, indicates that a Top\n\nEchelon      informant    had    told   him   that   Flemmi,   French,    Martin,\n\nCassesso, and Barboza had murdered Deegan, and states that this\n\ninformation had been transmitted to local authorities.                The third\n\nis a memorandum written on March 24 of the same year by the special\n\nagent   in    charge     of   the   FBI's   Boston   office;   that   memorandum\n\nessentially replicates the Rico memorandum.\n\n              On their face, these memoranda bolster the government's\n\nargument. But the memoranda do not exist in a vacuum. The district\n\ncourt found that, to the extent the FBI did volunteer information\n\nto state authorities in 1965, that information was general in nature\n\nand already within the state's ken.            See id. at 174-75 & n.73.        This\n\nfinding was not clearly erroneous.              The local police had Flemmi,\n\nFrench, Martin, Cassesso, and Barboza in their sights from the\n\nearliest stages of their investigation, and the three FBI memoranda,\n\nwhether read separately or in the ensemble, do not suggest that the\n\nreliability of the FBI's sources was communicated to the state.                  To\n\nthe   contrary,     the       director's    memorandum   instructed      that   the\n\nPatriarca bug remain secret.\n\n              The gaps in the record are also telling.            For instance,\n\nthere is absolutely no evidence indicating that the Boston-based FBI\n\nagents, whatever instructions they may have received, actually\n\ndivulged any information to state officials at the time of the\n\nkilling in March 1965 or during Barboza's debriefing in 1967 and\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\f1968.    In fact the state prosecutor, Zalkind, testified in the\n\ndistrict court that he had not seen any of the FBI documents\n\ncontaining exculpatory evidence when he forged ahead with the\n\nprosecution.        He   also   denied   that   this    evidence     had    been\n\ncommunicated to him in any other form.          Given Zalkind's testimony,\n\nwe cannot set aside the district court's finding that the FBI agents\n\nfailed to provide relevant exculpatory information.                 See, e.g.,\n\nUnited   States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(emphasizing that \"the district court must be given wide rein to\n\nassess the evidence and judge the credibility of witnesses\").\n\n           The district court's finding that the FBI covered up its\n\nperfidy by stonewalling the scapegoats' post-conviction efforts to\n\nwin their freedom is equally unimpugnable.             The government argues\n\nthat the alleged coverup consisted of nothing more than a failure\n\nto provide state officials with exculpatory materials and that such\n\na failure cannot ground a claim under the FTCA.               See Bolduc, 402\n\nF.3d at 59 (holding that negligent failure to disclose Brady\n\nmaterials is not actionable); see also Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S.\n\n83, 87 (1963).      This argument veers well wide of the mark.             Here,\n\nthe government's post-conviction misconduct consisted of more than\n\nfailing to turn over exculpatory materials to state authorities; the\n\ngovernment   took    positive   steps    to   ensure   that   the   scapegoats\n\nremained behind bars.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f            For example, in mid-1970 Barboza, represented by new\n\ncounsel, signed a sworn affidavit in which he recanted certain\n\nportions of his trial testimony relating to the scapegoats' guilt.\n\nHis lawyer then requested permission to have a lie detector test\n\nadministered.     Shortly thereafter, two federal prosecutors visited\n\nBarboza,   who    retracted     his   recantation.        Despite   the   obvious\n\nimportance of these developments, the FBI agents failed either to\n\nconduct an investigation into the recantation or to brief their\n\nstate counterparts about it.\n\n            Other examples abound.         Among other things, the FBI told\n\nstate authorities who were considering petitions for commutation\n\nand/or parole that Limone, Greco, and Salvati had continuing ties\n\nto organized crime.       The FBI even went so far as to have agents\n\nvisit the office of a parole board member to voice opposition to\n\nLimone's petition for commutation.              Moreover, the record makes\n\nmanifest that the court below regarded the Brady violation (that is,\n\nthe FBI's failure to disclose exculpatory information in a timely\n\nmanner) as \"part of a broader scheme to put Barboza forward as a\n\nwitness    no    matter   the   cost,    even   if   it    meant    framing   the\n\nplaintiffs.\"      Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 222.          The government's\n\nafter-the-fact attempt to conceal what it had done became part of\n\nthe same scheme.      Id. at 202.\n\n            The SJC has made it abundantly clear that claims for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress may be founded on a\n\n\n                                        -40-\n\fpattern of misconduct.       See, e.g., Boyle v. Wenk, 392 N.E.2d 1053,\n\n1055 (Mass. 1979). Thus, it was appropriate for the district court,\n\non a pattern of conduct theory, to weigh the significance of the\n\nFBI's   failure     to   provide   state     authorities    with   exculpatory\n\nevidence.     See, e.g., Burrell v. Adkins, No. 01-2679, 2007 WL\n\n4699166, at *18 (W.D. La. Oct. 22, 2007).\n\n            The evidence supports the district court's finding that\n\na coverup occurred.         Despite contemporaneous requests by state\n\nofficials for information bearing upon the scapegoats' petitions for\n\npost-conviction relief, the FBI remained mute — and worse.               That\n\nrecalcitrance is especially damning in the circumstances of this\n\ncase — a case in which the FBI's deliberate misconduct had placed\n\nthe scapegoats in harm's way.          See Commonwealth v. Levesque, 766\n\nN.E.2d 50, 56 (Mass. 2002) (explaining that \"a duty to prevent harm\n\nto others arises when one creates a dangerous situation, whether\n\nthat    situation    was    created    intentionally       or   negligently\");\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 321 (1965) (similar).\n\n            To recapitulate, the district court supportably determined\n\nthat the FBI knew that the scapegoats were uninvolved in the Deegan\n\nmurder from the moment that Barboza implicated them. The FBI agents\n\nnonetheless assisted Barboza in embellishing his apocryphal tale,\n\nhelped him to sell that tale to state authorities and the jury, and\n\ncovered up their perfidy by stonewalling the scapegoats' petitions\n\nfor post-conviction relief.        The district court concluded that this\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fpattern of conduct was extreme and outrageous, Limone IV, 497 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 227, and we may upset that conclusion only if reasonable\n\nminds would be compelled to reach the opposite conclusion, see\n\nJackson, 156 F.3d at 232-33; see also Boyle, 392 N.E.2d at 1056-57.\n\nApplying that standard, the conclusion that the government indulged\n\nin extreme and outrageous conduct must stand.                See, e.g., Pitt v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 491 F.3d 494, 506 (D.C. Cir. 2007); Wagenmann v.\n\nAdams, 829 F.2d 196, 214 (1st Cir. 1987); Newton v. City of New\n\nYork, 566 F. Supp. 2d 256, 281 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); Harris v. Harvin,\n\nNo. 01-2292, 2005 WL 2461876, at *2 (Mass. Super. Ct. Aug. 4, 2005);\n\nSarvis v. Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co., No. 94-1215, 1994 WL\n\n879797, at *3 (Mass. Super. Ct. June 6, 1994).\n\n            We    need    not     linger     long     over    the   finding     of\n\nintentionality.        Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.           Common sense\n\nsuggests that the FBI's deliberate acts and omissions were likely\n\nto   lead   to   the   wrongful   conviction        and   incarceration   of   the\n\nscapegoats (and, thus, the consequent emotional distress).                That is\n\nexactly what transpired.          Accordingly, the district court had an\n\nample predicate from which to infer that the FBI knew that its\n\nmisconduct was likely to cause emotional distress.                   See, e.g.,\n\nWagenmann, 829 F.2d at 214.\n\n            In a variation on this theme, the government contends that\n\nit cannot be held legally responsible for causing the emotional\n\ndistress that occurred here.        All that the FBI did, it reasons, was\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fto hand a witness to state authorities, who then exercised their\n\nindependent discretion in bringing that witness before a grand jury\n\nand a petit jury.    In the government's view, the state's decision\n\nto pursue the murder case and the trial jurors' decision to convict\n\nare intervening acts that broke the causal chain.\n\n            Causation is a factbound issue and, as such, is normally\n\nleft to the trier.    Peckham v. Cont'l Cas. Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830,\n\n837 (1st Cir. 1990); Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 449 N.E.2d 331,\n\n338 (Mass. 1983).    The causation inquiry has two components: proof\n\nthat the harm would not have occurred but for the defendant's\n\nmisconduct, see Glidden v. Maglio, 722 N.E.2d 971, 974-75 (Mass.\n\n2000), and proof that the defendant was a proximate cause of the\n\nharm, see Kent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. 2002).\n\nThese two components may be thought of as causation in fact and\n\nlegal causation.\n\n            In this instance, the district court's causation-in-fact\n\nanalysis, Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227, is ironclad. Given the\n\naid   and   encouragement   that   the   FBI   afforded   Barboza   and   its\n\nexclusive possession of exculpatory evidence that probably would\n\nhave rescued the scapegoats from wrongful conviction, the finding\n\nthat the FBI's misconduct constituted a but-for cause of the\n\nscapegoats' plight is fully sustainable. See Burke v. McDonald, 572\n\nF.3d 51, 58 (1st Cir. 2009) (ruling that police officer could be\n\n\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fsaid to have \"caused\" plaintiff's confinement without bail if jury\n\nfound that he suppressed exonerating DNA evidence).\n\n          The second component of the causation inquiry requires\n\nelaboration. Under Massachusetts law, proximate cause turns largely\n\non the foreseeability of the harm.10     See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at\n\n214; Kent, 771 N.E.2d at 777.     Intervening acts of a third party\n\nwill not break the causal chain if those acts were reasonably\n\nforeseeable.    Copithorne v. Framingham Union Hosp., 520 N.E.2d 139,\n\n142-43 (Mass. 1988); Gidwani v. Wasserman, 365 N.E.2d 827, 830-31\n\n(Mass. 1977).\n\n          In the case at bar, the district court concluded that the\n\nindictment, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration were all\n\nreasonably foreseeable results of the FBI's misconduct.   Limone IV,\n\n497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.     That conclusion strikes us as virtually\n\ninescapable.     The so-called \"intervening acts\" — notably, the\n\nstate's decision to prosecute and the jury's decision to convict —\n\nwere well within the realm of reasonable expectations once the\n\ngovernment took steps to prop up Barboza's credibility and conceal\n\nexculpatory evidence.    See Burke, 572 F.3d at 58-61.\n\n\n\n     10\n        The most recent draft restatement suggests that an\nintentional tortfeasor should be deemed the legal cause of any harm\nthat he intends to inflict without reference to the foreseeability\nof that harm.    See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical Harms § 33 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005). The SJC\nhas not spoken to this proposal and, given the foreseeability of\nthe harm flowing from the FBI's misconduct, we need not decide\nwhether section 33 applies here.\n\n                                 -44-\n\f            This leaves the fourth and final element of the tort: that\n\nthe scapegoats suffered severe emotional distress.             The government\n\ndoes not challenge the district court's finding to this effect, nor\n\ncould it credibly do so.        On this record, it is unarguable that the\n\nwrongful indictment, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration\n\ncaused the victims severe emotional distress.                 Therefore, the\n\nplaintiffs satisfied their burden of proving all the elements of\n\ntheir claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.11\n\n              C.    The Discretionary Function Exception.\n\n            Regardless of the invulnerability of the district court's\n\nfindings on the elements of the intentional infliction claims, we\n\nmust    address    yet    another   issue   bearing   upon   liability.   The\n\ngovernment invokes the FTCA's discretionary function exception as a\n\nfurther defense.         It argues, in essence, that the conduct on which\n\n\n\n       11\n        In Massachusetts, a cause of action for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress may succeed only if the defendant\nhas intentionally inflicted severe emotional distress \"without\nprivilege.\"   Agis, 355 N.E.2d at 318.     The government did not\nargue, either in the district court or in its briefs on appeal,\nthat its conduct was privileged. Consequently, its assertion of\nprivilege for the first time at oral argument in this court is too\nlittle and too late. See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30\n(1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not\npresented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it\nin the court of appeals.\"); Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900\nF.2d 388, 397 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that an appellant's briefs\nfix the scope of the issues appealed and that, therefore, an\nappellant cannot breathe life into an omitted theory merely by\nreferring to it at oral argument); see also McCullen v. Coakley,\n571 F.3d 167, 182 (1st Cir. 2009) (holding that theory advanced by\na member of the court at oral argument, but neither briefed nor\nraised below, is waived).\n\n                                      -45-\n\fthe intentional infliction claims is based involves the performance\n\nor   failure       to   perform     discretionary        functions       on   the    part   of\n\ngovernment actors.           See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a); see also Irving v.\n\nUnited States, 162 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc).\n\n              We    afford     de     novo    review         to    a    district     court's\n\ndetermination that the discretionary function exception does or does\n\nnot apply.     Fothergill v. United States, 566 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Irving, 162 F.3d at 162.                        We start by identifying the\n\nparticular     conduct       giving    rise       to   the   claims      at   issue.        See\n\nFothergill, 566 F.3d at 252-53; Muñiz-Rivera v. United States, 326\n\nF.3d   8, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).                  Here, that conduct consists of\n\nassisting Barboza to frame the scapegoats for a capital crime and\n\ncovering up the frame job by withholding exculpatory information\n\nfrom state officials.\n\n              Having identified the conduct at issue, we move to a\n\nbinary inquiry designed to reveal whether Congress sought to shield\n\nthat conduct from liability.            Bolduc, 402 F.3d at 60.                This inquiry\n\nseeks to ascertain, first, if the conduct \"involves an element of\n\njudgment or choice\" for the actor.                  Berkovitz v. United States, 486\n\nU.S. 531, 536 (1988).               Then, so long as the conduct involved a\n\nmatter   of    judgment      or     choice    —     that     is,   so   long    as   it     was\n\ndiscretionary in nature — the inquiry seeks to ascertain whether\n\nthat judgment or choice was susceptible to policy-related analysis.\n\nId. at 536-37.\n\n\n                                             -46-\n\f              It is elementary that the discretionary function exception\n\ndoes    not   immunize       the   government    from     liability   for   actions\n\nproscribed by federal statute or regulation.                   Bolduc, 402 F.3d at\n\n60.    Nor does it shield conduct that transgresses the Constitution.\n\nSee Castro v. United States, 560 F.3d 381, 389 (5th Cir. 2009)\n\n(collecting cases); Thames Shipyard & Repair Co. v. United States,\n\n350 F.3d 247, 254-55 (1st Cir. 2003) (same).                   The district court\n\ndetermined      that   the    FBI's   conduct    in     this   case   violated   the\n\nConstitution as well as Department of Justice guidelines.                   Limone\n\nIV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 203-04.\n\n              The   government      demurs.       It     insists   that   decisions\n\nconcerning the conduct and course of law enforcement investigations,\n\nincluding decisions as to whether and how informants should be\n\nemployed, are generally discretionary.                 See, e.g., Kelly v. United\n\nStates, 924 F.2d 355, 362 (1st Cir. 1991); Pooler v. United States,\n\n787 F.2d 868, 871 (3d Cir. 1986).             Relatedly, the government argues\n\nthat it possessed discretion to withhold exculpatory information\n\nfrom state prosecutors in order to protect the security of its\n\nsources.      See, e.g., Ga. Cas. & Sur. Co. v. United States, 823 F.2d\n\n260, 262-63 (8th Cir. 1987); see also Taglianetti v. United States,\n\n398 F.2d 558, 572 (1st Cir. 1968) (recognizing that government\n\npossesses \"substantial interest in preserving the secrecy of its\n\ninvestigation\").         Given      these     foundational      propositions,    the\n\ngovernment exhorts us to conclude that the conduct upon which the\n\n\n                                        -47-\n\fplaintiffs' intentional infliction claims rests must perforce be\n\ndiscretionary.\n\n               This    exhortation    operates    at    too    high    a    level     of\n\ngenerality.       Viewed from 50,000 feet, virtually any action can be\n\ncharacterized as discretionary.             But the discretionary function\n\nexception requires that an inquiring court focus on the specific\n\nconduct at issue.          See Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 546-47; Trevino v.\n\nGen. Dynamics Corp., 865 F.2d 1474, 1484 (5th Cir. 1989).                         Here,\n\nwhen the FBI's conduct is examined in context, warts and all, any\n\nillusion that the conduct was discretionary is quickly dispelled.\n\n               To use a phrase popularly attributed to Lawrence \"Yogi\"\n\nBerra, much of this is déjà vu all over again.12                 In Limone II, we\n\nheld    that     the    plaintiffs'    allegations      that    FBI    agents        had\n\nparticipated in framing them and had withheld exculpatory evidence\n\nto cover up their malefactions stated a clear violation of due\n\nprocess.      372 F.3d at 44-50.      The plaintiffs proved the substance of\n\nthese       allegations.     See   Limone   IV,   497    F.    Supp.   2d    at     227.\n\nConsequently, the conduct was unconstitutional and, therefore, not\n\nwithin the sweep of the discretionary function exception.13\n\n\n       12\n       But see Ralph Keyes, Nice Guys Finish Seventh; Phrases,\nSpurious Sayings and Familiar Misquotations 152 (1992) (noting that\n\"although this [phrase] is commonly cited as a 'Berra-ism,' Yogi\nBerra denies ever saying it\").\n       13\n        In so holding, we do not view the FBI's constitutional\ntransgressions as corresponding to the plaintiffs' causes of action\n— after all, the plaintiffs' claims are not Bivens claims — but\nrather, as negating the discretionary function defense.         See\n\n                                        -48-\n\f           This   holding   ends    our   discussion   of   liability.    We\n\nconclude   that   the   district      court     possessed   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims for intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress and that the plaintiffs proved those claims.\n\nBecause the district court determined that the same damages flowed\n\nfrom all of the torts alleged, we need not inquire whether the\n\nplaintiffs also proved their claims of conspiracy, negligence,\n\nand/or negligent supervision.       Only questions pertaining to damages\n\nremain.\n\n                              D.     Damages.\n\n           The district court made the damage awards listed in the\n\nappendix to this opinion.      These awards total $101,750,000.          The\n\ngovernment argues that the court's approach was wrongheaded and that\n\nthe assessed damages are excessive.         In a cross-appeal Greco's son,\n\nEdward, contends that the court awarded him insufficient damages.\n\n           The weight of authority indicates that damage awards under\n\nthe FTCA are subject to clear-error review.            See, e.g., Davis v.\n\nUnited States, 375 F.3d 590, 591 (7th Cir. 2004); Lebron v. United\n\nStates, 279 F.3d 321, 325 (5th Cir. 2002); Duplan v. Harper, 188\n\nF.3d 1195, 1202 (10th Cir. 1999); Whitley v. United States, 170 F.3d\n\n1061, 1079 (11th Cir. 1999); Bartleson v. United States, 96 F.3d\n\n1270, 1274 (9th Cir. 1996).        This court has lent its voice to that\n\n\n\nBolduc, 402 F.3d at 56 (\"Federal constitutional or statutory law\ncannot function as the source of FTCA liability.\").\n\n                                     -49-\n\fchorus.   See Soto v. United States, 11 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nBut this description oversimplifies the matter.          The standard of\n\nreview, at least insofar as it pertains to awards of non-economic\n\ndamages, is more nuanced.    See Neyer v. United States, 845 F.2d 641,\n\n644-45 (6th Cir. 1988).\n\n           In   that   context,   the   appropriate   standard   of   review\n\nactually has three facets.        Raw findings of fact are reviewed for\n\nclear error.    Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 166 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).    Claimed errors of law engender de novo review.          Soto, 11\n\nF.3d at 17.     The third facet of the standard of review relates to\n\nmatters of judgment, which are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Davis, 375 F.3d at 592 (using language consistent with abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard); Soto, 11 F.3d at 18 (similar).\n\n           These differentiated aspects of the standard of review are\n\ndesigned to operate in a synchronized fashion.          Thus, in an FTCA\n\ncase that involves non-economic damages, an appellate court reviews\n\nfacts found by the trial judge (such as the existence and nature of\n\nthe harm suffered) for clear error.        See Doe v. United States, 976\n\nF.2d 1071, 1083 (7th Cir. 1992); Reilly, 863 F.2d at 166.             At the\n\nsame time, the court assays the reasonableness of the trial judge's\n\nmonetization of that harm — a classic example of a judgment call —\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard.          See Wilkinson v. United\n\nStates, 564 F.3d 927, 934 (8th Cir. 2009).       Within that rubric, the\n\ncourt evaluates the trial judge's assumptions as to purely legal\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\fmatters de novo.     Cf. Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernández, 350 F.3d\n\n219, 221 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that, in the preliminary\n\ninjunction   context,    an    error      of    law   is   a     per   se   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion).   We apply this nuanced standard of review in examining\n\nthe damage awards about which the government complains.\n\n          We   cut   directly       to    the   chase.     The   district    court's\n\nfindings of fact as to the existence, nature, and quantum of the\n\nharm sustained by the scapegoats are not clearly erroneous — indeed,\n\nthose findings are largely uncontested on appeal.                      Our inquiry,\n\ntherefore,   centers    on    the   reasonableness         of    the   awards.      As\n\nexplained above, abuse of discretion review applies to that issue.\n\n          Under abuse of discretion review, an appellate court ought\n\nnot disturb an award of non-economic damages unless the award is\n\neither grossly disproportionate to the proven injuries or trenches\n\nupon a miscarriage of justice.             See Wilkinson, 564 F.3d at 934;\n\nNeyer, 845 F.2d at 644; see also Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 553\n\nF.3d 121, 144 (1st Cir. 2009) (discussing gross disproportionality\n\nin remittitur context); doCanto v. Ametek, Inc., 328 N.E.2d 873, 880\n\n(Mass. 1975) (similar).       Though this standard is daunting, we have\n\nthe authority to reduce a judge's award of non-economic damages if\n\nthat award is so extravagant as to shock our collective conscience.\n\nSee, e.g., Delph v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Paragould, Inc., 130\n\nF.3d 349, 357-58 (8th Cir. 1997); Trevino v. United States, 804 F.2d\n\n1512, 1515 (9th Cir. 1986).\n\n\n                                         -51-\n\f              We approach the awards at issue here mindful that, in an\n\nFTCA case, both the nature of allowable damages and the measure of\n\nthose damages are drawn from state law.           Davis, 375 F.3d at 591;\n\nLebron, 279 F.3d at 326 n.4.         Under Massachusetts law, the proper\n\nmeasure of damages is, within wide limits, committed to the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trier of fact.        See Bartley v. Phillips, 57 N.E.2d\n\n26, 31 (Mass. 1944).\n\n              Broad discretion, however, is not to be confused with\n\nunbounded discretion.        The SJC, recognizing the difficulty of\n\nplacing   a    particular   dollar   value   on   emotional    injuries,     has\n\nadmonished courts to strive to identify a sum that \"relate[s]\n\nreasonably to the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff.\"\n\nLabonte v. Hutchins & Wheeler, 678 N.E.2d 853, 861 (Mass. 1997).\n\nThat sum should approximate the amount that reasonable persons would\n\nconsider just recompense for the emotional distress inflicted.               Id.\n\nat 861 n.16.       Although the SJC has suggested that a comparison of\n\nagnate awards sometimes may be useful, it has stressed the paramount\n\nimportance of case-specific facts.          Id. at 861-62 & n.17.\n\n              With this framework in place, we turn to the particulars\n\nof the parties' challenges.\n\n              1.   The   Government's   Appeal.     As   a    prelude   to   the\n\nassessment of damages, the district court laboriously recounted the\n\ndetails of the scapegoats' lives behind bars.         See Limone IV, 497 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 235-41.       The government has not contested the court's\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fnarrative, and it is evident that the scapegoats suffered all the\n\nhardships customarily associated with prolonged prison confinement.\n\nThese hardships were magnified by their knowledge that they had been\n\nframed: all of them were forced to come to grips with the reality\n\nthat, innocence aside, they might live out their days in prison.                 To\n\nmake matters worse, three of the men — Limone, Tameleo, and Greco —\n\nspent the first few years after the trial in the grim shadow of\n\ndeath sentences.         All told, Limone and Salvati spent 33 and 29\n\nyears, respectively, in prison; Tameleo and Greco died in custody\n\nafter 18 and 28 years, respectively.14\n\n           After         considering      the        particular      individuals'\n\ncircumstances      and   consulting     damage       awards   in   other   wrongful\n\nincarceration cases, the district court determined that $1,000,000\n\nper year of immurement constituted the appropriate baseline for its\n\ncalculation   of    damages.      See    id.    at    243-45.      The   government\n\nmaintains that this baseline is overly generous and results in\n\ndamages that are grossly disproportionate to awards in comparable\n\ncases.    In the government's view, the district court should have\n\nlimited its comparability survey to cases arising in Massachusetts\n\nand, moreover, looked only to cases involving protracted periods of\n\nincarceration.      The government's theory seems to be that wrongful\n\n\n     14\n        Limone served the first seven years of his sentence and\nTameleo served the first five years of his sentence concurrent with\npreviously imposed sentences in unrelated cases.         Thus, the\ndistrict court declined to award either of them damages for those\nperiods. See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 245.\n\n                                        -53-\n\fincarceration gives rise to two distinct strains of emotional harm:\n\nthe initial jolt of wrongful imprisonment, and some (lesser) injury\n\nbased on the day-to-day loss of liberty.             It asserts that the\n\ndistrict court did not appreciate this important distinction; that\n\nthe court did not use any congeners involving protracted periods of\n\nincarceration; and that the court erred in not limiting its canvass\n\nto    Massachusetts inmates.     We find the government's reasoning\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n            To begin, the government uses faulty premises. On the one\n\nhand, its assertion that the district court did not look to awards\n\nrelated to lengthy periods of wrongful incarceration is incorrect as\n\na matter of fact.      See, e.g., id. at 244 (discussing a 15-year\n\nperiod of wrongful incarceration).        On the other hand, its parochial\n\ninsistence that the lower court should have restricted any inquiry\n\nto cases that arose within the borders of Massachusetts is incorrect\n\nas a matter of law.    Although we have said that helpful guidance may\n\nbe found in damage awards from \"similar cases arising out of the\n\nsame context that are tried in the same locale,\" Gutiérrez-Rodríguez\n\nv. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 579 (1st Cir. 1989), that does not mean\n\nthat a court is prohibited from looking for guidance elsewhere.         The\n\nkey    is   comparability:   whether   the    counterpart   cases   involve\n\nanalogous facts, similar measures of damages, and are otherwise\n\nfairly congruent.     See, e.g., Morrow v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 541\n\nF.2d 713, 721-22 (8th Cir. 1976).         On the whole, we are satisfied\n\n\n                                   -54-\n\fthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in looking to\n\nother cases for comparison.\n\n            Warming to the attack, the government touts a string of\n\nMassachusetts cases memorializing lesser awards. Without exception,\n\nhowever, these cases involve settlements, not verdicts.                     See, e.g.,\n\nCowans v. City of Boston, No. 05-11574, 2006 WL 4286744 (D. Mass.\n\nAug. 4, 2006); Miller v. City of Boston, No. 03-10805, 2006 WL\n\n4111728 (D. Mass. Mar. 9, 2006); Veláquez v. City of Chicopee, No.\n\n03-30249, 2005 WL 3839494 (D. Mass. Oct. 14, 2005); Harding v. City\n\nof Boston, No. 98-11801, 2000 WL 33223074 (D. Mass. Feb. 2000).                   But\n\nit is unrealistic to assume that settlement values (which, by\n\ndefinition, implicate compromise) equate to actual damages.                       See\n\nNeyer, 845 F.2d at 644.             This is a comparison of plums with\n\npomegranates.        Thus, these cases do not undercut the district\n\ncourt's baseline calculation.\n\n            The    government     also    seeks       to   undermine   the   district\n\ncourt's baseline by marshaling a series of legislative enactments\n\nthat impose ceilings on the liability of governmental entities for\n\nwrongful incarcerations.          See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §§ 1495, 2513(e)\n\n(limiting    government's     liability         for   wrongful   incarceration     of\n\nfederal prisoners to $50,000 per year, or to $100,000 per year in\n\ncapital cases); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258D, §§ 1, 5 (capping state's\n\nliability at $500,000 per incident).                  But these statutes do not\n\npurport     to    measure   the   harm     actually        inflicted   by    wrongful\n\n\n                                         -55-\n\fincarceration; rather, each reflects a legislative choice to limit\n\nthe sovereign's liability.      Congress could have imposed such a\n\nceiling on damages for wrongful incarceration under the FTCA but\n\nchose instead to make the United States liable to the same extent as\n\na private party under local law.     See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).    We\n\nhave neither the authority nor the inclination to veto this exercise\n\nof legislative judgment.\n\n            We turn next to the government's plaint that the ratio of\n\nemotional distress damages to years served should decrease over time\n\n(that is, that the longer an individual is in a penitentiary, the\n\nless he should receive in damages on an annualized basis).   That is\n\nan argument more appropriately made to the trier of fact.    There is\n\nno flat rule to that effect — nor should there be.           In some\n\ncircumstances, it may be reasonable to conclude that the loss of\n\nhope as time marches on warrants larger annualized amounts for\n\nemotional injuries.\n\n            In short, the range of permissible ratios is wide.     That\n\nis understandable; dollars are at best a rough and awkward proxy for\n\ntime spent in the throes of wrongful incarceration.     In the final\n\nanalysis, it is for the trier of fact to resolve the difficult\n\nquestions   of   quantification and monetization that lurk in the\n\npenumbra of cases such as this.    See Anderson v. Robinson, 497 F.2d\n\n120, 121 (5th Cir. 1974) (noting that court of appeals possesses \"no\n\nyardstick with which to measure . . . abstractions\").\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\f           Let us be perfectly clear.            There are limits to the trial\n\ncourt's discretion in this respect, but those limits are commodious.\n\nLangevine v. Dist. of Columbia, 106 F.3d 1018, 1024 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1997).     The    lower    court's      decision   to    use    a   sliding    scale,\n\ndecreasing    over    time,     would   be    within    the    encincture     of   that\n\ndiscretion.       So, too, is its decision not to use such a sliding\n\nscale.\n\n           This brings us to the damage awards themselves.                    We have\n\nsaid before, and today reaffirm, that \"there is no scientific\n\nformula or measuring device which can be applied to place a precise\n\ndollar value on matters such as restraint of freedom, fright,\n\nanxiety, loss of face, or emotional scarring.\"                 Wagenmann, 829 F.2d\n\nat 216.\n\n           The wisdom of that statement is evident here: placing a\n\ndollar    value      on   the    emotional      pain     incident     to    wrongful\n\nincarceration, the dreary sameness of life behind bars for years on\n\nend, and the loss of freedom, relationships, and hope cries out for\n\napproximation. Moreover, the difficulty inherent in monetization of\n\nthose injuries is itself a reason for deference to the front-line\n\njudgment of the trial court.                 Cf. Langevine, 106 F.3d at 1024\n\n(indicating that \"[a] court must be especially hesitant to disturb\n\na jury's determination of damages in cases involving intangible and\n\nnon-economic injuries\"); Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 215 (similar).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\fViewed through this prism, we cannot say that the district court's\n\nchoice of baseline was unreasonable.\n\n          We do not mean to imply that the methodology employed by\n\nthe district court in this case should be regarded as the norm, nor\n\ndo we suggest that it should be transplanted root and branch into\n\nother factual scenarios.     Were we sitting as trial judges, none of\n\nus would have employed that same methodology.           The $1,000,000 per\n\nyear baseline is extremely generous, and in cases involving non-\n\neconomic damages we have counseled that special attention must be\n\npaid to the particular circumstances of each individual plaintiff.\n\nSee, e.g., Tobin, 553 F.3d at 144-45.\n\n          But we are not sitting as trial judges in this instance.\n\nOur function is solely one of appellate review.           In carrying out\n\nthat task, we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for that\n\nof the trial court.   Rather, we must acknowledge the trial court's\n\nsuperior coign of vantage.\n\n          Moreover,   a   district   court,   sitting    without   a   jury,\n\npossesses a variety of implements with which to work in monetizing\n\nemotional injuries.   Although particular tools must be selected and\n\ndeployed with a degree of circumspection, the valuation difficulties\n\nposed by specific sets of facts also must be taken into account.\n\nGiven the extent of those difficulties here, the district court's\n\ndecision to reach into its armamentarium and select a per-year\n\n\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\fbaseline as the methodology of choice cannot be deemed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            That leaves the naked claim of excessiveness (a claim that\n\nencompasses the government's charge that $1,000,000 per year is\n\nsimply too rich).15      This question is not free from doubt.           The\n\ndistrict court's awards are considerably more munificent than the\n\namounts that this court would have awarded in the first instance.\n\nIn our view, the awards approach the outermost boundary of what\n\nmight be thought conscionable.      Cf. Baba-Ali v. State, 878 N.Y.S.2d\n\n555, 568 n.7 (N.Y. Ct. Cl. 2009) (chronicling awards of lesser\n\namounts).\n\n            Still and all, the awards are by no means unprecedented,\n\nand the \"shock-the-conscience\" test cannot be administered in a\n\nvacuum.     What is shocking under one set of facts may be acceptable\n\n(even if only marginally so) under different circumstances.              See\n\nUnited States v. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            We are frank to say that, here, the awards for wrongful\n\nincarceration are high enough to be troubling.           But when we take\n\ninto    account   the   severe   emotional   trauma   inflicted   upon   the\n\nscapegoats, we cannot say with any firm conviction that those awards\n\n\n       15\n       The government has not specifically challenged the amounts\nof the derivative awards (or, for that matter, the liability\nfindings) on the plaintiffs' claims for loss of consortium and the\nlike. Consequently, we eschew any discussion of those awards in\nconnection with the government's appeal.     See United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that issues not\nbriefed or argued are deemed abandoned).\n\n                                    -59-\n\fare grossly disproportionate to the injuries sustained.                           After all,\n\nsome cases involving analogous factual scenarios have resulted in\n\ncomparable damage awards.          See, e.g., Thompson v. Connick, 553 F.3d\n\n836, 865-66 (5th Cir. 2008) (upholding jury award of $14,000,000 for\n\n18 years of wrongful incarceration), vacated on other grounds by ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ (5th Cir. 2009) (en banc) [No. 07-30443, slip op. at\n\n1];    Newsome    v.   McCabe,     319    F.3d    301,       302-03   (7th    Cir.    2003)\n\n(involving       award    of     $15,000,000          for    15   years      of    wrongful\n\nincarceration); White v. McKinley, No. 05-203, 2009 WL 813001, at\n\n*22 (W.D. Mo. Mar. 26, 2009) (upholding jury award of $14,000,000 in\n\ncompensatory damages for 5 ½ years of wrongful incarceration);\n\nSarsfield v. City of Marlborough, No. 03-10319, 2006 WL 2850359, at\n\n*1 (D. Mass. Oct. 4, 2006) (reflecting judicial award of more than\n\n$13,000,000 for 9 ½ years of wrongful incarceration). Consequently,\n\nwe conclude that the district court's awards must stand.\n\n              In concluding that the awards in this case fall short of\n\nshocking the conscience, we think it important to make clear that\n\nthe    $1,000,000      annuity    selected       by    the    district    court      as   the\n\nbaseline for its calculation should not be understood as a carob\n\nseed    for   measuring    the     harm    caused       by    wrongful    incarceration\n\ngenerally.     Applying a literal reading of the statement in Limone IV\n\nthat \"wrongfully imprisoned plaintiffs were entitled to compensation\n\nof at least $1 million per year of imprisonment,\" 497 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n243 (emphasis supplied), one district court recently has treated the\n\n\n                                          -60-\n\f$1,000,000 per year baseline as a floor for damages arising out of\n\nwrongful incarceration.      See Smith v. City of Oakland, 538 F. Supp.\n\n2d 1217, 1242-43 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (citing Limone IV).        We regard\n\nthat characterization as unfortunate.       As we have emphasized, the\n\ndistrict court's awards are at the outer edge of the universe of\n\npermissible awards and survive scrutiny, though barely, only because\n\nof the deferential nature of the standard of review and the unique\n\ncircumstances of the case.\n\n             2.    The Cross-Appeal.   The district court awarded each\n\nminor child of a scapegoat $200,000 for loss of consortium and\n\n$50,000 in emotional distress damages.      Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 249-50.    Edward Greco, the surviving son of the late Louis Greco,\n\nSr., objects to his award on the ground that he suffered more from\n\nhis father's wrongful incarceration than did the other children.\n\n             The cross-appeal comes to us in the following procedural\n\nposture.     After the district court handed down its decision in\n\nLimone IV and entered judgment, Edward filed a motion to alter the\n\njudgment.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).   The court denied that motion,\n\ndeclaring that any additional hardship was attributable to the Greco\n\nfamily's dysfunctionality — a condition that predated Louis Greco's\n\nconviction.       See Limone v. United States (Limone V), No. 02-10890\n\n(D. Mass. Dec. 21, 2007) (unpublished order).     We review the denial\n\nof a motion to alter or amend a previously entered judgment for\n\n\n\n\n                                   -61-\n\fabuse of discretion.   Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n           It is axiomatic that damage awards must be based on the\n\nevidence presented.        A corollary to this axiom is that a court\n\ncharged with making a damage award should take into account the\n\nparticular circumstances of each individual plaintiff.           Gutiérrez-\n\nRodríguez, 882 F.2d at 579.     This corollary holds true with respect\n\nto damages for emotional distress and loss of consortium, both of\n\nwhich by their very nature are difficult to monetize.            See, e.g.,\n\nTobin, 553 F.3d at 144-45; Koster v. TWA, Inc., 181 F.3d 24, 35-36\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 32-33 & n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n           This does not mean, however, that different plaintiffs can\n\nnever be given identical damage awards in emotional distress or loss\n\nof   consortium   cases.      Identical   damage   awards   at   times   are\n\nwarranted.    See, e.g., Sutton v. Earles, 26 F.3d 903, 918 (9th Cir.\n\n1994) (upholding identical annualized awards of non-economic damages\n\nto five parents of deceased seamen).\n\n           The district court engaged in a thoughtful, detailed\n\nanalysis of the manner in which each scapegoat and each family\n\nmember was affected by the government's misconduct.         See Limone IV,\n\n497 F. Supp. 2d at 235-43.          Within that analysis, the         court\n\nchronicled the deterioration of the Greco family.           Id. at 241-43.\n\nThe court's rescript reveals that Edward was eleven years old when\n\n\n                                   -62-\n\fhis father was sentenced.         Around that time, his mother, Roberta,\n\nbegan to drink heavily, and Edward became the primary caretaker for\n\nhis older brother.    Roberta abused Edward physically and, when he\n\nwas thirteen, abandoned him without making provisions for his care.\n\nEdward and his brother lived with extended family, but Edward was\n\nthrown out when he was sixteen.                 He soon lost contact with his\n\nbrother (who eventually committed suicide).\n\n           The district court determined that Edward's plight, though\n\ntragic, was attributable mainly to causes that predated his father's\n\nimprisonment.     Roberta had filed for divorce three years before\n\nGreco's conviction, charging extreme cruelty.                In response, Greco\n\nattempted to strangle her.        Indeed, the marital relationship was so\n\ntroubled that the district court rejected Roberta's claim for loss\n\nof   consortium   (though    it    awarded       her   damages   for   intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress).              Id. at 247, 250.\n\n            Based on this background, the district court concluded in\n\nLimone V that the government's misconduct caused only a fraction of\n\nthe woes that befell Edward.         The rest would have occurred in any\n\nevent because of the dysfunctional family environment.\n\n           Edward   resists       this    conclusion,      admonishing    that   a\n\ndefendant takes a plaintiff as it finds him.                See Doty v. Sewall,\n\n908 F.2d 1053, 1059 (1st Cir. 1990); Dulieu v. White & Sons, [1901]\n\n2 K.B. 669, 679.    That is true as far as it goes — but it does not\n\ntake Edward very far.       A defendant may be held liable only for the\n\n\n                                         -63-\n\fdamages that it actually causes.          See W. Page Keeton, Prosser &\n\nKeeton on Torts 292 (5th ed. 1984) (reiterating this principle in\n\nregard to \"eggshell-skull\" plaintiffs).\n\n            Causation is generally a question of fact, committed\n\nlargely to the competence of the factfinder.       See Peckham, 895 F.2d\n\nat 837.   Given the idiosyncratic circumstances surrounding Edward's\n\nclaim, we cannot say that the district court either clearly erred in\n\nholding that the government's misconduct was not a but-for cause of\n\nEdward's special hardships or abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to alter the judgment.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We summarize succinctly.      The district court handled this\n\nmatter with care and assiduous attention to detail.         It took pains\n\nto make specific findings and to explain its reasoning.          While we\n\nreject its finding that the government is liable for malicious\n\nprosecution, we uphold the court's alternate finding             that the\n\ngovernment   is   liable   for   intentional   infliction   of   emotional\n\ndistress.    We also uphold the district court's decision to reject\n\nthe government's invocation of the discretionary function defense.\n\nFinally, we conclude that the district court used a permissible\n\nmethodology in computing damages and that the damage awards, though\n\nhigh, are not so excessive as to warrant appellate intervention.\n\n            We need go no further.    This case exemplifies a situation\n\nin which the end did not justify the government's use of very\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\funattractive means. In its zeal to accomplish a worthwhile objective\n\n(stamping out organized crime), the FBI stooped too low.                      Its\n\nmisconduct    was   not   only    outrageous   but    also    tortious.      That\n\nmisconduct    resulted    in   severe   harm   to    the    persons    wrongfully\n\nconvicted    and    to    their   families.         Under    these    unfortunate\n\ncircumstances, the large damage awards mark the last word of a sad\n\nchapter in the annals of federal law enforcement.\n\n\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -65-\n\f                                 Appendix\n\n            The district court awarded damages as follows:\n\n            1.

It also awarded $1,000,000 each to the\nwives of the scapegoats other than Greco and $200,000 to each of\nthe scapegoats' minor children for loss of consortium.

The genesis of these appeals can\n\nbe traced to the gangland slaying of Edward \"Teddy\" Deegan, which\n\noccurred in 1965 in Chelsea, Massachusetts.              Initially, the murder\n\nwent unsolved.      Two years later, agents of the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation (FBI), intent on frying bigger fish, cultivated a\n\ncooperating witness, Joseph Barboza, with tight ties to organized\n\ncrime.       Barboza      thereafter   met   with    state      authorities    and\n\nimplicated several individuals in the Deegan slaying.\n\n            Based      principally      on    Barboza's         testimony,     the\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts secured indictments in 1967 and\n\nconvictions the following year.           Among those convicted were Peter\n\nLimone, Sr., Enrico Tameleo, Louis Greco, Sr., and Joseph Salvati\n\n(collectively,      the    scapegoats).      All    of   them    received     stiff\n\nsentences.\n\n            Some three decades later, disturbing revelations cast\n\ngrave doubt upon the verdicts.            In December of 2000, the FBI for\n\nthe first time disclosed that all along it had possessed reliable\n\nintelligence undercutting Barboza's account of the murder and that\n\nit had suppressed this intelligence.                By the time that this\n\ninformation came to light, Tameleo and Greco had died in prison,\n\nSalvati had been paroled, and Limone was still behind bars.                  In due\n\ncourse, the convictions of all four men were vacated and Limone was\n\nreleased.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            Salvati, Limone, and the representatives of the estates\n\nof   Tameleo   and    Greco,   along     with   various   family    members\n\n(collectively, the plaintiffs), brought suit against the United\n\nStates advancing claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n\n28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-2680.          Following a bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court found the government liable on a multitude of\n\ntheories and awarded over $100,000,000 in damages.         The government\n\nappeals, as does one of the plaintiffs.\n\n            The record evinces egregious governmental misconduct; the\n\nFBI agents responsible for handling Barboza exhibited a callous\n\ndisregard for the scapegoats' rights.             But it is our duty to\n\ninterpret and apply the law even-handedly, regardless of the\n\negregiousness of a defendant's misconduct.          Fidelity to that duty\n\nrequires us to examine and resolve several vexing issues concerning\n\nboth liability and damages. After painstaking consideration of the\n\nvoluminous record, the parties' briefs, and the district court's\n\ncarefully   crafted   rescripts,   we    affirm   the   liability   finding\n\n(albeit on grounds that differ in one significant respect from\n\nthose relied upon by the district court).\n\n            The damage awards give us pause.        Insofar as the awards\n\nembody damages for wrongful incarceration, they are considerably\n\nhigher than any one of us, if sitting on the trial court bench,\n\nwould have ordered.      We nonetheless affirm those awards.           Our\n\nproper function as appellate judges is not to second-guess the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ftrial court but, rather, to apply a very deferential standard of\n\nreview.    Adhering to that role, and testing the disputed awards\n\nonly to that extent, we conclude that the awards, though high, are\n\nnot so grossly disproportionate to the harm sustained as to either\n\nshock   our     collective      conscience      or   raise    the   specter    of   a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n              These appeals have a long factual and procedural history.\n\nWe rehearse that history only insofar as is necessary to place into\n\nperspective the issues that we must decide.                  We direct the reader\n\nwho   hungers    for     more   detail    to    consult   the   district     court's\n\ncapstone opinion in Limone v. United States (Limone IV), 497 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 143 (D. Mass. 2007).\n\n              We bifurcate our account.            First, we limn the unsavory\n\nhistory of the Deegan murder and its aftermath.                 Then, we move to\n\nthe commencement and travel of the federal case.                      Because these\n\nappeals follow findings made by a district court sitting without a\n\njury, we resolve factual conflicts in favor of the district court's\n\nfindings   (to     the    extent   that    those     findings   are    not   clearly\n\nerroneous).

The Murder and Its Aftermath.\n\n              On the night of March 12, 1965, Teddy Deegan's bullet-\n\nridden body was discovered in Chelsea, Massachusetts.                    Deegan had\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fbeen shot six times, and the shots had been fired from three\n\ndifferent guns.         Suspicion focused upon a group of men that\n\nincluded Barboza, Jimmy Flemmi, Roy French, Joseph Martin, and\n\nRonald Cassesso, all of whom were linked to organized crime.                        The\n\ngroup had been observed leaving a local gang hangout, the Ebb Tide\n\nLounge, earlier that evening and returning shortly after the murder\n\nwas committed.         Eyewitnesses attested that they had seen blood\n\nstains on French's clothing that night.\n\n              Despite local officers' suspicions, the trail went cold\n\nwithin    a   matter    of   weeks.     The       police    were   unable   to    gather\n\nsufficient evidence to prefer charges against anyone.\n\n              Some two years later, FBI agents H. Paul Rico and Dennis\n\nCondon started cultivating Barboza, a known killer, in hopes of\n\n\"flipping\" him; that is, developing him as a cooperating witness\n\nagainst the Italian Mafia (La Cosa Nostra or LCN).                      At the time,\n\nBarboza    was   facing      up   to   89    years    of    imprisonment     on   state\n\n\"habitual offender\" charges.            See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 279, § 25.\n\nBarboza indicated a willingness to deal but placed one immutable\n\ncondition on any information that he might provide: he would not\n\ninculpate his close associate, Flemmi.                     The FBI tacitly accepted\n\nthat condition.\n\n              Throughout the spring of 1967, the agents used both\n\ncarrots and sticks in their efforts to mine information from\n\nBarboza.      Barboza was in state custody, and the agents plied him\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fwith promises of favorable recommendations and a slap-on-the-wrist\n\nsentence.     They also fabricated a story that La Cosa Nostra was\n\nattempting,    by   influencing     state   prosecutors,       to    bring   about\n\nBarboza's lifetime confinement.\n\n              Barboza's cooperation was not a one-shot affair.               Over\n\nthe course of several months of interrogation, he claimed to be\n\nknowledgeable about many crimes.            Pertinently, he mentioned the\n\nDeegan murder (although in his conversations with the FBI agents he\n\nwas not forthcoming as to any details).           That crime was primarily\n\na   matter    of    state,    not   federal,     interest.           Accordingly,\n\nMassachusetts law enforcement officers sought to interview Barboza.\n\n             On September 8, 1967, two Suffolk County detectives (John\n\nDoyle and Frank Walsh) conversed with Barboza.                 Agents Rico and\n\nCondon were present, but the detectives pulled the laboring oar.\n\nUnder questioning, Barboza finally provided his account of the\n\nDeegan killing. According to that account, Limone hired Barboza to\n\nmurder     Deegan   because    Deegan   had     robbed    an    LCN-affiliated\n\nbookmaker.     Barboza then requested permission to carry out the\n\n\"hit\" from Tameleo, an LCN hierarch.           After Tameleo's blessing had\n\nbeen secured, Barboza and Greco formulated a plan.\n\n             According to Barboza, the mechanics of the plan were as\n\nfollows.      French   would    accompany      Deegan    to    the    site   of   a\n\nhypothetical burglary.        Once there, French would turn on Deegan\n\nand, assisted by Barboza, Salvati, Greco, Martin, and Cassesso,\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwould kill both Deegan and another putative participant in the\n\nburglary, Anthony Stathopoulos, Jr.      Upon learning the details of\n\nthe plan, Limone approved it and agreed to pay an additional sum\n\nbecause it involved a double murder.\n\n            During subsequent meetings with the detectives and the\n\nagents, Barboza modified his account. This modified version, which\n\ndiffered only at the margins and not at the core, formed the\n\npredicate for the indictments and convictions that followed.\n\n            At the time that Barboza unveiled his account of Deegan's\n\nmurder, the FBI possessed powerful intelligence casting grave doubt\n\non   the   account's   veracity.    Because    the   strength     of    this\n\nintelligence is of decretory significance here, we discuss it in\n\nsome detail.\n\n            In the early 1960s, the FBI ramped up its efforts to\n\nextirpate organized crime in New England.       Among other things, it\n\nsurreptitiously   installed   an   illegal   electronic   \"bug\"    at    the\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island office of Raymond L. S. Patriarca, the\n\nreputed head of La Cosa Nostra in the area.       The bug was in place\n\nfrom early 1962 through July 12, 1965.

The Patriarca bug revealed that Barboza and\n\nFlemmi had approached Patriarca and obtained his sanction for the\n\nhit.   Other information from both the bug and the FBI's then-\n\ncurrent crop of Top Echelon informants implicated five malefactors\n\n(Barboza, Flemmi, French, Martin, and Cassesso) in the murder, but\n\nnot a single source other than Barboza so much as hinted that any\n\nof the scapegoats were involved.\n\n          Despite    possessing       credible   intelligence      undermining\n\nBarboza's tale, the FBI did not turn over this intelligence to\n\nstate authorities either at the time of the murder or during\n\nBarboza's later debriefing.      To make a bad situation worse, agents\n\nRico and Condon informed the state prosecutor, Norman Zalkind, that\n\nBarboza's tale \"checked out.\"         Condon appeared as a witness at the\n\nstate-court trial and lent credence to Barboza's narrative by\n\nemphasizing   that   he    (Condon)    always    was   concerned    about   the\n\n\"purity\" of the testimony given by his informants.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f            On the strength of Barboza's false testimony, the jury\n\nconvicted   the   scapegoats   on     first-degree   murder   and    murder-\n\nconspiracy charges.1     The trial judge sentenced Limone, Tameleo,\n\nand Greco to death, and sentenced Salvati to life imprisonment.\n\nThe   scapegoats'    appeals   were    unsuccessful,   but    the   capital\n\nsentences were commuted to life imprisonment after the United\n\nStates Supreme Court decided Furman v.

See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 199 (describing parole process).        The scapegoats filed numerous\n\npetitions for commutation and parole over many years.               Although\n\nstate authorities requested all relevant information, the FBI never\n\nturned over the exculpatory information that reposed within its\n\nfiles.    On some occasions, the FBI went so far as to forward\n\ninformation that harmed the scapegoats' chances for commutation or\n\nparole.   On other occasions, it took affirmative steps to deflect\n\npossible challenges to the convictions.\n\n            Tameleo and Greco died in prison in 1985 and in 1995,\n\nrespectively.     Salvati secured a commutation from the governor and\n\nwas released in 1997.     Limone remained incarcerated.\n\n\n      1\n       French, Martin, and Cassesso also were convicted on charges\nrelated to the murder.

The Durham documents revealed much of the\n\nexculpatory information that the FBI had kept in its organizational\n\nbosom all along.    Upon seeing this information, the Suffolk County\n\ndistrict attorney's office moved to vacate Limone's conviction.\n\nThe state trial court granted that motion on the ground that the\n\nresult of the trial in all likelihood would have been different had\n\nthe Durham documents been disclosed in a timeous manner. Salvati's\n\nconviction was vacated on the same ground.                Shortly thereafter,\n\nstate prosecutors filed notices of abandonment of prosecution\n\n(nolle prosequi) for both Limone and Salvati based on a perceived\n\nlack of evidence.     The prosecutors later arranged for posthumous\n\nvacatur of Tameleo's and Greco's convictions and issued similar\n\nnolle prosequi notices in those cases.\n\n                          B.

The plaintiffs later\n\ndropped their claims against the individual defendants (federal and\n\nstate) and proceeded only on the FTCA claims.\n\n          Following a 22-day bench trial, the district court found\n\nfor the plaintiffs (including the family members) on their claims\n\nof malicious prosecution, coercive civil conspiracy, intentional\n\ninfliction      of   emotional     distress,    negligence,   negligent\n\nsupervision, and loss of consortium.           The court awarded total\n\ndamages in excess of $100,000,000.        These timely appeals ensued.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           On appeal, the government challenges the district court's\n\nholdings on both liability and damages.      Its argument on liability\n\nmakes three basic points: (i) that the district court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims by reason\n\nof the FTCA's discretionary function exception; (ii) that the court\n\nlacked such jurisdiction because the plaintiffs' claims arose out\n\nof intentional torts committed before Congress amended the FTCA to\n\npermit   the   maintenance   of   such   claims;   and    (iii)     that    the\n\nplaintiffs adduced insufficient evidence to prove the elements of\n\nany of the asserted torts.\n\n           In a secondary line of attack, the government assails the\n\ndistrict court's damages calculus, arguing that the court's rule-\n\nof-thumb baseline of $1,000,000 per year for each year of wrongful\n\nincarceration    is   unreasonable   and   resulted      in   a   battery   of\n\nexcessive awards.      In a cross-appeal, the son of one of the\n\nscapegoats contends that the district court erred in awarding him\n\nthe same damages as were awarded to the offspring of the other\n\nscapegoats.\n\n           In the pages that follow, we address these arguments.\n\nFor ease in exposition we deal with the second and third prongs of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthe government's challenge to liability before addressing the first\n\nprong.2\n\n            We start that discussion with what all the parties have\n\ntreated    as   the   leading    edge    of    the   government's     appeal:   its\n\nasseveration     that    the     district      court   erred    in   finding    the\n\ngovernment liable for malicious prosecution.                   While we conclude\n\nthat the government's asseveration has merit, that proves to be a\n\nhollow victory. The next most bruited theory on which the district\n\ncourt premised liability — its finding that the FBI is liable for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress — withstands scrutiny.\n\nAs to that cause of action, we also reject the government's\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence and discretionary function defenses.\n\nFinally, we uphold the damage awards in their entirety (a decision\n\nthat entails, among other things, defenestration of the cross-\n\nappeal).\n\n                        A.     Malicious Prosecution.\n\n            Federal     courts    lack    jurisdiction     over      tort   actions\n\nagainst the United States except insofar as the sovereign has\n\n\n     2\n        Because the discretionary function exception, when\napplicable, deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, some\nmight think consideration of it logically antecedent to\nconsideration of the merits. But the answer to the discretionary\nfunction inquiry depends in large measure on the nature of the\nconduct at issue. See, e.g., Fothergill v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203829\"><a href=\"/opinion/203829/fothergill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252-53 (1st Cir. 2009); Shansky v.

Moreover, there is not a shred of\n\nevidence that the FBI induced the state to pursue the murder case.\n\nThe agents' primary interest was in preserving the secrecy of their\n\nown sources.   They did not demand that state actors bring charges\n\nagainst the scapegoats; indeed, there is no evidence that they so\n\nmuch as suggested that such charges should be brought.\n\n          Finally, though the agents assisted Barboza in shoring up\n\nhis false tale when inconsistencies came to light, that subsequent\n\nassistance does not support a conclusion that the FBI \"encouraged\"\n\nstate actors to institute the Deegan prosecution.   See Correllas,\n\n572 N.E.2d at 10.    Equally as important, that evidence does not\n\nsupport the district court's findings, Limone IV, 497 F.

There\n\nis case law in Massachusetts indicating that an individual who\n\ntransmits untruthful information to an official with power to\n\ncharge sometimes may be said to have instituted an ensuing criminal\n\nproceeding     brought    by   that    official.

This does not mean, however, that every provider of\n\nfalse information, nor even every bad-faith provider of false\n\ninformation, may be said to have instituted an ensuing criminal\n\nproceeding.\n\n          The question of whether such an individual has instituted\n\na   criminal    proceeding      depends     on   the     circumstances.        The\n\ncontrolling precedent is the ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court (SJC) in Correllas, 572 N.E.2d at 10.                  Under that\n\ndecision, an individual may not be held to have instituted criminal\n\nproceedings     if   he   merely      provides   false    information     to   law\n\nenforcement officials in response to these officials' queries\n\nduring an ongoing investigation.           See id.; see also Councilman v.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fAlibris, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372534/councilman-v-alibris-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Instead, the\n\ninformation provider must take some initiative; that is, he must\n\nvoluntarily reach out to law enforcement officials and cause them\n\nto commence a new line of inquiry.            See Councilman, 386 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 9.\n\n            The court below concluded that the United States was\n\nresponsible    for    instituting    criminal      proceedings      against     the\n\nscapegoats on the theory that the FBI, through Barboza, had become\n\na bad-faith provider of false information. Limone IV, 497 F. Supp.\n\n2d   at    207-13.      This    conclusion      rests    principally       on   two\n\nconsiderations.      First, agents Rico and Condon recruited, vetted,\n\nand delivered Barboza to state authorities.              Id. at 206.       Second,\n\nthey knew that Barboza was not being truthful when he implicated\n\nthe scapegoats, yet they assisted Barboza in making his tale more\n\nbelievable    and    encouraged    him   to    stand    by   that   tale   through\n\nincentives such as protection, promises of leniency, and financial\n\nrewards.    Id. at 179-80, 211, 217-18.\n\n            The record leaves no doubt but that the agents conducted\n\nthemselves deplorably.         But we cannot agree that they can be said\n\nto have \"instituted\" the criminal proceedings that ensued against\n\nthe scapegoats.        The turning point is the SJC's analysis in\n\nCorrellas.\n\n            The record in this case makes pellucid that, during\n\ninterrogations conducted exclusively by Rico and Condon, Barboza\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fmade only passing reference to the Deegan homicide.                         He neither\n\nmentioned the scapegoats nor offered any specific details about the\n\nmurder or the murderers.               For their part, the agents exhibited no\n\nparticular interest in those subjects.\n\n               This void remained until state authorities began to take\n\npart in the questioning.               Barboza first offered the account that\n\nwould       form   the   basis    of    the    prosecution   during    an    interview\n\nconducted chiefly by Doyle and Walsh (Suffolk County detectives) on\n\nSeptember 8, 1967.4              That questioning came about as part of a\n\nlarger state investigation into the Deegan murder.                    By the time of\n\nthe September 8 interview, state investigators had visited Barboza\n\non at least four occasions and had asked him point-blank for\n\ninformation pertaining to the Deegan murder.5                 Even though federal\n\nagents were present during these audiences, it seems to have been\n\nthe detectives, not the FBI, who first brought up, and then kept\n\ndigging into, the Deegan murder.                 See supra note 4.\n\n               So viewed, the record compels the conclusion that Barboza\n\nfurnished the false information that led to the institution of the\n\n\n\n        4\n       The FBI report of this interview indicates that Doyle\nconducted the interview.    Moreover, the substance of that FBI\nreport consists only of a copy of Doyle's interview notes. That\ngeneral scenario is characteristic of the FBI reports of subsequent\ninterrogation sessions at which the detectives were present.\n     5\n       Although Barboza would make alterations to the fairy tale\nthat he narrated on September 8, these alterations too came about\nduring joint interview sessions led by state law enforcement\nofficers.\n\n                                              -21-\n\fprosecution while under questioning by state agents investigating\n\na state crime.   There is no evidence that the FBI brought Barboza\n\nand state authorities together specifically so that he would talk\n\non the Deegan murder; indeed, Barboza offered information to state\n\nauthorities on various matters, including another murder he would\n\nlater testify about, before he answered questions regarding Deegan.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence that the FBI knew that Barboza would\n\nconcoct the bogus story that emerged.   See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 217 (finding that Barboza had pulled \"the [scapegoats'] names\n\nout of thin air\").   Although there is evidence that the FBI helped\n\nto shore up Barboza's credibility as matters moved along, the\n\nprosecution by then already had been instituted.\n\n          There is one loose end.       The SJC has left open the\n\npossibility that an individual may be held liable for malicious\n\nprosecution if he pursues a prosecution after it has become clear\n\nto him that there is no probable cause to support it.          See\n\nGutiérrez v. MBTA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (Mass. 2002); see also\n\nMitchell v.

Given\n\nthe SJC's holding in Correllas, however, it is evident that the\n\nmere provision of false information cannot alone ground a malicious\n\ncontinuation finding. More is required, such as an insistence that\n\nthe prosecution go forward even after it has become clear that\n\nprobable cause is lacking.   See, e.g., Miller v. City of Boston,\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2327251\"><a href=\"/opinion/2327251/miller-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass. 2003); Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts § 655 cmt. c (1977).\n\n              Here, there is no evidence that FBI agents urged state\n\nauthorities to continue the ill-starred prosecution. Patently, the\n\nagents' primary interest was in Barboza, not in prosecuting the\n\nscapegoats.     The mere fact that the agents propped up the state's\n\ncase (e.g., by bolstering Barboza's credibility) does not make the\n\nFBI a \"continuer\" of the prosecution any more than the defendant in\n\nCorrellas (who gratuitously offered false data to the authorities\n\nsubsequent to the initiation of prosecution).\n\n              To sum up, we hold that the FBI did not institute\n\ncriminal proceedings against the scapegoats.         See Correllas, 572\n\nN.E.2d at 10.     Thus, the plaintiffs have failed to prove the first\n\nelement of the tort of malicious prosecution.         Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding the United States liable for that\n\ntort. Nevertheless, this conclusion does not end our odyssey. The\n\ndistrict court also found the government liable on other theories.\n\nHence, we proceed to the most promising of those parallel theories\n\nof liability.\n\n         B.    Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.\n\n              Under Massachusetts law, an individual is liable for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress when he, \"by extreme\n\nand   outrageous    conduct   and   without   privilege,   causes   severe\n\nemotional distress to another.\"        Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 355\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fN.E.2d 315, 318 (Mass. 1976).6           The court below found that the\n\nFBI's extreme and outrageous misconduct had caused the plaintiffs\n\nto suffer severe emotional distress and, thus, imposed liability.\n\nLimone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.\n\n            The   government    does     not   contest    that   the    tort    of\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, unlike malicious\n\nprosecution, was actionable under the FTCA before the passage of\n\nthe   law   enforcement   proviso.       Instead,    it   suggests     that    the\n\ndistrict    court    lacked    subject    matter    jurisdiction       over    the\n\nplaintiffs' intentional infliction claims because those claims\n\narise out of malicious prosecution (a tort that was barred by the\n\nversion of the FTCA in effect at the time of the convictions).                  As\n\na fallback, the United States questions the factual predicate\n\nunderlying the district court's analysis. We treat these arguments\n\nsequentially.\n\n            1.    Subject Matter Jurisdiction.        As said, Congress did\n\nnot waive the federal government's immunity from actions arising\n\nout of malicious prosecution until it enacted the law enforcement\n\nproviso in 1974.     The government hypothesizes that the plaintiffs'\n\n\n      6\n       Agis is the seminal Massachusetts case recognizing a cause\nof action for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the\nabsence of an accompanying physical injury.          Although the\nscapegoats' convictions predate this decision, the United States\nhas not ascribed any relevance to this chronology. Thus, we deem\nwaived any contention that the government cannot be held liable\nunder the FTCA on a tort theory that was not firmly established in\nthe case law of the relevant state at the time of the tortious\nacts.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fintentional infliction claims arise out of a maliciously instigated\n\nprosecution that occurred before the enactment of this proviso and,\n\ntherefore, the district court lacked competence to adjudicate those\n\nclaims.    We do not accept that hypothesis.\n\n            Although courts (including this court) sometimes have\n\nreferred loosely to section 2680(h) as an \"intentional torts\"\n\nexception to the general waiver contained in the FTCA, see, e.g.,\n\nRodríguez v.

In performing that tamisage,\n\nsubstance trumps form; an inquiring court must look past the\n\nnomenclature employed by the plaintiff and focus on the actual\n\nnature of the plaintiff's grievance.      See Jiménez-Nieves v.

If that grievance rests on\n\nproof of conduct that traditionally comprises an excepted tort,\n\nsection 2680(h) precludes suit.

See Block v.\n\nNeal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110883\"><a href=\"/opinion/110883/block-v-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298 (1983).    It follows that when an element of\n\nan excepted tort is missing from the factual scenario, the claim is\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\fnot pretermitted.          See Estate of Trentadue, 397 F.3d at 855\n\n(holding       intentional       infliction         claim    not    barred    by\n\nmisrepresentation exception because elements of misrepresentation,\n\nincluding reliance and pecuniary loss, were not present); Truman,\n\n26 F.3d at 596 (holding intentional infliction claim not barred by\n\nassault or battery exceptions because elements of these latter\n\ntorts were not alleged); Jiménez-Nieves, 682 F.2d at 4-5 (holding\n\nnegligence claim not barred by misrepresentation exception because\n\nreliance not present).\n\n              In the instant case, the plaintiffs failed to prove that\n\nthe FBI instituted criminal proceedings against the scapegoats, see\n\nsupra Part II(A), and thus failed to prove an essential element of\n\nthe tort of malicious prosecution.                  Furthermore, the conduct\n\nundergirding the plaintiffs' claims for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress is broader than that traditionally associated\n\nwith    the   tort   of   malicious   prosecution       in   that   it   includes\n\nmalfeasance that postdates the scapegoats' convictions, such as\n\nefforts by the FBI to cover up its misdeeds (a topic to which we\n\nshall    return).         And,   finally,     the    plaintiffs'    intentional\n\ninfliction claims require proof not only that the FBI's conduct was\n\nsomething akin to malicious, but also that it was extreme and\n\noutrageous.       Agis, 355 N.E.2d at 318.              These are substantive\n\ndistinctions.        See Foley v.

The    plaintiffs'      intentional\n\ninfliction     claims,      they   suggest,       are     barred       by   this\n\ncharacterization.\n\n            This suggestion is more cry than wool.              The plaintiffs\n\nhad the right to plead alternative theories of liability, see Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 8(d), and their exercise of that right did not debar\n\nthem from an independent review of each set of claims.                 See Dedham\n\nWater Co. v.

The Merits.    To make out a claim for intentional\n\ninfliction    of     emotional   distress   under   Massachusetts   law,    a\n\nclaimant must prove:\n\n            (1) that the [defendant] intended to inflict\n            emotional distress or that he knew or should\n            have known that emotional distress was the\n            likely result of his conduct; (2) that the\n            conduct was extreme and outrageous, was beyond\n            all possible bounds of decency and was utterly\n            intolerable in a civilized community; (3) that\n            the actions of the defendant were the cause of\n            the plaintiff's distress; and (4) that the\n            emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff\n            was severe and of a nature that no reasonable\n            man could be expected to endure it.\n\nAgis, 355 N.E.2d at 318-19 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     The court below determined that the plaintiffs had\n\nproven these four elements by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nLimone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.          In the court's view, the FBI\n\nhad participated willingly in framing the scapegoats, and then\n\nscrambled to cover up the frame job by obstructing the scapegoats'\n\n                                     -29-\n\fefforts to clear their names.           Id.   The court found this conduct\n\n\"intentional,\" \"outrageous,\" \"beyond all bounds of decency,\" and to\n\nhave \"no place in a civilized community.\"               Id.    The consequent\n\nemotional distress was \"so severe and of such a nature that no\n\nreasonable person could be expected to endure it.\"              Id.\n\n              The government raises a host of record-based challenges\n\nto this series of findings.           Because these appeals follow a bench\n\ntrial, we review the lower court's factfinding for clear error.\n\nCumpiano v.

It\n\nregards this standard as inapposite because the district court\n\nrelied principally upon documentary evidence in constructing its\n\nfindings and conclusions.        We reject that argument out of hand.\n\n              In Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, the Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether, under Rule 52(a), an appellate tribunal may\n\nreview   de    novo   findings   of    fact   not   bottomed   on   credibility\n\ndeterminations.       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573-74 (1985).

The\n\napplication of clear-error review to findings drawn from a paper\n\nrecord has long been the practice in this circuit.                 See, e.g.,\n\nReliance Steel Prods. Co. v.

That is the practice to which we adhere today.\n\n           With the standard of review nailed down, we turn to the\n\ngovernment's      multi-faceted    critique      of    the     trial   court's\n\nfactfinding.      To begin, the government takes umbrage with the\n\ncourt's conclusion that the FBI's misconduct was extreme and\n\noutrageous.      But that conclusion seems rock-solid: it is premised\n\non the court's determination that FBI agents knowingly participated\n\nin the events leading to the wrongful indictment, prosecution,\n\nconviction, and continued incarceration of the scapegoats.                Limone\n\nIV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.           This determination rests on three\n\nbuilding blocks: that the FBI (i) knew Barboza was dissembling when\n\nhe implicated the scapegoats in Deegan's murder; (ii) assisted\n\nBarboza in selling his lies to state authorities and encouraged him\n\nto stick to them; and (iii) covered up its misdeeds post-conviction\n\nby   hindering    the   scapegoats'    efforts   to   obtain    relief.     The\n\ngovernment challenges each of these building blocks.\n\n           As an initial matter, the district court's determination\n\nthat FBI agents knew that the scapegoats were strangers to the\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fDeegan slaying is not a necessary prerequisite to its finding of\n\nextreme and outrageous conduct.      The SJC has made pellucid that\n\nsuch a finding may be grounded either on actual knowledge or on a\n\ndefendant's deliberate disregard of a substantial probability that\n\nhis actions will produce severe emotional distress.        Simon v.\n\nSolomon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561-62 (Mass. 1982); see Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. i (1965).    Thus, the FBI may not hide\n\nbehind an assertion that it remained (wilfully) blind to the\n\nscapegoats' innocence.     And though actual knowledge is not a\n\nnecessary finding, the district court's finding of actual knowledge\n\nis obviously sufficient.\n\n          Moreover, that finding is unassailable.        The record\n\ncontains adequate evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could\n\nconclude — as did the district court — that the FBI knew that the\n\nscapegoats were not involved in the slaying.\n\n          The   district    court     painstakingly   reviewed   the\n\nintelligence in the FBI's possession at the relevant time.       See\n\nLimone IV, 497 Supp. 2d at 172-77.    In the days and months leading\n\nup to Deegan's murder, the FBI learned from the Patriarca bug and\n\nfrom its Top Echelon informants that Barboza and Flemmi — not\n\nLimone or Tameleo — had requested permission to murder Deegan and\n\nthat Patriarca (the head of the LCN) had blessed the hit.    On the\n\nday following the murder, a highly reliable Top Echelon informant\n\ntold agent Rico that Flemmi had bragged about killing Deegan with\n\n\n                               -32-\n\fthe   help   of   French,   Martin,   Cassesso,   and   Barboza.   This\n\nenumeration of the participants in the murder was repeated and\n\nconfirmed through various informants and conversations picked up by\n\nthe Patriarca bug.      Much of this information was catalogued in\n\nmemoranda, airtels, and correlator reports,8 a number of which were\n\neither authored or initialed as read by Rico and Condon.           Under\n\nthese circumstances, one would have to believe in the tooth fairy\n\nto believe that the agents did not know the identities of the real\n\nkillers.\n\n             Relatedly, Barboza's accusation that Limone and Tameleo\n\nhad orchestrated the hit did not jibe with information that the FBI\n\nhad gleaned from the Patriarca bug.       When requesting Patriarca's\n\npermission to carry out the hit, Barboza and Flemmi made no mention\n\nof any prior authorization given by Limone and Tameleo.            And,\n\ntellingly, the Patriarca bug showed that Limone, rather than\n\nordering the hit, had tried to warn Deegan that violence might be\n\nin the offing.       Rico and Condon turned a blind eye to these\n\ncontradictions.\n\n             There is other evidence as well.       When Barboza first\n\nspoke with Rico and Condon in March of 1967, he made it plain that\n\nhe would not incriminate Flemmi. The FBI had reliable intelligence\n\n\n      8\n       An airtel is an inter-office FBI communique sent between a\nlocal field office and FBI headquarters. A correlator report is a\ndocument that summarizes all the pertinent information possessed by\na field office concerning a particular person or subject.\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\flinking Flemmi to the Deegan murder; Barboza's enumeration of a\n\ncast of participants that did not include Flemmi, especially when\n\ncoupled with his avowed intent to shield Flemmi, surely should have\n\nconvinced the agents that they were not getting the whole story.\n\n            What is more, a local police officer had seen a balding\n\nindividual matching Flemmi's description in the back seat of\n\nMartin's car at around the time of the killing.       When Barboza\n\nlearned of the officer's observations, he suddenly \"remembered\"\n\nthat Salvati, whom he had previously placed in the back seat of\n\nMartin's automobile, was wearing a bald wig. Given what the agents\n\nknew, this convenient improvisation was a red flag that should have\n\ntriggered their suspicions.\n\n            Indeed, there is compelling reason to believe that FBI\n\nagents assented to the omission of Flemmi's name in order to\n\nfurther their own agenda. After all, the FBI formally targeted him\n\nas a Top Echelon informant three days prior to Deegan's murder and\n\nofficially assigned him to Rico on the very day that Deegan was\n\nkilled.   An FBI memorandum written in June of that year rated the\n\nquality of Flemmi's information as good.       Even after the FBI\n\ndropped Flemmi from the ranks of its informants in September of\n\n1965, it had a powerful incentive to keep him out of prison; his\n\nbrother, Stephen, became a Top Echelon informant around that time\n\nand remained in that status for many years.   See Flemmi, 225 F.3d\n\nat 80-82.\n\n\n                                -34-\n\f           The FBI's willingness to accept Barboza's narrative at\n\nface value is especially troubling because Barboza exhibited a\n\nsimilar lack of consistency in his account of Greco's supposed\n\ninvolvement in the crime.        When law enforcement officers were\n\nunable to corroborate Barboza's insistence that Greco was present\n\nat the Ebb Tide and had left with the rest of the men that Barboza\n\nhad fingered, Barboza reversed his field and claimed to have\n\n\"remembered\" that Greco joined the others at a later time.\n\n           From this and other information in the record, it is\n\ntransparently clear that the district court had a sturdy foundation\n\nfor its finding that the FBI knew at the time that Barboza's story\n\nwas riddled with inconsistencies.        The court was entitled to view\n\nthat knowledge in light of a wealth of FBI intelligence indicating\n\nthat the scapegoats were not part of the band of miscreants who\n\ncarried out the murder plot. Although the evidence does not compel\n\nthe   conclusion   that   the   FBI   knew   that   the   scapegoats   were\n\nuninvolved, it is enough to ground a reasonable inference to that\n\neffect.\n\n           The government likewise challenges the district court's\n\ndetermination that the FBI aided Barboza in framing the scapegoats.\n\nIn this regard, the government argues that the FBI did no more than\n\ngift-wrap Barboza and hand him over to state authorities (who then\n\nmade an independent decision to prosecute the scapegoats).             The\n\n\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\frecord supports the district court's determination regarding the\n\nFBI's culpability.\n\n            To be sure, there is no evidence that the FBI spoon-fed\n\nthe scapegoats' names to Barboza.           For aught that appears, the\n\nfictional tale sprang directly from the informant's brow.                   But\n\nthere is evidence that, once Barboza gave the scapegoats' names to\n\nthe Suffolk County detectives, the FBI assisted him in doctoring\n\nhis tale to make it seem more believable.         For example, as we have\n\nsaid,    Barboza    modified   his   initial   version   of   the   facts    to\n\naccommodate other information possessed by the authorities.                 The\n\ndistrict    court   concluded   that   Barboza   made    these   alterations\n\nbecause the FBI had made him aware of contradictory evidence in the\n\nhands of state officials.       Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 179-80.9\n\n            There was also evidence tending to show that the FBI\n\nhelped to \"sell\" Barboza's tale both to state authorities and to\n\nthe jury. The prosecutor, Zalkind, testified that the FBI had told\n\nhim that Barboza's account \"checked out.\"          Agent Condon testified\n\nat the murder trial, vouchsafing that he was careful not to impart\n\nany information about the murder investigation to Barboza because\n\n\n\n     9\n       The government seizes upon a statement in the district\ncourt's opinion suggesting that state officials may have shared in\nthe responsibility for showing Barboza their investigative files.\nSee Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 180 (\"Someone in law enforcement\nhad to have done so, either the FBI directly or state law\nenforcement in the FBI's presence.\"). But the court's opinion,\nfairly read, attributes primary responsibility for shoring up\nBarboza's testimony to the FBI. See, e.g., id. at 179, 180.\n\n                                     -36-\n\fhe (Condon) always was concerned about assuring the \"purity\" of\n\ntestimony   given    by   his    informants.     But    the    district    court\n\nrejected this testimony and supportably found that Condon knew at\n\nthe time that Barboza was spinning a yarn about the scapegoats'\n\ninvolvement in the murder.        Id. at 186.\n\n            Equally as important, the FBI interposed no disincentives\n\nthat might have deterred Barboza from standing by his bogus story.\n\nThe Bureau continued to coddle Barboza.              Among other things, the\n\nFBI pledged to bring Barboza's cooperation to the attention of\n\nrelevant authorities, extended protection to him and his family,\n\nand promised to give him money and a fresh start on the other side\n\nof the continent. The \"habitual offender\" charges that Barboza was\n\nfacing when he first began cooperating were dropped, and Barboza\n\nreceived only a one-year sentence for his role in Deegan's murder.\n\n            The     government     attempts     to     absolve     itself      of\n\nresponsibility for the scapegoats' plight by piously asserting that\n\nthe FBI turned over all relevant information to state authorities.\n\nIn this regard, it points to three memoranda.                  The first is a\n\nmemorandum from the FBI director dated March 16, 1965, which\n\ninstructs the Boston office to disclose to local authorities\n\ninformation pertaining to the Deegan murder to the extent that\n\ndivulgement   is    consistent     with   the   complete      security    of   the\n\nPatriarca bug. A handwritten notation on that memorandum indicates\n\nthat full disclosure already had taken place.                   The second, a\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fmemorandum authored by Rico on March 15, 1965, indicates that a Top\n\nEchelon      informant    had    told   him   that   Flemmi,   French,    Martin,\n\nCassesso, and Barboza had murdered Deegan, and states that this\n\ninformation had been transmitted to local authorities.                The third\n\nis a memorandum written on March 24 of the same year by the special\n\nagent   in    charge     of   the   FBI's   Boston   office;   that   memorandum\n\nessentially replicates the Rico memorandum.\n\n              On their face, these memoranda bolster the government's\n\nargument. But the memoranda do not exist in a vacuum. The district\n\ncourt found that, to the extent the FBI did volunteer information\n\nto state authorities in 1965, that information was general in nature\n\nand already within the state's ken.            See id. at 174-75 & n.73.        This\n\nfinding was not clearly erroneous.              The local police had Flemmi,\n\nFrench, Martin, Cassesso, and Barboza in their sights from the\n\nearliest stages of their investigation, and the three FBI memoranda,\n\nwhether read separately or in the ensemble, do not suggest that the\n\nreliability of the FBI's sources was communicated to the state.                  To\n\nthe   contrary,     the       director's    memorandum   instructed      that   the\n\nPatriarca bug remain secret.\n\n              The gaps in the record are also telling.            For instance,\n\nthere is absolutely no evidence indicating that the Boston-based FBI\n\nagents, whatever instructions they may have received, actually\n\ndivulged any information to state officials at the time of the\n\nkilling in March 1965 or during Barboza's debriefing in 1967 and\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\f1968.    In fact the state prosecutor, Zalkind, testified in the\n\ndistrict court that he had not seen any of the FBI documents\n\ncontaining exculpatory evidence when he forged ahead with the\n\nprosecution.        He   also   denied   that   this    evidence     had    been\n\ncommunicated to him in any other form.          Given Zalkind's testimony,\n\nwe cannot set aside the district court's finding that the FBI agents\n\nfailed to provide relevant exculpatory information.                 See, e.g.,\n\nUnited   States v. Natanel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(emphasizing that \"the district court must be given wide rein to\n\nassess the evidence and judge the credibility of witnesses\").\n\n           The district court's finding that the FBI covered up its\n\nperfidy by stonewalling the scapegoats' post-conviction efforts to\n\nwin their freedom is equally unimpugnable.             The government argues\n\nthat the alleged coverup consisted of nothing more than a failure\n\nto provide state officials with exculpatory materials and that such\n\na failure cannot ground a claim under the FTCA.               See Bolduc, 402\n\nF.3d at 59 (holding that negligent failure to disclose Brady\n\nmaterials is not actionable); see also Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1963).      This argument veers well wide of the mark.             Here,\n\nthe government's post-conviction misconduct consisted of more than\n\nfailing to turn over exculpatory materials to state authorities; the\n\ngovernment   took    positive   steps    to   ensure   that   the   scapegoats\n\nremained behind bars.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\f            For example, in mid-1970 Barboza, represented by new\n\ncounsel, signed a sworn affidavit in which he recanted certain\n\nportions of his trial testimony relating to the scapegoats' guilt.\n\nHis lawyer then requested permission to have a lie detector test\n\nadministered.     Shortly thereafter, two federal prosecutors visited\n\nBarboza,   who    retracted     his   recantation.        Despite   the   obvious\n\nimportance of these developments, the FBI agents failed either to\n\nconduct an investigation into the recantation or to brief their\n\nstate counterparts about it.\n\n            Other examples abound.         Among other things, the FBI told\n\nstate authorities who were considering petitions for commutation\n\nand/or parole that Limone, Greco, and Salvati had continuing ties\n\nto organized crime.       The FBI even went so far as to have agents\n\nvisit the office of a parole board member to voice opposition to\n\nLimone's petition for commutation.              Moreover, the record makes\n\nmanifest that the court below regarded the Brady violation (that is,\n\nthe FBI's failure to disclose exculpatory information in a timely\n\nmanner) as \"part of a broader scheme to put Barboza forward as a\n\nwitness    no    matter   the   cost,    even   if   it    meant    framing   the\n\nplaintiffs.\"      Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 222.          The government's\n\nafter-the-fact attempt to conceal what it had done became part of\n\nthe same scheme.      Id. at 202.\n\n            The SJC has made it abundantly clear that claims for\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress may be founded on a\n\n\n                                        -40-\n\fpattern of misconduct.       See, e.g., Boyle v.

Thus, it was appropriate for the district court,\n\non a pattern of conduct theory, to weigh the significance of the\n\nFBI's   failure     to   provide   state     authorities    with   exculpatory\n\nevidence.     See, e.g., Burrell v. Adkins, No. 01-2679, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">4699166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18 (W.D. La. Oct. 22, 2007).\n\n            The evidence supports the district court's finding that\n\na coverup occurred.         Despite contemporaneous requests by state\n\nofficials for information bearing upon the scapegoats' petitions for\n\npost-conviction relief, the FBI remained mute — and worse.               That\n\nrecalcitrance is especially damning in the circumstances of this\n\ncase — a case in which the FBI's deliberate misconduct had placed\n\nthe scapegoats in harm's way.          See Commonwealth v. Levesque, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (Mass. 2002) (explaining that \"a duty to prevent harm\n\nto others arises when one creates a dangerous situation, whether\n\nthat    situation    was    created    intentionally       or   negligently\");\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 321 (1965) (similar).\n\n            To recapitulate, the district court supportably determined\n\nthat the FBI knew that the scapegoats were uninvolved in the Deegan\n\nmurder from the moment that Barboza implicated them. The FBI agents\n\nnonetheless assisted Barboza in embellishing his apocryphal tale,\n\nhelped him to sell that tale to state authorities and the jury, and\n\ncovered up their perfidy by stonewalling the scapegoats' petitions\n\nfor post-conviction relief.        The district court concluded that this\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fpattern of conduct was extreme and outrageous, Limone IV, 497 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 227, and we may upset that conclusion only if reasonable\n\nminds would be compelled to reach the opposite conclusion, see\n\nJackson, 156 F.3d at 232-33; see also Boyle, 392 N.E.2d at 1056-57.\n\nApplying that standard, the conclusion that the government indulged\n\nin extreme and outrageous conduct must stand.

Common sense\n\nsuggests that the FBI's deliberate acts and omissions were likely\n\nto   lead   to   the   wrongful   conviction        and   incarceration   of   the\n\nscapegoats (and, thus, the consequent emotional distress).                That is\n\nexactly what transpired.          Accordingly, the district court had an\n\nample predicate from which to infer that the FBI knew that its\n\nmisconduct was likely to cause emotional distress.                   See, e.g.,\n\nWagenmann, 829 F.2d at 214.\n\n            In a variation on this theme, the government contends that\n\nit cannot be held legally responsible for causing the emotional\n\ndistress that occurred here.        All that the FBI did, it reasons, was\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fto hand a witness to state authorities, who then exercised their\n\nindependent discretion in bringing that witness before a grand jury\n\nand a petit jury.    In the government's view, the state's decision\n\nto pursue the murder case and the trial jurors' decision to convict\n\nare intervening acts that broke the causal chain.\n\n            Causation is a factbound issue and, as such, is normally\n\nleft to the trier.

The causation inquiry has two components: proof\n\nthat the harm would not have occurred but for the defendant's\n\nmisconduct, see Glidden v. Maglio, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974-75 (Mass.\n\n2000), and proof that the defendant was a proximate cause of the\n\nharm, see Kent v.

Supp. 2d at 227, is ironclad. Given the\n\naid   and   encouragement   that   the   FBI   afforded   Barboza   and   its\n\nexclusive possession of exculpatory evidence that probably would\n\nhave rescued the scapegoats from wrongful conviction, the finding\n\nthat the FBI's misconduct constituted a but-for cause of the\n\nscapegoats' plight is fully sustainable. See Burke v. McDonald, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st Cir. 2009) (ruling that police officer could be\n\n\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\fsaid to have \"caused\" plaintiff's confinement without bail if jury\n\nfound that he suppressed exonerating DNA evidence).\n\n          The second component of the causation inquiry requires\n\nelaboration. Under Massachusetts law, proximate cause turns largely\n\non the foreseeability of the harm.10     See Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at\n\n214; Kent, 771 N.E.2d at 777.     Intervening acts of a third party\n\nwill not break the causal chain if those acts were reasonably\n\nforeseeable.    Copithorne v. Framingham Union Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n142-43 (Mass. 1988); Gidwani v.

Limone IV,\n\n497 F. Supp. 2d at 227.     That conclusion strikes us as virtually\n\ninescapable.     The so-called \"intervening acts\" — notably, the\n\nstate's decision to prosecute and the jury's decision to convict —\n\nwere well within the realm of reasonable expectations once the\n\ngovernment took steps to prop up Barboza's credibility and conceal\n\nexculpatory evidence.    See Burke, 572 F.3d at 58-61.\n\n\n\n     10\n        The most recent draft restatement suggests that an\nintentional tortfeasor should be deemed the legal cause of any harm\nthat he intends to inflict without reference to the foreseeability\nof that harm.    See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical Harms § 33 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 2005). The SJC\nhas not spoken to this proposal and, given the foreseeability of\nthe harm flowing from the FBI's misconduct, we need not decide\nwhether section 33 applies here.\n\n                                 -44-\n\f            This leaves the fourth and final element of the tort: that\n\nthe scapegoats suffered severe emotional distress.             The government\n\ndoes not challenge the district court's finding to this effect, nor\n\ncould it credibly do so.        On this record, it is unarguable that the\n\nwrongful indictment, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration\n\ncaused the victims severe emotional distress.                 Therefore, the\n\nplaintiffs satisfied their burden of proving all the elements of\n\ntheir claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress.11\n\n              C.    The Discretionary Function Exception.\n\n            Regardless of the invulnerability of the district court's\n\nfindings on the elements of the intentional infliction claims, we\n\nmust    address    yet    another   issue   bearing   upon   liability.   The\n\ngovernment invokes the FTCA's discretionary function exception as a\n\nfurther defense.         It argues, in essence, that the conduct on which\n\n\n\n       11\n        In Massachusetts, a cause of action for intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress may succeed only if the defendant\nhas intentionally inflicted severe emotional distress \"without\nprivilege.\"   Agis, 355 N.E.2d at 318.     The government did not\nargue, either in the district court or in its briefs on appeal,\nthat its conduct was privileged. Consequently, its assertion of\nprivilege for the first time at oral argument in this court is too\nlittle and too late. See United States v.

We\n\nconclude   that   the   district      court     possessed   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction over the plaintiffs' claims for intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress and that the plaintiffs proved those claims.\n\nBecause the district court determined that the same damages flowed\n\nfrom all of the torts alleged, we need not inquire whether the\n\nplaintiffs also proved their claims of conspiracy, negligence,\n\nand/or negligent supervision.       Only questions pertaining to damages\n\nremain.\n\n                              D.

In a cross-appeal Greco's son,\n\nEdward, contends that the court awarded him insufficient damages.\n\n           The weight of authority indicates that damage awards under\n\nthe FTCA are subject to clear-error review.

The standard of\n\nreview, at least insofar as it pertains to awards of non-economic\n\ndamages, is more nuanced.    See Neyer v.

Raw findings of fact are reviewed for\n\nclear error.    Reilly v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515719\"><a href=\"/opinion/515719/donna-reilly-etc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).    Claimed errors of law engender de novo review.          Soto, 11\n\nF.3d at 17.     The third facet of the standard of review relates to\n\nmatters of judgment, which are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Davis, 375 F.3d at 592 (using language consistent with abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard); Soto, 11 F.3d at 18 (similar).\n\n           These differentiated aspects of the standard of review are\n\ndesigned to operate in a synchronized fashion.          Thus, in an FTCA\n\ncase that involves non-economic damages, an appellate court reviews\n\nfacts found by the trial judge (such as the existence and nature of\n\nthe harm suffered) for clear error.        See Doe v.

At the\n\nsame time, the court assays the reasonableness of the trial judge's\n\nmonetization of that harm — a classic example of a judgment call —\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard.          See Wilkinson v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192435/wilkinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934 (8th Cir. 2009).       Within that rubric, the\n\ncourt evaluates the trial judge's assumptions as to purely legal\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\fmatters de novo.     Cf. Rosario-Urdaz v.

We apply this nuanced standard of review in examining\n\nthe damage awards about which the government complains.\n\n          We   cut   directly       to    the   chase.     The   district    court's\n\nfindings of fact as to the existence, nature, and quantum of the\n\nharm sustained by the scapegoats are not clearly erroneous — indeed,\n\nthose findings are largely uncontested on appeal.                      Our inquiry,\n\ntherefore,   centers    on    the   reasonableness         of    the   awards.      As\n\nexplained above, abuse of discretion review applies to that issue.\n\n          Under abuse of discretion review, an appellate court ought\n\nnot disturb an award of non-economic damages unless the award is\n\neither grossly disproportionate to the proven injuries or trenches\n\nupon a miscarriage of justice.

Davis, 375 F.3d at 591;\n\nLebron, 279 F.3d at 326 n.4.

Id.\n\nat 861 n.16.       Although the SJC has suggested that a comparison of\n\nagnate awards sometimes may be useful, it has stressed the paramount\n\nimportance of case-specific facts.          Id. at 861-62 & n.17.\n\n              With this framework in place, we turn to the particulars\n\nof the parties' challenges.\n\n              1.   The   Government's   Appeal.     As   a    prelude   to   the\n\nassessment of damages, the district court laboriously recounted the\n\ndetails of the scapegoats' lives behind bars.         See Limone IV, 497 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 235-41.       The government has not contested the court's\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fnarrative, and it is evident that the scapegoats suffered all the\n\nhardships customarily associated with prolonged prison confinement.\n\nThese hardships were magnified by their knowledge that they had been\n\nframed: all of them were forced to come to grips with the reality\n\nthat, innocence aside, they might live out their days in prison.                 To\n\nmake matters worse, three of the men — Limone, Tameleo, and Greco —\n\nspent the first few years after the trial in the grim shadow of\n\ndeath sentences.         All told, Limone and Salvati spent 33 and 29\n\nyears, respectively, in prison; Tameleo and Greco died in custody\n\nafter 18 and 28 years, respectively.14\n\n           After         considering      the        particular      individuals'\n\ncircumstances      and   consulting     damage       awards   in   other   wrongful\n\nincarceration cases, the district court determined that $1,000,000\n\nper year of immurement constituted the appropriate baseline for its\n\ncalculation   of    damages.      See    id.    at    243-45.      The   government\n\nmaintains that this baseline is overly generous and results in\n\ndamages that are grossly disproportionate to awards in comparable\n\ncases.    In the government's view, the district court should have\n\nlimited its comparability survey to cases arising in Massachusetts\n\nand, moreover, looked only to cases involving protracted periods of\n\nincarceration.      The government's theory seems to be that wrongful\n\n\n     14\n        Limone served the first seven years of his sentence and\nTameleo served the first five years of his sentence concurrent with\npreviously imposed sentences in unrelated cases.         Thus, the\ndistrict court declined to award either of them damages for those\nperiods. See Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d at 245.\n\n                                        -53-\n\fincarceration gives rise to two distinct strains of emotional harm:\n\nthe initial jolt of wrongful imprisonment, and some (lesser) injury\n\nbased on the day-to-day loss of liberty.             It asserts that the\n\ndistrict court did not appreciate this important distinction; that\n\nthe court did not use any congeners involving protracted periods of\n\nincarceration; and that the court erred in not limiting its canvass\n\nto    Massachusetts inmates.     We find the government's reasoning\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n            To begin, the government uses faulty premises. On the one\n\nhand, its assertion that the district court did not look to awards\n\nrelated to lengthy periods of wrongful incarceration is incorrect as\n\na matter of fact.      See, e.g., id. at 244 (discussing a 15-year\n\nperiod of wrongful incarceration).        On the other hand, its parochial\n\ninsistence that the lower court should have restricted any inquiry\n\nto cases that arose within the borders of Massachusetts is incorrect\n\nas a matter of law.    Although we have said that helpful guidance may\n\nbe found in damage awards from \"similar cases arising out of the\n\nsame context that are tried in the same locale,\" Gutiérrez-Rodríguez\n\nv. Cartagena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 (1st Cir. 1989), that does not mean\n\nthat a court is prohibited from looking for guidance elsewhere.

Mass. Feb. 2000).                   But\n\nit is unrealistic to assume that settlement values (which, by\n\ndefinition, implicate compromise) equate to actual damages.                       See\n\nNeyer, 845 F.2d at 644.             This is a comparison of plums with\n\npomegranates.        Thus, these cases do not undercut the district\n\ncourt's baseline calculation.\n\n            The    government     also    seeks       to   undermine   the   district\n\ncourt's baseline by marshaling a series of legislative enactments\n\nthat impose ceilings on the liability of governmental entities for\n\nwrongful incarcerations.          See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §§ 1495, 2513(e)\n\n(limiting    government's     liability         for   wrongful   incarceration     of\n\nfederal prisoners to $50,000 per year, or to $100,000 per year in\n\ncapital cases); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258D, §§ 1, 5 (capping state's\n\nliability at $500,000 per incident).                  But these statutes do not\n\npurport     to    measure   the   harm     actually        inflicted   by    wrongful\n\n\n                                         -55-\n\fincarceration; rather, each reflects a legislative choice to limit\n\nthe sovereign's liability.      Congress could have imposed such a\n\nceiling on damages for wrongful incarceration under the FTCA but\n\nchose instead to make the United States liable to the same extent as\n\na private party under local law.     See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1).    We\n\nhave neither the authority nor the inclination to veto this exercise\n\nof legislative judgment.\n\n            We turn next to the government's plaint that the ratio of\n\nemotional distress damages to years served should decrease over time\n\n(that is, that the longer an individual is in a penitentiary, the\n\nless he should receive in damages on an annualized basis).   That is\n\nan argument more appropriately made to the trier of fact.    There is\n\nno flat rule to that effect — nor should there be.           In some\n\ncircumstances, it may be reasonable to conclude that the loss of\n\nhope as time marches on warrants larger annualized amounts for\n\nemotional injuries.\n\n            In short, the range of permissible ratios is wide.     That\n\nis understandable; dollars are at best a rough and awkward proxy for\n\ntime spent in the throes of wrongful incarceration.     In the final\n\nanalysis, it is for the trier of fact to resolve the difficult\n\nquestions   of   quantification and monetization that lurk in the\n\npenumbra of cases such as this.

Cir.\n\n1997).     The    lower    court's      decision   to    use    a   sliding    scale,\n\ndecreasing    over    time,     would   be    within    the    encincture     of   that\n\ndiscretion.       So, too, is its decision not to use such a sliding\n\nscale.\n\n           This brings us to the damage awards themselves.                    We have\n\nsaid before, and today reaffirm, that \"there is no scientific\n\nformula or measuring device which can be applied to place a precise\n\ndollar value on matters such as restraint of freedom, fright,\n\nanxiety, loss of face, or emotional scarring.\"                 Wagenmann, 829 F.2d\n\nat 216.\n\n           The wisdom of that statement is evident here: placing a\n\ndollar    value      on   the    emotional      pain     incident     to    wrongful\n\nincarceration, the dreary sameness of life behind bars for years on\n\nend, and the loss of freedom, relationships, and hope cries out for\n\napproximation. Moreover, the difficulty inherent in monetization of\n\nthose injuries is itself a reason for deference to the front-line\n\njudgment of the trial court.                 Cf. Langevine, 106 F.3d at 1024\n\n(indicating that \"[a] court must be especially hesitant to disturb\n\na jury's determination of damages in cases involving intangible and\n\nnon-economic injuries\"); Wagenmann, 829 F.2d at 215 (similar).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -57-\n\fViewed through this prism, we cannot say that the district court's\n\nchoice of baseline was unreasonable.\n\n          We do not mean to imply that the methodology employed by\n\nthe district court in this case should be regarded as the norm, nor\n\ndo we suggest that it should be transplanted root and branch into\n\nother factual scenarios.     Were we sitting as trial judges, none of\n\nus would have employed that same methodology.           The $1,000,000 per\n\nyear baseline is extremely generous, and in cases involving non-\n\neconomic damages we have counseled that special attention must be\n\npaid to the particular circumstances of each individual plaintiff.\n\nSee, e.g., Tobin, 553 F.3d at 144-45.\n\n          But we are not sitting as trial judges in this instance.\n\nOur function is solely one of appellate review.           In carrying out\n\nthat task, we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for that\n\nof the trial court.   Rather, we must acknowledge the trial court's\n\nsuperior coign of vantage.\n\n          Moreover,   a   district   court,   sitting    without   a   jury,\n\npossesses a variety of implements with which to work in monetizing\n\nemotional injuries.   Although particular tools must be selected and\n\ndeployed with a degree of circumspection, the valuation difficulties\n\nposed by specific sets of facts also must be taken into account.\n\nGiven the extent of those difficulties here, the district court's\n\ndecision to reach into its armamentarium and select a per-year\n\n\n\n\n                                  -58-\n\fbaseline as the methodology of choice cannot be deemed an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n            That leaves the naked claim of excessiveness (a claim that\n\nencompasses the government's charge that $1,000,000 per year is\n\nsimply too rich).15      This question is not free from doubt.           The\n\ndistrict court's awards are considerably more munificent than the\n\namounts that this court would have awarded in the first instance.\n\nIn our view, the awards approach the outermost boundary of what\n\nmight be thought conscionable.      Cf. Baba-Ali v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">555</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 n.7 (N.Y. Ct. Cl. 2009) (chronicling awards of lesser\n\namounts).\n\n            Still and all, the awards are by no means unprecedented,\n\nand the \"shock-the-conscience\" test cannot be administered in a\n\nvacuum.     What is shocking under one set of facts may be acceptable\n\n(even if only marginally so) under different circumstances.              See\n\nUnited States v.

But when we take\n\ninto    account   the   severe   emotional   trauma   inflicted   upon   the\n\nscapegoats, we cannot say with any firm conviction that those awards\n\n\n       15\n       The government has not specifically challenged the amounts\nof the derivative awards (or, for that matter, the liability\nfindings) on the plaintiffs' claims for loss of consortium and the\nlike.

Consequently,\n\nwe conclude that the district court's awards must stand.\n\n              In concluding that the awards in this case fall short of\n\nshocking the conscience, we think it important to make clear that\n\nthe    $1,000,000      annuity    selected       by    the    district    court      as   the\n\nbaseline for its calculation should not be understood as a carob\n\nseed    for   measuring    the     harm    caused       by    wrongful    incarceration\n\ngenerally.     Applying a literal reading of the statement in Limone IV\n\nthat \"wrongfully imprisoned plaintiffs were entitled to compensation\n\nof at least $1 million per year of imprisonment,\" 497 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n243 (emphasis supplied), one district court recently has treated the\n\n\n                                          -60-\n\f$1,000,000 per year baseline as a floor for damages arising out of\n\nwrongful incarceration.      See Smith v. City of Oakland, 538 F. Supp.\n\n2d 1217, 1242-43 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (citing Limone IV).        We regard\n\nthat characterization as unfortunate.       As we have emphasized, the\n\ndistrict court's awards are at the outer edge of the universe of\n\npermissible awards and survive scrutiny, though barely, only because\n\nof the deferential nature of the standard of review and the unique\n\ncircumstances of the case.\n\n             2.    The Cross-Appeal.   The district court awarded each\n\nminor child of a scapegoat $200,000 for loss of consortium and\n\n$50,000 in emotional distress damages.      Limone IV, 497 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 249-50.    Edward Greco, the surviving son of the late Louis Greco,\n\nSr., objects to his award on the ground that he suffered more from\n\nhis father's wrongful incarceration than did the other children.\n\n             The cross-appeal comes to us in the following procedural\n\nposture.     After the district court handed down its decision in\n\nLimone IV and entered judgment, Edward filed a motion to alter the\n\njudgment.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).   The court denied that motion,\n\ndeclaring that any additional hardship was attributable to the Greco\n\nfamily's dysfunctionality — a condition that predated Louis Greco's\n\nconviction.       See Limone v. United States (Limone V), No. 02-10890\n\n(D. Mass. Dec. 21, 2007) (unpublished order).     We review the denial\n\nof a motion to alter or amend a previously entered judgment for\n\n\n\n\n                                   -61-\n\fabuse of discretion.   Vasapolli v.

A corollary to this axiom is that a court\n\ncharged with making a damage award should take into account the\n\nparticular circumstances of each individual plaintiff.           Gutiérrez-\n\nRodríguez, 882 F.2d at 579.     This corollary holds true with respect\n\nto damages for emotional distress and loss of consortium, both of\n\nwhich by their very nature are difficult to monetize.            See, e.g.,\n\nTobin, 553 F.3d at 144-45; Koster v. TWA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198522\"><a href=\"/opinion/198522/koster-v-trans-world/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35-36\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); Smith v.

Identical   damage   awards   at   times   are\n\nwarranted.    See, e.g., Sutton v. Earles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 918 (9th Cir.\n\n1994) (upholding identical annualized awards of non-economic damages\n\nto five parents of deceased seamen).\n\n           The district court engaged in a thoughtful, detailed\n\nanalysis of the manner in which each scapegoat and each family\n\nmember was affected by the government's misconduct.         See Limone IV,\n\n497 F. Supp. 2d at 235-43.          Within that analysis, the         court\n\nchronicled the deterioration of the Greco family.           Id. at 241-43.\n\nThe court's rescript reveals that Edward was eleven years old when\n\n\n                                   -62-\n\fhis father was sentenced.         Around that time, his mother, Roberta,\n\nbegan to drink heavily, and Edward became the primary caretaker for\n\nhis older brother.    Roberta abused Edward physically and, when he\n\nwas thirteen, abandoned him without making provisions for his care.\n\nEdward and his brother lived with extended family, but Edward was\n\nthrown out when he was sixteen.                 He soon lost contact with his\n\nbrother (who eventually committed suicide).\n\n           The district court determined that Edward's plight, though\n\ntragic, was attributable mainly to causes that predated his father's\n\nimprisonment.     Roberta had filed for divorce three years before\n\nGreco's conviction, charging extreme cruelty.                In response, Greco\n\nattempted to strangle her.        Indeed, the marital relationship was so\n\ntroubled that the district court rejected Roberta's claim for loss\n\nof   consortium   (though    it    awarded       her   damages   for   intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress).              Id. at 247, 250.\n\n            Based on this background, the district court concluded in\n\nLimone V that the government's misconduct caused only a fraction of\n\nthe woes that befell Edward.         The rest would have occurred in any\n\nevent because of the dysfunctional family environment.\n\n           Edward   resists       this    conclusion,      admonishing    that   a\n\ndefendant takes a plaintiff as it finds him.                See Doty v. Sewall,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545153\"><a href=\"/opinion/545153/arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall-arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1059 (1st Cir. 1990); Dulieu v. White & Sons, [1901]\n\n2 K.B. 669, 679.    That is true as far as it goes — but it does not\n\ntake Edward very far.       A defendant may be held liable only for the\n\n\n                                         -63-\n\fdamages that it actually causes.          See W. Page Keeton, Prosser &\n\nKeeton on Torts 292 (5th ed. 1984) (reiterating this principle in\n\nregard to \"eggshell-skull\" plaintiffs).\n\n            Causation is generally a question of fact, committed\n\nlargely to the competence of the factfinder.       See Peckham, 895 F.2d\n\nat 837.   Given the idiosyncratic circumstances surrounding Edward's\n\nclaim, we cannot say that the district court either clearly erred in\n\nholding that the government's misconduct was not a but-for cause of\n\nEdward's special hardships or abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to alter the judgment.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We summarize succinctly.      The district court handled this\n\nmatter with care and assiduous attention to detail.         It took pains\n\nto make specific findings and to explain its reasoning.          While we\n\nreject its finding that the government is liable for malicious\n\nprosecution, we uphold the court's alternate finding             that the\n\ngovernment   is   liable   for   intentional   infliction   of   emotional\n\ndistress.    We also uphold the district court's decision to reject\n\nthe government's invocation of the discretionary function defense.\n\nFinally, we conclude that the district court used a permissible\n\nmethodology in computing damages and that the damage awards, though\n\nhigh, are not so excessive as to warrant appellate intervention.\n\n            We need go no further.    This case exemplifies a situation\n\nin which the end did not justify the government's use of very\n\n\n                                   -64-\n\funattractive means. In its zeal to accomplish a worthwhile objective\n\n(stamping out organized crime), the FBI stooped too low.                      Its\n\nmisconduct    was   not   only    outrageous   but    also    tortious.      That\n\nmisconduct    resulted    in   severe   harm   to    the    persons    wrongfully\n\nconvicted    and    to    their   families.
