Petitioner Timothy Dupont seeks a certificate of\n\nappealability (\"COA\") to appeal from the denial of his § 2254\n\npetition.     In his pro se filings in this court, petitioner raises\n\nmultiple issues.     Only the two issues that he raised in his § 2254\n\npetition in district court are properly before us. See David v.\n\nUnited States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"It is well\n\nestablished that a party may not unveil an argument in the court of\n\nappeals that he did not seasonably raise in the district court\").\n\n     An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a\n\nperson in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court shall be\n\nentertained \"only on the ground that he is in custody in violation\n\nof the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28\n\nU.S.C.   §   2254(a).     Where,   as    in    this   case,   the   claims   were\n\nadjudicated on the merits in state court, relief may be granted only\n\nif the state court's adjudication of the claim resulted in a\n\ndecision     that   was   \"contrary     to    or   involved   an    unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States;\" or that was \"based on an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n     A COA to appeal from the denial of such a petition may issue\n\n\"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial\n\nof a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). Where, as here,\n\nthe \"district court has rejected the           constitutional claims on the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fmerits,   the     showing     required     to   satisfy    §   2253(c)    is\n\nstraightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable\n\njurists   would   find   the    district    court's   assessment    of   the\n\nconstitutional claims debatable or wrong.\" Slack v. McDaniel, 529\n\nU.S. 473, 484 (2000).       Petitioner has failed to make the requisite\n\nshowing with regard to either issue presented to the district court.\n\n     I. Sufficiency of the Indictments\n\n     A. Particularity       In his memo in support of his § 2254 motion,\n\nDupont argued that the indictments were not sufficiently specific\n\nto allow defendant to prepare his defense because \"[t]he only\n\ndistinguishing facts among the sets of indictments are the dates.\"\n\nThe Sixth Amendment \"requires that the defendant be informed of the\n\nnature and cause of the accusation.\" United States v. Calderon, 77\n\nF.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).             \"[I]n general, an\n\nindictment is sufficiently particular if it elucidates the elements\n\nof the crime, enlightens a defendant as to the nature of the charge\n\nagainst which she must defend, and enables her to plead double\n\njeopardy in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. See\n\nHamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974).\" United States v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1192 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n     The indictments charged Dupont with           sixty-nine counts of\n\nfelonious sexual assault, in violation of RSA 632-A:3, III.              The\n\nelements of that offense are: 1) engaging in sexual contact, 2) with\n\na person other than the actor's legal spouse, 3) when the person is\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\funder 13 years of age. Each count charged a specific sexual contact\n\nbetween Dupont and his step daughter, and the month and year when\n\nsuch contact occurred.     The New Hampshire Supreme Court \"agree[d]\n\nwith the trial court that the defendant failed to demonstrate that\n\nhe was prejudiced in his ability to prepare a defense.\" State v.\n\nDupont, 149 N.H. 70, 77 (2003).    The district court concluded that\n\nthe state court's holding in that regard was not contrary to nor an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the United States Supreme Court. 8/27/03 Order, pp.\n\n11-12.   Dupont has failed to demonstrate that reasonable jurists\n\nwould find that assessment debatable or wrong.\n\n     B. Duplicity\n\n     \"Duplicity is the joining in a single count of two or\n     more distinct and separate offenses.\" United States v.\n     Martinez Canas, 595 F.2d 73, 78 (1st Cir. 1979). \"[T]he\n     prohibition against duplicitous indictments arises\n     primarily out of a concern that the jury may find a\n     defendant guilty on a count without having reached a\n     unanimous verdict on the commission of any particular\n     offense.\" United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st\n     Cir. 1995).\n\nUnited States v. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     In his § 2254 memorandum, Dupont argued that \"the manner in\n\nwhich the indictments read had the effect of being duplications and\n\nthus tainted the verdict of the jury,\" in violation of his right\n\nagainst Double Jeopardy.     This argument was made by Dupont in his\n\nappeal to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, where he contended\n\nthat \"notwithstanding the separate indictments, they are generic in\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fnature and permit the juror confusion enunciated in [State v.] Patch\n\n[, 135 N.H. 127 (1991)].\"      However, the New Hampshire Supreme Court\n\nheld that the potential for jury confusion recognized in Patch \"did\n\nnot exist in this case because the State did exactly what Patch\n\nrequires; it 'brought several indictments, each alleging a specific\n\nincident, and consolidated them for trial.' Patch, 135 N.H. at 129.\n\nThe allegation of a single incident in each of a number of specific\n\nmonths both ensured unanimity and precluded any danger of double\n\njeopardy.\" Dupont, 149 N.H. at 77.\n\n      The district court held that Dupont had failed to demonstrate\n\nthat the state court's resolution of that issue was contrary to or\n\ninvolved an unreasonable application of federal law. Dupont has not\n\nshown that reasonable jurists could find that assessment debatable\n\nor   wrong   with   respect   to   his   claim   that   the   indictment   was\n\nunconstitutionally duplicitous.\n\n      II. Tape-Recorded Confession\n\n      In his second Amended Petition, Dupont clarified that he was\n\nseeking § 2254 relief on the ground that the New Hampshire Supreme\n\nCourt had misapplied the federal \"harmless error\" rule set forth in\n\nRose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570 (1986), to his claim that the trial\n\ncourt had erred in admitting his tape-recorded confession. However,\n\na COA may not issue unless the petitioner has made a substantial\n\nshowing of the denial of a constitutional right. As the district\n\ncourt stated, \"[t]here is no requirement in federal law that a taped\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fconfession be 'complete' before it can be admitted into evidence,\n\nand certainly the federal constitution imposes no such requirement.\"\n\n8/27/03 Order, p. 9.    Therefore, the second Amended § 2254 Petition\n\nfailed to allege, much less make a substantial showing of, a\n\nconstitutional violation.\n\n     The district court noted that Dupont's original § 2254 petition\n\n\"hints at a claim that Dupont's due process rights were violated by\n\nthe admission into evidence of his taped confession.\" Id., p. 9 n.1.\n\nFinding that claim to be unexhausted but \"wholly without merit,\" the\n\ndistrict court denied it. Id.     \"An application for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of\n\nthe applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the\n\nState.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2).\n\n     In his § 2254 memorandum Dupont argued that his due process\n\nrights were violated by \"the failure of the government to record and\n\nintroduce   the   entire   interrogation   of   the   defendant.\"   §   2254\n\nMemorandum, p. 7. In support of that argument he relies upon Crane\n\nv. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683 (1986).     That case is inapposite however.\n\nDupont has not alleged that he sought and the trial court prevented\n\nhim from introducing evidence about the circumstances in which his\n\nconfession was given.      Instead, he argued that the admission into\n\nevidence of the selective recording of his interrogation misled the\n\njury by keeping from them the \"context of the 'confession' and the\n\ncoercive nature of the interrogation as alleged by the defendant.\"\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fThe police officers' failure to record the entire interrogation\n\narguably could be characterized as a failure to preserve evidence.\n\nSuch a failure violates a defendant's due process rights only if the\n\ngovernment: \"(1) acted in bad faith when it [failed to preserve]\n\nevidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and,\n\nwhich (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.\" United States v. Femia,\n\n9 F.3d 990, 993-94 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n      It   appears    that   Dupont     could    not   satisfy    the    second\n\nrequirement.   The state court found that \"[t]he defendant's taped\n\nconfession was merely cumulative of [other] evidence,\" that there\n\nwas \"no evidence that the defendant made exculpatory or otherwise\n\ninconsistent statements during the unrecorded portion of his\n\nstatements to the police,\" and that \"the victim's testimony that\n\nthe   defendant      had   committed    all     of   the   acts   charged   was\n\nessentially uncontradicted.\" Dupont, 149 N.H. at 76.                    The New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court concluded that \"it is clear beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant would have been convicted even\n\nif the recording had been excluded.\" Id. Dupont has not challenged\n\nthose findings.       Under these circumstances, reasonable jurists\n\ncould not find debatable or wrong the district court's assessment\n\nthat Dupont's due process claim was meritless.\n\n      Dupont's requests for a COA and for an evidentiary hearing\n\nare denied.    The appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f",

Therefore, the second Amended § 2254 Petition\n\nfailed to allege, much less make a substantial showing of, a\n\nconstitutional violation.\n\n     The district court noted that Dupont's original § 2254 petition\n\n\"hints at a claim that Dupont's due process rights were violated by\n\nthe admission into evidence of his taped confession.\" Id., p. 9 n.1.\n\nFinding that claim to be unexhausted but \"wholly without merit,\" the\n\ndistrict court denied it. Id.     \"An application for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of\n\nthe applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the\n\nState.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2).\n\n     In his § 2254 memorandum Dupont argued that his due process\n\nrights were violated by \"the failure of the government to record and\n\nintroduce   the   entire   interrogation   of   the   defendant.\"   §   2254\n\nMemorandum, p. 7. In support of that argument he relies upon Crane\n\nv. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986).     That case is inapposite however.\n\nDupont has not alleged that he sought and the trial court prevented\n\nhim from introducing evidence about the circumstances in which his\n\nconfession was given.      Instead, he argued that the admission into\n\nevidence of the selective recording of his interrogation misled the\n\njury by keeping from them the \"context of the 'confession' and the\n\ncoercive nature of the interrogation as alleged by the defendant.\"\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fThe police officers' failure to record the entire interrogation\n\narguably could be characterized as a failure to preserve evidence.\n\nSuch a failure violates a defendant's due process rights only if the\n\ngovernment: \"(1) acted in bad faith when it [failed to preserve]\n\nevidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and,\n\nwhich (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.\" United States v. Femia,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195039\"><a href=\"/opinion/195039/united-states-v-femia/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 993-94 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n      It   appears    that   Dupont     could    not   satisfy    the    second\n\nrequirement.   The state court found that \"[t]he defendant's taped\n\nconfession was merely cumulative of [other] evidence,\" that there\n\nwas \"no evidence that the defendant made exculpatory or otherwise\n\ninconsistent statements during the unrecorded portion of his\n\nstatements to the police,\" and that \"the victim's testimony that\n\nthe   defendant      had   committed    all     of   the   acts   charged   was\n\nessentially uncontradicted.\" Dupont, 149 N.H. at 76.                    The New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court concluded that \"it is clear beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant would have been convicted even\n\nif the recording had been excluded.\" Id. Dupont has not challenged\n\nthose findings.       Under these circumstances, reasonable jurists\n\ncould not find debatable or wrong the district court's assessment\n\nthat Dupont's due process claim was meritless.\n\n      Dupont's requests for a COA and for an evidentiary hearing\n\nare denied.    The appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f</pre>",
