Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n               Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Barry J.

Chief for the State of Rhode Island, Claire Richards,\nDeputy Executive Counsel, and Mary Kay, Deputy Chief Legal Counsel,\nfor the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, were\non brief, for defendants-appellees/cross-appellants.\n\n\n\n                          July 28, 2003\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.            Rhode Island, through its\n\nDepartment of Environmental Management, acquired an area of land in\n\nthe Pascoag Reservoir (\"Reservoir\" or \"Lake\") by adverse possession\n\nand obtained a prescriptive easement on behalf of the public to use\n\nthe   Reservoir   for   recreational      activities.       In   this   inverse\n\ncondemnation suit,1 Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC (\"Pascoag\"), the\n\nReservoir's owner, seeks compensation for that acquisition.\n\n           The district court dismissed the case for failure to\n\nstate a claim.     Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC v. Rhode Island, 217\n\nF. Supp. 2d 206, 229 (D.R.I. 2002) (hereinafter \"Pascoag Federal\n\nDecision\").       The   court   found   that,    as   a   general   rule,   the\n\ngovernment must compensate for a taking made by adverse possession\n\nor prescription, but Pascoag may not recover in this case either\n\nbecause the statute of limitations began to run in 1975, when the\n\nstate acquired its property rights, or because the doctrine of\n\nlaches bars recovery.       Id. at 226-29.       The court then dismissed\n\nPascoag's state law claims.       Id. at 229.\n\n           The state appeals the first finding, asserting that\n\nadverse possession and prescription do not constitute a taking of\n\nproperty under the Constitution.        Pascoag appeals the dismissal of\n\n\n1\n     Inverse condemnation is \"'a cause of action against a\ngovernmental defendant to recover the value of property which has\nbeen taken in fact by the governmental defendant, even though no\nformal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted\nby the taking agency.'\" United States v. Clarke, 445 U.S. 253, 257\n(1980) (quoting D. Hagman, Urban Planning and Land Development\nControl Law 328 (1971)).\n\n                                    -2-\n\fits claim, arguing that the statute of limitations did not begin to\n\nrun until the recent judicial determination that the state had\n\nacquired property rights in the Reservoir.\n\n          We agree with the district court that Pascoag failed to\n\nstate a viable claim.      Because Pascoag failed to timely pursue its\n\nstate remedies, it forfeited its federal claim.                   Following the\n\n\"fundamental rule of judicial restraint,\" we do not reach the\n\nconstitutional question of whether compensation is due when the\n\nstate acquires land by adverse possession or prescription.                  Am.\n\nMfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 62 (Ginsburg, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (quotation\n\nomitted); see also Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187 F.3d 192, 197 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (declaring \"courts should not reach constitutional\n\nquestions in advance of the necessity of deciding them\").\n\n                                  I.    Facts\n\n          Located in the towns of Burrillville and Glocester, Rhode\n\nIsland, the Reservoir (also known as Echo Lake) is more than two\n\nmiles long and has more than ten miles of shoreline.                  Pascoag's\n\npredecessor in title created the Lake in 1860; Pascoag has owned\n\nthe Reservoir since 1983.         In 1964, the state purchased a lot\n\nabutting the Reservoir and constructed a public boat ramp the\n\nfollowing year.\n\n          Until at least 1997, \"members of the public could . . .\n\nuse the   ramp   as   a   point   of   access   to   the   lake    for   various\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\frecreational activities, including boating and fishing.\"                    Reitsma\n\nv. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 829 (R.I. 2001)\n\n(hereinafter \"Pascoag State Decision\").              The Reservoir was enjoyed\n\nby \"innumerable members of the public and other lakeside property\n\nowners.\"      Id.   In 1997, Pascoag sought to limit the public's use by\n\nplacing a \"NO TRESPASSING\" sign near the water.                Id.\n\n              In 1998, the state brought suit in state court asserting,\n\namong other things, that it had acquired property rights in the\n\nReservoir.          Pascoag   cross-claimed,    alleging      that    the   state's\n\nactions constituted a taking without just compensation, but the\n\nstate courts did not decide the taking issue because Pascoag later\n\nvoluntarily dismissed its inverse condemnation claim. In 2001, the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court held that the state had acquired by\n\nadverse possession a small portion of the Lake bottom (occupied by\n\nthe    boat   ramp)    and    had   acquired,   on   the    public's    behalf,   a\n\nprescriptive easement to use the boat ramp to access the entire\n\nLake for recreational purposes.           Id. at 834.       The court held \"that\n\nthe state had begun to use the Reservoir property in 1965 and,\n\nunder the Rhode Island ten year adverse possession statute, had\n\nacquired title to a portion of the Reservoir plus an easement in\n\n1975.\"     Pascoag Federal Decision, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 211 (citing\n\nPascoag State Decision, 774 A.2d at 838).              The issue in the state\n\ncase    was   whether    the    state   acquired     land    rights    by   adverse\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fpossession and prescription; the Rhode Island Supreme Court held\n\nthat it did.     Pascoag State Decision, 774 A.2d at 834.\n\n            Pascoag filed this complaint in federal court in October\n\n2001, alleging that the state violated the Takings Clause of the\n\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments and asserting related state law\n\nclaims.     The district court, treating the claim as one arising\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, dismissed the suit, and this appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                        II.    Standard of Review\n\n            We review de novo the district court's dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).        Rockwell\n\nv. Cape Cod Hosp., 26 F.3d 254, 255 (1st Cir. 1994).        We accept the\n\ncomplaint's allegations as true and make all reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of the plaintiff.       Id.    We will affirm the dismissal only\n\nif Pascoag cannot prove any facts entitling it to relief.         Id.\n\n                              III.   Discussion\n\n            A.   Prerequisites to a Takings Claim\n\n            In Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v.\n\nHamilton Bank, the Supreme Court outlined two prerequisites to a\n\nfederal suit alleging a Fifth Amendment taking of a property\n\ninterest.    473 U.S. 172, 186, 194-95 (1985).      A federal suit is not\n\ntimely until a plaintiff demonstrates that (a) \"the government\n\nentity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a\n\nfinal decision regarding the application of the regulations to the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fproperty at issue,\" (the \"final decision requirement\") and (b) the\n\nplaintiff sought (and was denied) just compensation by means of an\n\nadequate state procedure (the \"state action requirement\").2   Id. at\n\n186, 194-95.    Williamson County stands \"for the proposition that\n\nthere is no uncompensated taking -- that is, nothing to litigate\n\nunder ยง 1983 -- until the state has established (a) what it has\n\ntaken, and (b) its refusal to pay 'just compensation.'\"    SGB Fin.\n\nServs., Inc. v. Consol. City of Indianapolis-Marion County, Ind.,\n\n235 F.3d 1036, 1038 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n          Although Williamson County was a regulatory taking case,\n\na modified verison of its timeliness analysis applies to physical\n\ntaking cases.   Daniel v. County of Santa Barbara, 288 F.3d 375, 382\n\n(9th Cir. 2002).    The present case concerns a potential physical\n\ntaking, based on the intrusion onto Pascoag's property or the\n\nacquisition of rights in that property.3      In a physical taking\n\ncase, the final decision requirement is relieved or assumed because\n\n\"[w]here there has been a physical invasion, the taking occurs at\n\nonce, and nothing the [governmental actor] can do or say after that\n\npoint will change that fact.\"    Hall v. City of Santa Barbara, 833\n\n\n2\n   This case does not raise the issue of whether the Williamson\nCounty requirements apply when a litigant alleges that the state\nhas taken property for a purely private use. See Daniels v. Area\nPlan Comm'n, 306 F.3d 445, 453 & n.6 (7th Cir. 2002) (identifying\ncircuit split and citing cases).\n3\n   Both the fee simple in the Lake bottom and the easement on\nbehalf of the public are permanent physical occupations.  See\nNollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 832 (1987).\n\n                                -6-\n\fF.2d 1270, 1281 n.28 (9th Cir. 1987); cf. Arnett v. Myers, 281 F.3d\n\n552, 563 (6th Cir. 2002) (finding final decision requirement\n\nsatisfied because decision maker \"arrived at a definitive position\n\ninflicting an actual, concrete injury when its agents removed and\n\ndestroyed\" plaintiff's alleged property); Forseth v. Village of\n\nSussex, 199 F.3d 363, 372 n.12 (7th Cir. 2000) (finding physical\n\ntaking claim subject only to Williamson County's state action\n\nrequirement).    However, the state action requirement remains in\n\nphysical taking cases: \"[C]ompensation must first be sought from\n\nthe state if adequate procedures are available.\"            Sinaloa Lake\n\nOwners Ass'n v. City of Simi Valley, 882 F.2d 1398, 1402 (9th Cir.\n\n1989), overruled on other grounds by Armendariz v. Penman, 75 F.3d\n\n1311, 1326 (9th Cir. 1996) (en banc).\n\n           B.   State Action Requirement\n\n           Here, if Rhode Island \"provides an adequate process for\n\nobtaining compensation, and resort to that process holds out some\n\nrealistic promise of yielding just compensation,\" Pascoag may not\n\nseek compensation in federal court for an alleged taking without\n\nfirst   resorting   to   the   state   process.   Gilbert   v.   City   of\n\nCambridge, 932 F.2d 51, 63 (1st Cir. 1991); accord Williamson\n\nCounty, 473 U.S. at 195 (\"[I]f a state provides an adequate\n\nprocedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot\n\nclaim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used\n\nthe procedure and been denied just compensation.\").          \"'[B]ecause\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthe Fifth Amendment4 proscribes takings without just compensation,\n\nno constitutional violation occurs until just compensation has been\n\ndenied.'\"    Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 63 (quoting Williamson County, 473\n\nU.S. at 194 n.13); accord Gamble v. Eau Claire County, 5 F.3d 285,\n\n286 (7th Cir. 1993) (stating that a litigant must \"exhaust[] his\n\nremedies for obtaining a compensation award or equivalent relief\n\nfrom the state\" because \"the right protected by the duty of just\n\ncompensation is not to the land or its use but merely to the market\n\nvalue of what is taken\").    Thus, \"the state's action . . . is not\n\n'complete' until the state fails to provide adequate compensation\n\nfor the taking.\"    Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 195.\n\n            Pascoag did not seek compensation through the state\n\ncourt.      Pascoag's burden is to show that one of the narrow\n\nexceptions to the state action requirement applies.       The Supreme\n\nCourt in Williamson County identified two exceptions -- where state\n\nremedies were \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate.\"    473 U.S. at 196-97;\n\naccord Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 285 F.3d 142, 146 (1st\n\nCir. 2002); Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 65.         Some courts have also\n\nrecognized an exception where state remedies are \"futile.\" See,\n\ne.g., Daniels, 306 F.3d at 456.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The Fifth Amendment provides that \"private property [shall not]\nbe taken for public use without just compensation.\" U.S. Const.\namend. V.    It applies to the states through the Fourteenth\nAmendment. MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. County of Yolo, 477 U.S.\n340, 342 n.1 (1986).\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              1.    Availability of adequate state remedies\n\n              First, we consider whether adequate state remedies were\n\navailable to Pascoag.             Courts have made exceptions to Williamson\n\nCounty's state action requirement when state law did not recognize\n\nthe taking that occurred, or did not permit the relief required to\n\nmake the plaintiff whole.            See, e.g., Daniels, 306 F.3d at 456-57\n\n(finding an exception to the state action requirement because\n\nplaintiffs did not have a \"definable pecuniary loss\" and state\n\ninverse condemnation proceedings were limited to monetary damages);\n\nHall,   833    F.2d     at   1281    n.28    (finding     a   state    court   process\n\ninadequate because at the time, no action for inverse condemnation\n\nbased on a regulatory taking could be brought under California\n\nlaw); see also Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725,\n\n734 n.8 (1997) (\"Ordinarily, a plaintiff must seek compensation\n\nthrough state inverse condemnation proceedings before initiating a\n\ntakings suit in federal court, unless the state does not provide\n\nadequate remedies for obtaining compensation.\").\n\n              Pascoag cannot show that Rhode Island's remedies were\n\ninadequate or unavailable. The Rhode Island Constitution prohibits\n\nthe   taking       of   private     property      for   public   use   without    just\n\ncompensation and Rhode Island state courts have long allowed\n\nrecovery through suits for inverse condemnation.                        Annicelli v.\n\nTown of South Kingstown, 463 A.2d 133, 139 (R.I. 1983); E & J Inc.\n\nv. Redevelopment Agency of Woonsocket, 405 A.2d 1187, 1189 (R.I.\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\f1979) (\"Governmental action short of actual acquisition of property\n\nmay be a constructive taking or an inverse condemnation . . . .\");\n\ncf. Caldarone v. Rhode Island, 199 A.2d 303, 304 (R.I. 1964)\n\n(assessing damages for land taken by state); see also Harris v. Mo.\n\nConservation Comm'n, 790 F.2d 678, 680-81 (8th Cir. 1986) (finding\n\nconstitutional provision provided adequate remedy).            Thus, Rhode\n\nIsland has an adequate process available to address Pascoag's suit\n\nfor just compensation.\n\n              2.   Futility of pursuing state remedies5\n\n              In its decision regarding the property rights of the\n\nstate   and    Pascoag,   the   Rhode   Island   Supreme   Court   discussed\n\nPascoag's potential takings claims in dicta:\n\n              [E]ven if the state's conduct from 1965 to\n              1975 had been unlawful and amounted to an\n              improper taking of the lake owner's property\n              without paying just compensation, and even if\n              the lake owner's property had not been taken\n              in   the   constitutional  sense   until   the\n              prescriptive period ended in 1975 - issues\n              that we have no need to decide in this case -\n              the corporation and its predecessors failed to\n              assert any takings claim in a timely manner.\n              Thus, they are barred from asserting them now\n              under any statute of limitations that possibly\n              could apply to such claims . . . .\n\n\n\n\n5\n   We recognized a futility exception to Williamson County's final\ndecision requirement where \"the granting authority has dug in its\nheels and made it transparently clear that the permit, application\nor no, will not be forthcoming.\" Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 61 (citation\nomitted).    A futility exception to the state action requirement\nwould exist under similar circumstances.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fPascoag State Decision, 774 A.2d at 838.      Pascoag argues that\n\nbecause this language suggests that Pascoag's claim is time-barred,\n\nstate court remedies are futile.\n\n          Again, Pascoag fails to carry its burden to show that an\n\nexception to the state action requirement applies.       Pascoag's\n\nfutility argument is simply that it is now time-barred from making\n\nstate law claims.   If the futility rule were read this broadly it\n\nwould swallow the general rule of state remedy exhaustion.    Like\n\nthe other exceptions, the futility exception must consider the\n\nlandowner's available state remedies at the time of the taking.\n\nSee Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 194 (\"[A]ll that is required [by\n\nthe Fifth Amendment] is that a reasonable, certain and adequate\n\nprovision for obtaining compensation exist at the time of the\n\ntaking.\") (quotation omitted). There is no evidence that the state\n\nwould not have been receptive to Pascoag's claim had it been\n\nbrought at the time the property was taken (regardless of whether\n\nthat was in 1965 or 1975 -- a determination we address below).\n\nPascoag offers no compelling explanation for not using state\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fprocedures earlier,6 and we find that state court remedies are not\n\nfutile.\n\n          C. Consequences of Failure to Bring a Timely State Claim\n\n          Pascoag    did   not   satisfy   the     Williamson   County\n\nprerequisites for a federal claim.      We have stated that takings\n\nclaims are \"unripe until the potential state remedy has been more\n\nfully pursued.\"7    Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 65.     The situation here is\n\ndifferent.   As the Rhode Island Supreme Court noted, there is a\n\nfatal flaw in Pascoag's claim: it is too late for any state law\n\ncause of action.    Williamson County requires the pursuit of state\n\n\n6\n   Because Pascoag's federal claim has been forfeited, we need not\naddress the issue of whether Pascoag, who became the owner of the\nReservoir in 1983, has a right to compensation. See Palazzolo v.\nRhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 628 (2001) (noting that in a physical\ntaking case, \"it is a general rule of the law of eminent domain\nthat any award goes to the owner at the time of the taking, and\nthat the right to compensation is not passed to a subsequent\npurchaser.\").\n7\n   The term \"ripe\" is confusing because, as explained infra, a\nplaintiff is barred from bringing federal suit in a situation such\nas Pascoag's, where the state statute of limitations has run.\nRipeness terminology suggests that a claim will later be available\nto the plaintiff; such language has been avoided in some recent\ncases. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.,\n526 U.S. 687, 721 (1999) (\"A federal court, moreover, cannot\nentertain a takings claim under ยง 1983 unless or until the\ncomplaining landowner has been denied an adequate postdeprivation\nremedy.\"); Harbours Pointe of Nashotah, LLC v. Village of Nashotah,\n278 F.3d 701, 704 (7th Cir. 2002) (noting that a plaintiff \"cannot\nstate a claim under federal law until he has used those [state]\nprocedures and been denied compensation.\"); but see Palazzolo, 533\nU.S. at 618 (using \"ripeness\" to explain Williamson County's\nrequirements in the regulatory taking context). We, too, avoid\nterms of ripeness because the Williamson County requirements may\nreveal the claim to be either unripe (too early) or overripe (too\nlate).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fremedies before a taking case is heard in federal court.            Adequate\n\nstate remedies were available to Pascoag; it simply ignored those\n\nremedies until it was too late.       By failing to bring a timely state\n\ncause of action, Pascoag forfeited its federal claim.\n\n            We assume for purposes of this appeal that a taking claim\n\nmay arise when the government acquires property rights by adverse\n\npossession or prescription.      Reviewing the dates as determined by\n\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court, the state and the public began\n\nusing the land and water in a manner that was open, actual,\n\nnotorious, hostile, adverse, continuous, and under a claim of right\n\nin 1965.    Pascoag State Decision, 774 A.2d at 834.       Property rights\n\nwere acquired by the state and the public in 1975.            Id. at 838.\n\nThe state court decision was issued in 2001.\n\n            Relying on United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745\n\n(1947), Pascoag argues that the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntaking had not \"stabilized\" until the Rhode Island Supreme Court's\n\nfinal decision, and the statute of limitations did not begin to run\n\nuntil     that   time.    See   id.    at   749.    We     find    Dickinson\n\ndistinguishable.     There, the government caused plaintiff's land to\n\nbe flooded, and the water level rose over a period of years.              Id.\n\nat 747.    The government did not use condemnation proceedings, but\n\n\"left the taking to physical events.\"        Id. at 748.    The Court held\n\nthat the statute of limitations did not begin to run when flooding\n\ncommenced, but only when physical events stabilized,              Id. at 749.\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fThis ensured     that   damages   could   be      ascertained   and    that   res\n\njudicata would not bar recovery for future damage.               Id.\n\n             While   Pascoag   points   to     facts   suggesting      that   the\n\nsituation regarding ownership of the Reservoir was not certain as\n\nlate as 1997, the State Supreme Court found that the State's use\n\nsatisfied all the adverse possession requirements by 1975. At that\n\ntime a final account could be struck, and nothing in the State's\n\nuse of the Lake changed over time, so piecemeal litigation would\n\nnot result.     There was continuous occupancy by the State for ten\n\nyears at which point property rights were acquired by operation of\n\nlaw and, if compensable, must be countered by a state court suit\n\nwithin the period allowed by the state statute of limitations.\n\n             Pascoag also asserts that its claim was not ripe until\n\nthe decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.                  We disagree.\n\nFirst, Pascoag's argument is at odds with the state court's finding\n\nof adverse possession and prescription, which is binding on Pascoag\n\nand requires open and notorious possession by the adverse party.\n\nThat determination means, assuming arguendo that a taking claim\n\ncould   be    made    for   acquisition      by     adverse     possession     or\n\nprescription, Pascoag should have known that a taking was in\n\nprogress and brought suit under state law at that time (within the\n\nrelevant statute of limitations).8        The statute of limitations for\n\n\n8\n   What remedies did Pascoag have available to it? From 1965 to\n1975, before adverse possession and prescription transferred title,\nPascoag could have brought a suit to evict the state from the land\n\n                                   -14-\n\fa state taking claim is, at most, 10 years (for \"all civil actions\n\nnot otherwise limited\"), and likely 1 year (for \"assessment of\n\ndamages in state condemnation proceedings\"). R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 9-1-\n\n36 (2002).   Pascoag's claim was ripe under state law at least by\n\n1975, when Pascoag, assuming it had any claim at all, could have\n\nbrought suit for recovery in state proceedings.    If it had done so\n\nand the state had denied a remedy in violation of the Constitution,\n\nthen a ยง 1983 claim would have ripened at the time of the denial.\n\nTo its detriment, Pascoag did not file suit, but instead waited\n\nuntil the state sought judicial remedies in 1998.\n\n          Second,   while   the    Williamson   County   requirements\n\ntypically reveal a claim to be premature, they may also reveal that\n\na claim is barred from the federal forum.       See Vandor, Inc. v.\n\nMilitello, 301 F.3d 37, 39 (2d Cir. 2002); Harbours Pointe, 278\n\nF.3d at 706; Gamble, 5 F.3d at 286; Harris, 790 F.2d at 681.     The\n\nWilliamson County \"ripeness\" requirements will never be met in this\n\ncase, because the state statute of limitations has run on Pascoag's\n\ninverse condemnation claim.   By failing to bring its state claim\n\nwithin the statute of limitations period, Pascoag forfeited its\n\nfederal claim.   Gamble, 5 F.3d at 286; accord Vandor, 301 F.3d at\n\n39. \"The state provided a remedy, but plaintiff[] failed to pursue\n\n\nor, alternatively, should have demanded that the state agree in\nwriting that occupancy was not intended to be adverse but was by\ntemporary and revocable permission.      This may seem harsh but\nadverse possession law puts this burden on all landowners as to all\noccupants.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fit.    [It] cannot obtain jurisdiction in the federal courts simply\n\nby    waiting   until    the   statute   of    limitation    bars   the   state\n\nremedies.\"      Harris, 790 F.2d at 681.\n\n            In Gamble, the plaintiff filed suit in federal court\n\nalleging that she had been denied just compensation by a zoning\n\nplan.      Gamble, 5 F.3d at 285.             The Seventh Circuit, citing\n\nWilliamson County, asked whether she had exhausted her remedies\n\n\"for obtaining a compensation award or equivalent relief from the\n\nstate.\"    Id. at 286.    Among the options available to the plaintiff\n\nunder state law was the ability to bring an inverse condemnation\n\nsuit.     Id.   However, the statute of limitations barred plaintiff\n\nfrom raising that issue in the state courts.           Id.    Analogizing to\n\nother situations where exhaustion of remedies is required, the\n\ncourt held that the failure to pursue state compensation remedies\n\nin a timely fashion forfeited plaintiff's federal claim to just\n\ncompensation.      Id.\n\n            Similarly, Pascoag's failure to bring a timely suit for\n\ncompensation under state law has led to the forfeiture of its\n\nfederal taking claim.          Even making all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of Pascoag -- that a taking claim can stand when the state\n\nacquires land by adverse possession, that the claim did not accrue\n\nuntil the state assumed property rights in 1975, and that the Rhode\n\nIsland statute of limitations for such a claim is 10 years --\n\nPascoag's state claim was time-barred in 1985.                 \"[A] claimant\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fcannot be permitted to let the time for seeking a state remedy pass\n\nwithout doing anything to obtain it and then proceed in federal\n\ncourt   on   the    basis    that     no    state    remedies    are      open.\"    Id.\n\nPascoag's failure to assert a timely state claim has foreclosed its\n\nfederal cause of action.            \"Litigants who neglect or disdain their\n\nstate remedies are out of court, period.\"                  River Park, Inc. v. City\n\nof Highland Park, 23 F.3d 164, 165 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                   IV.     Conclusion\n\n             To sum up, a taking by adverse possession occurred, on\n\nPascoag's own theory, in 1975 after a ten-year period of government\n\noccupancy or use.           At that point, Pascoag had an obligation to\n\nbring a suit in state court for compensation within the limitations\n\nperiod unless the state remedy was plainly futile (which in this\n\ncase it was not); and by failing to do so it forfeited any federal\n\nclaim that      state      processes      were     inadequate.       Of   course,   the\n\nsituation      in   1975    may    well     have    been   unclear     from   a    legal\n\nstandpoint, but for that, Pascoag's remedy was to bring a lawsuit\n\nwithin the statutory period.               The question of whether or not the\n\nstate   must    pay   when    it    takes     land    by   adverse     possession    or\n\nprescription will have to wait for another day.                      Because Pascoag\n\nfailed to bring a timely claim in state court, it forfeited its\n\nfederal takings claim.            The district court's decision is affirmed.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\f",

The court found that, as a general rule, the government must compensate for a taking made by adverse possession or prescription, but Pascoag may not recover in this case either because the statute of limitations began to run in 1975, when the state acquired its property rights, or because the doctrine of laches bars recovery. <i>Id.</i> at 226-29.

Following the \"fundamental rule of judicial restraint,\" we do not reach the constitutional question of whether compensation is due when the state acquires land by adverse possession or prescription. <i>Am.

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Located in the towns of Burrillville and Glocester, Rhode Island, the Reservoir (also known as Echo Lake) is more than two miles long and has more than ten miles of shoreline. Pascoag's predecessor in title created the Lake in 1860; Pascoag has owned the Reservoir since 1983. In 1964, the state purchased a lot abutting the Reservoir and constructed a public boat ramp the following year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until at least 1997, \"members of the public could ... use the ramp as a point of access to the lake for various recreational activities, including boating and fishing.\" <i>Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir &amp; Dam, LLC,</i> 774 A.2d 826, 829 (R.I.2001) (hereinafter <i>\"Pascoag State Decision\"</i>). The Reservoir was enjoyed by \"innumerable members of the public and other lakeside property owners.\" <i>Id.</i> In 1997, Pascoag sought to limit the public's use by placing a \"NO TRESPASSING\" sign near the water. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the state brought suit in state court asserting, among other things, that it had acquired property rights in the Reservoir. Pascoag cross-claimed, alleging that the state's actions constituted a taking without just compensation, but the state courts did not decide the taking issue because Pascoag later voluntarily dismissed its inverse condemnation claim. In 2001, the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that the state had acquired by adverse possession a small portion of the Lake bottom (occupied by the boat ramp) and had acquired, on the public's behalf, a prescriptive easement to use the boat ramp to access the entire Lake for recreational purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 834. The court held \"that the state had begun to use the Reservoir property in 1965 and, under the Rhode Island ten year adverse possession statute, had acquired title to a portion of the Reservoir plus an easement in 1975.\" <i>Pascoag Federal Decision,</i> 217 F.Supp.2d at 211 (citing <i>Pascoag State Decision,</i> 774 A.2d at 838). The issue in the state case was whether the state acquired land rights by adverse possession and prescription; the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that it did. <i>Pascoag State Decision,</i> 774 A.2d at 834.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pascoag filed this complaint in federal court in October 2001, alleging that the state violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and asserting related state law claims.

A federal suit is not timely until a plaintiff demonstrates that (a) \"the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue,\" (the \"final decision requirement\") and (b) the plaintiff sought (and was denied) just compensation by means of an adequate state procedure (the \"state action requirement\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> at 186, 194-95, 105 S.Ct. 3108. <i>Williamson County</i> stands \"for the proposition that there is no uncompensated taking &#8212; that is, nothing to litigate under &#167; 1983 &#8212; until the state has established (a) what it has taken, and (b) its refusal to pay `just compensation.'\" <i>SGB Fin.

The present case concerns a potential physical taking, based on the intrusion onto Pascoag's property or the acquisition of rights in that property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In a physical taking case, the final decision requirement is relieved or assumed because \"[w]here there has been a physical invasion, the taking occurs at once, and nothing the [governmental actor] can do or say after that point will change that fact.\" <i>Hall v.

Village of Sussex,</i> 199 F.3d 363, 372 n. 12 (7th Cir.2000) (finding physical taking claim subject only to <i>Williamson County's</i> state action requirement).

Pascoag's burden is to show that one of the narrow exceptions to the state action requirement applies. The Supreme Court in <i>Williamson County</i> identified two exceptions &#8212; where state remedies were \"unavailable\" or \"inadequate.\" 473 U.S. at 196-97, 105 S.Ct. 3108; <i>accord Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 285 F.3d 142, 146 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Gilbert,</i> 932 F.2d at 65.

Courts have made exceptions to <i>Williamson County's</i> state action requirement when state law did not recognize the taking that occurred, or did not permit the relief required to make the plaintiff whole. <i>See, e.g., Daniels,</i> 306 F.3d at 456-57 (finding an exception to the state action requirement because plaintiffs did not have a \"definable pecuniary loss\" and state inverse condemnation proceedings were limited to monetary damages); <i>Hall,</i> 833 F.2d at 1281 n. 28 (finding a state court process inadequate because at the time, no action for inverse condemnation based on a regulatory taking could be brought under California law); <i>see also Suitum v.

The Rhode Island Constitution prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation and Rhode Island state courts have long allowed recovery through suits for inverse condemnation. <i>Annicelli v. Town of South Kingstown,</i> 463 A.2d 133, 139 (R.I.1983); <i>E &amp; J Inc. v.

Pascoag's futility argument is simply that it is now time-barred from making state law claims. If the futility rule were read this broadly it would swallow the general rule of state remedy exhaustion. Like the other exceptions, the futility exception must consider the landowner's available state remedies at the time of the taking. <i>See Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (\"[A]ll that is required [by the Fifth Amendment] is that a reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation exist at the time of the taking.\") (quotation omitted). There is no evidence that the state would not have been receptive to Pascoag's claim had it been brought at the time the property was taken (regardless of whether that was in 1965 or 1975 &#8212; a determination we address below). Pascoag offers no compelling explanation for not using state procedures earlier,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and we find that state court remedies are not futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

We have stated that takings claims are \"unripe until the potential state remedy has been more fully pursued.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Gilbert,</i> 932 F.2d at 65. The situation here is different. As the Rhode Island Supreme Court noted, there is a fatal flaw in Pascoag's claim: it is too late for any state law cause of action. <i>Williamson County</i> requires the pursuit of state remedies before a taking case is heard in federal court. Adequate state remedies were available to Pascoag; it simply ignored those remedies until it was too late. By failing to bring a timely state cause of action, Pascoag forfeited its federal claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume for purposes of this appeal that a taking claim may arise when the government acquires property rights by adverse possession or prescription. Reviewing the dates as determined by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, the state and the public began using the land and water in a manner that was open, actual, notorious, hostile, adverse, continuous, and under a claim of right in 1965. <i>Pascoag State Decision,</i> 774 A.2d at 834. Property rights were acquired by the state and the public in 1975. <i>Id.</i> at 838. The state court decision was issued in 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on <i>United States v. Dickinson,</i> 331 U.S. 745, 67 S.Ct. 1382, 91 L.Ed. 1789 (1947), Pascoag argues that the circumstances surrounding the taking had not \"stabilized\" until the Rhode Island Supreme Court's final decision, and the statute of limitations did not begin to run until that time. <i>See id.</i> at 749, 67 S.Ct. 1382. We find <i>Dickinson</i> distinguishable. There, the government caused plaintiff's land to be flooded, and the water level rose over a period of years. <i>Id.</i> at 747, 67 S.Ct. 1382. The government did not use condemnation proceedings, but \"left the taking to physical events.\" <i>Id.</i> at 748, 67 S.Ct. 1382. The Court held that the statute of limitations did not begin to run when flooding commenced, but only when physical events stabilized, <i>Id.</i> at 749, 67 S.Ct. 1382. This ensured that damages could be ascertained and that res judicata would not bar recovery for future damage. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Pascoag points to facts suggesting that the situation regarding ownership of the Reservoir was not certain as late as 1997, the State Supreme Court found that the State's use satisfied all the adverse possession requirements by 1975. At that time a final account could be struck, and nothing in the State's use of the Lake changed over time, so piecemeal litigation would not result. There was continuous occupancy by the State for ten years at which point property rights were acquired by operation of law and, if compensable, must be countered by a state court suit within the period allowed by the state statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pascoag also asserts that its claim was not ripe until the decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. We disagree. First, Pascoag's argument is at odds with the state court's finding of adverse possession and prescription, which is binding on Pascoag and requires open and notorious possession by the adverse party. That determination means, assuming arguendo that a taking claim could be made for acquisition by adverse possession or prescription, Pascoag should have known that a taking was in progress and brought suit under state law at that time (within the relevant statute of limitations).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The statute of limitations for a state taking claim is, at most, 10 years (for \"all civil actions not otherwise limited\"), and likely 1 year (for \"assessment of damages in state condemnation proceedings\"). R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-1-36 (2002). Pascoag's claim was ripe under state law at least by 1975, when Pascoag, assuming it had any claim at all, could have brought suit for recovery in state proceedings. If it had done so and the state had denied a remedy in violation of the Constitution, then a &#167; 1983 claim would have ripened at the time of the denial. To its detriment, Pascoag did not file suit, but instead waited until the state sought judicial remedies in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, while the <i>Williamson County</i> requirements typically reveal a claim to be premature, they may also reveal that a claim is barred from the federal forum. <i>See Vandor, Inc. v. Militello,</i> 301 F.3d 37, 39 (2d Cir.2002); <i>Harbours Pointe,</i> 278 F.3d at 706; <i>Gamble,</i> 5 F.3d at 286; <i>Harris,</i> 790 F.2d at 681. The <i>Williamson County</i> \"ripeness\" requirements will never be met in this case, because the state statute of limitations has run on Pascoag's inverse condemnation claim. By failing to bring its state claim within the statute of limitations period, Pascoag <i>forfeited</i> its federal claim. <i>Gamble,</i> 5 F.3d at 286; <i>accord Vandor,</i> 301 F.3d at 39. \"The state provided a remedy, but plaintiff[] failed to pursue it. [It] cannot obtain jurisdiction in the federal courts simply by waiting until the statute of limitation bars the state remedies.\" <i>Harris,</i> 790 F.2d at 681.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Gamble,</i> the plaintiff filed suit in federal court alleging that she had been denied just compensation by a zoning plan. <i>Gamble,</i> 5 F.3d at 285. The Seventh Circuit, citing <i>Williamson County,</i> asked whether she had exhausted her remedies \"for obtaining a compensation award or equivalent relief from the state.\" <i>Id.</i> at 286. Among the options available to the plaintiff under state law was the ability to bring an inverse condemnation suit. <i>Id.</i> However, the statute of limitations barred plaintiff from raising that issue in the state courts. <i>Id.</i> Analogizing to other situations where exhaustion of remedies is required, the court held that the failure to pursue state compensation remedies in a timely fashion forfeited plaintiff's federal claim to just compensation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Pascoag's failure to bring a timely suit for compensation under state law has led to the forfeiture of its federal taking claim. Even making all reasonable inferences in favor of Pascoag &#8212; that a taking claim can stand when the state acquires land by adverse possession, that the claim did not accrue until the state assumed property rights in 1975, and that the Rhode Island statute of limitations for such a claim is 10 years &#8212; Pascoag's state claim was time-barred in 1985. \"[A] claimant cannot be permitted to let the time for seeking a state remedy pass without doing anything to obtain it and then proceed in federal court on the basis that no state remedies are open.\" <i>Id.</i> Pascoag's failure to assert a timely state claim has foreclosed its federal cause of action. \"Litigants who neglect or disdain their state remedies are out of court, period.\" <i>River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park,</i> 23 F.3d 164, 165 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, a taking by adverse possession occurred, on Pascoag's own theory, in 1975 after a ten-year period of government occupancy or use. At that point, Pascoag had an obligation to bring a suit in state court for compensation within the limitations period unless the state remedy was plainly futile (which in this case it was not); and by failing to do so it forfeited any federal claim that state processes were inadequate. Of course, the situation in 1975 may well have been unclear from a legal standpoint, but for that, Pascoag's remedy was to bring a lawsuit within the statutory period. The question of whether or not the state must pay when it takes land by adverse possession or prescription will have to wait for another day. Because Pascoag failed to bring a timely claim in state court, it forfeited its federal takings claim. The district court's decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Inverse condemnation is \"`a cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover the value of property which has been taken in fact by the governmental defendant, even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted by the taking agency.'\"<i>United States v.

Pascoag's futility argument is simply that it is now time-barred from making state law claims. If the futility rule were read this broadly it would swallow the general rule of state remedy exhaustion. Like the other exceptions, the futility exception must consider the landowner's available state remedies at the time of the taking. <i>See Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The situation here is different. As the Rhode Island Supreme Court noted, there is a fatal flaw in Pascoag's claim: it is too late for any state law cause of action. <i>Williamson County</i> requires the pursuit of state remedies before a taking case is heard in federal court.

At that time a final account could be struck, and nothing in the State's use of the Lake changed over time, so piecemeal litigation would not result. There was continuous occupancy by the State for ten years at which point property rights were acquired by operation of law and, if compensable, must be countered by a state court suit within the period allowed by the state statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pascoag also asserts that its claim was not ripe until the decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. We disagree. First, Pascoag's argument is at odds with the state court's finding of adverse possession and prescription, which is binding on Pascoag and requires open and notorious possession by the adverse party. That determination means, assuming arguendo that a taking claim could be made for acquisition by adverse possession or prescription, Pascoag should have known that a taking was in progress and brought suit under state law at that time (within the relevant statute of limitations).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The statute of limitations for a state taking claim is, at most, 10 years (for \"all civil actions not otherwise limited\"), and likely 1 year (for \"assessment of damages in state condemnation proceedings\"). R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-1-36 (2002). Pascoag's claim was ripe under state law at least by 1975, when Pascoag, assuming it had any claim at all, could have brought suit for recovery in state proceedings. If it had done so and the state had denied a remedy in violation of the Constitution, then a &#167; 1983 claim would have ripened at the time of the denial.

Among the options available to the plaintiff under state law was the ability to bring an inverse condemnation suit. <i>Id.</i> However, the statute of limitations barred plaintiff from raising that issue in the state courts. <i>Id.</i> Analogizing to other situations where exhaustion of remedies is required, the court held that the failure to pursue state compensation remedies in a timely fashion forfeited plaintiff's federal claim to just compensation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Pascoag's failure to bring a timely suit for compensation under state law has led to the forfeiture of its federal taking claim. Even making all reasonable inferences in favor of Pascoag &#8212; that a taking claim can stand when the state acquires land by adverse possession, that the claim did not accrue until the state assumed property rights in 1975, and that the Rhode Island statute of limitations for such a claim is 10 years &#8212; Pascoag's state claim was time-barred in 1985. \"[A] claimant cannot be permitted to let the time for seeking a state remedy pass without doing anything to obtain it and then proceed in federal court on the basis that no state remedies are open.\" <i>Id.</i> Pascoag's failure to assert a timely state claim has foreclosed its federal cause of action. \"Litigants who neglect or disdain their state remedies are out of court, period.\" <i>River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669122\"><a href=\"/opinion/669122/river-park-inc-and-country-club-estates-ltd-v-city-of-highland-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 165 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, a taking by adverse possession occurred, on Pascoag's own theory, in 1975 after a ten-year period of government occupancy or use. At that point, Pascoag had an obligation to bring a suit in state court for compensation within the limitations period unless the state remedy was plainly futile (which in this case it was not); and by failing to do so it forfeited any federal claim that state processes were inadequate. Of course, the situation in 1975 may well have been unclear from a legal standpoint, but for that, Pascoag's remedy was to bring a lawsuit within the statutory period. The question of whether or not the state must pay when it takes land by adverse possession or prescription will have to wait for another day. Because Pascoag failed to bring a timely claim in state court, it forfeited its federal takings claim. The district court's decision is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Inverse condemnation is \"`a cause of action against a governmental defendant to recover the value of property which has been taken in fact by the governmental defendant, even though no formal exercise of the power of eminent domain has been attempted by the taking agency.'\"<i>United States v.
