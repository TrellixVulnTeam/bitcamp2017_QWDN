This Court\n\nreviews de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment,\n\naffirming the judgment only if there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and if the appellee is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.      Yohe v. Nugent, 321 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nWe recount the history of this case in the light most favorable to\n\nthe losing parties (the plaintiffs-appellants) and then address the\n\nprincipal questions presented.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            A.    The Sinking of the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\n            On the morning of November 2, 1997, the NORTHERN VOYAGER,\n\na 144-foot fishing vessel, was proceeding a few miles off the coast\n\nof Gloucester, Massachusetts when crewmen discovered water flooding\n\na compartment in the ship's stern.             The flooding, which resulted\n\nwhen the starboard rudder dropped out of the vessel, was severe and\n\nthe crew immediately began trying to pump out the water.                  Despite\n\nthe crew's       best   efforts,   the    water   level    in   the   compartment\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcontinued to rise, threatening to flood the boat's engine room. If\n\nthe engine room flooded, all of the NORTHERN VOYAGER's electrical\n\npumps and generators located inside would be rendered useless.\n\n           The situation was such that the master of the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER,   Captain   David   Haggerty,   radioed   Coast   Guard   Station\n\nGloucester, told them that \"[w]ater [was] coming in fast,\" and\n\nrequested that they \"get some pumps out to [the ship].\"                 To\n\ncomplicate matters, a storm had passed through the area the night\n\nbefore, leaving swells of roughly six to eight feet.               Station\n\nGloucester (under the command of Chief Warrant Officer Wesley\n\nDittes) responded immediately by launching a 41-foot boat, to be\n\nfollowed shortly thereafter by a 47-foot one. The Coast Guard also\n\ndiverted a 110-foot cutter, the ADAK, to assist as On Scene\n\nCoordinator.   Coast Guard Group Boston, which is organizationally\n\nsuperior to Station Gloucester, assumed the role of Search and\n\nRescue Mission Coordinator.\n\n           The 41-footer arrived on the scene at approximately 9:15\n\na.m. and immediately evacuated eight crew members who apparently\n\nrequested to leave the NORTHERN VOYAGER, leaving on board of the\n\noriginal crew Captain Haggerty, the engineer, and the first mate.\n\nTwo Coast Guardsmen, Petty Officers Adam Sirois and Brian Conners,\n\nboarded the NORTHERN VOYAGER and attempted to assist in continuing\n\nefforts to remove water from the ship using extra pumps supplied by\n\nthe Coast Guard.     Although what was done slowed the rate of water\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\faccumulation, the flooding continued and the NORTHERN VOYAGER began\n\nto develop a port side list.\n\n           As the NORTHERN VOYAGER rolled and began to list, Coast\n\nGuard Officer Dittes (aboard the 47-footer), Group Boston, and the\n\nOn Scene Coordinator began discussing the possibility that the\n\nvessel would need to be evacuated. Several factors worried Dittes.\n\nHis most immediate concern was that the vessel's port side tilt\n\nmade both access to and escape from the NORTHERN VOYAGER more\n\ndifficult.    This is because the fishing boat's only access port, a\n\ndoor from the shelter deck through which the crew boarded and\n\ndeparted from the boat, was on the starboard side.   As the fishing\n\nboat tilted more and more to port, the starboard side was raised\n\nhigher and higher off the surface of the water.   No less worrisome\n\nwas his concern about progressive flooding, which was causing the\n\nvessel to settle further in the water, with the danger that the\n\nboat would capsize without warning before it sank, trapping anyone\n\naboard before they could be rescued.\n\n             Based upon these concerns, Dittes's conversations with\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER crew members who had already boarded the 47-\n\nfooter, and the continual progression of the flooding, Dittes\n\nordered his men to evacuate the NORTHERN VOYAGER's remaining crew\n\nmembers.     Captain Haggerty opposed the Coast Guard's decision to\n\nevacuate his vessel and wanted to talk about other options for\n\npumping and salvage, including commercial salvage.\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Dittes and Conners refused to discuss any other options\n\nfor salvage aboard the NORTHERN VOYAGER, and, again, ordered\n\nHaggerty and his men off the boat.     According to Captain Haggerty,\n\nConners informed him that if he did not cooperate, the Coast Guard\n\nwould \"subdue [him] physically\" in order to take him off the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER.     All Coast Guard personnel and the remaining\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER officers were then transferred to the Coast Guard\n\n47-footer.\n\n          The   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   was   abandoned   at   10:27   a.m.,\n\ncontinued to sink, and capsized at 11:22 a.m., fifty-five minutes\n\nafter the last person left the vessel.       Captain Haggerty did not\n\nwant to stay around and watch the boat sink.     Accordingly, shortly\n\nafter the evacuation, the Coast Guard 47-footer headed back to\n\nStation Gloucester with Captain Haggerty and the remaining members\n\nof his crew on board.\n\n          According to plaintiffs' experts, there were various\n\nsteps that Captain Haggerty and his senior crew could have taken to\n\nstabilize the situation if the Coast Guard had permitted them to\n\nstay on the vessel.     These steps included shutting certain doors\n\nand making them watertight so that the flooding was confined to two\n\ncompartments in the stern of the boat.       If these steps had been\n\ntaken, plaintiffs' experts asserted, the vessel could have floated\n\nfor at least another twenty hours even assuming that no pumping\n\ncapacity was brought to bear.   This would have provided ample time\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffor independent salvage resources to reach the vessel, even if they\n\nhad to come from as far away as Boston.\n\n             B.    Alternative Salvage Efforts Were Underway\n\n             While Coast Guard rescue efforts were underway, radio\n\ntraffic about the NORTHERN VOYAGER was overheard by a commercial\n\nsalvor named Michael Goodridge based in Newburyport, Massachusetts.\n\nAt 9:03 a.m., just minutes after Captain Haggerty first radioed for\n\nCoast Guard assistance, Goodridge placed a telephone call to\n\nStation Gloucester.         He told them that he had dive gear and pumps\n\nand asked whether they needed assistance.               Station Gloucester\n\nresponded that they were busy and they were going to \"handle it.\"\n\n             At 9:04 a.m., Captain Haggerty informed the Coast Guard\n\nby radio that he thought the water was coming up through the\n\nvessel's rudder-post.         He conjectured that the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\n\"might ah, dropped the rudder.\" Earlier, he had explained that the\n\nvessel had lost its steering capability.\n\n             Several minutes later, the Coast Guard transmitted an\n\nUrgent Marine Information Broadcast stating that it \"ha[d] received\n\na report that the Fishing Vessel Voyager is taking on water\" and\n\nrequesting that \"all vessels keep a sharp lookout, assist if\n\npossible, [and] report all sightings to the U.S. Coast Guard.\"\n\nThis   was   the    Coast    Guard's   only   attempt   to   solicit   outside\n\nassistance.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f              Himself a diver, Goodridge, who continued to monitor\n\ndevelopments over his radio, recognized that the \"vessel was going\n\nto need a diver to correct the problem.\"        Accordingly, he began\n\nloading up his truck.      At 9:15 a.m., Goodridge placed a telephone\n\ncall to Cape Ann Divers to see if anyone was available to assist\n\nhim.       At 9:33 a.m., he reported to Station Gloucester that he was\n\nen route, with diving gear, and that his estimated time of arrival\n\nwas one hour.\n\n               At 10:03 a.m., several minutes before the decision to\n\nevacuate was made, Goodridge hailed Station Gloucester on radio\n\nchannel 16.       He was told to switch to channel 12, a frequency not\n\nbeing used by anyone on the scene.       Goodridge stated that he was\n\nboarding a vessel at Cape Ann Marina, and asked if he should bring\n\nextra pumps or whether just diving assistance was necessary.\n\n               Station Gloucester responded that it \"wasn't sure,\" the\n\nsituation was unstable, and it needed to keep \"[the] frequency\n\nclear.\"1      Goodridge interpreted this to mean that he shouldn't tie\n\nup the channel.       He stated that he would be there \"in a little\n\nbit,\" and he got off the radio.       Shortly thereafter, everyone was\n\nevacuated from the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n\n\n       1\n      The comment about the need to keep the frequency clear was\nconceded by the Coast Guard employee who made it to be a\nmisstatement. The Coast Guard employee said that it was a \"bad\nchoice of words,\" that Goodridge's contact came at a time when she\nneeded to listen, and that what she should have done was to ask\nGoodridge to \"wait out.\"\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           At about 10:44 a.m., when Goodridge was about a mile from\n\nthe Northern Voyager, he contacted Station Gloucester by radio\n\nhoping to establish contact with the captain.       At that point,\n\nGoodridge had just seen the 47-footer heading back with the crew.\n\nStation Gloucester told him to call by \"land line.\" When Goodridge\n\ncalled back on his cellular phone, he was told that he could talk\n\nto the captain when he arrived back at the station.\n\n           Goodridge said that he did not attempt to contact the 47-\n\nfooter directly because he had \"[b]een told twice to stay off the\n\nradio.\"    He didn't bother going to the station to talk to the\n\ncaptain because he assumed that, based on the Coast Guard reports,\n\nthe boat was too far gone for him to take the necessary time.\n\n           According to plaintiffs' expert, Goodridge was in a\n\nposition to reach the NORTHERN VOYAGER by 10:50 a.m., well before\n\nit sank.   Goodridge stated at his deposition that he had the skill\n\nand equipment necessary to dive under the NORTHERN VOYAGER and plug\n\nthe hole formerly containing the rudder post, and the task would\n\nhave taken him only a couple minutes.2   However, he needed to talk\n\nto somebody in the NORTHERN VOYAGER crew before making such an\n\nattempt in order to find out if the engines were running.   Without\n\nthis knowledge, it was too risky to dive near the propellers, as he\n\nwould have had to do to plug the rudder tube.\n\n     2\n      Plaintiffs' expert stated that there were many available\nobjects, such as a lobster buoy or life jacket, that Goodridge\ncould have used to plug the hole and that this would have stopped,\nor at least considerably reduced, the influx of sea water.\n\n                                -9-\n\f          Captain    Haggerty    stated   that   he    did    not     know   any\n\ncommercial salvors in the Gloucester area and thought that the\n\nCoast Guard was working on getting commercial assistance.                At no\n\ntime before the captain was put ashore in Gloucester, however, did\n\nhe learn, nor was he told by the Coast Guard, that a salvor was\n\napproaching with additional pumps and with dive gear.3                  If the\n\ncaptain had been in contact with Goodridge and had been made aware\n\nof his concerns about the engine running, the captain would have\n\nshut off the engines before evacuating, rigged a Jacobs ladder in\n\norder to facilitate a possible return to the boat, and communicated\n\nthis information to Goodridge.\n\n          C.   Proceedings in the District Court\n\n          Northern   Voyager,    its   insurers,      and    Thames   Shipyard\n\nbrought this action in the District of Massachusetts against the\n\nUnited States alleging that the sinking of the NORTHERN VOYAGER was\n\ndue to the negligence of the Coast Guard.              Plaintiffs' primary\n\ncontention was that the Coast Guard exceeded its authority by\n\ncoercively compelling the NORTHERN VOYAGER's master to leave the\n\nvessel against his will.        Plaintiffs   further alleged that the\n\nCoast Guard negligently interfered with the efforts of Michael\n\nGoodridge, the commercial salvor, and also deprived the NORTHERN\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The record contains conflicting evidence on this point, but\nwe, of course, take the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nlosing party.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fVOYAGER of other possible sources of assistance in its time of\n\nperil.4\n\n            The United States contended that the Coast Guard was\n\nlegally authorized to issue the evacuation order by virtue of the\n\nbroad search and rescue powers conferred upon the Coast Guard by\n\nCongress under 14 U.S.C. § 88 to \"perform any and all acts\n\nnecessary to rescue and aid persons . . . \"   See note 7, infra.   It\n\nfurther argued that the decision to issue the order in these\n\ncircumstances was a decision protected under the discretionary\n\nfunction exception.   The United States moved for summary judgment\n\non the grounds that the suit was barred by the exception.          In\n\nrespect to plaintiffs' arguments that the Coast Guard negligently\n\ninterfered with the commercial salvor's efforts, the United States\n\ncontended that these arguments failed under the \"Good Samaritan\"\n\ndoctrine requiring a would-be rescuer to have worsened the victim's\n\nposition.\n\n            The district court concluded that the Coast Guard's\n\ndecision to compel Haggerty and his crew to abandon the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER was protected by the discretionary function exception.\n\n\n     4\n      In addition, plaintiffs alleged various intentional torts\nincluding trespass to chattels, conversion, breach of fiduciary\nobligations,   bailment,   and    intentional   interference   with\ncontractual and/or advantageous relations. Our discussion, infra,\nconcluding that the Coast Guard's evacuation decision is protected\nby the discretionary function exception disposes of most of these\nclaims. We do not think that the alleged facts support a claim of\nintentional   interference   with   contractual   or   advantageous\nrelations.\n\n                               -11-\n\fNorthern Voyager Ltd. P'ship v. Thames Shipyard & Repair Co., 214\n\nF. Supp. 2d 47, 52 (D. Mass 2002).         Though the court did not cite\n\nto or evaluate the scope of 14 U.S.C. § 88, it did cite internal\n\ngovernment manuals as stating the need for broad discretion and\n\nflexibility when conducting search and rescue operations.                Id.\n\nApplying the discretionary function test articulated in Berkovitz\n\nv. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 537 (1988), the court concluded\n\nthat (1) the Coast Guard has complete discretion over all search\n\nand rescue procedures; and (2) the Coast Guard's decision to\n\nevacuate   the   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   is   the   type   of   \"policy   based\n\ndiscretion\" protected by the exception.          Id. at 51-52.      Once it\n\nconcluded that plaintiffs' claims are barred by the discretionary\n\nfunction exception, the court granted the United States' motion for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n           This appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit\n\nexcept as it consents to be sued, and the terms of its consent\n\ndefine the federal courts' jurisdiction over suits against the\n\nUnited States.      United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586\n\n(1941).    The Suits in Admiralty Act (\"SAA\") waives sovereign\n\nimmunity \"[i]n cases where if such vessel were privately owned or\n\noperated . . . or if a private person or property were involved, a\n\nproceeding in admiralty could be maintained . . .\"           46 U.S.C. Appx.\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f§ 742.      The Public Vessels Act (\"PVA\") allows recovery against the\n\nUnited States for damages \"caused by a public vessel of the United\n\nStates . . .\"5           46 U.S.C. Appx. § 781.\n\n              Both waiver provisions apply here.              See Wilson v. United\n\nStates, 23 F.3d 559, 561 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Both the [SAA] and the\n\n[PVA] apply where a plaintiff brings a 'public-vessel-related suit\n\nin admiralty against the United States.'\") (internal citation\n\nomitted).          Although neither contains an express discretionary\n\nfunction exception, it has been implied into both.                        See Limar\n\nShipping Ltd. v. United States, 324 F.3d 1, 6-7 & n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (SAA); United States Fire Ins. Co. v. United States, 806 F.2d\n\n1529,      1534-35       (11th   Cir.    1986)     (PVA)   (reasoning     that     the\n\n\"separation         of     powers\"      concerns    that    justify      reading     a\n\ndiscretionary function exception into the SAA warrant reading the\n\nsame       exception      into   the     PVA,    especially     given    the     close\n\nrelationship between the two statutes).                    We review de novo the\n\nlower court's determination that the Coast Guard's actions are\n\nprotected by the discretionary function exception.                      See Wood v.\n\nUnited States, 290 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              A.     The Discretionary Function Exception:              the Standard\n                     Test\n\n\n\n       5\n      The PVA embraces cases where injury is caused by the crew of\na public vessel and not by the vessel itself. See Coumou v. United\nStates, 107 F.3d 290, 294 n.9 (5th Cir.), modified, 114 F.3d 64\n(5th Cir. 1997); Harrington v. United States, 748 F. Supp. 919, 929\n(D.P.R. 1990).\n\n                                          -13-\n\f            The purpose of the discretionary function exception is to\n\ninsulate    certain    governmental      actions        and   decisions    based   on\n\nconsiderations of public policy from tort liability by private\n\nindividuals.        Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536-37.              The exception is\n\nintended to preclude \"judicial 'second-guessing' of legislative and\n\nadministrative       decisions      grounded       in   social,       economic,    and\n\npolitical policy.\"          Limar Shipping, 324 F.3d at 6 (quoting United\n\nStates v.

Thus, the discretionary\n\nfunction exception \"insulates the Government from liability if the\n\naction challenged in the case involves the permissible exercise of\n\npolicy judgment.\"       Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 537.\n\n            Where, as here, the government avers that it is immune\n\nfrom suit because the challenged conduct falls under the protection\n\nof the discretionary function exception, we must determine whether\n\nthe disputed conduct involved the \"permissible exercise of policy\n\njudgment.\"    Berkovitz, 486 U.S.        at 539.        In a series of cases, the\n\nSupreme     Court    has     established      an    analytical        framework    for\n\ndetermining whether the conduct warrants discretionary function\n\nimmunity.\n\n             The    court    must   initially      identify     the    conduct    that\n\nallegedly caused the harm. United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.S. 315,\n\n322 (1991).         Then, to determine whether the exception applies,\n\nthe court employs           a two prong test.            First, the court must\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdetermine whether the challenged conduct involves an element of\n\njudgment, meaning that it is \"a matter of choice for the acting\n\nemployee.\"      Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536.          This Court has declared\n\nthat   conduct     is   non-discretionary        \"if   a     federal      statute,\n\nregulation, or policy specifically instructed federal officials to\n\nfollow a specified course of action.\"                Muniz-Rivera v. United\n\nStates, 326 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 2003 WL 21692180\n\n(U.S. Oct. 6, 2003) (No. 03-25). Second, the court \"must determine\n\nwhether that      judgment   is   of   the    kind   that    the    discretionary\n\nfunction   was    designed   to   shield,\"      meaning      that    it   involved\n\n\"governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of\n\npublic policy.\"     Berkovitz, 486 U.S. at 536-37.\n\n           In    addition,   courts      have   read   the    Supreme      Court's\n\ndiscretionary function cases as denying protection to actions that\n\nare unauthorized because they are unconstitutional, proscribed by\n\nstatute, or exceed the scope of an official's authority.                      See,\n\ne.g., K. W. Thompson Tool Co. v. United States, 836 F.2d 721, 727\n\nn.4 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"It has been held that implicit in Varig and\n\nDalehite is the proposition that a 'decision cannot be shielded\n\nfrom liability if the decisionmaker is acting without actual\n\nauthority.'\") (quoting Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians v. United\n\nStates, 800 F.2d 1187, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1986)); Medina v. United\n\nStates, 259 F.3d 220, 225 (4th Cir. 2001) (stating that \"[f]ederal\n\nofficials do not possess discretion to violate constitutional\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\frights or federal statutes\") (quoting United States Fid. & Guar.\n\nCo. v. United States, 837 F.2d 116, 120 (3d Cir. 1988)); Nurse v.\n\nUnited States, 226 F.3d 996, 1002 (9th Cir. 2000) (\"[G]overnmental\n\nconduct cannot be discretionary if it violates a legal mandate.\");\n\nMyers & Myers, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, 527 F.2d 1252,\n\n1261 (2d Cir. 1975) (\"It is, of course, a tautology that a federal\n\nofficial cannot have discretion to behave unconstitutionally or\n\noutside the scope of his delegated authority.\").\n\n          B.    The Decision     to   Forcibly   Evacuate   the    NORTHERN\n                VOYAGER.\n\n          Following this framework, we focus on the decision to\n\nforcibly evacuate the NORTHERN VOYAGER.      Relying on Indian Towing\n\nCo. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61 (1955), and United States v.\n\nSandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., 372 F.2d 189 (1st Cir. 1967),\n\nappellants   contend   that   the   discretionary   function      exception\n\napplies to decisions whether or not to undertake a rescue mission\n\nbut not to decisions made during the course of a rescue mission\n\nonce undertaken. Appellants further contend that the Coast Guard's\n\nevacuation decision was not a policy decision. Finally, appellants\n\nargue that the government cannot seek refuge in the exception\n\nbecause the forcible evacuation was outside the scope of its\n\nstatutorily-delegated authority and, indeed, violated legal and\n\nconstitutional norms.    We disagree.\n\n                1.     Whether   Indian Towing and Sandra & Dennis\n                       Fishing   Corp. Preclude Application of the\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f                       Discretionary Function    Exception     to   the\n                       Decision at Issue.\n\n             We begin by addressing plaintiffs' argument based on\n\nIndian Towing and Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp.       For the following\n\nreasons, we do not think that these cases support plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the discretionary function exception is inapplicable\n\nto decisions made during the course of a rescue mission to the\n\nextent those decisions implicate protected policy concerns.\n\n             Indian Towing involved a lawsuit alleging that the Coast\n\nGuard negligently failed to maintain a lighthouse, causing the loss\n\nof a ship.    The Court held that the Coast Guard need not undertake\n\nto provide lighthouse service.      Indian Towing, 350 U.S. at 69.\n\nHowever, having \"exercised its discretion to operate [the] light .\n\n. . and engendered reliance on the guidance afforded by the light,\n\n[the Coast Guard] was obligated to use due care to make certain\n\nthat the light was kept in working order.\"      Id.\n\n             Indian Towing is inapposite for two reasons. First, the\n\ndiscretionary function exception was not at issue because the\n\ngovernment conceded that it did not apply.     Id. at 64.    Second, as\n\nthis Court has interpreted the case, through the lens of later\n\nSupreme Court decisions, it illustrates a situation where there was\n\nno exercise of policy judgment but rather involved purely technical\n\nor scientific considerations.      Ayer v. United States, 902 F.2d\n\n1038, 1042 (1st Cir. 1990).     Indeed, we have suggested that had a\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fpolicy-based reason for failing to maintain the lighthouse been\n\narticulated, the result might have been different.          See id.\n\n             In Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., a Coast Guard patrol\n\nboat took in tow a fishing vessel that was then in no immediate\n\ndanger of sinking and, through negligence (human error), caused the\n\nvessel to strand on a shoal.      This Court stated that the Coast\n\nGuard had no duty to provide rescue services on demand.          Sandra &\n\nDennis Fishing Corp., 372 F.2d at 195.        However, we held that \"if\n\nthe Coast Guard accepts a mission it should conduct its share of\n\nthe proceeding with acceptable seamanship.\"        Id. at 197.\n\n             There is no hint in Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp. that\n\nthe government attempted to rely on the discretionary function\n\nexception.     Nor is there any reason to think that the negligent\n\nconduct upon which this Court affirmed liability (the failure to\n\ncheck with the loran on the towed vessel when the loran on the\n\nCoast Guard patrol boat went out) implicated protected policy\n\nconcerns as opposed to mere technical, navigational missteps.\n\nAccordingly, neither Indian Towing nor Sandra & Dennis Fishing\n\nCorp. stand for the proposition that a Coast Guard determination\n\nmade during the course of a mission may not be protected by the\n\ndiscretionary     function   exception   in     otherwise     appropriate\n\ncircumstances.\n\n             Indeed, to hold differently could be said to fly in the\n\nface of the Supreme Court's decision in Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325-\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f26, which rejects a distinction between initiation of programs and\n\ndecisions made at an operational level.    See also Varig Airlines,\n\n467 U.S. at 813 (\"[T]he basic inquiry concerning the application of\n\nthe discretionary function exception is whether the challenged acts\n\nof a Government employee--whatever his or her rank--are of the\n\nnature and quality that Congress intended to shield from tort\n\nliability.\")   Accordingly, we turn next to the familiar two-prong\n\ninquiry, supra p. 14-15, under Berkovitz and progeny.        For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we conclude that both prongs are met.\n\n                2.   Application of the Two-Prong Inquiry.\n\n          First, the Coast Guard has statutorily-granted discretion\n\nto exercise its judgment in determining how it goes about search\n\nand rescue (\"SAR\") operations.    See 14 U.S.C. § 88 (providing that\n\nthe Coast Guard may perform any and all acts necessary to rescue\n\nand aid persons and property). Further, internal manuals recognize\n\nthe discretionary nature of decisions made during the course of SAR\n\noperations.    The National Search and Rescue Manual notes that\n\n\"[b]ecause of the many variables encountered during SAR operations\n\nand the individuality of each SAR case, the guidance provided in\n\nthis Manual must be tempered with sound judgment, having due regard\n\nfor the individual situation.\"     1 Joint Chiefs of Staff & U.S.\n\nCoast Guard, National Search and Rescue Manual v, § 3.a (1991). The\n\nCoast Guard Addendum to this manual provides that \"Coast Guard\n\npersonnel are expected to exercise broad discretion in performing\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fthe functions discussed.\"     U.S. Coast Guard, Coast Guard Addendum\n\nto the National Search and Rescue Manual at 2.\n\n          Second,     the   determination    that   the    peril   to   the\n\nendangered seamen had reached such a level as to require a forced\n\nevacuation involved a true policy choice.       This case does not fall\n\nwithin the \"line of cases involving plaintiffs who challenge\n\nofficial judgments that implicate technical safety assessments\n\nconducted pursuant to prior choices.\"        Shansky v. United States,\n\n164 F.3d 688, 694 (1st Cir. 1999).       \"Such decisions come within a\n\ncategory of objective professional judgments that, without more,\n\nare not readily amenable to policy analysis.\"             Id.   Rather, it\n\ninvolved the balancing of incommensurable values -- such as human\n\nsafety, protection of property, autonomy, and the allocation of\n\nresources -- typically associated with policy decisions.6          See id.\n\nat 695.   The Coast Guard's manual sets forth a policy of giving\n\npriority to the saving of human lives over the saving of property.\n\nSee infra p. 25.    Applying such a policy in circumstances of danger\n\nsuch as these calls for an evaluation       of multiple factors that is\n\nanything but purely technical and routine.\n\n\n     6\n      The last factor (allocation of resources) comes into play\nespecially because, despite appellants' suggestion to the contrary,\nthe Coast Guard, once on the scene, would have been hard pressed\nsimply to abandon the imperilled seamen. If the ship had capsized,\ntrapping the men inside or putting them overboard, the Coast Guard\nwould have been faced with a riskier, more costly rescue operation\nthat might have endangered the lives of Coast Guard personnel\nseeking to rescue those members of the NORTHERN VOYAGER's crew who\nhad elected to remain on board.\n\n                                  -20-\n\f                  3.   The Scope of 14 U.S.C. § 88.\n\n             Finally, we turn to appellants' contention that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception does not apply because the Coast\n\nGuard acted outside the scope of its statutorily-granted authority\n\nor in derogation of other constitutional and legal principles.\n\nThis argument requires us to determine whether 14 U.S.C. § 88,\n\nwhich provides inter alia that the Coast Guard may perform \"any and\n\nall acts necessary to rescue and aid persons and protect and save\n\nproperty,\" permits the Coast Guard, when it deems such action\n\nnecessary to protect lives, to compel an unwilling master to\n\nevacuate his vessel.7      This is a novel question in that, while\n\nsimilar events may have arisen in the past, no federal cases\n\n\n\n     7\n         The pertinent part of § 88 provides in full:\n\n             (a) In order to render aid to distressed persons,\n             vessels, and aircraft on and under the high seas and on\n             and under the waters over which the United States has\n             jurisdiction and in order to render aid to persons and\n             property imperiled by flood, the Coast Guard may:\n             (1) perform any and all acts necessary to rescue and aid\n             persons and protect and save property;\n             (2) take charge of and protect all property saved from\n             marine or aircraft disasters, or floods, at which the\n             Coast Guard is present, until such property is claimed by\n             persons legally authorized to receive it or until\n             otherwise disposed of in accordance with law or\n             applicable regulations, and care for bodies of those who\n             may have perished in such catastrophes;\n             (3) furnish clothing, food, lodging, medicines, and other\n             necessary supplies and services to persons succored by\n             the Coast Guard; and\n             (4) destroy or tow into port sunken or floating dangers\n             to navigation.\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\finterpreting the Coast Guard's powers in this regard appear to\n\nexist in the law books, nor have any specific regulations been\n\npromulgated on the subject by the Coast Guard.                Moreover, the\n\nlegislative history of § 88 does not address this particular\n\nissue.8   On   the    one   hand,    the   statute's     literal    language\n\n(empowering the Coast Guard to \"perform any and all acts necessary\n\nto rescue and aid persons . . . \") can be said literally to\n\nencompass such action. On the other, in our democratic society the\n\ncircumstances are limited in which governmental officials may\n\nlegally compel people, against their will, to abandon their homes\n\nor other private property. If it were unconstitutional or contrary\n\nto clear law for the Coast Guard to rescue unwilling mariners in\n\nlife-threatening     situations,    we   would   be   loath   to   read   such\n\nauthority into § 88.\n\n          Given the dearth of federal authority, we turn to state\n\nlaw and practice in analogous rescue situations for guidance.\n\n\n     8\n      Section 88 was added to Title 14 in 1949. See Act of Aug. 4,\n1949, c. 393, 63 Stat. 501. The Senate Report that accompanied the\nlegislation explains that previous \"statutes were enacted over a\nperiod of a century and cover[ed], in some cases, only limited\ngeographical areas, and in other cases only limited types of\nassistance work,\" and that \"section 88 authorizes the Coast Guard,\nin the broadest possible terms without limitation as to method or\nplace, to save lives and property.\"      S. Rep. No. 81-656, at 5\n(1949), reprinted in 1949 U.S. Code & Cong. Serv. 1652, 1656. This\nhistory suggests that the phrase \"any and all acts\" defines the\nscope of Coast Guard authority and, is not, as plaintiffs contend,\nmerely an implementary provision.      Further, it is plain that\nCongress intended the scope of this power to be broad.\nNonetheless, nothing in the legislative history specifically\naddresses the power to order forcible evacuation.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fAlmost every state in the United States has adopted statutes\n\nproviding for the exercise of police powers in the event of an\n\nemergency or disaster (such as fire, flood, tornado, hurricane,\n\netc.)   See Howard D. Swanson, The Delicate Art of Practicing\n\nMunicipal Law Under Conditions of Hell and High Water, 76 N.D.L.\n\nRev. 487, 490-93 & n.10 (2000) (citing statutes).                    Most of the\n\nstate statutory schemes provide that the governor of the state has\n\nthe ability to declare an emergency.               See id. at 490.       \"Further,\n\nmost of the states also allow the exercise of emergency or disaster\n\nauthority by a local government.\"             Id.     One of the most common\n\nforms of authority exercised in an emergency is the mandatory\n\nevacuation of buildings, streets, neighborhoods, and cities.                    Id.\n\nat 495, see also David G. Tucker & Alfred O. Bragg, III, Florida's\n\nLaw of Storms:       Emergency Management, Local Government, and the\n\nPolice Power, 30 Stetson L. Rev. 837, 838 (Winter 2001) (\"Local\n\ndecision-makers may be called upon to order evacuations or prevent\n\npeople from returning to damaged houses.\").\n\n           In   some    states,      there   are    statutes      that   expressly\n\ndelegate   to   local       safety   officers       the   authority      to   order\n\nevacuations     in     an    emergency.        See,       e.g.,    Alaska     Stat.\n\n§ 18.70.075(a)(2) (providing that a fire officer has the authority\n\nto \"order a person to leave a building or place in the vicinity of\n\na fire or emergency, for the purpose of protecting the person from\n\ninjury\"); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 7-313b (similar); Del. Code Ann. tit.\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f16, § 6701A(2) (similar); N.H. Rev. St. Ann. § 154:7 (similar);\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 6-21-703 (similar); W. Va. Code § 29-3A-1\n\n(similar).         In other states, where the issue is not expressly\n\naddressed in any statute, the authority of a safety officer to\n\norder an evacuation has been inferred from a statute delegating\n\ngeneral authority \"to preserve the public peace.\"            See, e.g., Ohio\n\nOp. Atty. Gen. No. 87-099 (reasoning in this way and opining that\n\na sheriff \"may order the evacuation of persons residing . . . in\n\nthe vicinity of a hazardous materials accident or emergency, when\n\nreasonably necessary for the protection of the health, safety, and\n\nwell-being of such persons\" and \"may, in a reasonable manner,\n\nremove   to    a    safe   area   any   persons   who   refuse   to   evacuate\n\nvoluntarily\").9\n\n              The Coast Guard is a governmental agency and has been\n\ngranted by Congress a variety of public safety responsibilities and\n\n\n     9\n      We have no doubts about the constitutionality of such\nauthority. Courts have rejected due process challenges to summary\naction taken in an emergency situation, see, e.g., Hodel v.\nVirginia Surface Min. & Recl. Assn., 452 U.S. 264, 299-301 (1981)\n(upholding the constitutionality of an emergency procedure which\nallowed government inspectors to order the immediate cessation of\nmining activities), and have similarly rejected Fourth Amendment\nchallenges to police action taken in response to a life-threatening\nemergency. See, e.g., Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978)\n(\"Numerous state and federal cases have recognized that the Fourth\nAmendment does not bar police officers from making warrantless\nentries and searches when they reasonably believe that a person\nwithin is in need of immediate aid.\") (internal footnotes omitted)\n(citing cases); see also Wayne v. United States, 318 F.2d 205, 212\n(D.C. Cir. 1963) (Burger, J.) (\"The need to protect or preserve\nlife or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be\notherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.\").\n\n                                        -24-\n\fpowers, including, of course, the specific power under discussion\n\nto rescue and aid persons and property.10   In exercising its rescue\n\npowers, it construes its own role as giving priority to the saving\n\nof lives over the saving of property.   See U. S. Coast Guard, Boat\n\nCrew Seamanship Manual at 18-92.      In circumstances such as the\n\npresent, Coast Guard operations are relevantly different from the\n\nsituation in which a private vessel or a commercial salvor comes to\n\nthe aid of a distressed vessel.11 Under the circumstances, we think\n\n     10\n      See, e.g., 14 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Primary Duties\") (stating, inter\nalia, that the Coast Guard \"shall administer laws and promulgate\nand enforce regulations for the promotion of safety of life and\nproperty on and under the high seas and waters subject to the\njurisdiction of the United States covering all matters not\nspecifically delegated by law to some other executive department\"\nand \"shall develop, establish, maintain, and operate, with due\nregard to the requirements of national defense, aids to maritime\nnavigation, icebreaking facilities, and rescue facilities for the\npromotion of safety on, under, and over the high seas and waters\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States\").\n     11\n      It is a general principle of admiralty law that an owner of\na vessel has a right to decline salvage assistance and that \"a\nsalvor who acts without the express or implied consent of the owner\nis a 'gratuitous intermeddler' who is not entitled to any salvage\naward.\" 2 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty & Maritime Law § 16-1 at\n360-61 (3d ed. 2001). Interestingly, however, there is dicta in\nseveral cases limiting this principle to instances where only the\nowner's property interests are at stake. See, e.g., Smit Americas,\nInc. v. M/T Mantinia, 259 F. Supp. 2d 118, 134 (D.P.R. 2003)\n(suggesting that an owner's right of refusal is limited in\nsituations involving imminent danger of large losses of the\nproperty of third persons); Ramsey v. Pohatcong, 77 F. 996\n(S.D.N.Y. 1896) (holding that tugboat was \"bound to respect the\nmaster's decision [to refuse salvage assistance]\" where case\ninvolved only ordinary property interests and \"did not involve\nimminent danger to life, nor the danger of large losses of the\nproperty of third persons\"); see also Martin J. Norris, The Law of\nSeaman, § 9:39 (4th ed. 2002) (\"It is the privilege of the master\nto accept [proffered salvage services] or not, so long as the\nvessel in distress is then in a position where nothing but ordinary\n\n                               -25-\n\fit reasonable to assume that Congress, in granting the Coast Guard\n\nthe broad authority to undertake \"any and all acts necessary to\n\nrescue and aid persons and protect and save property,\" intended to\n\nconfer powers analogous to those commonly possessed by state public\n\nsafety officials, namely, the power to rescue a person even against\n\nhis will in life-threatening circumstances.\n\n          We do not, however, accept that the phrase \"any and all\"\n\ngives the Coast Guard carte blanche authority to engage in forcible\n\nevacuations in less than life-threatening emergencies.   A forcible\n\nevacuation from a private vessel constitutes a seizure of the\n\nperson.   Under the circumstances, the body of case law developed\n\nunder the \"emergency aid\" exception to the Fourth Amendment's\n\nwarrant requirement both lends support for evacuation authority and\n\ncabins it.    That exception requires an objectively reasonable\n\nbelief by safety officers that a true emergency exists and there is\n\nan immediate need for assistance or aid.      See, e.g., McCabe v.\n\nLife-Line Ambulance Serv., Inc. 77 F.3d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(recognizing that \"exigent circumstances\" exceptions, by their\n\nnature, turn upon the objective reasonableness of ad hoc, fact-\n\nspecific assessments); United States v. Richardson, 208 F.3d 626,\n\n629 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that, \"as is normally the case for\n\nFourth Amendment inquiries, the test is objective\"); Russoli v.\n\n\nproperty interests are involved.\") (emphasis added).       In all\nevents, we need not pursue this suggestion further in light of our\nconclusion that the Coast Guard is not the equivalent of a\ncommercial salvor.\n\n                               -26-\n\fSalisbury Township, 126 F. Supp. 2d 821, 846-59 (E.D. Penn. 2000)\n\n(suggesting without deciding that the emergency aid doctrine might\n\njustify a seizure, for the person's own good and the good of\n\nothers, where safety officers reasonably believe that there is a\n\nlife-threatening emergency).\n\n              In situations as the present, where we are satisfied\n\nthat such a life-threatening emergency could reasonably be found to\n\nexist, infra p. 28, the Coast Guard possessed under § 88 the\n\ndiscretionary    authority   to   order   (or   not   order)   a   forced\n\nevacuation.    Within the scope of that discretionary authority, we\n\nhold that the Coast     Guard could not be held liable for the\n\nconsequences of its decision.\n\n                 4. The Instant Scenario\n\n          The facts of this case lead us to conclude that the Coast\n\nGuard reacted rationally, and that human life could reasonably have\n\nbeen deemed to be at serious risk had Captain Haggerty and his crew\n\nnot been removed.     The NORTHERN VOYAGER, without steering, was\n\nrolling in six to eight foot ocean seas.        Water was pouring in.\n\nShe was developing an increasing port-side list.           The fishing\n\nboat's only access port was on the starboard side.             The Coast\n\nGuardsmen on the vessel reported progressive flooding, raising the\n\npossibility that the ship would capsize, trapping all on board.\n\nWhile arguments can perhaps be made in the light of 20-20 hindsight\n\ntending to minimize the potential dangers had the master and his\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\ffellows been allowed to remain, we see no basis to doubt the\n\nobjective reasonableness of the Coast Guard's on the scene decision\n\nto remove them.\n\n          Under the circumstances (and in light of our conclusions\n\nabove), we hold that (1) the discretionary function exception\n\napplies to the decision at issue; (2) the Coast Guard made a policy\n\nchoice when it determined the time had come, in the interest of\n\nsafety, to take the men off; (3) the Coast Guard acted within the\n\nbroad rescue powers specified by Congress in § 88; and (4) the\n\nCoast Guard was not guilty of violating rights applicable in more\n\nordinary circumstances (i.e. where the threat to life was less).\n\n          C.      The Coast Guard's Conduct Vis-a-vis the Private\n                  Salvor.\n\n          Plaintiffs' alternative argument is that evidence of\n\nCoast Guard alleged discouragement or interference with the efforts\n\nof Michael Goodridge, the commercial salvor, warrants a remand for\n\na determination of liability.      The government has never advanced\n\nany protected policy reasons, and we can think of none, to explain\n\nits conduct vis-a-vis the commercial salvor. Rather, to the extent\n\nthat   conscious    decisions   were     made,   rather   than   mistakes,\n\noversights, or misstatements, the decisions appear to be ordinary\n\nprofessional judgments. Accordingly, we turn to the issue of\n\nliability.\n\n          Plaintiffs suggest that the Coast Guard was negligent in\n\ndelaying the start of Goodridge's response, instructing Goodridge\n\n                                  -28-\n\fto stay off the radio, and suppressing effective communication with\n\nhim.    Plaintiffs also suggest that Captain Haggerty detrimentally\n\nrelied on the Coast Guard's assurance that it was working on\n\ngetting commercial assistance, and, as a result, did not make\n\nindependent radio calls of his own for such commercial assistance.\n\nAlthough we are unpersuaded by plaintiffs' arguments based on\n\nallegations of delay and reliance, we find sufficient evidence in\n\nthe record to create a factual issue on the question whether the\n\nCoast    Guard's        interference    with   the   commercial   salvor's\n\ncommunications prevented Goodridge from pursuing salvage efforts\n\nand using his diving capacity to find and plug the leak.               We\n\nexplain, beginning with the relevant standard of negligence and\n\nthen applying it to the facts of this case.\n\n                   1.    The Good Samaritan Rule.\n\n            The parties agree that the standard of negligence in this\n\ncontext is the Good Samaritan rule \"which makes one person liable\n\nto another for breach of a duty voluntarily assumed by affirmative\n\nconduct, even when that assumption of duty is gratuitous.\" Good v.\n\nOhio Edison Co., 149 F.3d 413, 420 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting\n\nPatentas v. United States, 687 F.2d 707, 713-14 (3d Cir. 1982)).\n\nThis doctrine is articulated in § 323 of the Second Restatement of\n\nTorts which provides:\n\n            One who undertakes, gratuitously or for\n            consideration, to render services to another\n            which he should recognize as necessary for the\n            protection of the other's person or things, is\n\n                                       -29-\n\f          subject to liability to the other for physical\n          harm resulting from his failure to exercise\n          reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if\n          (a) his failure to exercise such care\n          increases the risk of such harm, or (b) the\n          harm is suffered because of the other's\n          reliance upon the undertaking.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 323.\n\n          A parallel rule in § 324A of the Second Restatement deals\n\nwith liability to third persons:\n\n          One who undertakes, gratuitously or for\n          consideration, to render services to another\n          which he should recognize as necessary for the\n          protection of a third person or his things, is\n          subject to liability to the third person for\n          physical harm resulting from his failure to\n          exercise reasonable care to protect his\n          undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise\n          reasonable care increases the risk of such\n          harm, or (b) he has undertaken to perform a\n          duty owed by the other to the third person, or\n          (c) the harm is suffered because of reliance\n          of the other or the third person upon the\n          undertaking.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 324A.\n\n          Under these provisions, Coast Guard liability based on\n\nnegligence may be established provided it can be shown that the\n\nCoast   Guard's   negligence   \"increase[d]   the   risk\"   of   harm.\n\nPlaintiffs \"must show that the Coast Guard through affirmative\n\nactions caused some physical change to the environment or some\n\nother material alteration of circumstances.\" Good, 149 F.3d at 421\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).      \"Thus, '[t]he\n\ntest is not whether the risk was increased over what it would have\n\n                                -30-\n\fbeen if the defendant had not been negligent,' but rather whether\n\n'[t]he risk [wa]s increased over what it would have been had the\n\ndefendant not engaged in the undertaking at all.'\" Id. (quoting\n\nMyers v. United States, 17 F.3d 890, 903 (6th Cir. 1994)); see also\n\nSagan v. United States, 342 F.3d 493, 498 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\nMyers).\n\n            Coast    Guard    liability       may   also   be   established   in\n\nappropriate circumstances on a theory of induced \"reasonable,\n\njustifiable\" detrimental reliance.             Myers, 17 F.3d at 904.         The\n\nreliance must have caused another \"to forgo other remedies or\n\nprecautions against the risk.\"            Id. at 903 (quoting Restatement §\n\n324A cmt. e).       In the maritime context, detrimental reliance has\n\nbeen found where the \"Coast Guard's actions caused potential\n\nrescuers to rest on their oars . . . in reliance on the Coast\n\nGuard's     undertaking      and    its   presumed,    unless     affirmatively\n\ndisclaimed, competency.\"           Fondow v. United States, 112 F. Supp. 2d\n\n119, 130 (D. Mass. 2000) (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            A related principle, set forth in § 327 of the Second\n\nRestatement, is also relevant and has been applied in the maritime\n\ncontext.    See Hood v. United States, 695 F. Supp. 237, 43-44 (E.D.\n\nLa. 1988).    Section 327 provides:\n\n            One who knows or has reason to know that a\n            third person is giving or is ready to give to\n            another aid necessary to prevent physical harm\n\n                                       -31-\n\f          to him, and negligently prevents or disables\n          the third person from giving such aid, is\n          subject to liability for physical harm caused\n          to the other by the absence of the aid which\n          he has prevented the third party from giving.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 327.\n\n          Our   decision   in   Sandra   &   Dennis   Fishing   Corp.   is\n\nconsistent with the Good Samaritan rule as articulated above.           In\n\nSandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., the Coast Guard clearly worsened the\n\nposition of the towed vessel which, when taken in tow, was in no\n\nimminent peril.    See Rodrigue v. United States, 968 F.2d 1430,\n\n1434-35 (1st Cir. 1992) (observing that, in Sandra & Dennis Fishing\n\nCorp., \"the district court made the significant finding that there\n\nwould have no stranding but for the Coast Guard's misconduct\").\n\nAdditionally, in Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., we emphasized that\n\nthe Coast Guard had induced reliance upon a belief that it \"would\n\nperform its functions with reasonable care.\"      372 F.2d at 195; see\n\nalso Daley v. United States, 499 F. Supp. 1005, 1010 n.6 (D. Mass.\n\n1980) (Aldrich, J., sitting by designation) (explaining that this\n\ncomment in Sandra & Dennis must be understood against a record\n\nwhich showed that the disabled vessel had refrained from seeking\n\nother available assistance).\n\n          More recently, this Court discussed \"the Good Samaritan\n\nrule\" in a case where parents of an airman who drowned after being\n\ncarried out to sea by strong currents at a recreational beach sued\n\nthe Air Force based on its four-hour delay after notification in\n\n                                 -32-\n\fsending a rescue helicopter.         See Rodrigue, 968 F.2d at 1434-35.\n\nWe emphasized that the plaintiffs could not state a case simply by\n\nalleging that the Air Force was negligent.               See id. at 1435.\n\nRather, it was necessary to show, more likely than not, that by its\n\nnegligence the Air Force had worsened the airman's position.                Id.\n\n             Finally, we note that in evaluating Coast Guard conduct\n\nunder the Good Samaritan rule, courts must consider the Coast\n\nGuard's actions and decisions in light of the information known\n\nduring the rescue and not with the benefit of hindsight.                    See\n\nFondow, 112 F. Supp. 2d at 131 (citing cases).                     Accordingly,\n\n\"conduct that might ordinarily be negligent may be non-negligent in\n\nthe pressure cooker circumstances of a rescue.\"              Id.\n\n                  2.   The Standards Applied.\n\n                        a.     The Reliance Argument.\n\n             The evidence of detrimental reliance is insufficient as\n\na matter of law to support a finding of Coast Guard liability, and,\n\nthus,   by   itself    would   not   warrant   a   remand.     In    his   sworn\n\ndeclaration, Captain Haggerty states that \"[b]ecause the Coast\n\nGuard had told me that they were working on arranging commercial\n\nassistance, I did not make any calls on the radio.\"                 However, he\n\ndoes not state exactly what the Coast Guard said or when.              See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(e) (requiring affidavits to set forth \"specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial\").\n\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\f              The   only   other    evidence     we    have    on    this    point   is\n\nHaggerty's     vague   deposition        testimony     that    he    \"asked   Station\n\nGloucester if there was anybody available, if there was any more\n\npumps\" and the response was \"[w]e're working on that.\"                      The Coast\n\nGuard's response, without more, falls short of a representation\n\nthat    the    Coast   Guard       was   working      on    obtaining       commercial\n\nassistance.12       We do not think that a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat    Haggerty    justifiably      relied     on    the    Coast   Guard's     vague\n\nresponse and reasonably refrained from making any efforts of his\n\nown to contact commercial assistance.\n\n                           b.   The Delay\n\n              Similarly, the evidence tending to suggest that the Coast\n\nGuard delayed Goodridge's departure by reason of its initial\n\nresponse discouraging his participation in the rescue operation is\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law to warrant a remand.                    Goodridge's\n\ninitial phone call to the Coast Guard was at 9:03 a.m.                   He was told\n\nthey were going \"to handle it.\"            But by 9:15 a.m., notwithstanding\n\nthat response, he was on the telephone to Cape Ann Divers to see\n\nwho might be available to assist him.                      In addition, some time\n\nduring that period, Goodridge took time to load his truck before\n\nnotifying the Coast Guard at 9:33 a.m. that he was on his way to\n\n\n       12\n       In fact, depending upon when the Coast Guard's statement was\nmade, a natural assumption is that it was talking about the Coast\nGuard cutter ADAK, which arrived late on the scene with additional\npumps.\n\n                                         -34-\n\fassist.     Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nplaintiffs, the delay was, at most, twelve minutes.       We do not\n\nthink a reasonable jury could find that this brief delay was\n\nmaterial.    Plaintiffs' expert opined that Goodridge's boat was in\n\na position to reach the NORTHERN VOYAGER on or about 10:50 a.m.\n\nEven if Goodridge had arrived at the vessel roughly twelve minutes\n\nearlier than expected, at 10:38 a.m., it would have been after the\n\nevacuation.    Indeed, by 10:38 a.m. the Coast Guard 47-footer was\n\nalready en route to Station Gloucester with the Northern Voyager\n\ncrew on board.13\n\n            We add, moreover, that we see nothing wrong in the Coast\n\nGuard's response at 9:03 a.m. that they were going \"to handle it.\"\n\nCaptain Haggerty had, in fact, called the Coast Guard; they were\n\nplanning to go to the NORTHERN VOYAGER's assistance; and at 9:03\n\na.m. the Coast Guard had yet to be informed as to many of the\n\n\n\n     13\n      Our dissenting colleague suggests that, in addition to a\ntwelve-minute delay of Goodridge's departure from Newburyport, the\nrecord supports a finding that the Coast Guard caused further delay\nonce Goodridge arrived at his boat at Cape Ann Marina by its\nindefinite response to his query as to whether additional pumps\nwere needed or just diving assistance. Appellants made no argument\nalong these lines, and we are not persuaded. The transcript of the\nradio communication indicates the Coast Guard responded reasonably\nto Goodridge's inquiry by saying \"we're not sure at this time.\"\nAlthough the dissent suggests this indefinite response caused\nGoodridge to spend unnecessary extra time loading pumps on board\nhis boat, we do not see how the Coast Guard can be faulted for its\nresponse, especially given record evidence that the Coast Guard's\nown pumps kept failing and the possibility that, even if diving\nassistance were successful, some additional pumping assistance\nmight be required.\n\n                                -35-\n\fdetails that might have indicated a need for Goodridge's additional\n\nassistance.\n\n               c.   Alleged    Interference   With/Failure   to\n                    Facilitate Communications Between Goodridge\n                    and the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n\n          Plaintiffs   have   a   stronger   argument   of   Coast    Guard\n\ninterference with Goodridge's efforts based on Station Gloucester's\n\nmisstatement to Goodridge at 10:03 a.m. that it \"need[ed] to keep\n\nthis frequency clear.\"    See note 1, supra.        As noted, one who\n\nnegligently prevents or disables a third person from giving aid\n\nnecessary to prevent physical harm is subject to liability for that\n\nharm caused by the absence of the prevented aid.        See Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 327, supra p. 32.14      Here a fact-finder could\n\ndetermine that the Coast Guard's negative responses to Goodridge,\n\nafter assuming control itself of the rescue operation, prevented or\n\ndisabled Goodridge from giving aid that could have prevented the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER from sinking.\n\n          By 10:03 a.m., Coast Guard personnel had been told by the\n\ncaptain that the vessel \"might, ah, dropped the rudder.\"             And in\n\nhis 10:03 a.m. transmission to the Coast Guard, Goodridge indicated\n\n\n\n     14\n      Although § 327 is arguably, by its terms, limited to physical\nharm to a person, it applies to claims involving property damage\nthrough the operation of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 497 (\"The\nrules which determine negligence of conduct threatening harm to\nanother's interest in the physical condition of land and chattels\nare the same as those which determine the negligence of conduct\nwhich threatens bodily harm.\").\n\n                                  -36-\n\fboth that he was on his way and could offer diving assistance.\n\nDiving capability, given the character of the leak -- an open\n\nrudder tube allowing a pathway for the sea water to enter the ship\n\n-- could be found to have been just what the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\nneeded.     The record contains expert testimony that such a leak\n\ncould be contained by a diver's inserting of objects like a life\n\npreserver or lobster buoy into the opening. Goodridge testified he\n\nhad the equipment and skill to have plugged the rudder leak in a\n\nmatter of minutes.    Yet the Coast Guard's only response was to tell\n\nGoodridge to clear the air waves.\n\n             In his deposition, Goodridge testified that the reason he\n\ndid not later seek to radio the master of the NORTHERN VOYAGER,\n\nafter the master had been evacuated to the Coast Guard's 47-footer,\n\nwas that \"he [had] been told twice to stay off the radio.\"             We\n\nthink there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact-finder to\n\nfind that the Coast Guard's rebuff at 10:03 a.m. discouraged\n\nGoodridge from further attempts to communicate with the Coast Guard\n\nor, directly, with the NORTHERN VOYAGER, as he motored to the\n\nscene.     Had he done so, plans might have developed that would have\n\nled   to    saving   the   vessel.      In   particular,   had   Goodridge\n\ncommunicated with Captain Haggerty, or even a knowledgeable Coast\n\nGuard officer involved in the rescue operation, advance plans could\n\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fhave been discussed for Goodridge to dive under the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER while it was still afloat.15\n\n             The Coast Guard's witness, Chief Warrant Officer Dittes,\n\nconceded that the information that Goodridge was coming was \"a\n\nsignificant piece of information\" and the sort \"they would normally\n\npass to the person that's in trouble.\"     Yet the Coast Guard did not\n\nadvise the NORTHERN VOYAGER that Goodridge was on the way, much\n\nless did it note the fact that Goodridge had a diving capability\n\nwhich might be put to good use.     Had Captain Haggerty been alerted\n\nthat Goodridge was coming, and had he then communicated by radio\n\nwith Goodridge, advance plans could have been laid for Goodridge to\n\ndive under the NORTHERN VOYAGER and plug the leak.            There is\n\nevidence from which to infer that even if Goodridge arrived shortly\n\nafter Haggerty had been removed from his sinking vessel, the dive\n\nmight have been consummated had Haggerty prepared for it before\n\nleaving the NORTHERN VOYAGER.      See note 15, supra.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          In his affidavit, Captain Haggerty stated in pertinent part:\n\n             If Mr. Goodridge had been allowed to call me\n             on the radio or by cellphone, I could have\n             communicated with him and learned what he\n             needed.   If this had happened, I could have\n             and would have shut off those engines, rigged\n             a Jacobs ladder, and communicated this to him,\n             even if we were nevertheless to be forced off\n             the vessel thereafter.\n\nAff. of Captain Haggerty ¶ 8.\n\n                                  -38-\n\f             We do not suggest the Coast Guard had an independent duty\n\nof its own to provide a commercial diver.16         Even if it exercised\n\npoor judgment in not doing so, it would not be civilly liable\n\nunless its negligence worsened the situation over what it would\n\nhave been had the Coast Guard not come to the aid of the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER.     But its announcement to Goodridge that it was \"handling\"\n\nthe rescue operation and its later insistence when Goodridge called\n\nthat he keep the frequency clear, coupled with its failure to tell\n\nCaptain     Haggerty   about   Goodridge,   could   be   found   to   have\n\ndiscouraged Goodridge from further attempts to communicate and so\n\nto assist the NORTHERN VOYAGER.      The Coast Guard had a duty not to\n\nthrow roadblocks in the path of Goodridge's independent efforts to\n\nhelp.     A fact-finder might find that by announcing it was handling\n\nthe rescue, and then that it needed to keep the frequency clear,\n\nthe Coast Guard in effect declared exclusive control over rescue-\n\nrelated communications, leading Goodridge to forgo further efforts\n\neither to call the NORTHERN VOYAGER directly or to discuss salvage\n\noptions with Coast Guard officers handling the rescue.\n\n\n     16\n      The current version of the Coast Guard Addendum to the United\nStates National Search and Rescue Supplement provides that \"SMC's\n[i.e., Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator's] must remain\nfamiliar with all SAR assistance resources within the SMC's [area\nof responsibility] . . . and shall direct those resources that the\nSMC believes are needed to the scene of a vessel in distress.\"\nCoast Guard Addendum § 4.2.7.1.      Commercial providers are an\nassistance resource. Id. at § 4.2.3.3. However, the National SAR\nmanual and the Addendum do not define a standard of care owing to\nthe public. See, e.g., In re American Oil Co., 417 F.2d 164, 170\n(5th Cir. 1969); Daley, 499 F. Supp. at 1010.\n\n                                   -39-\n\f          The Coast Guard's comment about the need to keep the\n\nfrequency clear came at a critical time when the decision whether\n\nto evacuate was under consideration.            If Goodridge had not been\n\ndiscouraged   from    further   contact    at    this    time,    before    the\n\nevacuation, there is evidence suggesting the outcome could have\n\nbeen different.      Had Captain Haggerty spoken to Goodridge or even\n\nbeen told by the Coast Guard he was on the way with a diver, he\n\ncould have notified Goodridge that he wished his assistance.                 By\n\nitself, such an expression would likely have caused Goodridge to\n\nhave increased and prolonged his efforts to reach and assist the\n\nsinking   vessel.       Further,   communication        could    have    allowed\n\nGoodridge to arrange with Captain Haggerty to dive under the\n\nvessel.    Even if the Coast Guard still believed that safety\n\nconsiderations    required   Haggerty     to    leave    the    vessel    before\n\nGoodridge could reach it, the captain stated in his affidavit that\n\nhe could have taken steps to facilitate a dive before leaving by,\n\nfor example, making sure to shut off the engines (and to assure\n\nGoodridge of the fact), and rigging a Jacobs ladder in order to\n\nfacilitate a possible return to the vessel.             Thus, a fact-finder\n\ncould determine that even without Haggerty on board, a dive to plug\n\nthe leak could have been arranged.        Indeed, the record supports a\n\npossible inference that the first step, alone, would have been\n\nsufficient, and that if Goodridge had been engaged by Haggerty and\n\nhad then simply been assured that the main engines were turned off,\n\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fhe would have been willing to dive under the vessel and seek to\n\nplug the rudder tube, thereby checking the influx of water and\n\nquite possibly stabilizing the situation so as to permit further\n\nsalvage efforts that would have ultimately saved the vessel.\n\n            A    similar   argument    can   be   made    based    on    Station\n\nGloucester's unhelpful response to Goodridge on or about 10:47 a.m.\n\nwhen Goodridge contacted the station by radio hoping to get in\n\ntouch with the captain.        At this point, both Goodridge and the\n\ncaptain, who was by then on board the 47-foot Coast Guard vessel,\n\nwere roughly one mile from the sinking NORTHERN VOYAGER.                 Station\n\nGloucester first told Goodridge to call back by \"land line\" and,\n\nthen, when Goodridge called by cellular phone, told him that he\n\ncould speak to the captain back at the station.             Captain Haggerty\n\nwas not immediately informed of the call nor were efforts made to\n\nallow contact via the radio of the Coast Guard's vessel bearing\n\nHaggerty.       A fact-finder could reasonably infer that the Coast\n\nGuard's response to Goodridge had the effect of interfering with\n\nthe last opportunity to arrange for a dive.          The only way in which\n\nGoodridge could have contacted the captain meaningfully once he was\n\naboard the Coast Guard vessel would have been via the latter's\n\nradio.   At 10:47 a.m., with both Goodridge and the captain not far\n\nfrom the    scene,    it   remained   possible    that,   had     they   spoken,\n\nGoodridge might still have taken effective measures to dive and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fplug the leak.        Or, at least, the record suffices to raise a\n\nfactual issue on this point.\n\n           In sum, we think the evidence, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to appellants, was such that a reasonable fact-finder\n\ncould conclude that the Coast Guard had reason to know that a third\n\nparty was ready to give aid of a potentially useful type that the\n\nCoast Guard could not provide, and that it negligently engaged in\n\nactions that tended to prevent or disable such person from giving\n\nsuch aid. Further, we think that a fact-finder could conclude from\n\nsuch evidence, viewed most favorably, that this negligence was a\n\nproximate cause of the sinking of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.                Under the\n\ncircumstances, a remand for further proceedings is warranted.\n\n           It    is   true    that   under    the   Good   Samaritan   rule   the\n\nappellants have the burden of demonstrating that the Coast Guard\n\nincreased the risk of the NORTHERN VOYAGER's sinking over what it\n\nwould have been had there been no Coast Guard involvement at all.\n\nArguably, appellants have not established that, absent the Coast\n\nGuard's pumping assistance, the NORTHERN VOYAGER would have stayed\n\nafloat for a sufficient time to permit Goodridge to reach it and\n\neffectively plug the leak, (i.e., that the loss of the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER could have been prevented by the private salvor, acting\n\nalone,   had    the   Coast    Guard   not    become   involved).      However,\n\naccording to plaintiffs' experts, there are various things that\n\nCaptain Haggerty and his crew could have done to contain the\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fflooding temporarily and stabilize the situation, such as closing\n\ncertain doors and making them watertight. While there is little or\n\nno evidence in the record that the captain and his crew actually\n\ndid or thought of any of these things at the time of the emergency,\n\nthere was evidence to suggest that at least one of the doors was\n\nnot shut because of the presence of the hose of a Coast Guard pump.\n\nWhile the evidence is perhaps minimal that the ship would have\n\nsurvived until Goodridge could have saved it without help from the\n\nCoast Guard's pumps, we find it sufficient, viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to appellants, to establish a factual issue and\n\nwarrant a trial on the question of whether the Coast Guard worsened\n\nthe plight of the NORTHERN VOYAGER by its negative handling of\n\nGoodridge's attempts to become involved by radio.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm so much of the\n\ndistrict   court   opinion    as    concluded    that      the   Coast   Guard's\n\ndecision   to   forcibly    evacuate    the    crew   is    protected    by   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception but remand for further proceedings\n\non   plaintiffs'    claim    that      Coast    Guard      interference       with\n\ncommunications between the commercial salvor and NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\nresulted in the sinking of the ship.\n\n           Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     Opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part follows.\n\n                                    -43-\n\f",

The Sinking of the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\n            On the morning of November 2, 1997, the NORTHERN VOYAGER,\n\na 144-foot fishing vessel, was proceeding a few miles off the coast\n\nof Gloucester, Massachusetts when crewmen discovered water flooding\n\na compartment in the ship's stern.             The flooding, which resulted\n\nwhen the starboard rudder dropped out of the vessel, was severe and\n\nthe crew immediately began trying to pump out the water.                  Despite\n\nthe crew's       best   efforts,   the    water   level    in   the   compartment\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcontinued to rise, threatening to flood the boat's engine room. If\n\nthe engine room flooded, all of the NORTHERN VOYAGER's electrical\n\npumps and generators located inside would be rendered useless.\n\n           The situation was such that the master of the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER,   Captain   David   Haggerty,   radioed   Coast   Guard   Station\n\nGloucester, told them that \"[w]ater [was] coming in fast,\" and\n\nrequested that they \"get some pumps out to [the ship].\"                 To\n\ncomplicate matters, a storm had passed through the area the night\n\nbefore, leaving swells of roughly six to eight feet.               Station\n\nGloucester (under the command of Chief Warrant Officer Wesley\n\nDittes) responded immediately by launching a 41-foot boat, to be\n\nfollowed shortly thereafter by a 47-foot one. The Coast Guard also\n\ndiverted a 110-foot cutter, the ADAK, to assist as On Scene\n\nCoordinator.   Coast Guard Group Boston, which is organizationally\n\nsuperior to Station Gloucester, assumed the role of Search and\n\nRescue Mission Coordinator.\n\n           The 41-footer arrived on the scene at approximately 9:15\n\na.m. and immediately evacuated eight crew members who apparently\n\nrequested to leave the NORTHERN VOYAGER, leaving on board of the\n\noriginal crew Captain Haggerty, the engineer, and the first mate.\n\nTwo Coast Guardsmen, Petty Officers Adam Sirois and Brian Conners,\n\nboarded the NORTHERN VOYAGER and attempted to assist in continuing\n\nefforts to remove water from the ship using extra pumps supplied by\n\nthe Coast Guard.     Although what was done slowed the rate of water\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\faccumulation, the flooding continued and the NORTHERN VOYAGER began\n\nto develop a port side list.\n\n           As the NORTHERN VOYAGER rolled and began to list, Coast\n\nGuard Officer Dittes (aboard the 47-footer), Group Boston, and the\n\nOn Scene Coordinator began discussing the possibility that the\n\nvessel would need to be evacuated. Several factors worried Dittes.\n\nHis most immediate concern was that the vessel's port side tilt\n\nmade both access to and escape from the NORTHERN VOYAGER more\n\ndifficult.    This is because the fishing boat's only access port, a\n\ndoor from the shelter deck through which the crew boarded and\n\ndeparted from the boat, was on the starboard side.   As the fishing\n\nboat tilted more and more to port, the starboard side was raised\n\nhigher and higher off the surface of the water.   No less worrisome\n\nwas his concern about progressive flooding, which was causing the\n\nvessel to settle further in the water, with the danger that the\n\nboat would capsize without warning before it sank, trapping anyone\n\naboard before they could be rescued.\n\n             Based upon these concerns, Dittes's conversations with\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER crew members who had already boarded the 47-\n\nfooter, and the continual progression of the flooding, Dittes\n\nordered his men to evacuate the NORTHERN VOYAGER's remaining crew\n\nmembers.     Captain Haggerty opposed the Coast Guard's decision to\n\nevacuate his vessel and wanted to talk about other options for\n\npumping and salvage, including commercial salvage.\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Dittes and Conners refused to discuss any other options\n\nfor salvage aboard the NORTHERN VOYAGER, and, again, ordered\n\nHaggerty and his men off the boat.     According to Captain Haggerty,\n\nConners informed him that if he did not cooperate, the Coast Guard\n\nwould \"subdue [him] physically\" in order to take him off the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER.     All Coast Guard personnel and the remaining\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER officers were then transferred to the Coast Guard\n\n47-footer.\n\n          The   NORTHERN   VOYAGER   was   abandoned   at   10:27   a.m.,\n\ncontinued to sink, and capsized at 11:22 a.m., fifty-five minutes\n\nafter the last person left the vessel.       Captain Haggerty did not\n\nwant to stay around and watch the boat sink.     Accordingly, shortly\n\nafter the evacuation, the Coast Guard 47-footer headed back to\n\nStation Gloucester with Captain Haggerty and the remaining members\n\nof his crew on board.\n\n          According to plaintiffs' experts, there were various\n\nsteps that Captain Haggerty and his senior crew could have taken to\n\nstabilize the situation if the Coast Guard had permitted them to\n\nstay on the vessel.     These steps included shutting certain doors\n\nand making them watertight so that the flooding was confined to two\n\ncompartments in the stern of the boat.       If these steps had been\n\ntaken, plaintiffs' experts asserted, the vessel could have floated\n\nfor at least another twenty hours even assuming that no pumping\n\ncapacity was brought to bear.   This would have provided ample time\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffor independent salvage resources to reach the vessel, even if they\n\nhad to come from as far away as Boston.\n\n             B.    Alternative Salvage Efforts Were Underway\n\n             While Coast Guard rescue efforts were underway, radio\n\ntraffic about the NORTHERN VOYAGER was overheard by a commercial\n\nsalvor named Michael Goodridge based in Newburyport, Massachusetts.\n\nAt 9:03 a.m., just minutes after Captain Haggerty first radioed for\n\nCoast Guard assistance, Goodridge placed a telephone call to\n\nStation Gloucester.         He told them that he had dive gear and pumps\n\nand asked whether they needed assistance.               Station Gloucester\n\nresponded that they were busy and they were going to \"handle it.\"\n\n             At 9:04 a.m., Captain Haggerty informed the Coast Guard\n\nby radio that he thought the water was coming up through the\n\nvessel's rudder-post.         He conjectured that the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\n\"might ah, dropped the rudder.\" Earlier, he had explained that the\n\nvessel had lost its steering capability.\n\n             Several minutes later, the Coast Guard transmitted an\n\nUrgent Marine Information Broadcast stating that it \"ha[d] received\n\na report that the Fishing Vessel Voyager is taking on water\" and\n\nrequesting that \"all vessels keep a sharp lookout, assist if\n\npossible, [and] report all sightings to the U.S. Coast Guard.\"\n\nThis   was   the    Coast    Guard's   only   attempt   to   solicit   outside\n\nassistance.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f              Himself a diver, Goodridge, who continued to monitor\n\ndevelopments over his radio, recognized that the \"vessel was going\n\nto need a diver to correct the problem.\"        Accordingly, he began\n\nloading up his truck.      At 9:15 a.m., Goodridge placed a telephone\n\ncall to Cape Ann Divers to see if anyone was available to assist\n\nhim.       At 9:33 a.m., he reported to Station Gloucester that he was\n\nen route, with diving gear, and that his estimated time of arrival\n\nwas one hour.\n\n               At 10:03 a.m., several minutes before the decision to\n\nevacuate was made, Goodridge hailed Station Gloucester on radio\n\nchannel 16.       He was told to switch to channel 12, a frequency not\n\nbeing used by anyone on the scene.       Goodridge stated that he was\n\nboarding a vessel at Cape Ann Marina, and asked if he should bring\n\nextra pumps or whether just diving assistance was necessary.\n\n               Station Gloucester responded that it \"wasn't sure,\" the\n\nsituation was unstable, and it needed to keep \"[the] frequency\n\nclear.\"1      Goodridge interpreted this to mean that he shouldn't tie\n\nup the channel.       He stated that he would be there \"in a little\n\nbit,\" and he got off the radio.       Shortly thereafter, everyone was\n\nevacuated from the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n\n\n       1\n      The comment about the need to keep the frequency clear was\nconceded by the Coast Guard employee who made it to be a\nmisstatement. The Coast Guard employee said that it was a \"bad\nchoice of words,\" that Goodridge's contact came at a time when she\nneeded to listen, and that what she should have done was to ask\nGoodridge to \"wait out.\"\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           At about 10:44 a.m., when Goodridge was about a mile from\n\nthe Northern Voyager, he contacted Station Gloucester by radio\n\nhoping to establish contact with the captain.       At that point,\n\nGoodridge had just seen the 47-footer heading back with the crew.\n\nStation Gloucester told him to call by \"land line.\" When Goodridge\n\ncalled back on his cellular phone, he was told that he could talk\n\nto the captain when he arrived back at the station.\n\n           Goodridge said that he did not attempt to contact the 47-\n\nfooter directly because he had \"[b]een told twice to stay off the\n\nradio.\"    He didn't bother going to the station to talk to the\n\ncaptain because he assumed that, based on the Coast Guard reports,\n\nthe boat was too far gone for him to take the necessary time.\n\n           According to plaintiffs' expert, Goodridge was in a\n\nposition to reach the NORTHERN VOYAGER by 10:50 a.m., well before\n\nit sank.   Goodridge stated at his deposition that he had the skill\n\nand equipment necessary to dive under the NORTHERN VOYAGER and plug\n\nthe hole formerly containing the rudder post, and the task would\n\nhave taken him only a couple minutes.2   However, he needed to talk\n\nto somebody in the NORTHERN VOYAGER crew before making such an\n\nattempt in order to find out if the engines were running.   Without\n\nthis knowledge, it was too risky to dive near the propellers, as he\n\nwould have had to do to plug the rudder tube.\n\n     2\n      Plaintiffs' expert stated that there were many available\nobjects, such as a lobster buoy or life jacket, that Goodridge\ncould have used to plug the hole and that this would have stopped,\nor at least considerably reduced, the influx of sea water.\n\n                                -9-\n\f          Captain    Haggerty    stated   that   he    did    not     know   any\n\ncommercial salvors in the Gloucester area and thought that the\n\nCoast Guard was working on getting commercial assistance.                At no\n\ntime before the captain was put ashore in Gloucester, however, did\n\nhe learn, nor was he told by the Coast Guard, that a salvor was\n\napproaching with additional pumps and with dive gear.3                  If the\n\ncaptain had been in contact with Goodridge and had been made aware\n\nof his concerns about the engine running, the captain would have\n\nshut off the engines before evacuating, rigged a Jacobs ladder in\n\norder to facilitate a possible return to the boat, and communicated\n\nthis information to Goodridge.\n\n          C.   Proceedings in the District Court\n\n          Northern   Voyager,    its   insurers,      and    Thames   Shipyard\n\nbrought this action in the District of Massachusetts against the\n\nUnited States alleging that the sinking of the NORTHERN VOYAGER was\n\ndue to the negligence of the Coast Guard.              Plaintiffs' primary\n\ncontention was that the Coast Guard exceeded its authority by\n\ncoercively compelling the NORTHERN VOYAGER's master to leave the\n\nvessel against his will.        Plaintiffs   further alleged that the\n\nCoast Guard negligently interfered with the efforts of Michael\n\nGoodridge, the commercial salvor, and also deprived the NORTHERN\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The record contains conflicting evidence on this point, but\nwe, of course, take the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nlosing party.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fVOYAGER of other possible sources of assistance in its time of\n\nperil.4\n\n            The United States contended that the Coast Guard was\n\nlegally authorized to issue the evacuation order by virtue of the\n\nbroad search and rescue powers conferred upon the Coast Guard by\n\nCongress under 14 U.S.C. § 88 to \"perform any and all acts\n\nnecessary to rescue and aid persons . . . \"   See note 7, infra.   It\n\nfurther argued that the decision to issue the order in these\n\ncircumstances was a decision protected under the discretionary\n\nfunction exception.   The United States moved for summary judgment\n\non the grounds that the suit was barred by the exception.          In\n\nrespect to plaintiffs' arguments that the Coast Guard negligently\n\ninterfered with the commercial salvor's efforts, the United States\n\ncontended that these arguments failed under the \"Good Samaritan\"\n\ndoctrine requiring a would-be rescuer to have worsened the victim's\n\nposition.\n\n            The district court concluded that the Coast Guard's\n\ndecision to compel Haggerty and his crew to abandon the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER was protected by the discretionary function exception.\n\n\n     4\n      In addition, plaintiffs alleged various intentional torts\nincluding trespass to chattels, conversion, breach of fiduciary\nobligations,   bailment,   and    intentional   interference   with\ncontractual and/or advantageous relations. Our discussion, infra,\nconcluding that the Coast Guard's evacuation decision is protected\nby the discretionary function exception disposes of most of these\nclaims. We do not think that the alleged facts support a claim of\nintentional   interference   with   contractual   or   advantageous\nrelations.\n\n                               -11-\n\fNorthern Voyager Ltd.

Indian Towing, 350 U.S. at 69.\n\nHowever, having \"exercised its discretion to operate [the] light .\n\n. . and engendered reliance on the guidance afforded by the light,\n\n[the Coast Guard] was obligated to use due care to make certain\n\nthat the light was kept in working order.\"      Id.\n\n             Indian Towing is inapposite for two reasons.

Second, as\n\nthis Court has interpreted the case, through the lens of later\n\nSupreme Court decisions, it illustrates a situation where there was\n\nno exercise of policy judgment but rather involved purely technical\n\nor scientific considerations.

See id.\n\n             In Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp., a Coast Guard patrol\n\nboat took in tow a fishing vessel that was then in no immediate\n\ndanger of sinking and, through negligence (human error), caused the\n\nvessel to strand on a shoal.      This Court stated that the Coast\n\nGuard had no duty to provide rescue services on demand.          Sandra &\n\nDennis Fishing Corp., 372 F.2d at 195.        However, we held that \"if\n\nthe Coast Guard accepts a mission it should conduct its share of\n\nthe proceeding with acceptable seamanship.\"        Id. at 197.\n\n             There is no hint in Sandra & Dennis Fishing Corp. that\n\nthe government attempted to rely on the discretionary function\n\nexception.     Nor is there any reason to think that the negligent\n\nconduct upon which this Court affirmed liability (the failure to\n\ncheck with the loran on the towed vessel when the loran on the\n\nCoast Guard patrol boat went out) implicated protected policy\n\nconcerns as opposed to mere technical, navigational missteps.\n\nAccordingly, neither Indian Towing nor Sandra & Dennis Fishing\n\nCorp. stand for the proposition that a Coast Guard determination\n\nmade during the course of a mission may not be protected by the\n\ndiscretionary     function   exception   in     otherwise     appropriate\n\ncircumstances.\n\n             Indeed, to hold differently could be said to fly in the\n\nface of the Supreme Court's decision in Gaubert, 499 U.S. at 325-\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f26, which rejects a distinction between initiation of programs and\n\ndecisions made at an operational level.

For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we conclude that both prongs are met.\n\n                2.   Application of the Two-Prong Inquiry.\n\n          First, the Coast Guard has statutorily-granted discretion\n\nto exercise its judgment in determining how it goes about search\n\nand rescue (\"SAR\") operations.    See 14 U.S.C. § 88 (providing that\n\nthe Coast Guard may perform any and all acts necessary to rescue\n\nand aid persons and property). Further, internal manuals recognize\n\nthe discretionary nature of decisions made during the course of SAR\n\noperations.    The National Search and Rescue Manual notes that\n\n\"[b]ecause of the many variables encountered during SAR operations\n\nand the individuality of each SAR case, the guidance provided in\n\nthis Manual must be tempered with sound judgment, having due regard\n\nfor the individual situation.\"     1 Joint Chiefs of Staff & U.S.\n\nCoast Guard, National Search and Rescue Manual v, § 3.a (1991). The\n\nCoast Guard Addendum to this manual provides that \"Coast Guard\n\npersonnel are expected to exercise broad discretion in performing\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fthe functions discussed.\"     U.S. Coast Guard, Coast Guard Addendum\n\nto the National Search and Rescue Manual at 2.\n\n          Second,     the   determination    that   the    peril   to   the\n\nendangered seamen had reached such a level as to require a forced\n\nevacuation involved a true policy choice.

Rather, it\n\ninvolved the balancing of incommensurable values -- such as human\n\nsafety, protection of property, autonomy, and the allocation of\n\nresources -- typically associated with policy decisions.6          See id.\n\nat 695.   The Coast Guard's manual sets forth a policy of giving\n\npriority to the saving of human lives over the saving of property.\n\nSee infra p. 25.    Applying such a policy in circumstances of danger\n\nsuch as these calls for an evaluation       of multiple factors that is\n\nanything but purely technical and routine.\n\n\n     6\n      The last factor (allocation of resources) comes into play\nespecially because, despite appellants' suggestion to the contrary,\nthe Coast Guard, once on the scene, would have been hard pressed\nsimply to abandon the imperilled seamen. If the ship had capsized,\ntrapping the men inside or putting them overboard, the Coast Guard\nwould have been faced with a riskier, more costly rescue operation\nthat might have endangered the lives of Coast Guard personnel\nseeking to rescue those members of the NORTHERN VOYAGER's crew who\nhad elected to remain on board.\n\n                                  -20-\n\f                  3.   The Scope of 14 U.S.C. § 88.\n\n             Finally, we turn to appellants' contention that the\n\ndiscretionary function exception does not apply because the Coast\n\nGuard acted outside the scope of its statutorily-granted authority\n\nor in derogation of other constitutional and legal principles.\n\nThis argument requires us to determine whether 14 U.S.C. § 88,\n\nwhich provides inter alia that the Coast Guard may perform \"any and\n\nall acts necessary to rescue and aid persons and protect and save\n\nproperty,\" permits the Coast Guard, when it deems such action\n\nnecessary to protect lives, to compel an unwilling master to\n\nevacuate his vessel.7      This is a novel question in that, while\n\nsimilar events may have arisen in the past, no federal cases\n\n\n\n     7\n         The pertinent part of § 88 provides in full:\n\n             (a) In order to render aid to distressed persons,\n             vessels, and aircraft on and under the high seas and on\n             and under the waters over which the United States has\n             jurisdiction and in order to render aid to persons and\n             property imperiled by flood, the Coast Guard may:\n             (1) perform any and all acts necessary to rescue and aid\n             persons and protect and save property;\n             (2) take charge of and protect all property saved from\n             marine or aircraft disasters, or floods, at which the\n             Coast Guard is present, until such property is claimed by\n             persons legally authorized to receive it or until\n             otherwise disposed of in accordance with law or\n             applicable regulations, and care for bodies of those who\n             may have perished in such catastrophes;\n             (3) furnish clothing, food, lodging, medicines, and other\n             necessary supplies and services to persons succored by\n             the Coast Guard; and\n             (4) destroy or tow into port sunken or floating dangers\n             to navigation.\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\finterpreting the Coast Guard's powers in this regard appear to\n\nexist in the law books, nor have any specific regulations been\n\npromulgated on the subject by the Coast Guard.                Moreover, the\n\nlegislative history of § 88 does not address this particular\n\nissue.8   On   the    one   hand,    the   statute's     literal    language\n\n(empowering the Coast Guard to \"perform any and all acts necessary\n\nto rescue and aid persons . . . \") can be said literally to\n\nencompass such action. On the other, in our democratic society the\n\ncircumstances are limited in which governmental officials may\n\nlegally compel people, against their will, to abandon their homes\n\nor other private property. If it were unconstitutional or contrary\n\nto clear law for the Coast Guard to rescue unwilling mariners in\n\nlife-threatening     situations,    we   would   be   loath   to   read   such\n\nauthority into § 88.\n\n          Given the dearth of federal authority, we turn to state\n\nlaw and practice in analogous rescue situations for guidance.\n\n\n     8\n      Section 88 was added to Title 14 in 1949. See Act of Aug. 4,\n1949, c. 393, 63 Stat. 501. The Senate Report that accompanied the\nlegislation explains that previous \"statutes were enacted over a\nperiod of a century and cover[ed], in some cases, only limited\ngeographical areas, and in other cases only limited types of\nassistance work,\" and that \"section 88 authorizes the Coast Guard,\nin the broadest possible terms without limitation as to method or\nplace, to save lives and property.\"      S. Rep. No. 81-656, at 5\n(1949), reprinted in 1949 U.S. Code & Cong. Serv. 1652, 1656. This\nhistory suggests that the phrase \"any and all acts\" defines the\nscope of Coast Guard authority and, is not, as plaintiffs contend,\nmerely an implementary provision.      Further, it is plain that\nCongress intended the scope of this power to be broad.\nNonetheless, nothing in the legislative history specifically\naddresses the power to order forcible evacuation.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fAlmost every state in the United States has adopted statutes\n\nproviding for the exercise of police powers in the event of an\n\nemergency or disaster (such as fire, flood, tornado, hurricane,\n\netc.)   See Howard D. Swanson, The Delicate Art of Practicing\n\nMunicipal Law Under Conditions of Hell and High Water, 76 N.D.L.\n\nRev. 487, 490-93 & n.10 (2000) (citing statutes).                    Most of the\n\nstate statutory schemes provide that the governor of the state has\n\nthe ability to declare an emergency.               See id. at 490.       \"Further,\n\nmost of the states also allow the exercise of emergency or disaster\n\nauthority by a local government.\"             Id.     One of the most common\n\nforms of authority exercised in an emergency is the mandatory\n\nevacuation of buildings, streets, neighborhoods, and cities.                    Id.\n\nat 495, see also David G. Tucker & Alfred O. Bragg, III, Florida's\n\nLaw of Storms:       Emergency Management, Local Government, and the\n\nPolice Power, 30 Stetson L. Rev. 837, 838 (Winter 2001) (\"Local\n\ndecision-makers may be called upon to order evacuations or prevent\n\npeople from returning to damaged houses.\").\n\n           In   some    states,      there   are    statutes      that   expressly\n\ndelegate   to   local       safety   officers       the   authority      to   order\n\nevacuations     in     an    emergency.        See,       e.g.,    Alaska     Stat.\n\n§ 18.70.075(a)(2) (providing that a fire officer has the authority\n\nto \"order a person to leave a building or place in the vicinity of\n\na fire or emergency, for the purpose of protecting the person from\n\ninjury\"); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 7-313b (similar); Del. Code Ann. tit.\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f16, § 6701A(2) (similar); N.H. Rev. St. Ann. § 154:7 (similar);\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 6-21-703 (similar); W. Va. Code § 29-3A-1\n\n(similar).         In other states, where the issue is not expressly\n\naddressed in any statute, the authority of a safety officer to\n\norder an evacuation has been inferred from a statute delegating\n\ngeneral authority \"to preserve the public peace.\"            See, e.g., Ohio\n\nOp. Atty. Gen. No. 87-099 (reasoning in this way and opining that\n\na sheriff \"may order the evacuation of persons residing . . . in\n\nthe vicinity of a hazardous materials accident or emergency, when\n\nreasonably necessary for the protection of the health, safety, and\n\nwell-being of such persons\" and \"may, in a reasonable manner,\n\nremove   to    a    safe   area   any   persons   who   refuse   to   evacuate\n\nvoluntarily\").9\n\n              The Coast Guard is a governmental agency and has been\n\ngranted by Congress a variety of public safety responsibilities and\n\n\n     9\n      We have no doubts about the constitutionality of such\nauthority.

See U. S. Coast Guard, Boat\n\nCrew Seamanship Manual at 18-92.      In circumstances such as the\n\npresent, Coast Guard operations are relevantly different from the\n\nsituation in which a private vessel or a commercial salvor comes to\n\nthe aid of a distressed vessel.11 Under the circumstances, we think\n\n     10\n      See, e.g., 14 U.S.C. § 2 (\"Primary Duties\") (stating, inter\nalia, that the Coast Guard \"shall administer laws and promulgate\nand enforce regulations for the promotion of safety of life and\nproperty on and under the high seas and waters subject to the\njurisdiction of the United States covering all matters not\nspecifically delegated by law to some other executive department\"\nand \"shall develop, establish, maintain, and operate, with due\nregard to the requirements of national defense, aids to maritime\nnavigation, icebreaking facilities, and rescue facilities for the\npromotion of safety on, under, and over the high seas and waters\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States\").\n     11\n      It is a general principle of admiralty law that an owner of\na vessel has a right to decline salvage assistance and that \"a\nsalvor who acts without the express or implied consent of the owner\nis a 'gratuitous intermeddler' who is not entitled to any salvage\naward.\" 2 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty & Maritime Law § 16-1 at\n360-61 (3d ed. 2001).

Within the scope of that discretionary authority, we\n\nhold that the Coast     Guard could not be held liable for the\n\nconsequences of its decision.\n\n                 4. The Instant Scenario\n\n          The facts of this case lead us to conclude that the Coast\n\nGuard reacted rationally, and that human life could reasonably have\n\nbeen deemed to be at serious risk had Captain Haggerty and his crew\n\nnot been removed.     The NORTHERN VOYAGER, without steering, was\n\nrolling in six to eight foot ocean seas.        Water was pouring in.\n\nShe was developing an increasing port-side list.           The fishing\n\nboat's only access port was on the starboard side.             The Coast\n\nGuardsmen on the vessel reported progressive flooding, raising the\n\npossibility that the ship would capsize, trapping all on board.\n\nWhile arguments can perhaps be made in the light of 20-20 hindsight\n\ntending to minimize the potential dangers had the master and his\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\ffellows been allowed to remain, we see no basis to doubt the\n\nobjective reasonableness of the Coast Guard's on the scene decision\n\nto remove them.\n\n          Under the circumstances (and in light of our conclusions\n\nabove), we hold that (1) the discretionary function exception\n\napplies to the decision at issue; (2) the Coast Guard made a policy\n\nchoice when it determined the time had come, in the interest of\n\nsafety, to take the men off; (3) the Coast Guard acted within the\n\nbroad rescue powers specified by Congress in § 88; and (4) the\n\nCoast Guard was not guilty of violating rights applicable in more\n\nordinary circumstances (i.e. where the threat to life was less).\n\n          C.      The Coast Guard's Conduct Vis-a-vis the Private\n                  Salvor.\n\n          Plaintiffs' alternative argument is that evidence of\n\nCoast Guard alleged discouragement or interference with the efforts\n\nof Michael Goodridge, the commercial salvor, warrants a remand for\n\na determination of liability.      The government has never advanced\n\nany protected policy reasons, and we can think of none, to explain\n\nits conduct vis-a-vis the commercial salvor. Rather, to the extent\n\nthat   conscious    decisions   were     made,   rather   than   mistakes,\n\noversights, or misstatements, the decisions appear to be ordinary\n\nprofessional judgments. Accordingly, we turn to the issue of\n\nliability.\n\n          Plaintiffs suggest that the Coast Guard was negligent in\n\ndelaying the start of Goodridge's response, instructing Goodridge\n\n                                  -28-\n\fto stay off the radio, and suppressing effective communication with\n\nhim.    Plaintiffs also suggest that Captain Haggerty detrimentally\n\nrelied on the Coast Guard's assurance that it was working on\n\ngetting commercial assistance, and, as a result, did not make\n\nindependent radio calls of his own for such commercial assistance.\n\nAlthough we are unpersuaded by plaintiffs' arguments based on\n\nallegations of delay and reliance, we find sufficient evidence in\n\nthe record to create a factual issue on the question whether the\n\nCoast    Guard's        interference    with   the   commercial   salvor's\n\ncommunications prevented Goodridge from pursuing salvage efforts\n\nand using his diving capacity to find and plug the leak.

The Standards Applied.\n\n                        a.     The Reliance Argument.\n\n             The evidence of detrimental reliance is insufficient as\n\na matter of law to support a finding of Coast Guard liability, and,\n\nthus,   by   itself    would   not   warrant   a   remand.     In    his   sworn\n\ndeclaration, Captain Haggerty states that \"[b]ecause the Coast\n\nGuard had told me that they were working on arranging commercial\n\nassistance, I did not make any calls on the radio.\"                 However, he\n\ndoes not state exactly what the Coast Guard said or when.              See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(e) (requiring affidavits to set forth \"specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial\").\n\n\n\n                                     -33-\n\f              The   only   other    evidence     we    have    on    this    point   is\n\nHaggerty's     vague   deposition        testimony     that    he    \"asked   Station\n\nGloucester if there was anybody available, if there was any more\n\npumps\" and the response was \"[w]e're working on that.\"                      The Coast\n\nGuard's response, without more, falls short of a representation\n\nthat    the    Coast   Guard       was   working      on    obtaining       commercial\n\nassistance.12       We do not think that a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat    Haggerty    justifiably      relied     on    the    Coast   Guard's     vague\n\nresponse and reasonably refrained from making any efforts of his\n\nown to contact commercial assistance.\n\n                           b.   The Delay\n\n              Similarly, the evidence tending to suggest that the Coast\n\nGuard delayed Goodridge's departure by reason of its initial\n\nresponse discouraging his participation in the rescue operation is\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law to warrant a remand.                    Goodridge's\n\ninitial phone call to the Coast Guard was at 9:03 a.m.                   He was told\n\nthey were going \"to handle it.\"            But by 9:15 a.m., notwithstanding\n\nthat response, he was on the telephone to Cape Ann Divers to see\n\nwho might be available to assist him.                      In addition, some time\n\nduring that period, Goodridge took time to load his truck before\n\nnotifying the Coast Guard at 9:33 a.m. that he was on his way to\n\n\n       12\n       In fact, depending upon when the Coast Guard's statement was\nmade, a natural assumption is that it was talking about the Coast\nGuard cutter ADAK, which arrived late on the scene with additional\npumps.\n\n                                         -34-\n\fassist.     Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nplaintiffs, the delay was, at most, twelve minutes.       We do not\n\nthink a reasonable jury could find that this brief delay was\n\nmaterial.    Plaintiffs' expert opined that Goodridge's boat was in\n\na position to reach the NORTHERN VOYAGER on or about 10:50 a.m.\n\nEven if Goodridge had arrived at the vessel roughly twelve minutes\n\nearlier than expected, at 10:38 a.m., it would have been after the\n\nevacuation.    Indeed, by 10:38 a.m. the Coast Guard 47-footer was\n\nalready en route to Station Gloucester with the Northern Voyager\n\ncrew on board.13\n\n            We add, moreover, that we see nothing wrong in the Coast\n\nGuard's response at 9:03 a.m. that they were going \"to handle it.\"\n\nCaptain Haggerty had, in fact, called the Coast Guard; they were\n\nplanning to go to the NORTHERN VOYAGER's assistance; and at 9:03\n\na.m. the Coast Guard had yet to be informed as to many of the\n\n\n\n     13\n      Our dissenting colleague suggests that, in addition to a\ntwelve-minute delay of Goodridge's departure from Newburyport, the\nrecord supports a finding that the Coast Guard caused further delay\nonce Goodridge arrived at his boat at Cape Ann Marina by its\nindefinite response to his query as to whether additional pumps\nwere needed or just diving assistance. Appellants made no argument\nalong these lines, and we are not persuaded. The transcript of the\nradio communication indicates the Coast Guard responded reasonably\nto Goodridge's inquiry by saying \"we're not sure at this time.\"\nAlthough the dissent suggests this indefinite response caused\nGoodridge to spend unnecessary extra time loading pumps on board\nhis boat, we do not see how the Coast Guard can be faulted for its\nresponse, especially given record evidence that the Coast Guard's\nown pumps kept failing and the possibility that, even if diving\nassistance were successful, some additional pumping assistance\nmight be required.\n\n                                -35-\n\fdetails that might have indicated a need for Goodridge's additional\n\nassistance.\n\n               c.   Alleged    Interference   With/Failure   to\n                    Facilitate Communications Between Goodridge\n                    and the NORTHERN VOYAGER.\n\n\n          Plaintiffs   have   a   stronger   argument   of   Coast    Guard\n\ninterference with Goodridge's efforts based on Station Gloucester's\n\nmisstatement to Goodridge at 10:03 a.m. that it \"need[ed] to keep\n\nthis frequency clear.\"    See note 1, supra.        As noted, one who\n\nnegligently prevents or disables a third person from giving aid\n\nnecessary to prevent physical harm is subject to liability for that\n\nharm caused by the absence of the prevented aid.        See Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 327, supra p. 32.14      Here a fact-finder could\n\ndetermine that the Coast Guard's negative responses to Goodridge,\n\nafter assuming control itself of the rescue operation, prevented or\n\ndisabled Goodridge from giving aid that could have prevented the\n\nNORTHERN VOYAGER from sinking.\n\n          By 10:03 a.m., Coast Guard personnel had been told by the\n\ncaptain that the vessel \"might, ah, dropped the rudder.\"             And in\n\nhis 10:03 a.m. transmission to the Coast Guard, Goodridge indicated\n\n\n\n     14\n      Although § 327 is arguably, by its terms, limited to physical\nharm to a person, it applies to claims involving property damage\nthrough the operation of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 497 (\"The\nrules which determine negligence of conduct threatening harm to\nanother's interest in the physical condition of land and chattels\nare the same as those which determine the negligence of conduct\nwhich threatens bodily harm.\").\n\n                                  -36-\n\fboth that he was on his way and could offer diving assistance.\n\nDiving capability, given the character of the leak -- an open\n\nrudder tube allowing a pathway for the sea water to enter the ship\n\n-- could be found to have been just what the NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\nneeded.     The record contains expert testimony that such a leak\n\ncould be contained by a diver's inserting of objects like a life\n\npreserver or lobster buoy into the opening. Goodridge testified he\n\nhad the equipment and skill to have plugged the rudder leak in a\n\nmatter of minutes.    Yet the Coast Guard's only response was to tell\n\nGoodridge to clear the air waves.\n\n             In his deposition, Goodridge testified that the reason he\n\ndid not later seek to radio the master of the NORTHERN VOYAGER,\n\nafter the master had been evacuated to the Coast Guard's 47-footer,\n\nwas that \"he [had] been told twice to stay off the radio.\"             We\n\nthink there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact-finder to\n\nfind that the Coast Guard's rebuff at 10:03 a.m. discouraged\n\nGoodridge from further attempts to communicate with the Coast Guard\n\nor, directly, with the NORTHERN VOYAGER, as he motored to the\n\nscene.     Had he done so, plans might have developed that would have\n\nled   to    saving   the   vessel.      In   particular,   had   Goodridge\n\ncommunicated with Captain Haggerty, or even a knowledgeable Coast\n\nGuard officer involved in the rescue operation, advance plans could\n\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fhave been discussed for Goodridge to dive under the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER while it was still afloat.15\n\n             The Coast Guard's witness, Chief Warrant Officer Dittes,\n\nconceded that the information that Goodridge was coming was \"a\n\nsignificant piece of information\" and the sort \"they would normally\n\npass to the person that's in trouble.\"     Yet the Coast Guard did not\n\nadvise the NORTHERN VOYAGER that Goodridge was on the way, much\n\nless did it note the fact that Goodridge had a diving capability\n\nwhich might be put to good use.     Had Captain Haggerty been alerted\n\nthat Goodridge was coming, and had he then communicated by radio\n\nwith Goodridge, advance plans could have been laid for Goodridge to\n\ndive under the NORTHERN VOYAGER and plug the leak.            There is\n\nevidence from which to infer that even if Goodridge arrived shortly\n\nafter Haggerty had been removed from his sinking vessel, the dive\n\nmight have been consummated had Haggerty prepared for it before\n\nleaving the NORTHERN VOYAGER.      See note 15, supra.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n          In his affidavit, Captain Haggerty stated in pertinent part:\n\n             If Mr. Goodridge had been allowed to call me\n             on the radio or by cellphone, I could have\n             communicated with him and learned what he\n             needed.   If this had happened, I could have\n             and would have shut off those engines, rigged\n             a Jacobs ladder, and communicated this to him,\n             even if we were nevertheless to be forced off\n             the vessel thereafter.\n\nAff. of Captain Haggerty ¶ 8.\n\n                                  -38-\n\f             We do not suggest the Coast Guard had an independent duty\n\nof its own to provide a commercial diver.16         Even if it exercised\n\npoor judgment in not doing so, it would not be civilly liable\n\nunless its negligence worsened the situation over what it would\n\nhave been had the Coast Guard not come to the aid of the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER.     But its announcement to Goodridge that it was \"handling\"\n\nthe rescue operation and its later insistence when Goodridge called\n\nthat he keep the frequency clear, coupled with its failure to tell\n\nCaptain     Haggerty   about   Goodridge,   could   be   found   to   have\n\ndiscouraged Goodridge from further attempts to communicate and so\n\nto assist the NORTHERN VOYAGER.      The Coast Guard had a duty not to\n\nthrow roadblocks in the path of Goodridge's independent efforts to\n\nhelp.     A fact-finder might find that by announcing it was handling\n\nthe rescue, and then that it needed to keep the frequency clear,\n\nthe Coast Guard in effect declared exclusive control over rescue-\n\nrelated communications, leading Goodridge to forgo further efforts\n\neither to call the NORTHERN VOYAGER directly or to discuss salvage\n\noptions with Coast Guard officers handling the rescue.\n\n\n     16\n      The current version of the Coast Guard Addendum to the United\nStates National Search and Rescue Supplement provides that \"SMC's\n[i.e., Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator's] must remain\nfamiliar with all SAR assistance resources within the SMC's [area\nof responsibility] . . . and shall direct those resources that the\nSMC believes are needed to the scene of a vessel in distress.\"\nCoast Guard Addendum § 4.2.7.1.

Supp. at 1010.\n\n                                   -39-\n\f          The Coast Guard's comment about the need to keep the\n\nfrequency clear came at a critical time when the decision whether\n\nto evacuate was under consideration.            If Goodridge had not been\n\ndiscouraged   from    further   contact    at    this    time,    before    the\n\nevacuation, there is evidence suggesting the outcome could have\n\nbeen different.      Had Captain Haggerty spoken to Goodridge or even\n\nbeen told by the Coast Guard he was on the way with a diver, he\n\ncould have notified Goodridge that he wished his assistance.                 By\n\nitself, such an expression would likely have caused Goodridge to\n\nhave increased and prolonged his efforts to reach and assist the\n\nsinking   vessel.       Further,   communication        could    have    allowed\n\nGoodridge to arrange with Captain Haggerty to dive under the\n\nvessel.    Even if the Coast Guard still believed that safety\n\nconsiderations    required   Haggerty     to    leave    the    vessel    before\n\nGoodridge could reach it, the captain stated in his affidavit that\n\nhe could have taken steps to facilitate a dive before leaving by,\n\nfor example, making sure to shut off the engines (and to assure\n\nGoodridge of the fact), and rigging a Jacobs ladder in order to\n\nfacilitate a possible return to the vessel.             Thus, a fact-finder\n\ncould determine that even without Haggerty on board, a dive to plug\n\nthe leak could have been arranged.        Indeed, the record supports a\n\npossible inference that the first step, alone, would have been\n\nsufficient, and that if Goodridge had been engaged by Haggerty and\n\nhad then simply been assured that the main engines were turned off,\n\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fhe would have been willing to dive under the vessel and seek to\n\nplug the rudder tube, thereby checking the influx of water and\n\nquite possibly stabilizing the situation so as to permit further\n\nsalvage efforts that would have ultimately saved the vessel.\n\n            A    similar   argument    can   be   made    based    on    Station\n\nGloucester's unhelpful response to Goodridge on or about 10:47 a.m.\n\nwhen Goodridge contacted the station by radio hoping to get in\n\ntouch with the captain.        At this point, both Goodridge and the\n\ncaptain, who was by then on board the 47-foot Coast Guard vessel,\n\nwere roughly one mile from the sinking NORTHERN VOYAGER.                 Station\n\nGloucester first told Goodridge to call back by \"land line\" and,\n\nthen, when Goodridge called by cellular phone, told him that he\n\ncould speak to the captain back at the station.             Captain Haggerty\n\nwas not immediately informed of the call nor were efforts made to\n\nallow contact via the radio of the Coast Guard's vessel bearing\n\nHaggerty.       A fact-finder could reasonably infer that the Coast\n\nGuard's response to Goodridge had the effect of interfering with\n\nthe last opportunity to arrange for a dive.          The only way in which\n\nGoodridge could have contacted the captain meaningfully once he was\n\naboard the Coast Guard vessel would have been via the latter's\n\nradio.   At 10:47 a.m., with both Goodridge and the captain not far\n\nfrom the    scene,    it   remained   possible    that,   had     they   spoken,\n\nGoodridge might still have taken effective measures to dive and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fplug the leak.        Or, at least, the record suffices to raise a\n\nfactual issue on this point.\n\n           In sum, we think the evidence, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to appellants, was such that a reasonable fact-finder\n\ncould conclude that the Coast Guard had reason to know that a third\n\nparty was ready to give aid of a potentially useful type that the\n\nCoast Guard could not provide, and that it negligently engaged in\n\nactions that tended to prevent or disable such person from giving\n\nsuch aid. Further, we think that a fact-finder could conclude from\n\nsuch evidence, viewed most favorably, that this negligence was a\n\nproximate cause of the sinking of the NORTHERN VOYAGER.                Under the\n\ncircumstances, a remand for further proceedings is warranted.\n\n           It    is   true    that   under    the   Good   Samaritan   rule   the\n\nappellants have the burden of demonstrating that the Coast Guard\n\nincreased the risk of the NORTHERN VOYAGER's sinking over what it\n\nwould have been had there been no Coast Guard involvement at all.\n\nArguably, appellants have not established that, absent the Coast\n\nGuard's pumping assistance, the NORTHERN VOYAGER would have stayed\n\nafloat for a sufficient time to permit Goodridge to reach it and\n\neffectively plug the leak, (i.e., that the loss of the NORTHERN\n\nVOYAGER could have been prevented by the private salvor, acting\n\nalone,   had    the   Coast    Guard   not    become   involved).      However,\n\naccording to plaintiffs' experts, there are various things that\n\nCaptain Haggerty and his crew could have done to contain the\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fflooding temporarily and stabilize the situation, such as closing\n\ncertain doors and making them watertight. While there is little or\n\nno evidence in the record that the captain and his crew actually\n\ndid or thought of any of these things at the time of the emergency,\n\nthere was evidence to suggest that at least one of the doors was\n\nnot shut because of the presence of the hose of a Coast Guard pump.\n\nWhile the evidence is perhaps minimal that the ship would have\n\nsurvived until Goodridge could have saved it without help from the\n\nCoast Guard's pumps, we find it sufficient, viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to appellants, to establish a factual issue and\n\nwarrant a trial on the question of whether the Coast Guard worsened\n\nthe plight of the NORTHERN VOYAGER by its negative handling of\n\nGoodridge's attempts to become involved by radio.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm so much of the\n\ndistrict   court   opinion    as    concluded    that      the   Coast   Guard's\n\ndecision   to   forcibly    evacuate    the    crew   is    protected    by   the\n\ndiscretionary function exception but remand for further proceedings\n\non   plaintiffs'    claim    that      Coast    Guard      interference       with\n\ncommunications between the commercial salvor and NORTHERN VOYAGER\n\nresulted in the sinking of the ship.\n\n           Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     Opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part follows.\n\n                                    -43-\n\f</pre>",
