Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Boudin, Chief Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rafael A. Oliveras-López de Victoria for appellant.\n     Angel Castillo, Jr., with whom Lisa R. Askowitz, Larissa C.\nGarriga-Cesaní, and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP were on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 28, 2005\n\f            CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.      The estate of Antonio Rivera\n\nDiaz appeals from the district court order which dismissed its\n\nclaim   for    decedent’s   benefits,      pursuant    to   the   Employment\n\nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461, as\n\na sanction for disobeying a court order.         We affirm.\n\n                                      I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n            The decedent had been employed by American Airlines as a\n\nflight attendant, but retired in 1991 for health reasons. Diaz had\n\nbeen covered by an ERISA retirement plan (\"the Plan\").                American\n\nAirlines transmitted notification to Diaz that he had the right to\n\nfile for pension benefits under the Plan.        However, the notice was\n\naddressed to an invalid address, and was never received by Diaz.\n\nIn 1998, Diaz filed suit against the Plan in federal district\n\ncourt, demanding equitable relief as well as compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, and alleging that the Plan willfully failed to\n\naccord him the required notification of his rights under the Plan.\n\nThe district court dismissed the complaint, with prejudice, for\n\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies, also noting that only\n\nequitable relief is available under ERISA, thus Diaz could not\n\nrecover punitive damages.       On appeal, we affirmed regarding the\n\nunavailability of punitive damages, but noted that the dismissal\n\nshould be without prejudice to refiling the action after Diaz had\n\nexhausted     his   administrative   remedies.        Rivera   Diaz    v.   Am.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fAirlines, No. 99-2282, 2000 WL 1022888, at *1 n.3 (1st Cir. July\n\n25, 2000) (“Should plaintiffs later pursue a claim for punitive\n\ndamages, they may subject themselves to sanctions.”).\n\n            In due course, Diaz submitted an administrative claim\n\nwith the Plan.     Some five months passed with no response, and Diaz\n\nsubmitted a second suit in federal district court, once again\n\ndemanding punitive damages.       The second suit was dismissed with\n\nprejudice as well, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,\n\nand plaintiff’s counsel was ordered to remit $1500 as a sanction\n\nfor ignoring the court’s earlier admonition that ERISA does not\n\nprovide    for   punitive   damages.    Diaz    appealed   once   again.   We\n\naffirmed, but ordered a dismissal without prejudice, stating that\n\n“Counsel is, however, admonished to research the case law and take\n\nheed of what we said earlier (viz., in his first appeal)” regarding\n\nthe unavailability of punitive damages under ERISA.\n\n            Diaz died in June 2003.          In March 2004, before the Plan\n\nissued any decision on his administrative claim, the Diaz estate\n\nfiled a third complaint against the Plan, demanding, inter alia,\n\npunitive damages.      The Plan moved to dismiss the complaint for\n\nfailure to heed the courts’ admonitions against demanding punitive\n\ndamages.    The district court ordered plaintiffs to show cause why\n\nthe case should not be dismissed as a sanction.            Plaintiffs failed\n\nto file a timely response to the show-cause order.            In due course,\n\nthe district court dismissed the case, with prejudice, and imposed\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fan $1800 fine against plaintiffs’ counsel for a “flagrant[]”\n\nviolation of the repeated court orders stating that plaintiffs\n\ncould not recover punitive damages. Plaintiffs now appeal from the\n\ndismissal order.\n\n                                    II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Plaintiffs   insist     that   the   district   court   erred   in\n\ndismissing the complaint, given that (in plaintiffs’ view) the Plan\n\nunquestionably   violated   the    ERISA   disclosure     requirements    by\n\nwillfully mailing Diaz the notification of his pension rights to\n\nthe wrong address, unfairly withholding the pension benefits for\n\ntwelve years until Diaz’s death, and maliciously refusing, for four\n\nyears, to act on Diaz’s administrative complaint.             Given these\n\nextraordinary circumstances, plaintiffs contend, punitive damages\n\nare recoverable under ERISA.\n\n          Contrary to the thrust of the plaintiffs’ contentions on\n\nappeal, the district court did not dismiss the complaint on the\n\nmerits of the ERISA claim, but due to plaintiffs’ repeated failure\n\nto comply with a court order, which decision we review only for\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 62\n\n(1991) (stating that court may “dismiss an action or claim of a\n\nparty that fails to prosecute, to comply with the Federal Rules, or\n\nto obey an order of the court”) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b));\n\nTower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fCir. 2002). In order to thwart non-compliance with its orders, the\n\ncourt may choose among “a broad universe of possible sanctions,”\n\nincluding dismissal with prejudice.   Id.   Although dismissal, with\n\nprejudice, is the harshest of sanctions, its deployment may be\n\nappropriate, even absent consideration of lesser sanctions, where\n\nthe offending   party has engaged in “extreme conduct,” which by\n\ndefinition entails the knowing disobedience of a court order.    Id.\n\nSo drastic a remedy is justified due to the fact that            such\n\ndisobedience “robs [court orders] of their utility.” Id.        Given\n\nthese standards, the appellants are confronted with a “heavy\n\nburden”:   to demonstrate that the dismissal, with prejudice, for\n\ndisobedience of a court order constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\nId.\n\n           Not only have appellants failed to shoulder this heavy\n\nburden, they have not even attempted to do so.   The district court,\n\nas well as this court, warned plaintiffs of the dire consequences\n\nwere they to persist in their unwarranted demands for punitive\n\ndamages under ERISA.   See Buffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,\n\n426 F.3d 20, 31 n.15 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting well-settled law that\n\nERISA does not permit recovery of punitive damages). Nevertheless,\n\nplaintiffs simply ignored the courts’ admonitions.       They   also\n\nfailed to respond, in a timely manner, to the show-cause order, see\n\nGuex v. Allamerica Fin. Life Ins. & Annuity Co., 146 F.3d 40, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), nor do they offer, on appeal, any excuse for their\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fnoncompliance. Instead, they simply ignore their disobedience, and\n\nrequest that we address the merits of their complaint, insisting\n\nthat they should be entitled to prove punitive damages.                           After\n\nhaving warned plaintiffs repeatedly, see Serra-Lugo v. Consortium-\n\nLas Marias, 271 F.3d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that the district\n\ncourt warned of consequences for noncompliance, following which the\n\nparty repeatedly disobeyed court orders, and that “[c]ounsel who\n\nchoose   to    disregard     the     orders      of   the   district    court   place\n\nthemselves and their clients at risk”); HMG Prop. Investors, Inc.\n\nv. Parque Industrial Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 918 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (\"[T]he law is well established in this circuit that where a\n\nnoncompliant litigant has manifested a disregard for orders of the\n\ncourt and been suitably forewarned of the consequences of continued\n\nintransigence,     a   trial       judge    need      not   first   exhaust     milder\n\nsanctions before resorting to dismissal\"), the district court\n\ncannot have abused its discretion in directing dismissal as the\n\nmost   appropriate        sanction    for     the     plaintiffs’      repeated    and\n\nunexplained recalcitrance.\n\n              Affirmed.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span> (1991) (stating that court may \"dismiss an action or claim of a party that fails to prosecute, to comply with the Federal Rules, or to obey an order of the court\") (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b)); <i>Tower Ventures, Inc. v.

In order to thwart non-compliance with its orders, the court may choose among \"a broad universe of possible sanctions,\" including dismissal with prejudice. <i>Id.</i> Although dismissal, with prejudice, is the harshest of sanctions, its deployment may be appropriate, even absent consideration of lesser sanctions, where the offending party has engaged in \"extreme conduct,\" which by definition entails the knowing disobedience of a court order. <i>Id.</i> So drastic a remedy is justified due to the fact that such disobedience \"robs [court orders] of their utility.\" <i>Id.</i> Given these standards, the appellants are confronted with a \"heavy burden\": to demonstrate that the dismissal, with prejudice, for disobedience of a court order constituted an abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only have appellants failed to shoulder this heavy burden, they have not even attempted to do so. The district court, as well as this court, warned plaintiffs of the dire consequences were they to persist in their unwarranted demands for punitive damages under ERISA. <i>See Buffonge v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201856\"><a href=\"/opinion/201856/buffonge-v-prudential-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 31 n. 15 (1st Cir.2005) (noting well-settled law that ERISA does not permit recovery of punitive damages). Nevertheless, plaintiffs simply ignored the courts' admonitions. They also failed to respond, in a timely manner, to the show-cause order, <i>see Guex v. Allmerica Fin. Life Ins. &amp; Annuity Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755142\"><a href=\"/opinion/755142/christian-guex-v-allmerica-financial-life-insurance-and-annuity-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1998), nor do they offer, on appeal, any excuse for their noncompliance. Instead, they simply ignore their disobedience, and request that we address the merits of their complaint, insisting that they should be entitled to prove punitive damages. After having warned plaintiffs repeatedly, <i>see Serra-Lugo v. Consortium-Las Marias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199656\"><a href=\"/opinion/199656/serra-lugo-v-mayaguez-consortium/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that the district court warned of consequences for noncompliance, following which the party repeatedly disobeyed court orders, and that \"[c]ounsel who choose to disregard the orders of the district court place themselves and their clients at risk\"); <i>HMG Prop.
