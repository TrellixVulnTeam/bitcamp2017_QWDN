Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     William G. Billingham, with whom Billingham & Marzelli were on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Kevin P. McRoy, with whom Thomas E. Pontes and Wynn & Wynn,\nP.C. were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 28, 2003\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.      In this bankruptcy appeal arising\n\nfrom a Chapter 7 proceeding, we are asked to determine whether two\n\nMassachusetts homestead exemptions can be \"stacked\" to permit a\n\ndouble exemption for a debtor who claims on the basis of such\n\nstacking that a judicial lien impairs the value of his exemption.\n\nCitizens Bank    of   Massachusetts      holds   a   judicial   lien   on   the\n\nproperty owned by David Garran, the debtor in this petition, and\n\nhis wife.    At issue is whether David Garran is entitled to claim\n\nboth his $300,000 exemption as a disabled person, pursuant to Mass.\n\nGen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, § 1A (West Supp. 2003), and the $300,000\n\nexemption of his non-debtor spouse, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn. ch. 188, § 1 (West Supp. 2003).             If Garran can \"stack\" the\n\nexemptions and claim, in total, the $600,000 homestead exemption,\n\nhe will be able to avoid entirely Citizens' judicial lien on the\n\nproperty.     Applying   the   plain     language    of   the   Massachusetts\n\nstatutes, we affirm the decision of the district court affirming\n\nthe bankruptcy court's denial of Garran's motion to avoid the\n\njudicial lien.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            The material facts of this case are undisputed.             David\n\nGarran owns a single-family home in Hingham, Massachusetts, in\n\nPlymouth County, as a tenant by the entirety1 with his wife,\n\n\n     1\n       A tenancy by the entirety is a \"joint tenancy that arises\nbetween husband and wife when a single instrument conveys realty to\nboth of them but nothing is said in the deed or will about the\n\n                                    -2-\n\fJudith.    In February 1996, David Garran executed and delivered a\n\npromissory note for $50,000 to the United States Trust Company.\n\nThree years later, Garran executed another promissory note to the\n\nUnited States Trust Company in the amount of $5,000. Citizens Bank\n\nof Massachusetts (\"Citizens\") is the successor in interest to the\n\nnotes.\n\n            In August 2000, Citizens commenced an action against\n\nDavid Garran in the Superior Court of Massachusetts subsequent to\n\nGarran's default under the two promissory notes.       Citizens also\n\nobtained a writ of attachment against the Hingham property on\n\nAugust 18, 2000, and perfected that writ on August 29, 2000, by\n\nrecording it in the Plymouth County Registry of Deeds.     After the\n\ncourt entered judgment in favor of Citizens on the promissory\n\nnotes, Citizens recorded the execution on the Hingham property in\n\nthe amount of $59,697.50.2    On August 9, 2000, Garran recorded a\n\ndeclaration of homestead on the Hingham property as a disabled\n\nperson pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1A.      Judith Garran3\n\nlater recorded a declaration of homestead on the same property\n\npursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1.\n\n\ncharacter of their ownership.\"    Black's Law Dictionary 1477 (7th\ned. 1999).\n     2\n       The judgment included the $55,000 value of the promissory\nnotes plus interest. On April 2, 2001, the date Garran filed for\nbankruptcy, the value of Citizens' lien on the property was\n$62,739.79.\n     3\n         Judith Garran is not a debtor in this case.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            On April 2, 2001, Garran filed a Chapter 7 petition for\n\nbankruptcy.      In Schedule A (Real Property) of his petition, he\n\nlisted the Hingham property as having a value of $560,000.                     In\n\nSchedule    C    (Property   Claimed     as    Exempt),    Garran   listed    two\n\nhomestead exemptions under Massachusetts state law -- his § 1A\n\nexemption for $300,000 and his wife's § 1 exemption for $300,000 --\n\nthereby seeking a total exemption of $600,000 on the Hingham\n\nproperty.\n\n             Citizens filed an Objection to the Debtor's Claim of\n\nExemption, arguing that Garran could claim only one of the state\n\nlaw homestead exemptions.          Garran filed a motion under 11 U.S.C. §\n\n522(f) (2003) seeking to avoid Citizens' judicial lien, claiming\n\nthat it impaired his exemption in property.               Citizens objected to\n\nthe motion.      The bankruptcy court ruled that Garran could claim\n\nonly the later filed homestead exemption of his wife, thereby\n\nlimiting him to a $300,000 homestead exemption.              In re Garran, No.\n\n01-12676-JNF, slip op. at 10 (Bankr. D. Mass. Mar. 15, 2002).\n\nConcluding      that   Citizens'    judicial    lien   did   not    impair   this\n\n$300,000 exemption, the court denied Garran's motion to avoid the\n\nlien.   Id. at 12.      On appeal, the district court affirmed.          Garran\n\nv. Citizens Bank of Mass. (In re Garran), No. 02-10833-EFH, slip.\n\nop. at 3 (D. Mass. July 10, 2002).            Garran now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                                          II.\n\n            We review the decision of the bankruptcy court directly,\n\naffording de novo review to the court's resolution of the legal\n\nquestion presented.         Rutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis), 313 F.3d 9,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            A debtor is permitted to exempt a limited amount of\n\ncertain property from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 522(b) (2003) to protect those types of assets from creditors.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy petition, a debtor must file a list of\n\nproperty claimed as exempt.            11 U.S.C. § 522(l); Bank. R. 4003(a).\n\nIn   Massachusetts,        a    debtor    can    choose      between   the    federal\n\nexemptions -- those listed in § 522(d) -- or the exemptions\n\nenumerated in state law.            Patriot Portfolio v. Weinstein (In re\n\nWeinstein),    164       F.3d   677,     679   (1st   Cir.    1999);   see     also   §\n\n522(b)(2)(A) (permitting a debtor to select either federal or state\n\nexemptions).    Garran chose the state exemptions.\n\n            Along with exemptions for certain types of personal\n\nproperty,     Massachusetts        law     has    established       two      homestead\n\nexemptions.    Under § 1 of the Homestead Act, any owner of a home\n\nmay acquire \"[a]n estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in\n\nthe land and buildings.\"               Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, § 1.\n\nEntitlement    to    a    homestead      exemption    is     not   automatic     under\n\nMassachusetts law.         An owner of property must file the necessary\n\ndeclaration of homestead before the exemption can be claimed.                      Id.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f§ 2. Garran's wife filed the necessary declaration of homestead as\n\nan owner of the Hingham property.          Only one member of a family is\n\npermitted to file a declaration under § 1, and the filing of any\n\nmember of a family protects the entire family.          Id. § 1.\n\n           The other type of homestead exemption is available only\n\nto the elderly and disabled.          According to § 1A, \"[t]he real\n\nproperty or manufactured home of . . . a disabled person, as herein\n\ndefined,   shall    be   protected   against     attachment,   seizure   or\n\nexecution of judgment to the extent of $300,000.\" Garran filed the\n\nnecessary declaration of homestead under § 1A.          A declaration of\n\nhomestead under this section is available only to individuals; a\n\ndeclaration filed by one member of a family will not protect the\n\nnon-filing members of that family.           The parties do not dispute\n\nGarran's disability status.\n\n           Once property is exempted under § 522(b), it is immunized\n\nfrom creditors while the outstanding debts are being discharged in\n\nbankruptcy. See Owen v. Owen, 500 U.S. 305, 308 (1991) (explaining\n\nthe concept of exemptions).     A bankruptcy discharge, though, voids\n\nonly those judgments \"to the extent that such judgment is a\n\ndetermination of the personal liability of the debtor.\"            11 U.S.C.\n\n§ 524(a)(1).       Since a judicial lien attached to property is a\n\nliability in rem, it is not routinely discharged at the conclusion\n\nof the bankruptcy case.      Wrenn v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co. (In re\n\nWrenn), 40 F.3d 1162, 1164 (11th Cir. 1994).            However, because\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fjudicial liens may interfere with the \"fresh start\" the Bankruptcy\n\nCode seeks to give debtors, such liens may be avoidable under a\n\nseparate provision of the Bankruptcy Code, § 522(f).\n\n          That provision permits a debtor to avoid a judicial lien\n\nto the extent it \"impairs an exemption to which the debtor would\n\nhave been entitled.\"     11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1).   Pursuant to this\n\nsection, the debtor can avoid a particular judicial lien if, in\n\norder to satisfy it, he would have to use assets he is otherwise\n\nentitled to set aside from the bankruptcy estate as exemptions.\n\nSection 522(f)(2) establishes a formula for determining whether a\n\nlien impairs an exemption:\n\n          [A] lien shall be considered to impair an\n          exemption to the extent that the sum of --\n                 (i) the lien;\n                 (ii) all other liens on the property;\n                 and\n                 (iii) the amount of the exemption that\n                 the debtor could claim if there were no\n                 liens on the property;\n          exceeds the value that the debtor's interest\n          in the property would have in the absence of\n          any liens.\n\nId. § 522(f)(2)(A).      See Snyder v. Rockland Trust Co. (In re\n\nSnyder), 279 B.R. 1, 4 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2002).         Avoidance of\n\njudicial liens under § 522(f) is not an \"all-or-nothing matter\"; a\n\ndebtor is permitted to avoid only that portion of the judicial lien\n\nthat infringes upon the exemption to which he is entitled.     East\n\nCambridge Savings Bank v. Silveira (In re Silveira), 141 F.3d 34,\n\n35-36 (1st Cir. 1998).    If the judicial lien does not impair the\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fexemption -- if the value of the property is greater than the sum\n\nof the liens attached to it and the exemption -- then the debtor\n\ncannot avoid the lien and it will remain attached to the property.\n\n          Garran filed a motion to avoid Citizens' judicial lien on\n\nthe Hingham property in its entirety on the ground that it impaired\n\nthe homestead exemptions to which he was entitled.   At the time the\n\nmotion was filed, Citizens' lien on the property (component (i) of\n\nthe formula) was valued at $62,739.79.     In addition to this lien,\n\nthere were two mortgages on the property with a combined value of\n\n$194,857.91 (component (ii) of the formula). In order to determine\n\nwhether the sum of the liens and the exemptions exceeds the value\n\nof the property, we must determine \"the amount of the exemption\n\nthat the debtor could claim.\"    § 522(f)(2)(A)(iii).   This is the\n\nsingle issue of dispute in this appeal.4\n\n                                III.\n\n          As the Massachusetts courts have not yet addressed the\n\ninterplay between a § 1 exemption declared by a non-debtor spouse\n\nand a § 1A exemption declared by a debtor, we must predict how the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would interpret the statute.\n\nCaron v. Farmington Nat'l Bank (In re Caron), 82 F.3d 7, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).   Because homestead laws are \"designed to benefit the\n\n\n\n     4\n       Whether Garran is entitled to a $600,000 or a $300,000\nexemption will determine whether Citizens' lien is avoided entirely\nor not at all. The table in the Appendix outlines the differing\ncalculations the parties propose under § 522(f)(2)(A).\n\n                                -8-\n\fhomestead declarant and his or her family by protecting the family\n\nresidence from the claims of creditors,\" Massachusetts courts have\n\n\"construed the State homestead exemptions liberally in favor of\n\ndebtors.\"    Shamban v. Masidlover, 705 N.E.2d 1136, 1138 (Mass.\n\n1999).   Nevertheless, liberal construction does not mean that\n\ncourts can extend the protection of the homestead exemptions when\n\ndoing so would contradict the \"plain and unambiguous\" language of\n\nthe statute.     See id. at 1139 (finding the debtor's homestead\n\ndeclaration invalid for failure to file the proper documentation as\n\nthe statute explicitly required).      Consequently, we must turn to\n\nthe words of the statute in question.\n\n            Section 1 states, in pertinent part:\n\n            An estate of homestead to the extent of\n            $300,000 in the land and buildings may be\n            acquired pursuant to this chapter by an owner\n            or owners of a home or one or all who\n            rightfully possess the premise by lease or\n            otherwise and who occupy or intend to occupy\n            said home as a principal residence. . . .\n\n            . . . .\n\n            For the purposes of this chapter, an owner of\n            a home shall include a sole owner, joint\n            tenant, tenant by the entirety or tenant in\n            common; provided, that only one owner may\n            acquire an estate of homestead in any such\n            home for the benefit of his family. . . .\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, § 1.     Section 1A states, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n            The real property or manufactured home . . .\n            of a disabled person, as herein defined, shall\n            be protected against attachment, seizure or\n\n                                 -9-\n\f               execution of judgment to the extent of\n               $300,000; provided, however, that such person\n               has filed [a] . . . disabled person's\n               declaration of homestead protection . . . .\n\n               Each individual having an ownership interest\n               in the real property or manufactured home\n               which serves as that individual's principal\n               residence   and   who  qualifies   under   the\n               provisions of this section shall, upon filing\n               of an elderly or disabled person's declaration\n               of homestead protection, be eligible for\n               protection of such ownership interest up to a\n               maximum amount of $300,000 per individual,\n               regardless of whether such declaration is\n               filed individually or jointly with another.\n\n               . . . .\n\n               The . . . disabled person's estate or claim of\n               homestead shall be terminated . . . pursuant\n               to section two.\n\nId.   §   1A    (emphasis   added).     Regarding   the   acquisition   and\n\ntermination of homesteads, the pertinent part of section two\n\nstates:\n\n               To acquire an estate of homestead in real\n               property, the fact that it is designed to be\n               held as such shall be set forth in the deed of\n               conveyance by which the property is acquired;\n               or, after the title has been acquired, such\n               design may be declared by a writing duly\n               signed, sealed and acknowledged and recorded\n               in the registry of deeds for the county or\n               district in which the property is situated. .\n               . . The acquisition of a new estate or claim\n               of homestead shall defeat and discharge any\n               such previous estate.\n\nId. § 2 (emphasis added).\n\n               Citizens argued before the bankruptcy court that § 2\n\nensures that no individual can claim more than one homestead\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fexemption by stating that the acquisition of a new claim of\n\nhomestead    defeats        and    discharges      a   previously-filed       claim   of\n\nhomestead.    The court agreed with Citizens, holding that the plain\n\nlanguage     of    §    2   meant    that       Garran's   §    1A     declaration    and\n\ncorresponding homestead exemption was defeated and discharged by\n\nhis wife's subsequent § 1 declaration.                  We agree that this is the\n\nproper reading of the statutory language.\n\n             Garran's wife filed a declaration of homestead under § 1\n\non February 21, 2001.          The declaration of homestead under § 1 is an\n\nacquisition of a homestead \"for the benefit of [the] family.\"                         Id.\n\n§ 1. Therefore, by his wife's filing of a § 1 declaration, Garran,\n\nas her spouse and member of her family, \"acquired\" a homestead on\n\nFebruary 21, 2001.          See In re Roberts, 280 B.R. 540, 547 (Bankr. D.\n\nMass. 2001) (recognizing that a \"declaration filed under subsection\n\n1 protects even the non-filing debtor\").                       Section 2 states that\n\n\"the acquisition of a new . . . claim of homestead\" discharges any\n\nsuch previous estate.              Therefore, Garran's acquisition of a new\n\nhomestead on February 21, 2001, through his wife's filing, defeated\n\nhis prior declaration of homestead filed pursuant to § 1A on August\n\n9,   2000.        The   fact      that   the    homesteads      were    acquired   under\n\ndifferent sections is irrelevant, as § 1A states explicitly that a\n\nhomestead    declared        under       that    section   \"shall      be   terminated\"\n\npursuant to § 2, the same provision that governs the acquisition\n\nand discharge of § 1 homesteads.                 Even though the language of § 2\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fexisted prior to the enactment of § 1A, the specific invocation of\n\n§ 2 in the text of § 1A indicates that the drafters were aware of\n\nthe existing termination procedures and intended them to apply to\n\nthe newly amended portions of the statute.\n\n            Garran suggests that § 2 does not apply when a new\n\ndeclaration of homestead is filed on the same property -- that an\n\n\"acquisition of a new estate or claim of homestead\" means a \"new\n\nestate or claim of homestead on a new home or piece of property.\"\n\nCertainly    §    2   would   have   the   effect      of   discharging    a   prior\n\ndeclaration of homestead on an old home when a Massachusetts\n\nresident purchases a new home and files a new declaration of\n\nhomestead.       But there is nothing in the statute that limits § 2 to\n\na new home purchase situation.             Given that Judith Garran had not\n\npreviously declared a homestead on the Hingham property, her filing\n\nunder § 1 was a new \"claim of homestead\" under § 1, just as it\n\nwould have been if she had purchased a new home.\n\n             Alternatively, Garran argues that the statutes must be\n\ninterpreted as permitting a disabled person to stack the § 1 and 1A\n\nexemptions because the purpose of enacting § 1A was to provide\n\nadditional protection in bankruptcy to those who qualify for a § 1A\n\nexemption.       But at the time of the enactment of the amendment, § 1A\n\ndid provide an extra benefit to disabled debtors.                    Prior to the\n\n2000 amendments to the homestead statutes, §§ 1 and 1A provided\n\ndifferent    levels     of    exemptions    --   the    §   1   general   homestead\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fexemption provided protection only up to $100,000 while the § 1A\n\nexemption provided a $200,000 exemption.       Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch.\n\n188, §§ 1, 1A (West 1991).    The amendments in 2000 both raised the\n\nmonetary value and equalized the §§ 1 and 1A exemptions. Moreover,\n\n§ 1A still provides protections unavailable under § 1.           Under § 1A,\n\na debtor retains his homestead exemption even given a judgment\n\nagainst him based on fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence or\n\nlack of capacity, while under § 1 the debtor does not.           Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 188, § 1 (West Supp. 2003).             Rejecting Garran's\n\nproffered interpretation of the homestead statutes -- by holding\n\nthat disabled debtors do not have the right to \"stack\" their § 1A\n\nexemptions onto their § 1 exemptions -- does not eliminate the\n\nvalue of the § 1A enactment.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n            Having predicted that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt would conclude that the plain language of the Massachusetts\n\nhomestead    statutes   prohibits    the   stacking   of   the    exemption\n\navailable to disabled debtors on top of the exemption available to\n\nall other residents of Massachusetts, and that Garran is entitled\n\nonly to a maximum of $300,000 provided by his non-debtor spouse's\n\ndeclaration of homestead under § 1, we now must return to the\n\nformula laid out in 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(2)(A) to determine whether\n\nCitizens' lien impairs Garran's homestead exemption of $300,000.\n\nThe sum total of Citizens' lien at the time of the bankruptcy\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fpetition ($62,739.79), the other liens on the property at the time\n\nof the bankruptcy petition ($194,857.91) and Garran's homestead\n\nexemption ($300,000.00) is $557,597.70.   This total is less than\n\nthe value of the Garrans' property at the time of the bankruptcy\n\npetition ($560,000.00).   The Citizens' lien therefore does not\n\nimpair Garran's homestead exemption because Garran can both satisfy\n\nthe liens on the property and still retain the $300,000 homestead\n\nexemption to which he is entitled under Massachusetts law. Because\n\nthe Citizens' lien does not impair Garran's exemption, it cannot be\n\navoided under § 522(f).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f                                  Appendix\n\n            This table sets forth the differing calculations the\n\nparties propose under 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(2)(A):\n\n                           Garran's Theory         Citizens' Theory\n\nCitizens' lien             62,739.79               62,739.79\n(undisputed)\n\nOther liens (undisputed)   194,857.91              194,857.91\n\nExemption                  600,000.00              300,000.00\n\nSum of 522(f)(2)(A)(i)-    857,597.70              557,597.70\n(iii)\n\nValue of property          560,000.00              560,000.00\n(undisputed)\n\nExemption impaired?

Citizens Bank of Massachusetts holds a judicial lien on the property owned by David Garran, the debtor in this petition, and his wife. At issue is whether David Garran is entitled to claim both his $300,000 exemption as a disabled person, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1A (West Supp.2003), and the $300,000 exemption of his non-debtor spouse, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1 (West Supp.2003). If Garran can \"stack\" the exemptions and claim, in total, the $600,000 homestead exemption, he will be able to avoid entirely Citizens' judicial lien on the property. Applying the plain language of the Massachusetts statutes, we affirm the decision of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court's denial of Garran's motion to avoid the judicial lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts of this case are undisputed. David Garran owns a single-family home in Hingham, Massachusetts, in Plymouth County, as a tenant by the entirety<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with his wife, Judith. In February 1996, David Garran executed and delivered a promissory note for $50,000 to the United States Trust Company. Three years later, Garran executed another promissory note to the United States Trust Company in the amount of $5,000. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts (\"Citizens\") is the successor in interest to the notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Citizens commenced an action against David Garran in the Superior Court of Massachusetts subsequent to Garran's default under the two promissory notes. Citizens also obtained a writ of attachment against the Hingham property on August 18, 2000, and perfected that writ on August 29, 2000, by recording it in the Plymouth County Registry of Deeds. After the court entered judgment in favor of Citizens on the promissory notes, Citizens recorded the execution on the Hingham property in the amount of $59,697.50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On August 9, 2000, Garran recorded a declaration of homestead on the Hingham property as a disabled person pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, &#167; 1A. Judith Garran<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> later recorded a declaration of homestead on the same property pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, &#167; 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, Garran filed a Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy. In Schedule A (Real Property) of his petition, he listed the Hingham property as having a value of $560,000. In Schedule C (Property Claimed as Exempt), Garran listed two homestead exemptions under Massachusetts state law &#8212; his &#167; 1A exemption for $300,000 and his wife's &#167; 1 exemption for $300,000 &#8212; thereby seeking a total exemption of $600,000 on the Hingham property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizens filed an Objection to the Debtor's Claim of Exemption, arguing that Garran could claim only one of the state law homestead exemptions. Garran filed a motion under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f) (2003) seeking to avoid Citizens' judicial lien, claiming that it impaired his exemption in property. Citizens objected to the motion. The bankruptcy court ruled that Garran could claim only the later filed homestead exemption of his wife, thereby limiting him to a $300,000 homestead exemption. <i>In re Garran,</i> 274 B.R. 570, 575 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass. 2002). Concluding that Citizens' judicial lien did not impair this $300,000 exemption, the court denied Garran's motion to avoid the lien. <i>Id.</i> at 576. On appeal, the district court affirmed. <i>Garran v. Citizens Bank of Mass. (In re Garran),</i> 280 B.R. 292, 293-94 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass.2002). Garran now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the decision of the bankruptcy court directly, affording de novo review to the court's resolution of the legal question presented. <i>Rutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis),</i> 313 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A debtor is permitted to exempt a limited amount of certain property from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(b) (2003) to protect those types of assets from creditors. As part of the bankruptcy petition, a debtor must file a list of property claimed as exempt. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(<i>l</i>); Bank. R. 4003(a). In Massachusetts, a debtor can choose between the federal exemptions &#8212; those listed in &#167; 522(d) &#8212; or the exemptions enumerated in state law. <i>Patriot Portfolio v. Weinstein (In re Weinstein),</i> 164 F.3d 677, 679 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also</i> &#167; 522(b)(2)(A) (permitting a debtor to select either federal or state exemptions). Garran chose the state exemptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with exemptions for certain types of personal property, Massachusetts law has established two homestead exemptions. Under &#167; 1 of the Homestead Act, any owner of a home may acquire \"[a]n estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in the land and buildings.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1. Entitlement to a homestead exemption is not automatic under Massachusetts law. An owner of property must file the necessary declaration of homestead before the exemption can be claimed. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2. Garran's wife filed the necessary declaration of homestead as an owner of the Hingham property. Only one member of a family is permitted to file a declaration under &#167; 1, and the filing of any member of a family protects the entire family. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other type of homestead exemption is available only to the elderly and disabled. According to &#167; 1A, \"[t]he real property or manufactured home of ... a disabled person, as herein defined, shall be protected against attachment, seizure or execution of judgment to the extent of $300,000.\" Garran filed the necessary declaration of homestead under &#167; 1A. A declaration of homestead under this section is available only to individuals; a declaration filed by one member of a family will not protect the non-filing members of that family. The parties do not dispute Garran's disability status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once property is exempted under &#167; 522(b), it is immunized from creditors while the outstanding debts are being discharged in bankruptcy. <i>See Owen v. Owen,</i> 500 U.S. 305, 308, 111 S.Ct. 1833, 114 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991) (explaining the concept of exemptions). A bankruptcy discharge, though, voids only those judgments \"to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a)(1). Since a judicial lien attached to property is a liability <i>in rem,</i> it is not routinely discharged at the conclusion of the bankruptcy case. <i>Wrenn v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co. (In re Wrenn),</i> 40 F.3d 1162, 1164 (11th Cir.1994). However, because judicial liens may interfere with the \"fresh start\" the Bankruptcy Code seeks to give debtors, such liens may be avoidable under a separate provision of the Bankruptcy Code, &#167; 522(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That provision permits a debtor to avoid a judicial lien to the extent it \"impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(1). Pursuant to this section, the debtor can avoid a particular judicial lien if, in order to satisfy it, he would have to use assets he is otherwise entitled to set aside from the bankruptcy estate as exemptions. Section 522(f)(2) establishes a formula for determining whether a lien impairs an exemption:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A] lien shall be considered to impair an exemption to the extent that the sum of &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) the lien;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) all other liens on the property; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim if there were no liens on the property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">exceeds the value that the debtor's interest in the property would have in the absence of any liens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 522(f)(2)(A). <i>See Snyder v. Rockland Trust Co. (In re Snyder),</i> 279 B.R. 1, 4 (1st Cir. BAP 2002). Avoidance of judicial liens under &#167; 522(f) is not an \"all-or-nothing matter\"; a debtor is permitted to avoid only that portion of the judicial lien that infringes upon the exemption to which he is entitled. <i>East Cambridge Savings Bank v. Silveira (In re Silveira),</i> 141 F.3d 34, 35-36 (1st Cir.1998). If the judicial lien does not impair the exemption &#8212; if the value of the property is greater than the sum of the liens attached to it and the exemption &#8212; then the debtor cannot avoid the lien and it will remain attached to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garran filed a motion to avoid Citizens' judicial lien on the Hingham property in its entirety on the ground that it impaired the homestead exemptions to which he was entitled. At the time the motion was filed, Citizens' lien on the property (component (i) of the formula) was valued at $62,739.79. In addition to this lien, there were two mortgages on the property with a combined value of $194,857.91 (component (ii) of the formula). In order to determine whether the sum of the liens and the exemptions exceeds the value of the property, we must determine \"the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim.\" &#167; 522(f)(2)(A)(iii). This is the single issue of dispute in this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Massachusetts courts have not yet addressed the interplay between a &#167; 1 exemption declared by a non-debtor spouse and a &#167; 1A exemption declared by a debtor, we must predict how the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would interpret the statute. <i>Caron v. Farmington Nat'l Bank (In re Caron),</i> 82 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1996). Because homestead laws are \"designed to benefit the homestead declarant and his or her family by protecting the family residence from the claims of creditors,\" Massachusetts courts have \"construed the State homestead exemptions liberally in favor of debtors.\" <i>Shamban v. Masidlover,</i> 429 Mass. 50, 705 N.E.2d 1136, 1138 (1999). Nevertheless, liberal construction does not mean that courts can extend the protection of the homestead exemptions when doing so would contradict the \"plain and unambiguous\" language of the statute. <i>See id.</i> at 1139 (finding the debtor's homestead declaration invalid for failure to file the proper documentation as the statute explicitly required). Consequently, we must turn to the words of the statute in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 1 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in the land and buildings may be acquired pursuant to this chapter by an owner or owners of a home or one or all who rightfully possess the premise by lease or otherwise and who occupy or intend to occupy said home as a principal residence....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this chapter, an owner of a home shall include a sole owner, joint tenant, tenant by the entirety or tenant in common; provided, that only one owner may acquire an estate of homestead in any such home for the benefit of his family....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

Therefore, by his wife's filing of a &#167; 1 declaration, Garran, as her spouse and member of her family, \"acquired\" a homestead on February 21, 2001. <i>See In re Roberts,</i> 280 B.R. 540, 547 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2001) (recognizing that a \"declaration filed under subsection 1 protects even the non-filing debtor\"). Section 2 states that \"the acquisition of a new ... claim of homestead\" discharges any such previous estate. Therefore, Garran's acquisition of a new homestead on February 21, 2001, through his wife's filing, defeated his prior declaration of homestead filed pursuant to &#167; 1A on August 9, 2000. The fact that the homesteads were acquired under different sections is irrelevant, as &#167; 1A states explicitly that a homestead declared under that section \"shall be terminated\" pursuant to &#167; 2, the same provision that governs the acquisition and discharge of &#167; 1 homesteads. Even though the language of &#167; 2 existed prior to the enactment of &#167; 1A, the specific invocation of &#167; 2 in the text of &#167; 1A indicates that the drafters were aware of the existing termination procedures and intended them to apply to the newly amended portions of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garran suggests that &#167; 2 does not apply when a new declaration of homestead is filed on the same property &#8212; that an \"acquisition of a new estate or claim of homestead\" means a \"new estate or claim of homestead on a new home or piece of property.\" Certainly &#167; 2 would have the effect of discharging a prior declaration of homestead on an old home when a Massachusetts resident purchases a new home and files a new declaration of homestead. But there is nothing in the statute that limits &#167; 2 to a new home purchase situation. Given that Judith Garran had not previously declared a homestead on the Hingham property, her filing under &#167; 1 was a new \"claim of homestead\" under &#167; 1, just as it would have been if she had purchased a new home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Garran argues that the statutes must be interpreted as permitting a disabled person to stack the &#167; 1 and 1A exemptions because the purpose of enacting &#167; 1A was to provide additional protection in bankruptcy to those who qualify for a &#167; 1A exemption. But at the time of the enactment of the amendment, &#167; 1A did provide an extra benefit to disabled debtors. Prior to the 2000 amendments to the homestead statutes, &#167;&#167; 1 and 1A provided different levels of exemptions &#8212; the &#167; 1 general homestead exemption provided protection only up to $100,000 while the &#167; 1A exemption provided a $200,000 exemption. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167;&#167; 1, 1A (West 1991). The amendments in 2000 both raised the monetary value and equalized the &#167;&#167; 1 and 1A exemptions. Moreover, &#167; 1A still provides protections unavailable under &#167; 1. Under &#167; 1A, a debtor retains his homestead exemption even given a judgment against him based on fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence or lack of capacity, while under &#167; 1 the debtor does not. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1 (West Supp.2003). Rejecting Garran's proffered interpretation of the homestead statutes &#8212; by holding that disabled debtors do not have the right to \"stack\" their &#167; 1A exemptions onto their &#167; 1 exemptions &#8212; does not eliminate the value of the &#167; 1A enactment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having predicted that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would conclude that the plain language of the Massachusetts homestead statutes prohibits the stacking of the exemption available to disabled debtors on top of the exemption available to all other residents of Massachusetts, and that Garran is entitled only to a maximum of $300,000 provided by his non-debtor spouse's declaration of homestead under &#167; 1, we now must return to the formula laid out in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(2)(A) to determine whether Citizens' lien impairs Garran's homestead exemption of $300,000. The sum total of Citizens' lien at the time of the bankruptcy petition ($62,739.79), the other liens on the property at the time of the bankruptcy petition ($194,857.91) and Garran's homestead exemption ($300,000.00) is $557,597.70. This total is less than the value of the Garrans' property at the time of the bankruptcy petition ($560,000.00). The Citizens' lien therefore does not impair Garran's homestead exemption because Garran can both satisfy the liens on the property and still retain the $300,000 homestead exemption to which he is entitled under Massachusetts law. Because the Citizens' lien does not impair Garran's exemption, it cannot be avoided under &#167; 522(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Appendix</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This table sets forth the differing calculations the parties propose under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(2)(A):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <pre>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Garran's Theory              Citizens' Theory\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCitizens' lien                     62,739.79                    62,739.79\n(undisputed)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther liens (undisputed)          194,857.91                   194,857.91\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExemption                         600,000.00                   300,000.00\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSum of 522(f)(2)(A)(1)-(111)      857,597.70                   557,597.70\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValue of property                 560,000.00                   560,000.00\n(undisputed)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExemption impaired?

Citizens Bank of Massachusetts holds a judicial lien on the property owned by David Garran, the debtor in this petition, and his wife. At issue is whether David Garran is entitled to claim both his $300,000 exemption as a disabled person, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1A (West Supp.2003), and the $300,000 exemption of his non-debtor spouse, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1 (West Supp.2003). If Garran can \"stack\" the exemptions and claim, in total, the $600,000 homestead exemption, he will be able to avoid entirely Citizens' judicial lien on the property. Applying the plain language of the Massachusetts statutes, we affirm the decision of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court's denial of Garran's motion to avoid the judicial lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts of this case are undisputed. David Garran owns a single-family home in Hingham, Massachusetts, in Plymouth County, as a tenant by the entirety<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> with his wife, Judith. In February 1996, David Garran executed and delivered a promissory note for $50,000 to the United States Trust Company. Three years later, Garran executed another promissory note to the United States Trust Company in the amount of $5,000. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts (\"Citizens\") is the successor in interest to the notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Citizens commenced an action against David Garran in the Superior Court of Massachusetts subsequent to Garran's default under the two promissory notes. Citizens also obtained a writ of attachment against the Hingham property on August 18, 2000, and perfected that writ on August 29, 2000, by recording it in the Plymouth County Registry of Deeds. After the court entered judgment in favor of Citizens on the promissory notes, Citizens recorded the execution on the Hingham property in the amount of $59,697.50.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On August 9, 2000, Garran recorded a declaration of homestead on the Hingham property as a disabled person pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, &#167; 1A. Judith Garran<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> later recorded a declaration of homestead on the same property pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, &#167; 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, Garran filed a Chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy. In Schedule A (Real Property) of his petition, he listed the Hingham property as having a value of $560,000. In Schedule C (Property Claimed as Exempt), Garran listed two homestead exemptions under Massachusetts state law &#8212; his &#167; 1A exemption for $300,000 and his wife's &#167; 1 exemption for $300,000 &#8212; thereby seeking a total exemption of $600,000 on the Hingham property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizens filed an Objection to the Debtor's Claim of Exemption, arguing that Garran could claim only one of the state law homestead exemptions. Garran filed a motion under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f) (2003) seeking to avoid Citizens' judicial lien, claiming that it impaired his exemption in property. Citizens objected to the motion. The bankruptcy court ruled that Garran could claim only the later filed homestead exemption of his wife, thereby limiting him to a $300,000 homestead exemption. <i>In re Garran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1896894\"><a href=\"/opinion/1896894/in-re-garran/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 575 (Bkrtcy.D.Mass. 2002). Concluding that Citizens' judicial lien did not impair this $300,000 exemption, the court denied Garran's motion to avoid the lien. <i>Id.</i> at 576.

In Massachusetts, a debtor can choose between the federal exemptions &#8212; those listed in &#167; 522(d) &#8212; or the exemptions enumerated in state law. <i>Patriot Portfolio v.

Under &#167; 1 of the Homestead Act, any owner of a home may acquire \"[a]n estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in the land and buildings.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1. Entitlement to a homestead exemption is not automatic under Massachusetts law. An owner of property must file the necessary declaration of homestead before the exemption can be claimed. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2. Garran's wife filed the necessary declaration of homestead as an owner of the Hingham property. Only one member of a family is permitted to file a declaration under &#167; 1, and the filing of any member of a family protects the entire family. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other type of homestead exemption is available only to the elderly and disabled. According to &#167; 1A, \"[t]he real property or manufactured home of ... a disabled person, as herein defined, shall be protected against attachment, seizure or execution of judgment to the extent of $300,000.\" Garran filed the necessary declaration of homestead under &#167; 1A. A declaration of homestead under this section is available only to individuals; a declaration filed by one member of a family will not protect the non-filing members of that family.

A bankruptcy discharge, though, voids only those judgments \"to the extent that such judgment is a determination of the personal liability of the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a)(1). Since a judicial lien attached to property is a liability <i>in rem,</i> it is not routinely discharged at the conclusion of the bankruptcy case. <i>Wrenn v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co.

However, because judicial liens may interfere with the \"fresh start\" the Bankruptcy Code seeks to give debtors, such liens may be avoidable under a separate provision of the Bankruptcy Code, &#167; 522(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That provision permits a debtor to avoid a judicial lien to the extent it \"impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(1). Pursuant to this section, the debtor can avoid a particular judicial lien if, in order to satisfy it, he would have to use assets he is otherwise entitled to set aside from the bankruptcy estate as exemptions.

Avoidance of judicial liens under &#167; 522(f) is not an \"all-or-nothing matter\"; a debtor is permitted to avoid only that portion of the judicial lien that infringes upon the exemption to which he is entitled. <i>East Cambridge Savings Bank v.

If the judicial lien does not impair the exemption &#8212; if the value of the property is greater than the sum of the liens attached to it and the exemption &#8212; then the debtor cannot avoid the lien and it will remain attached to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garran filed a motion to avoid Citizens' judicial lien on the Hingham property in its entirety on the ground that it impaired the homestead exemptions to which he was entitled. At the time the motion was filed, Citizens' lien on the property (component (i) of the formula) was valued at $62,739.79. In addition to this lien, there were two mortgages on the property with a combined value of $194,857.91 (component (ii) of the formula). In order to determine whether the sum of the liens and the exemptions exceeds the value of the property, we must determine \"the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim.\" &#167; 522(f)(2)(A)(iii). This is the single issue of dispute in this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Massachusetts courts have not yet addressed the interplay between a &#167; 1 exemption declared by a non-debtor spouse and a &#167; 1A exemption declared by a debtor, we must predict how the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would interpret the statute. <i>Caron v.

Nevertheless, liberal construction does not mean that courts can extend the protection of the homestead exemptions when doing so would contradict the \"plain and unambiguous\" language of the statute. <i>See id.</i> at 1139 (finding the debtor's homestead declaration invalid for failure to file the proper documentation as the statute explicitly required). Consequently, we must turn to the words of the statute in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 1 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in the land and buildings may be acquired pursuant to this chapter by an owner or owners of a home or one or all who rightfully possess the premise by lease or otherwise and who occupy or intend to occupy said home as a principal residence....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this chapter, an owner of a home shall include a sole owner, joint tenant, tenant by the entirety or tenant in common; provided, that only one owner may acquire an estate of homestead in any such home for the benefit of his family....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

The court agreed with Citizens, holding that the plain language of &#167; 2 meant that Garran's &#167; 1A declaration and corresponding homestead exemption was defeated and discharged by his wife's subsequent &#167; 1 declaration. We agree that this is the proper reading of the statutory language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garran's wife filed a declaration of homestead under &#167; 1 on February 21, 2001. The declaration of homestead under &#167; 1 is an acquisition of a homestead \"for the benefit of [the] family.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1. Therefore, by his wife's filing of a &#167; 1 declaration, Garran, as her spouse and member of her family, \"acquired\" a homestead on February 21, 2001. <i>See In re Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1907541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1907541/in-re-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 547 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2001) (recognizing that a \"declaration filed under subsection 1 protects even the non-filing debtor\"). Section 2 states that \"the acquisition of a new ... claim of homestead\" discharges any such previous estate. Therefore, Garran's acquisition of a new homestead on February 21, 2001, through his wife's filing, defeated his prior declaration of homestead filed pursuant to &#167; 1A on August 9, 2000. The fact that the homesteads were acquired under different sections is irrelevant, as &#167; 1A states explicitly that a homestead declared under that section \"shall be terminated\" pursuant to &#167; 2, the same provision that governs the acquisition and discharge of &#167; 1 homesteads. Even though the language of &#167; 2 existed prior to the enactment of &#167; 1A, the specific invocation of &#167; 2 in the text of &#167; 1A indicates that the drafters were aware of the existing termination procedures and intended them to apply to the newly amended portions of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garran suggests that &#167; 2 does not apply when a new declaration of homestead is filed on the same property &#8212; that an \"acquisition of a new estate or claim of homestead\" means a \"new estate or claim of homestead on a new home or piece of property.\" Certainly &#167; 2 would have the effect of discharging a prior declaration of homestead on an old home when a Massachusetts resident purchases a new home and files a new declaration of homestead. But there is nothing in the statute that limits &#167; 2 to a new home purchase situation. Given that Judith Garran had not previously declared a homestead on the Hingham property, her filing under &#167; 1 was a new \"claim of homestead\" under &#167; 1, just as it would have been if she had purchased a new home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, Garran argues that the statutes must be interpreted as permitting a disabled person to stack the &#167; 1 and 1A exemptions because the purpose of enacting &#167; 1A was to provide additional protection in bankruptcy to those who qualify for a &#167; 1A exemption. But at the time of the enactment of the amendment, &#167; 1A did provide an extra benefit to disabled debtors. Prior to the 2000 amendments to the homestead statutes, &#167;&#167; 1 and 1A provided different levels of exemptions &#8212; the &#167; 1 general homestead exemption provided protection only up to $100,000 while the &#167; 1A exemption provided a $200,000 exemption. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167;&#167; 1, 1A (West 1991). The amendments in 2000 both raised the monetary value and equalized the &#167;&#167; 1 and 1A exemptions. Moreover, &#167; 1A still provides protections unavailable under &#167; 1. Under &#167; 1A, a debtor retains his homestead exemption even given a judgment against him based on fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence or lack of capacity, while under &#167; 1 the debtor does not. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 188, &#167; 1 (West Supp.2003). Rejecting Garran's proffered interpretation of the homestead statutes &#8212; by holding that disabled debtors do not have the right to \"stack\" their &#167; 1A exemptions onto their &#167; 1 exemptions &#8212; does not eliminate the value of the &#167; 1A enactment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having predicted that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would conclude that the plain language of the Massachusetts homestead statutes prohibits the stacking of the exemption available to disabled debtors on top of the exemption available to all other residents of Massachusetts, and that Garran is entitled only to a maximum of $300,000 provided by his non-debtor spouse's declaration of homestead under &#167; 1, we now must return to the formula laid out in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(2)(A) to determine whether Citizens' lien impairs Garran's homestead exemption of $300,000. The sum total of Citizens' lien at the time of the bankruptcy petition ($62,739.79), the other liens on the property at the time of the bankruptcy petition ($194,857.91) and Garran's homestead exemption ($300,000.00) is $557,597.70. This total is less than the value of the Garrans' property at the time of the bankruptcy petition ($560,000.00). The Citizens' lien therefore does not impair Garran's homestead exemption because Garran can both satisfy the liens on the property and still retain the $300,000 homestead exemption to which he is entitled under Massachusetts law. Because the Citizens' lien does not impair Garran's exemption, it cannot be avoided under &#167; 522(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Appendix</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This table sets forth the differing calculations the parties propose under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(f)(2)(A):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <pre>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Garran's Theory              Citizens' Theory\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCitizens' lien                     62,739.79                    62,739.79\n(undisputed)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther liens (undisputed)          194,857.91                   194,857.91\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExemption                         600,000.00                   300,000.00\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSum of 522(f)(2)(A)(1)-(111)      857,597.70                   557,597.70\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValue of property                 560,000.00                   560,000.00\n(undisputed)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExemption impaired?
