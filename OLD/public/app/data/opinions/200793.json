Assad for appellants.\n     Melody A. Alger, with whom Baluch, Gianfrancesco, Mathieu &\nSzerlag was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                       December 31, 2003\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge. The appellants in this tort action\n\nprofess disappointment with the jury's take-nothing verdict and\n\ninvite us to order a new trial.          Finding their disappointment\n\nunderstandable but their arguments unpersuasive, we decline the\n\ninvitation.\n\n                                   I.\n\n                             Background\n\n            The facts are straightforward.         On February 5, 1997,\n\nplaintiffs-appellants    Beverly   Correia   and    John    Carvalho   were\n\npassengers in a car heading eastbound on Route 195 in Seekonk,\n\nMassachusetts.   The driver, Russell Machado, was proceeding in the\n\nfar left-hand lane of a six-lane divided highway.          At the same time\n\nand place, defendant-appellee Roderick Davol, Jr., a firefighter,\n\nwas driving a fire engine owned by the City of East Providence,\n\nRhode Island (the City).      Although Seekonk and East Providence\n\nrepose in separate states, they are contiguous communities.\n\n            Davol was responding to an accident that had occurred in\n\nEast Providence.   To reach the scene of the accident, he needed to\n\nmake a U-turn and access the westbound lanes of Route 195.             As he\n\nattempted to guide the fire engine through that maneuver, it\n\ncollided with Machado's vehicle.         The crash occurred in broad\n\ndaylight.\n\n            There is considerable dispute about the etiology of the\n\ncollision. According to Davol, the fire truck was traveling in the\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffar left-hand lane (in front of Machado's car) with its siren\n\nblaring.   As he approached an emergency vehicle turnaround in the\n\nmedian strip, he slowed the truck, swung to the right (straddling\n\nthe far left and center lanes) in order to execute the wide left\n\nturn, and activated the directional signal.             The appellants tell a\n\ndifferent tale.     They maintain that the fire engine was fully in\n\nthe center lane all along and veered to the left without activating\n\neither its siren or blinker lights.\n\n           The parties agree that Machado's car (which was trying to\n\npass on the left) collided with the fire truck (which was trying to\n\nenter the turnaround).          Both vehicles were badly damaged and the\n\nappellants sustained severe injuries.\n\n           Relying on diversity of citizenship and the existence of\n\na controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), the\n\nappellants brought suit against the City, the City treasurer (as an\n\n\"official capacity\" defendant), and Davol in the United States\n\nDistrict Court     for   the     District     of   Massachusetts.      The   City\n\nretorted by filing a third-party complaint against Machado for the\n\ncost of repairing the fire engine.\n\n           For the most part, pretrial proceedings were uneventful.\n\nWe mention only one aspect.          The district court set the case for\n\ntrial in December of 2001.          On November 28, the appellants asked\n\nthe court to postpone the trial for three months, expressing\n\nconcern    that   the    jury    would   be    prejudiced    in     favor    of   a\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ffirefighter-defendant due to the publicity surrounding the events\n\nof September 11, 2001, and the sentiment engendered by those\n\nevents.1   The district court denied the motion.\n\n               As matters turned out, the court subsequently delayed the\n\ntrial    for    a   few   weeks   in   hopes    of    achieving   a   settlement.\n\nNegotiations proved fruitless and a five-day trial commenced on\n\nJanuary 14, 2002.         The district court submitted a verdict sheet to\n\nthe jury that incorporated several special interrogatories.                 These\n\nquestions addressed both the appellants' personal injury claims and\n\nthe City's property damage claim.              In connection with the former,\n\nthe jury returned a take-nothing verdict.                In connection with the\n\nlatter, the jury apportioned negligence 99% to Machado and 1% to\n\nDavol, and awarded the City $72,801.                 The district court entered\n\njudgment for the defendants on the take-nothing verdict and for the\n\nCity on the property damage award (albeit in a modified amount).2\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      On September 11, 2001, terrorists struck the United States.\nOne hijacked airliner, then another, crashed into the World Trade\nCenter towers in Manhattan, causing the towers to collapse. 2,752\nlives were lost.    As part of the same foray, a third hijacked\nairliner crashed into the Pentagon, and a fourth — diverted from\nits nefarious mission by a brave group of passengers — went down\nnear Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing all who were aboard. In the\naftermath, so-called first responders, particularly New York City\npolice officers and firefighters, performed valiantly to prevent\neven greater carnage.\n     2\n      The court reduced the property damage award by 1% to account\nfor Davol's negligence and by an additional $25,000 to account for\nan earlier payment. Neither Machado nor the City has appealed that\njudgment.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f            The appellants filed a timely motion for a new trial.\n\nThe take-nothing verdict, they said, confirmed their fears about\n\nthe ripple effect of the September 11 tragedy, contravened both the\n\nlaw   and    the   weight   of        the    evidence,    and   highlighted   an\n\nirreconcilable inconsistency in the jury's answers to the special\n\nquestions.    The district court rebuffed this asseverational array\n\nin a thoughtful rescript. See Carvalho v. Fitzgerald, 188 F. Supp.\n\n2d 132 (D. Mass. 2002).       This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n            In this venue, the appellants assign error to (i) the\n\nlower court's denial of their motion for a continuance, and (ii)\n\nthe court's denial of their motion for a new trial.                   We address\n\nthese claims sequentially.\n\n                                            A.\n\n                       Denial of the Continuance\n\n            The appellants argue that the widespread publicity about\n\nthe   cataclysmic    events      of    September    11    and   the   consequent\n\noutpouring of emotion negated the jury's ability to render an\n\nimpartial    verdict   (and      that,       therefore,   the   district   court\n\nblundered in failing to postpone the trial).              We review a district\n\ncourt's denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion.\n\nMacaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).                    This makes\n\nsense because even the most scrupulous study of an algid appellate\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\frecord cannot put the reader on an equal footing with the trial\n\njudge, who has gained first-hand knowledge of the nuances of a\n\nparticular case.    Given this deferential standard of review, we\n\nwill not deem the denial of a continuance erroneous unless our\n\ncanvass of the record indicates that \"the trial court indulged a\n\nserious error of law or suffered a meaningful lapse of judgment,\n\nresulting in substantial prejudice to the movant.\"          United States\n\nv. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 770 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          Here,    the   appellants'    core   contention   is    that   the\n\ndistrict court grossly underestimated the prejudicial effects of\n\nthe shock waves surrounding the September 11 tragedy.             The lower\n\ncourt rejected this contention both before trial and in its post-\n\nverdict opinion. On the later occasion, it explained that the jury\n\n\"most likely shared in the respect that fire fighters have earned\n\nfrom those for whom they risk their lives,\" but that the appellants\n\nnonetheless received a fair trial.        Carvalho, 188 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n135 & n.4.\n\n          We note at the outset that the appellants' argument is an\n\nunusual one.   Typically, a motion for a continuance on the ground\n\nof pretrial publicity involves publicity directly related to the\n\nlitigants or the matters at issue in the litigation.             See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Moreno Morales, 815 F.2d 725, 730 (1st Cir. 1987);\n\nDelaney v. United States, 199 F.2d 107, 110-13 (1st Cir. 1952).\n\nHere, however, the allegedly prejudicial publicity is exogenous in\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe    sense    that    it    bears   no   direct      connection       to    either    the\n\nlitigants      or   the      litigation.       While    publicity       of     this    sort\n\noccasionally may necessitate postponement of a trial, we suspect\n\nthat such occasions will be rare.\n\n               In all events, the appellants' argument depends upon the\n\nnotion that the events of September 11 so exalted first responders\n\nthat, for many months thereafter, no one who sat across a courtroom\n\nfrom a police officer or a firefighter could get a fair shake.                           We\n\nthink that argument underestimates a trial court's ability to cope\n\nwith public sentiment.           The best way to ensure that jurors do not\n\nharbor biases for or against the parties is for the trial court to\n\nconduct a thorough voir dire examination. See Patton v. Yount, 467\n\nU.S.    1025,    1038     &   n.13    (1984)     (\"[V]oir   dire    has        long    been\n\nrecognized as an effective method of rooting out such [publicity-\n\nbased]    bias,        especially     when     conducted     in     a        careful    and\n\nthoroughgoing manner.\") (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).       Assuming that venirepersons pass through this screen,\n\nthe trial court thereafter may operate on the presumption that the\n\nchosen jurors will obey the judge's instructions to put extraneous\n\nmatters aside and decide each case on its merits.                       See Richardson\n\nv. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987); Blake v. Pellegrino, 329 F.3d\n\n43, 50 (1st Cir. 2003).           While the presumption that jurors follow\n\nthe court's instructions is rebuttable, rebutting it takes more\n\nthan empty rhetoric.\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f           In this case, the appellants have wholly failed to rebut\n\nthe presumption.    To warrant a continuance on the ground of\n\npotential jury contamination, the appellants had to do more than\n\nshow that the jurors were exposed to pervasive (and potentially\n\ninfluential) news accounts.   They had to carry the added burden of\n\ndemonstrating that the exposure was likely to result in unfair\n\nprejudice. United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); Moreno Morales, 815 F.2d at 733-34.      The requisite\n\nprejudice can be shown either directly (say, by proof of actual\n\nbias among the seated jurors) or indirectly (say, by inferences\n\narising out of circumstantial evidence).   See Moreno Morales, 815\n\nF.3d at 731, 734-35.\n\n           The appellants have not shown any cognizable prejudice\n\nhere.    The district court conducted a thorough voir dire.     It\n\nqueried all the potential jurors about their biases vis-à-vis\n\nfirefighters and excused the one juror who expressed such a bias\n\n(the juror in question had a son who was a firefighter).       The\n\nappellants' counsel neither sought to have the court augment its\n\ninquiry nor suggested any other questions that might usefully be\n\nposed.    The questioning did not reveal anything even remotely\n\nindicating actual bias on the part of any seated juror.\n\n           By like token, the circumstantial evidence falls far\n\nshort of what would be needed to raise a presumption of prejudice.\n\nThe fact that only one member of the venire had to be excused\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fbecause of a pro-firefighter bias is itself telling. See Murphy v.\n\nFlorida, 421 U.S. 794, 803 (1975).              And to cinch matters, the\n\ndistrict court instructed the jurors, both at the commencement of\n\nthe trial and in the charge, to decide the case based strictly and\n\nsolely on the evidence. The court's language was firm and pointed.\n\nThere is nothing in the record before us that casts doubt upon the\n\npresumption that the jurors followed these instructions.\n\n            The short of it is that the district court handled this\n\nissue with great sensitivity.        The careful voir dire examination,\n\nthe clear instructions, and the absence of any evidentiary basis\n\nfor a finding of prejudice speak volumes.          Those features impel us\n\nto   hold   that   the   court   acted   well   within   the   realm   of   its\n\ndiscretion in denying the requested continuance. Cf. United States\n\nv. Capelton, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-1248, slip\n\nop. at 7-8] (rejecting defendants' claim that jury could not\n\ndispassionately evaluate police testimony and upholding denial of\n\nmistrial motion in trial commenced prior to the events of September\n\n11 and concluded thereafter).\n\n                                     B.\n\n                           Denial of a New Trial\n\n            We turn now to the appellants' motion for a new trial.\n\nThat motion implored the lower court to nullify the verdict as (i)\n\ncontrary to law, (ii) against the weight of the evidence, and (iii)\n\nbased upon irreconcilably inconsistent answers to the special\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fquestions that were incorporated into the verdict sheet.                        The\n\ndistrict court rejected these importunings, and so do we.\n\n           We pause first to make a procedural point.              The parties\n\nhave   briefed   this    case    as   if   state   law   (here,   the     law    of\n\nMassachusetts) describes the appropriate standard for granting a\n\nnew trial in a diversity action, and the district court acquiesced\n\nin this view.        See Carvalho, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (citing\n\nTurnpike Motors, Inc. v. Newbury Group, Inc., 596 N.E.2d 989, 994\n\n(Mass. 1992)).    We do not agree.\n\n           Federal      courts     sitting    in   diversity      apply    state\n\nsubstantive law and federal procedural rules. Hanna v. Plumer, 380\n\nU.S. 460, 465 (1965); Dichner v. Liberty Travel, 141 F.3d 24, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). Classifying a particular matter as substantive or\n\nprocedural can sometimes be a challenging endeavor.                 See, e.g.,\n\nHanna, 380 U.S. at 463-74; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99,\n\n104-12 (1945).    But classification is generally a straightforward\n\nexercise when a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure covers the point.\n\nSee Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427 n.7\n\n(1996); Burlington N. R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U.S. 1, 4-5 (1987).\n\n           This is such a case.        The granting or denial of a motion\n\nfor a new trial is a procedural matter governed by a directly\n\napplicable federal rule:         Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a).    See 11 Charles A.\n\nWright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2802, at 42 (2d ed.\n\n1995 & Supp. 2003); 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fPractice § 59.03, at 59-12 (3d. ed. 2003).         We consistently have\n\nlooked to federal law for the standard for deciding new trial\n\nmotions in diversity cases, see, e.g., Quinones-Pacheco v. Am.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 979 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1992); Putnam Res. v.\n\nPateman, 958 F.2d 448, 459 (1st Cir. 1992), and state practice\n\ngenerally has no place in that endeavor.3\n\n            We deem it worthwhile to clarify this procedural point\n\neven though it has no practical implications here.           When a trial\n\ncourt applies an incorrect legal standard to a motion for a new\n\ntrial,   one   possible   course    of    action   is   to   remand   for\n\nreconsideration.   See, e.g., Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric Ctr.,\n\n49 F.3d 1002, 1019 (3d Cir. 1995).        That course is unnecessary in\n\nthis case because the federal and Massachusetts standards for\n\ngranting or denying a new trial are identical in all relevant\n\nrespects.   Compare, e.g., Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200-01\n\n(1st Cir. 1987), with, e.g., Turnpike Motors, 596 N.E.2d at 994.\n\nWe therefore proceed with our assessment of the district court's\n\ndecision.\n\n            Our starting point is the standard of review.        We will\n\noverturn the denial of a motion for a new trial only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc., 847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st\n\n\n     3\n      We say \"generally\" because exceptions may apply in special\ncircumstances. See, e.g. Gasperini, 518 U.S. at 426-31 (holding\nthat a federal trial court sitting in diversity should use the\napplicable state standard in reviewing allegedly excessive damage\nawards). Here, however, no such special circumstances exist.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fCir. 1988); Hubbard v. Faros Fisheries, Inc., 626 F.2d 196, 200\n\n(1st Cir. 1980).   A mistake of law is, of course, tantamount to an\n\nabuse of discretion.   Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-2593, slip op. at 5].\n\n           The appellants' initial argument is that the jury verdict\n\nflouts the applicable law.   This is a somewhat convoluted argument\n\nand must be placed into workable perspective.\n\n           The jury's take-nothing verdict was underpinned by its\n\nanswers to special questions.   In response to Question No. 1, the\n\njury declared that Davol had been \"negligent while turning his fire\n\ntruck into the [Route 195] crossover.\" In response to Question No.\n\n2, it declared that Davol's negligence was not \"a substantial or\n\nproximate cause of [the appellants'] injur[ies] and damages.\"   The\n\nappellants concede that negligence was an open question appropriate\n\nfor jury consideration.   They argue, however, that once the jurors\n\nfound Davol negligent, they were legally obliged to find that his\n\nnegligence proximately caused their injuries and damages.\n\n           The appellants cobble together this theory out of a\n\nseries of stipulations entered into among the parties in connection\n\nwith the authentication and admissibility of various medical bills\n\nand reports. The operative language of each stipulation identified\n\nthe bills and reports as relating to treatment for \"injuries\n\nsustained as a result of the motor vehicle accident of February 5,\n\n1997.\"   The appellants construe this language as a legally binding\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fadmission of proximate cause.    This interpretation elevates hope\n\nover reason.\n\n           Determinations as to a stipulation's meaning and legal\n\neffect are determinations of law, and, thus, engender de novo\n\nreview.   Gómez v. Rivera Rodríguez, 344 F.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).    Courts should construe stipulations in accordance with\n\naccepted principles of general contract law.      Id.    Context can be\n\n— and often is — of decretory significance.             See, e.g., id.;\n\nNewport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank (In re Newport Plaza\n\nAssocs.), 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           In this instance, the trial court read the stipulations\n\nas falling well short of an admission of proximate cause and\n\ncharged the jurors that causation was for them to determine.       This\n\nwas undeniably correct.   Fairly read, the stipulations conceded\n\nthat the appellants had suffered injuries in the collision and had\n\nincurred reasonable hospital and medical expenses in an effort to\n\ncure and relieve those injuries.       The stipulations also admitted\n\nthat the injuries and damages flowed from the crash — but not that\n\nanyone's negligence caused the accident.      Because nothing in the\n\nstipulations even remotely approaches a concession of causation\n\nvis-à-vis the occurrence of the accident, the stipulations supply\n\nno basis for overturning the verdict.\n\n           The appellants next contend that the jury's answer to\n\nQuestion No. 2 was against the weight of the evidence.      They hammer\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe version of the accident that they espoused to the jury and note\n\nthat their accident reconstructionist, one McNally, opined that\n\nDavol's turning maneuver was the primary cause of the collision.\n\nThey also excoriate the district court's rejection of their claim.\n\n           This line of argument does not hold water.               A party\n\nchallenging a trial court's determination that a verdict did not\n\ncontradict the weight of the evidence faces a steep uphill climb.\n\nThe challenger must show that the evidence so far preponderates\n\nagainst the verdict that upholding it will perpetuate a manifest\n\nmiscarriage of justice.    Putnam Res., 958 F.2d at 459; Wagenmann,\n\n829 F.2d at 200-01.\n\n           The appellants' effort to carry this burden fails: their\n\nbrief does not present a balanced view of the facts, but, rather,\n\ninsupportably discounts (and, to some extent, blithely overlooks)\n\nthe evidence favorable to the verdict.       Taken as a whole, the proof\n\nin this case was not one-sided.         It could well have led rational\n\nminds to differ as to the issue of causation.        See Carvalho, 188 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 134-35 (highlighting permissible inferences from the\n\nevidence that supported the jury verdict).\n\n           If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\nappellants' argument succumbs to the law of the case.              The lower\n\ncourt's instructions laid out the ground rules. The court told the\n\njurors,   without   objection,   that    returning   a   verdict    for   the\n\nappellants required them to find not only that Davol breached an\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\factionable duty (i.e., that he was negligent) but also that this\n\nnegligence was a proximate cause of the accident.            The court's\n\ninstructions included the following explanation:\n\n           \"Proximate cause\" is defined as any cause\n           which in a natural and continuous sequence,\n           unburdened by any intervening cause, produces\n           the injury complained of and without which the\n           injurious result would not have occurred. In\n           plainer English, a defendant's negligent\n           conduct is the proximate cause of harm to\n           another if his conduct is a substantial factor\n           in bringing about that harm.         (Emphasis\n           supplied.)\n\nQuestion No. 2 reflected the substance of this instruction:          \"Was\n\nFireman Davol's negligence a substantial or proximate cause of\n\ninjur[ies] and damages to [the appellants]?\"\n\n           Both   the   instruction   and   the   question    jibe   with\n\nsubstantive principles of Massachusetts law.      See, e.g., Jorgensen\n\nv. Mass. Port Auth., 905 F.2d 515, 524 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting that\n\ncausation under Massachusetts negligence law requires a showing\n\nthat the defendant's conduct was a \"substantial . . . factor\" in\n\nbringing about the alleged harm); Tritsch v. Boston Edison Co., 293\n\nN.E.2d 264, 267 (Mass. 1973) (same).    Moreover, the appellants did\n\nnot object either to the instruction or to the form of Question No.\n\n2.   In the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the instruction\n\nbecame the law of the case.    See Milone, 847 F.2d at 38-39.\n\n           That dooms the appellants' argument.      Given the law of\n\nthe case and the totality of the proof, we cannot say that the\n\nfinding of \"no substantial cause\" worked a miscarriage of justice.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fOn this chiaroscuro record, the jury supportably could have found\n\nthat Davol was driving in the far left-hand lane of Route 195\n\neastbound with his siren blaring; that he eased the fire truck\n\npartially into the center lane as a prelude to a left-hand turn;\n\nthat he activated his left directional signal; and that Machado\n\ncaused the collision by recklessly attempting to pass.               A rational\n\njury might well have concluded — as this jury apparently did — that\n\nDavol was guilty of some slight negligence (say, moving toward the\n\ncenter lane without signaling) but that, in the overall scheme of\n\nthings, his conduct did not proximately cause the collision.\n\n            We   have   said     before   that    causation   questions       \"are\n\nnormally grist for the jury's mill.\"             Peckham v. Cont'l Cas. Ins.\n\nCo., 895 F.2d 830, 837 (1st Cir. 1990).            This case illustrates the\n\npoint.    It is the jury's task, not ours or the trial court's, to\n\nresolve conflicts in the testimony.           See id. at 839 (holding that\n\nthis court \"cannot reject possibilities rooted in the record merely\n\nbecause, if sitting as factfinders, we would likely have drawn a\n\ndifferent set of conclusions\").\n\n            The appellants have one last arrow in their quiver. They\n\ninsist that certain of the jury's answers to the special questions\n\nwere     irreconcilably    inconsistent.           This   claim    requires     an\n\nunderstanding of a further question posed by the court to the jury.\n\n            In   the    course    of   resolving    the   City's    third-party\n\ncomplaint (its property damage suit against Machado), Question No.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f7 asked the jurors to apportion negligence between Davol and\n\nMachado.     See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 85.    In response, the\n\njurors found Davol 1% negligent and Machado 99% negligent.      The\n\nappellants posit that this answer (in particular, the finding that\n\nDavol was 1% negligent) is fatally inconsistent with the jurors'\n\nresponse to Question No. 2 (in which they determined that Davol's\n\nconduct was not a substantial cause of the appellants' damages).\n\n           This argument is hopeless.    To begin with, it has been\n\nforfeited.    The special questions here were propounded pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 49(b).4       When the verdict was returned, the\n\nappellants did not raise a claim of inconsistency before the court\n\ndischarged the jury.    In that situation, failure to object to an\n\nalleged inconsistency while the jury is still in the box forfeits\n\na party's objection, subject only to the possibility of relief for\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The rule empowers the district court to \"submit to the jury,\ntogether with appropriate forms for a general verdict, written\ninterrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of\nwhich is necessary to a verdict.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 49(b). If the\ncourt elects to use this methodology, it is obliged to \"give such\nexplanation or instruction as may be necessary to enable the jury\nboth to make answers to the interrogatories and to render a general\nverdict.\" Id. In the event that \"the answers are inconsistent\nwith each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the\ngeneral verdict . . . the court shall return the jury for further\nconsideration of its answers and verdict or shall order a new\ntrial.\"    Id.   We have placed a gloss on this last proviso,\nrequiring the parties, on pain of forfeiture, to call any such\nalleged inconsistency to the trial court's attention as soon as the\nverdict is returned. See, e.g., Peckham, 895 F.2d at 836; McIsaac\nv. Didriksen Fishing Corp., 809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                -17-\n\fplain error.    See Peckham, 895 F.2d at 836; McIsaac v. Didriksen\n\nFishing Corp., 809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            We need not explore the parameters of plain error review\n\nbecause no less an authority than the Supreme Court has instructed\n\nthat \"[w]here there is a view of the case that makes the jury's\n\nanswers   to   special   interrogatories   consistent,   they   must   be\n\nresolved that way.\"       Atl. & Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman\n\nLines, Ltd., 369 U.S. 355, 364 (1962).          Here, one easily can\n\nconceive of theories that harmonize the jury's answer to Question\n\nNo. 7 with its answer to Question No. 2.     For example, the jury may\n\nhave thought Davol's 1% negligence insubstantial and — consistent\n\nwith the law of the case — insufficient to support a finding of\n\nproximate cause.\n\n            To recapitulate, each of the appellants' arguments in\n\nsupport of their new trial motion lacks merit.            We conclude,\n\ntherefore, that the district court acted appropriately in denying\n\nthe motion.\n\n                                 III.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold both the lower court's denial of a continuance and its\n\nrefusal to grant a new trial.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f",

Finding their disappointment understandable but their arguments unpersuasive, we decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are straightforward. On February 5, 1997, plaintiffs-appellants Beverly Correia and John Carvalho were passengers in a car heading eastbound on Route 195 in Seekonk, Massachusetts. The driver, Russell Machado, was proceeding in the far left-hand lane of a six-lane divided highway. At the same time and place, defendant-appellee Roderick Davol, Jr., a firefighter, was driving a fire engine owned by the City of East Providence, Rhode Island (the City). Although Seekonk and East Providence repose in separate states, they are contiguous communities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davol was responding to an accident that had occurred in East Providence. To reach the scene of the accident, he needed to make a U-turn and access the westbound lanes of Route 195. As he attempted to guide the fire engine through that maneuver, it collided with Machado's vehicle. The crash occurred in broad daylight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is considerable dispute about the etiology of the collision. According to Davol, the fire truck was traveling in the far left-hand lane (in front of Machado's car) with its siren blaring. As he approached an emergency vehicle turnaround in the median strip, he slowed the truck, swung to the right (straddling the far left and center lanes) in order to execute the wide left turn, and activated the directional signal. The appellants tell a different tale. They maintain that the fire engine was fully in the center lane all along and veered to the left without activating either its siren or blinker lights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Machado's car (which was trying to pass on the left) collided with the fire truck (which was trying to enter the turnaround). Both vehicles were badly damaged and the appellants sustained severe injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), the appellants brought suit against the City, the City treasurer (as an \"official capacity\" defendant), and Davol in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The City retorted by filing a third-party complaint against Machado for the cost of repairing the fire engine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, pretrial proceedings were uneventful. We mention only one aspect. The district court set the case for trial in December of 2001. On November 28, the appellants asked the court to postpone the trial for three months, expressing concern that the jury would be prejudiced in favor of a firefighter-defendant due to the publicity surrounding the events of September 11, 2001, and the sentiment engendered by those events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As matters turned out, the court subsequently delayed the trial for a few weeks in hopes of achieving a settlement. Negotiations proved fruitless and a five-day trial commenced on January 14, 2002. The district court submitted a verdict sheet to the jury that incorporated several special interrogatories. These questions addressed both the appellants' personal injury claims and the City's property damage claim. In connection with the former, the jury returned a take-nothing verdict. In connection with the latter, the jury apportioned negligence 99% to Machado and 1% to Davol, and awarded the City $72,801. The district court entered judgment for the defendants on the take-nothing verdict and for the City on the property damage award (albeit in a modified amount).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants filed a timely motion for a new trial. The take-nothing verdict, they said, confirmed their fears about the ripple effect of the September 11 tragedy, contravened both the law and the weight of the evidence, and highlighted an irreconcilable inconsistency in the jury's answers to the special questions. The district court rebuffed this asseverational array in a thoughtful rescript. <i>See Carvalho v. Fitzgerald,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d 132 (D.Mass.2002). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellants assign error to (i) the lower court's denial of their motion for a continuance, and (ii) the court's denial of their motion for a new trial. We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Denial of the Continuance</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants argue that the widespread publicity about the cataclysmic events of September 11 and the consequent outpouring of emotion negated the jury's ability to render an impartial verdict (and that, therefore, the district court blundered in failing to postpone the trial). We review a district court's denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion. <i>Macaulay v. Anas,</i> 321 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir.2003). This makes sense because even the most scrupulous study of an algid appellate record cannot put the reader on an equal footing with the trial judge, who has gained first-hand knowledge of the nuances of a particular case. Given this deferential standard of review, we will not deem the denial of a continuance erroneous unless our canvass of the record indicates that \"the trial court indulged a serious error of law or suffered a meaningful lapse of judgment, resulting in substantial prejudice to the movant.\" <i>United States v. Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d 754, 770 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the appellants' core contention is that the district court grossly underestimated the prejudicial effects of the shock waves surrounding the September 11 tragedy. The lower court rejected this contention both before trial and in its post-verdict opinion. On the later occasion, it explained that the jury \"most likely shared in the respect that fire fighters have earned from those for whom they risk their lives,\" but that the appellants nonetheless received a fair trial. <i>Carvalho,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d at 135 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset that the appellants' argument is an unusual one. Typically, a motion for a continuance on the ground of pretrial publicity involves publicity directly related to the litigants or the matters at issue in the litigation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moreno Morales,</i> 815 F.2d 725, 730 (1st Cir.1987); <i>Delaney v. United States,</i> 199 F.2d 107, 110-13 (1st Cir.1952). Here, however, the allegedly prejudicial publicity is exogenous in the sense that it bears no direct connection to either the litigants or the litigation. While publicity of this sort occasionally may necessitate postponement of a trial, we suspect that such occasions will be rare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the appellants' argument depends upon the notion that the events of September 11 so exalted first responders that, for many months thereafter, no one who sat across a courtroom from a police officer or a firefighter could get a fair shake. We think that argument underestimates a trial court's ability to cope with public sentiment. The best way to ensure that jurors do not harbor biases for or against the parties is for the trial court to conduct a thorough voir dire examination. <i>See Patton v. Yount,</i> 467 U.S. 1025, 1038 &amp; n. 13, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984) (\"[V]oir dire has long been recognized as an effective method of rooting out such [publicity-based] bias, especially when conducted in a careful and thoroughgoing manner.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming that venirepersons pass through this screen, the trial court thereafter may operate on the presumption that the chosen jurors will obey the judge's instructions to put extraneous matters aside and decide each case on its merits. <i>See Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987); <i>Blake v. Pellegrino,</i> 329 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir.2003). While the presumption that jurors follow the court's instructions is rebuttable, rebutting it takes more than empty rhetoric.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellants have wholly failed to rebut the presumption. To warrant a continuance on the ground of potential jury contamination, the appellants had to do more than show that the jurors were exposed to pervasive (and potentially influential) news accounts. They had to carry the added burden of demonstrating that the exposure was likely to result in unfair prejudice. <i>United States</i> <i>v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> 229 F.3d 33, 43 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Moreno Morales,</i> 815 F.2d at 733-34. The requisite prejudice can be shown either directly (say, by proof of actual bias among the seated jurors) or indirectly (say, by inferences arising out of circumstantial evidence). <i>See Moreno Morales,</i> 815 F.3d at 731, 734-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have not shown any cognizable prejudice here. The district court conducted a thorough voir dire. It queried all the potential jurors about their biases vis-&#224;-vis firefighters and excused the one juror who expressed such a bias (the juror in question had a son who was a firefighter). The appellants' counsel neither sought to have the court augment its inquiry nor suggested any other questions that might usefully be posed. The questioning did not reveal anything even remotely indicating actual bias on the part of any seated juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, the circumstantial evidence falls far short of what would be needed to raise a presumption of prejudice. The fact that only one member of the venire had to be excused because of a pro-firefighter bias is itself telling. <i>See Murphy v. Florida,</i> 421 U.S. 794, 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). And to cinch matters, the district court instructed the jurors, both at the commencement of the trial and in the charge, to decide the case based strictly and solely on the evidence. The court's language was firm and pointed. There is nothing in the record before us that casts doubt upon the presumption that the jurors followed these instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the district court handled this issue with great sensitivity. The careful voir dire examination, the clear instructions, and the absence of any evidentiary basis for a finding of prejudice speak volumes. Those features impel us to hold that the court acted well within the realm of its discretion in denying the requested continuance. <i>Cf. United States v. Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d 231, 240 (1st Cir.2003) (rejecting defendants' claim that jury could not dispassionately evaluate police testimony and upholding denial of mistrial motion in trial commenced prior to the events of September 11 and concluded thereafter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Denial of a New Trial</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the appellants' motion for a new trial. That motion implored the lower court to nullify the verdict as (i) contrary to law, (ii) against the weight of the evidence, and (iii) based upon irreconcilably inconsistent answers to the special questions that were incorporated into the verdict sheet. The district court rejected these importunings, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause first to make a procedural point. The parties have briefed this case as if state law (here, the law of Massachusetts) describes the appropriate standard for granting a new trial in a diversity action, and the district court acquiesced in this view. <i>See Carvalho,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d at 134 (citing <i>Turnpike Motors, Inc. v. Newbury Group, Inc.,</i> 413 Mass. 119, 596 N.E.2d 989, 994 (1992)). We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural rules. <i>Hanna v. Plumer,</i> 380 U.S. 460, 465, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965); <i>Dichner v. Liberty Travel,</i> 141 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir.1998). Classifying a particular matter as substantive or procedural can sometimes be a challenging endeavor. <i>See, e.g., Hanna,</i> 380 U.S. at 463-74, 85 S.Ct. 1136; <i>Guaranty Trust Co. v. York,</i> 326 U.S. 99, 104-12, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945). But classification is generally a straightforward exercise when a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure covers the point. <i>See Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities,</i> <i>Inc.,</i> 518 U.S. 415, 427 n. 7, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996); <i>Burlington N.R. Co. v. Woods,</i> 480 U.S. 1, 4-5, 107 S.Ct. 967, 94 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. The granting or denial of a motion for a new trial is a procedural matter governed by a directly applicable federal rule: Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a). <i>See</i> 11 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2802, at 42 (2d ed. 1995 &amp; Supp.2003); 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 59.03, at 59-12 (3d. ed.2003). We consistently have looked to federal law for the standard for deciding new trial motions in diversity cases, <i>see, e.g., Quinones-Pacheco v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 979 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1992); <i>Putnam Res. v. Pateman,</i> 958 F.2d 448, 459 (1st Cir.1992), and state practice generally has no place in that endeavor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deem it worthwhile to clarify this procedural point even though it has no practical implications here. When a trial court applies an incorrect legal standard to a motion for a new trial, one possible course of action is to remand for reconsideration. <i>See, e.g., Wagner v. Fair Acres Geriatric Ctr.,</i> 49 F.3d 1002, 1019 (3d Cir. 1995). That course is unnecessary in this case because the federal and Massachusetts standards for granting or denying a new trial are identical in all relevant respects. <i>Compare, e.g., Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 200-01 (1st Cir. 1987), <i>with, e.g., Turnpike Motors,</i> 596 N.E.2d at 994. We therefore proceed with our assessment of the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our starting point is the standard of review. We will overturn the denial of a motion for a new trial only for abuse of discretion. <i>Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1988); <i>Hubbard v. Faros Fisheries, Inc.,</i> 626 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1980). A mistake of law is, of course, tantamount to an abuse of discretion. <i>Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> 350 F.3d 219, 224 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' initial argument is that the jury verdict flouts the applicable law. This is a somewhat convoluted argument and must be placed into workable perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury's take-nothing verdict was underpinned by its answers to special questions. In response to Question No. 1, the jury declared that Davol had been \"negligent while turning his fire truck into the [Route 195] crossover.\" In response to Question No. 2, it declared that Davol's negligence was not \"a substantial or proximate cause of [the appellants'] injur[ies] and damages.\" The appellants concede that negligence was an open question appropriate for jury consideration. They argue, however, that once the jurors found Davol negligent, they were legally obliged to find that his negligence proximately caused their injuries and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants cobble together this theory out of a series of stipulations entered into among the parties in connection with the authentication and admissibility of various medical bills and reports. The operative language of each stipulation identified the bills and reports as relating to treatment for \"injuries sustained as a result of the motor vehicle accident of February 5, 1997.\" The appellants construe this language as a legally binding admission of proximate cause. This interpretation elevates hope over reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determinations as to a stipulation's meaning and legal effect are determinations of law, and, thus, engender de novo review. <i>G&#243;mez v. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir.2003). Courts should construe stipulations in accordance with accepted principles of general contract law. <i>Id.</i> Context can be &#8212; and often is &#8212; of decretory significance. <i>See, e.g., id.; Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank (In re Newport Plaza Assocs.),</i> 985 F.2d 640, 646 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the trial court read the stipulations as falling well short of an admission of proximate cause and charged the jurors that causation was for them to determine. This was undeniably correct. Fairly read, the stipulations conceded that the appellants had suffered injuries in the collision and had incurred reasonable hospital and medical expenses in an effort to cure and relieve those injuries. The stipulations also admitted that the injuries and damages flowed from the crash &#8212; but not that anyone's negligence caused the accident. Because nothing in the stipulations even remotely approaches a concession of causation vis-&#224;-vis the occurrence of the accident, the stipulations supply no basis for overturning the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next contend that the jury's answer to Question No. 2 was against the weight of the evidence. They hammer the version of the accident that they espoused to the jury and note that their accident reconstructionist, one McNally, opined that Davol's turning maneuver was the primary cause of the collision. They also excoriate the district court's rejection of their claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of argument does not hold water. A party challenging a trial court's determination that a verdict did not contradict the weight of the evidence faces a steep uphill climb. The challenger must show that the evidence so far preponderates against the verdict that upholding it will perpetuate a manifest miscarriage of justice. <i>Putnam Res.,</i> 958 F.2d at 459; <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 200-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' effort to carry this burden fails: their brief does not present a balanced view of the facts, but, rather, insupportably discounts (and, to some extent, blithely overlooks) the evidence favorable to the verdict. Taken as a whole, the proof in this case was not one-sided. It could well have led rational minds to differ as to the issue of causation. <i>See Carvalho,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d at 134-35 (highlighting permissible inferences from the evidence that supported the jury verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the appellants' argument succumbs to the law of the case. The lower court's instructions laid out the ground rules. The court told the jurors, without objection, that returning a verdict for the appellants required them to find not only that Davol breached an actionable duty (i.e., that he was negligent) but also that this negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. The court's instructions included the following explanation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Proximate cause\" is defined as any cause which in a natural and continuous sequence, unburdened by any intervening cause, produces the injury complained of and without which the injurious result would not have occurred. In plainer English, a defendant's negligent conduct is the proximate cause of harm to another if his conduct is a <i>substantial factor</i> in bringing about that harm. (Emphasis supplied.) Question No. 2 reflected the substance of this instruction: \"Was Fireman Davol's negligence a substantial or proximate cause of injur[ies] and damages to [the appellants]?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the instruction and the question jibe with substantive principles of Massachusetts law. <i>See, e.g., Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.,</i> 905 F.2d 515, 524 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting that causation under Massachusetts negligence law requires a showing that the defendant's conduct was a \"substantial... factor\" in bringing about the alleged harm); <i>Tritsch v. Boston Edison Co.,</i> 363 Mass. 179, 293 N.E.2d 264, 267 (1973) (same). Moreover, the appellants did not object either to the instruction or to the form of Question No. 2. In the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the instruction became the law of the case. <i>See Milone,</i> 847 F.2d at 38-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That dooms the appellants' argument. Given the law of the case and the totality of the proof, we cannot say that the finding of \"no substantial cause\" worked a miscarriage of justice. On this chiaroscuro record, the jury supportably could have found that Davol was driving in the far left-hand lane of Route 195 eastbound with his siren blaring; that he eased the fire truck partially into the center lane as a prelude to a left-hand turn; that he activated his left directional signal; and that Machado caused the collision by recklessly attempting to pass. A rational jury might well have concluded &#8212; as this jury apparently did &#8212; that Davol was guilty of some slight negligence (say, moving toward the center lane without signaling) but that, in the overall scheme of things, his conduct did not proximately cause the collision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said before that causation questions \"are normally grist for the jury's mill.\" <i>Peckham v. Cont'l Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> 895 F.2d 830, 837 (1st Cir.1990). This case illustrates the point. It is the jury's task, not ours or the trial court's, to resolve conflicts in the testimony. <i>See id.</i> at 839 (holding that this court \"cannot reject possibilities rooted in the record merely because, if sitting as factfinders, we would likely have drawn a different set of conclusions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have one last arrow in their quiver. They insist that certain of the jury's answers to the special questions were irreconcilably inconsistent. This claim requires an understanding of a further question posed by the court to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of resolving the City's third-party complaint (its property damage suit against Machado), Question No. 7 asked the jurors to apportion negligence between Davol and Machado. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 85. In response, the jurors found Davol 1% negligent and Machado 99% negligent. The appellants posit that this answer (in particular, the finding that Davol was 1% negligent) is fatally inconsistent with the jurors' response to Question No. 2 (in which they determined that Davol's conduct was not a substantial cause of the appellants' damages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is hopeless. To begin with, it has been forfeited. The special questions here were propounded pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> When the verdict was returned, the appellants did not raise a claim of inconsistency before the court discharged the jury. In that situation, failure to object to an alleged inconsistency while the jury is still in the box forfeits a party's objection, subject only to the possibility of relief for plain error. <i>See Peckham,</i> 895 F.2d at 836; <i>McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp.,</i> 809 F.2d 129, 134 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not explore the parameters of plain error review because no less an authority than the Supreme Court has instructed that \"[w]here there is a view of the case that makes the jury's answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way.\" <i>Atl. &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd.,</i> 369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962). Here, one easily can conceive of theories that harmonize the jury's answer to Question No. 7 with its answer to Question No. 2. For example, the jury may have thought Davol's 1% negligence insubstantial and &#8212; consistent with the law of the case &#8212; insufficient to support a finding of proximate cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, each of the appellants' arguments in support of their new trial motion lacks merit.

On February 5, 1997, plaintiffs-appellants Beverly Correia and John Carvalho were passengers in a car heading eastbound on Route 195 in Seekonk, Massachusetts. The driver, Russell Machado, was proceeding in the far left-hand lane of a six-lane divided highway. At the same time and place, defendant-appellee Roderick Davol, Jr., a firefighter, was driving a fire engine owned by the City of East Providence, Rhode Island (the City). Although Seekonk and East Providence repose in separate states, they are contiguous communities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Davol was responding to an accident that had occurred in East Providence. To reach the scene of the accident, he needed to make a U-turn and access the westbound lanes of Route 195. As he attempted to guide the fire engine through that maneuver, it collided with Machado's vehicle. The crash occurred in broad daylight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is considerable dispute about the etiology of the collision. According to Davol, the fire truck was traveling in the far left-hand lane (in front of Machado's car) with its siren blaring. As he approached an emergency vehicle turnaround in the median strip, he slowed the truck, swung to the right (straddling the far left and center lanes) in order to execute the wide left turn, and activated the directional signal. The appellants tell a different tale. They maintain that the fire engine was fully in the center lane all along and veered to the left without activating either its siren or blinker lights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Machado's car (which was trying to pass on the left) collided with the fire truck (which was trying to enter the turnaround). Both vehicles were badly damaged and the appellants sustained severe injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), the appellants brought suit against the City, the City treasurer (as an \"official capacity\" defendant), and Davol in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The City retorted by filing a third-party complaint against Machado for the cost of repairing the fire engine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, pretrial proceedings were uneventful. We mention only one aspect. The district court set the case for trial in December of 2001. On November 28, the appellants asked the court to postpone the trial for three months, expressing concern that the jury would be prejudiced in favor of a firefighter-defendant due to the publicity surrounding the events of September 11, 2001, and the sentiment engendered by those events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As matters turned out, the court subsequently delayed the trial for a few weeks in hopes of achieving a settlement. Negotiations proved fruitless and a five-day trial commenced on January 14, 2002. The district court submitted a verdict sheet to the jury that incorporated several special interrogatories. These questions addressed both the appellants' personal injury claims and the City's property damage claim. In connection with the former, the jury returned a take-nothing verdict. In connection with the latter, the jury apportioned negligence 99% to Machado and 1% to Davol, and awarded the City $72,801. The district court entered judgment for the defendants on the take-nothing verdict and for the City on the property damage award (albeit in a modified amount).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants filed a timely motion for a new trial. The take-nothing verdict, they said, confirmed their fears about the ripple effect of the September 11 tragedy, contravened both the law and the weight of the evidence, and highlighted an irreconcilable inconsistency in the jury's answers to the special questions. The district court rebuffed this asseverational array in a thoughtful rescript. <i>See Carvalho v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576948\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576948/carvalho-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We review a district court's denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion. <i>Macaulay v.

This makes sense because even the most scrupulous study of an algid appellate record cannot put the reader on an equal footing with the trial judge, who has gained first-hand knowledge of the nuances of a particular case. Given this deferential standard of review, we will not deem the denial of a continuance erroneous unless our canvass of the record indicates that \"the trial court indulged a serious error of law or suffered a meaningful lapse of judgment, resulting in substantial prejudice to the movant.\" <i>United States v.

The lower court rejected this contention both before trial and in its post-verdict opinion. On the later occasion, it explained that the jury \"most likely shared in the respect that fire fighters have earned from those for whom they risk their lives,\" but that the appellants nonetheless received a fair trial. <i>Carvalho,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d at 135 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset that the appellants' argument is an unusual one. Typically, a motion for a continuance on the ground of pretrial publicity involves publicity directly related to the litigants or the matters at issue in the litigation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moreno Morales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486363\"><a href=\"/opinion/486363/united-states-v-rafael-moreno-morales-united-states-of-america-v-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 730 (1st Cir.1987); <i>Delaney v.

Here, however, the allegedly prejudicial publicity is exogenous in the sense that it bears no direct connection to either the litigants or the litigation. While publicity of this sort occasionally may necessitate postponement of a trial, we suspect that such occasions will be rare.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the appellants' argument depends upon the notion that the events of September 11 so exalted first responders that, for many months thereafter, no one who sat across a courtroom from a police officer or a firefighter could get a fair shake. We think that argument underestimates a trial court's ability to cope with public sentiment. The best way to ensure that jurors do not harbor biases for or against the parties is for the trial court to conduct a thorough voir dire examination. <i>See Patton v. Yount,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111228\"><a href=\"/opinion/111228/patton-v-yount/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span>, 1038 &amp; n. 13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111228\"><a href=\"/opinion/111228/patton-v-yount/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Assuming that venirepersons pass through this screen, the trial court thereafter may operate on the presumption that the chosen jurors will obey the judge's instructions to put extraneous matters aside and decide each case on its merits. <i>See Richardson v.

While the presumption that jurors follow the court's instructions is rebuttable, rebutting it takes more than empty rhetoric.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellants have wholly failed to rebut the presumption. To warrant a continuance on the ground of potential jury contamination, the appellants had to do more than show that the jurors were exposed to pervasive (and potentially influential) news accounts. They had to carry the added burden of demonstrating that the exposure was likely to result in unfair prejudice. <i>United States</i> <i>v. Orlando-Figueroa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199119\"><a href=\"/opinion/199119/united-states-v-orlando-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Moreno Morales,</i> 815 F.2d at 733-34. The requisite prejudice can be shown either directly (say, by proof of actual bias among the seated jurors) or indirectly (say, by inferences arising out of circumstantial evidence). <i>See Moreno Morales,</i> 815 F.3d at 731, 734-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have not shown any cognizable prejudice here. The district court conducted a thorough voir dire. It queried all the potential jurors about their biases vis-&#224;-vis firefighters and excused the one juror who expressed such a bias (the juror in question had a son who was a firefighter). The appellants' counsel neither sought to have the court augment its inquiry nor suggested any other questions that might usefully be posed. The questioning did not reveal anything even remotely indicating actual bias on the part of any seated juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, the circumstantial evidence falls far short of what would be needed to raise a presumption of prejudice. The fact that only one member of the venire had to be excused because of a pro-firefighter bias is itself telling. <i>See Murphy v. Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109270\"><a href=\"/opinion/109270/murphy-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span>, 803, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109270\"><a href=\"/opinion/109270/murphy-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span> (1975). And to cinch matters, the district court instructed the jurors, both at the commencement of the trial and in the charge, to decide the case based strictly and solely on the evidence. The court's language was firm and pointed. There is nothing in the record before us that casts doubt upon the presumption that the jurors followed these instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the district court handled this issue with great sensitivity. The careful voir dire examination, the clear instructions, and the absence of any evidentiary basis for a finding of prejudice speak volumes. Those features impel us to hold that the court acted well within the realm of its discretion in denying the requested continuance. <i>Cf. United States v.

The granting or denial of a motion for a new trial is a procedural matter governed by a directly applicable federal rule: Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a). <i>See</i> 11 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2802, at 42 (2d ed. 1995 &amp; Supp.2003); 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 59.03, at 59-12 (3d. ed.2003).

When a trial court applies an incorrect legal standard to a motion for a new trial, one possible course of action is to remand for reconsideration. <i>See, e.g., Wagner v.

That course is unnecessary in this case because the federal and Massachusetts standards for granting or denying a new trial are identical in all relevant respects. <i>Compare, e.g., Wagenmann v.

In response to Question No. 1, the jury declared that Davol had been \"negligent while turning his fire truck into the [Route 195] crossover.\" In response to Question No. 2, it declared that Davol's negligence was not \"a substantial or proximate cause of [the appellants'] injur[ies] and damages.\" The appellants concede that negligence was an open question appropriate for jury consideration. They argue, however, that once the jurors found Davol negligent, they were legally obliged to find that his negligence proximately caused their injuries and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants cobble together this theory out of a series of stipulations entered into among the parties in connection with the authentication and admissibility of various medical bills and reports. The operative language of each stipulation identified the bills and reports as relating to treatment for \"injuries sustained as a result of the motor vehicle accident of February 5, 1997.\" The appellants construe this language as a legally binding admission of proximate cause. This interpretation elevates hope over reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determinations as to a stipulation's meaning and legal effect are determinations of law, and, thus, engender de novo review. <i>G&#243;mez v.

Courts should construe stipulations in accordance with accepted principles of general contract law. <i>Id.</i> Context can be &#8212; and often is &#8212; of decretory significance. <i>See, e.g., id.; Newport Plaza Assocs. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank (In re Newport Plaza Assocs.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600262\"><a href=\"/opinion/600262/in-re-newport-plaza-associates-lp-debtor-newport-plaza-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 646 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the trial court read the stipulations as falling well short of an admission of proximate cause and charged the jurors that causation was for them to determine. This was undeniably correct. Fairly read, the stipulations conceded that the appellants had suffered injuries in the collision and had incurred reasonable hospital and medical expenses in an effort to cure and relieve those injuries. The stipulations also admitted that the injuries and damages flowed from the crash &#8212; but not that anyone's negligence caused the accident. Because nothing in the stipulations even remotely approaches a concession of causation vis-&#224;-vis the occurrence of the accident, the stipulations supply no basis for overturning the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next contend that the jury's answer to Question No. 2 was against the weight of the evidence. They hammer the version of the accident that they espoused to the jury and note that their accident reconstructionist, one McNally, opined that Davol's turning maneuver was the primary cause of the collision. They also excoriate the district court's rejection of their claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of argument does not hold water. A party challenging a trial court's determination that a verdict did not contradict the weight of the evidence faces a steep uphill climb. The challenger must show that the evidence so far preponderates against the verdict that upholding it will perpetuate a manifest miscarriage of justice. <i>Putnam Res.,</i> 958 F.2d at 459; <i>Wagenmann,</i> 829 F.2d at 200-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' effort to carry this burden fails: their brief does not present a balanced view of the facts, but, rather, insupportably discounts (and, to some extent, blithely overlooks) the evidence favorable to the verdict. Taken as a whole, the proof in this case was not one-sided. It could well have led rational minds to differ as to the issue of causation. <i>See Carvalho,</i> 188 F.Supp.2d at 134-35 (highlighting permissible inferences from the evidence that supported the jury verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the appellants' argument succumbs to the law of the case. The lower court's instructions laid out the ground rules. The court told the jurors, without objection, that returning a verdict for the appellants required them to find not only that Davol breached an actionable duty (i.e., that he was negligent) but also that this negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. The court's instructions included the following explanation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Proximate cause\" is defined as any cause which in a natural and continuous sequence, unburdened by any intervening cause, produces the injury complained of and without which the injurious result would not have occurred. In plainer English, a defendant's negligent conduct is the proximate cause of harm to another if his conduct is a <i>substantial factor</i> in bringing about that harm. (Emphasis supplied.) Question No. 2 reflected the substance of this instruction: \"Was Fireman Davol's negligence a substantial or proximate cause of injur[ies] and damages to [the appellants]?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the instruction and the question jibe with substantive principles of Massachusetts law. <i>See, e.g., Jorgensen v. Mass. Port Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543065\"><a href=\"/opinion/543065/lisa-jorgensen-v-massachusetts-port-authority-appeal-of-donald-hertzfeldt/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 524 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting that causation under Massachusetts negligence law requires a showing that the defendant's conduct was a \"substantial... factor\" in bringing about the alleged harm); <i>Tritsch v. Boston Edison Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000926\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000926/tritsch-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000926\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000926/tritsch-v-boston-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 267 (1973) (same). Moreover, the appellants did not object either to the instruction or to the form of Question No. 2. In the absence of a contemporaneous objection, the instruction became the law of the case. <i>See Milone,</i> 847 F.2d at 38-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That dooms the appellants' argument. Given the law of the case and the totality of the proof, we cannot say that the finding of \"no substantial cause\" worked a miscarriage of justice. On this chiaroscuro record, the jury supportably could have found that Davol was driving in the far left-hand lane of Route 195 eastbound with his siren blaring; that he eased the fire truck partially into the center lane as a prelude to a left-hand turn; that he activated his left directional signal; and that Machado caused the collision by recklessly attempting to pass. A rational jury might well have concluded &#8212; as this jury apparently did &#8212; that Davol was guilty of some slight negligence (say, moving toward the center lane without signaling) but that, in the overall scheme of things, his conduct did not proximately cause the collision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said before that causation questions \"are normally grist for the jury's mill.\" <i>Peckham v. Cont'l Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536169\"><a href=\"/opinion/536169/scott-peckham-v-continental-casualty-insurance-co-scott-peckham-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span>, 837 (1st Cir.1990). This case illustrates the point. It is the jury's task, not ours or the trial court's, to resolve conflicts in the testimony. <i>See id.</i> at 839 (holding that this court \"cannot reject possibilities rooted in the record merely because, if sitting as factfinders, we would likely have drawn a different set of conclusions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have one last arrow in their quiver. They insist that certain of the jury's answers to the special questions were irreconcilably inconsistent. This claim requires an understanding of a further question posed by the court to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of resolving the City's third-party complaint (its property damage suit against Machado), Question No. 7 asked the jurors to apportion negligence between Davol and Machado. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, &#167; 85. In response, the jurors found Davol 1% negligent and Machado 99% negligent. The appellants posit that this answer (in particular, the finding that Davol was 1% negligent) is fatally inconsistent with the jurors' response to Question No. 2 (in which they determined that Davol's conduct was not a substantial cause of the appellants' damages).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is hopeless. To begin with, it has been forfeited. The special questions here were propounded pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> When the verdict was returned, the appellants did not raise a claim of inconsistency before the court discharged the jury. In that situation, failure to object to an alleged inconsistency while the jury is still in the box forfeits a party's objection, subject only to the possibility of relief for plain error. <i>See Peckham,</i> 895 F.2d at 836; <i>McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481636\"><a href=\"/opinion/481636/james-r-mcisaac-v-didriksen-fishing-corp-appeal-of-the-wise-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 134 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not explore the parameters of plain error review because no less an authority than the Supreme Court has instructed that \"[w]here there is a view of the case that makes the jury's answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way.\" <i>Atl. &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106368\"><a href=\"/opinion/106368/atlantic-gulf-stevedores-inc-v-ellerman-lines-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 364, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106368\"><a href=\"/opinion/106368/atlantic-gulf-stevedores-inc-v-ellerman-lines-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span> (1962). Here, one easily can conceive of theories that harmonize the jury's answer to Question No. 7 with its answer to Question No. 2. For example, the jury may have thought Davol's 1% negligence insubstantial and &#8212; consistent with the law of the case &#8212; insufficient to support a finding of proximate cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, each of the appellants' arguments in support of their new trial motion lacks merit.
