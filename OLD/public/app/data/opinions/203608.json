Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Judith H. Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for\nappellant.\n     Aixa Maldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        December 23, 2008\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.     By amendment, the United States\n\nSentencing Commission lowered the offense levels associated with\n\ncrack cocaine offenses.     See USSG App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The\n\nCommission thereafter issued a declaration of retroactivity with\n\nrespect to those lowered offense levels. See USSG App. C, Amend.\n\n713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).      Focusing on Amendment 706, defendant-\n\nappellant    Felipe   Ayala-Pizarro   moved    for   a   reduction     of   his\n\npreviously imposed sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).1\n\nThe district court found that it lacked authority to reduce the\n\nsentence, and Ayala-Pizarro appeals.\n\n            Because   Ayala-Pizarro's   single-issue      appeal      poses   a\n\nquestion    substantially   identical   to    that   posed   in   a   second,\n\nunrelated case, United States v. Caraballo, we consolidated the two\n\nappeals for oral argument.     We heard argument on November 5, 2008.\n\nWe elected, however, to issue separate opinions in the two cases.\n\n            The opinion in Caraballo issued on December 22, 2008.\n\nSee United States v. Caraballo, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2008) [No.\n\n08-1555].    In that decision, we held that if an amended guideline\n\ndoes not have the effect of lowering the sentencing range actually\n\nused at sentencing, the defendant's sentence cannot be deemed to\n\n\n\n     1\n       Ayala-Pizarro filed his motion on January 28, 2008, even\nthough the Sentencing Commission's declaration of retroactivity was\nnot effective until March 3, 2008. Nevertheless, the order denying\nthe motion was not entered on the district court docket until May\n12, 2008. Under the circumstances, we regard the premature filing\nof the motion as inconsequential.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fhave been \"based on\" that range within the intendment of section\n\n3582(c)(2).        Id. at ___ [slip op. at 9].         Thus, because Caraballo\n\nwas sentenced as a career offender rather than as a crack cocaine\n\noffender, id. at ___ [slip op. at 11], Amendment 706 did not pave\n\nthe    way   for    a   sentence   reduction    even   though   his   underlying\n\noffenses were crack cocaine offenses.            See id. at ___ [slip op. at\n\n11].\n\n             Ayala-Pizarro,        who   was   charged   with   crack   cocaine\n\noffenses but was sentenced as a career offender, is situated the\n\nsame as Caraballo in all material respects. Accordingly, this case\n\nis controlled by our decision in Caraballo.\n\n             To be sure, there are two arguable differences between\n\nthe cases. To avoid any misunderstanding, we briefly address them.\n\n             First, the original sentencing in Caraballo took place\n\nunder an advisory guidelines regime, that is, after the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245-46\n\n(2005), whereas the original sentencing in Ayala-Pizarro took place\n\nunder a mandatory, pre-Booker guidelines regime.                But as we made\n\npellucid in Caraballo, Booker has no effect on whether a career\n\noffender's sentence not \"based on\" a lowered sentencing range for\n\nan underlying offense opens the gate for a sentence reduction under\n\nsection 3582(c)(2).        See Caraballo, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 9-\n\n10].\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            Second,    Caraballo   received   a   non-guideline   sentence\n\npredicated primarily on his deteriorating health. Id. at ___ [slip\n\nop. at 11-12].    In contrast, Ayala-Pizarro received a within-the-\n\nrange sentence.       We fail to grasp how this difference works any\n\nmeaningful distinction between the two cases with respect to the\n\navailability of a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).\n\n            We need go no further.     The appellant's argument in this\n\ncase is, for all practical purposes, congruent with Caraballo's\n\nargument: that he was originally sentenced based on a sentencing\n\nrange that was lowered by the retroactive crack cocaine amendment\n\nto the drug quantity table.        Here, as in Caraballo, the drug type\n\nwas alluded to in the course of constructing the defendant's\n\nsentence but, ultimately, the sentence actually imposed was based\n\non a sentencing range derived from the career offender guideline.\n\nIt   follows   inexorably    that,    for   the   reasons   elucidated   in\n\nCaraballo, we must reject Ayala-Pizarro's appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
