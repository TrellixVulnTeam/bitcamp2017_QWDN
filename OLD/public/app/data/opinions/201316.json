Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f           JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.          Roger Edwards,\n\nLLC, appeals from a grant of summary judgment against it as to part\n\nof its contract suit against Fiddes & Son, Ltd., and judgment on a\n\njury verdict against Edwards on the remaining issues.               Edwards\n\ncontends that the Magistrate Judge1 erred in entering partial\n\nsummary judgment based on the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that\n\nthe contract had been terminated by an e-mail from Edwards stating,\n\n\"[I]t is over. . . [W]e are done\"; Edwards contends that the e-mail\n\nwas susceptible of more than one meaning and that there is a\n\ngenuine issue of fact as to whether the contract was terminated by\n\nthe e-mail. Edwards also contends that the Magistrate Judge should\n\nhave allowed Edwards to recover damages based on Fiddes's failure\n\nto give reasonable notice of termination. Edwards further contends\n\nthat the district court erred in rejecting Edwards's proposed\n\nanticipatory repudiation jury instruction.         We affirm.\n\n           Larry Mann is the owner of Roger Edwards, LLC, a Maine\n\nlimited   liability    company.   Edwards    had   been   distributing    a\n\nfurniture wax called \"Briwax\" since 1988.           In June 2000, Mann\n\nentered negotiations with Fiddes, a British wax manufacturer based\n\nin Cardiff, Wales, about becoming a distributor for Fiddes.           In e-\n\nmails exchanged from June to August 7, 2000, Mann and Fiddes's\n\nprincipal,    Robert     Fiddes   Gooding,    worked      out   a     trial\n\n\n     1\n      The suit was submitted to United States Magistrate Judge\nDavid M. Cohen, by the consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 636(c).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdistributorship agreement.   The terms were never memorialized in\n\none contract document, but must be gleaned from the exchange of\n\nlengthy e-mails.    Mann asked for certain states as \"protected\n\nterritory.\"   Gooding responded, \"We would grant territorial rights\n\nto the 34 states as requested, with a periodic review rather based\n\non both quantity sold and efforts extended.        I would like to\n\ndiscuss this in greater detail with you. . . .\"   Mann urged Gooding\n\nto finalize the agreement, and Gooding     responded, \"I . . . am\n\npleased to grant territorial rights to those states requested.\"\n\nOn August 7, Mann e-mailed: \"Sounds good–we have a deal.\"       The\n\nparties stipulated that the agreement did not have a specified\n\ntermination date and was not for a fixed duration.\n\n          Edwards began buying Fiddes products in September 2000.\n\nBy November 2001, the relationship was beginning to fray, with Mann\n\ncomplaining about inadequate promotional literature and Fiddes\n\ncomplaining about unpaid invoices.    Mann and Gooding met in New\n\nYork in November, but relations did not improve. Mann wrote Fiddes\n\nthat he suspected that Fiddes was not turning over to him \"all\n\nFiddes Supreme business of serious consequence,\" and Fiddes voiced\n\nits suspicions that Mann was selling his biggest customers Briwax\n\ninstead of Fiddes Supreme.\n\n          On November 17, 2001, Mann wrote to Gooding asking for\n\nGooding to give Mann a letter agreement to present to a banker in\n\nconnection with Edwards's application for inventory financing.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f(Mann later testified that the \"banker\" was Mann himself, and that\n\nhe   had   walked      back   and   forth    between      two   chairs    during   the\n\n\"conversation\" reported in the e-mails.)                   Mann wrote to Gooding\n\nthat the banker had advised him that \"it could be worth a lot more\n\ntaking you to court than following through with Fiddes Wood Care.\"\n\nGooding did not send the requested \"letter agreement,\" and on\n\nNovember 19, 2001 at 12:18 a.m., Mann wrote Gooding:\n\n             I have to assume that by your refusal to\n             provide a letter of our agreement, you do\n             realize it is over. Period. [T]oday for that\n             matter, we are done. We will be in a mode of\n             recover our costs through all means we have\n             including offset, clear out inventory we have\n             and pursue litigation.\n\nThat same day at 9:21 a.m., Gooding responded:\n\n             Your clear decision to revoke all official\n             distribution rights for our range of wood\n             finishing materials in the agreed 34 states is\n             indeed disappointing, however not surprising.\n             It has become evident from your recent\n             correspondence that you had neither the\n             financial means nor the intention to develop\n             our business any further.\n\n\nTwo days later, after further e-mails from Mann requesting the\n\nletter     for   the    \"banker,\"     Gooding      sent    Mann   an     e-mail    that\n\nreproduced       the   two    November      19   e-mails    excerpted      above    and\n\nconcluded: \"We will not respond to any further requests concerning\n\nthe above whilst the balance of your account remains unpaid.\"\n\n             Edwards brought suit in the state court of Maine for\n\nbreach of contract and specific performance.                    The breach alleged\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fwas stated in one simple paragraph:\n\n          The Defendant has breached its agreement with\n          the Plaintiff by bypassing the Defendant's\n          distributorship in order to sell directly to\n          end users within the 34 exclusive territorial\n          states provided to Plaintiff, and/or by\n          permitting other distributors to market and\n          distribute   Fiddes   products   within   the\n          Plaintiff's exclusive territory.\n\n\nFiddes removed the case to federal court and counterclaimed for\n\namounts Edwards owed on unpaid invoices for Fiddes products.\n\n          Fiddes moved for summary judgment on the ground that if\n\nthere was a contract, Edwards terminated it on November 19, 2001,\n\nand was not entitled to specific performance or to damages accruing\n\nafter that date.    The Magistrate Judge granted partial summary\n\njudgment based on Edwards's admissions of key facts stated in\n\nFiddes's summary of undisputed facts. Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes\n\n& Son, Ltd., 245 F. Supp. 2d 251, 261 (D. Me. 2003).        Fiddes\n\nstated:\n\n\n\n     27.   Robert Fiddes Gooding wrote to Larry Mann on\n     November 21, 2001 outlining the two e-mails that\n     reflected Mann's termination of the parties' relationship\n     and Robert Fiddes' acceptance of that termination.\n     (Plaintiff's Admissions, Exhibit AA, attached hereto at\n     Tab 19, authenticated in Plaintiff's Admissions, at ¶\n     38).\n\n(Emphasis added.)   The statement thus references a November 21 e-\n\nmail that in turn reproduced the two November 19 e-mails that\n\nFiddes said terminated the contract. The Exhibit AA referred to in\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fthe statement actually reproduces three e-mails, rather than two,\n\nbut Exhibit AA does include two November 19 communications. In the\n\nfirst of these, at 12:18 a.m., Mann stated, \"[I]t is over. Period.\n\ntoday [sic] for that matter, we're done.\"      Goodings's response at\n\n9:21 a.m. on the same day stated, \"Your clear decision to revoke\n\nall official distribution rights. . . is indeed disappointing,\n\nhowever not surprising.\" Edwards admitted paragraph 27 of Fiddes's\n\nstatement, which characterized the November 19 e-mails as \"Mann's\n\ntermination\" and \"Fiddes' acceptance of that termination.\"\n\n          Based on this admission, the Magistrate Judge held that\n\nEdwards terminated the contract on November 19, 2001, and Fiddes\n\naccepted the termination.2     245 F. Supp. 2d at 262. Accordingly,\n\nthe Magistrate Judge held that Edwards could not recover damages\n\nthat accrued after November 19, 2001, and Edwards was not entitled\n\nto specific performance.     Id. at 262-63.   However, the Magistrate\n\nJudge held that Edwards was entitled to trial on the issue of\n\nbreach and damages before November 19.     Id. at 263.   The Magistrate\n\nJudge also held that Fiddes was entitled to summary judgment on\n\nCounts I and II of its counterclaim for the price of the Fiddes\n\nproducts sold to Edwards.    Id. at 265.\n\n          At trial the jury answered special interrogatories.      The\n\njury found that \"a contract existed between the plaintiff and the\n\n\n     2\n      The Magistrate Judge concluded that the common law of Maine\ngoverned the distributorship contract, and the parties do not\ndispute this on appeal.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fdefendant granting the plaintiff the protected right to sell the\n\ndefendant's products in 323 states\" and that the defendant did not\n\nbreach the contract.         The Magistrate Judge entered judgment for\n\nFiddes on the jury verdict and also entered judgment for Fiddes in\n\nthe amount of $17,286 plus costs and interest on its counterclaim.\n\n               Edwards contends that the Magistrate Judge erred in\n\nentering partial summary judgment against it and in denying its\n\nrequested anticipatory repudiation instruction.               Fiddes cross-\n\nappealed, but its appeal is limited to an argument about what\n\nshould happen on remand if we were to reverse.\n\n                                      I.\n\n               We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party, giving the nonmoving party the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences.        Nicolo v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 201 F.3d\n\n29, 33 (1st Cir. 2000).         Summary judgment is appropriate if the\n\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and\n\naffidavits on file show that there is no genuine issue of material\n\nfact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \"Conjectural allegations, conclusory\n\nassertions,       and   inconsequential    evidence\"   do   not   suffice   to\n\nestablish a genuine issue of fact.          Nicolo, 201 F.3d at 33.\n\n\n\n       3\n      The parties' communications often refer to \"34 states,\" but\nthey miscounted. The correct number was 32.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           Edwards contends that the Magistrate Judge erred in\n\nholding that Edwards had admitted that Mann terminated the contract\n\non November 19 and that Fiddes accepted that termination.            Edwards\n\nstates: \"Plaintiff made no such admission.\"             The record shows\n\nEdwards did indeed make such an admission.\n\n           Edwards admitted paragraph No. 27 in Fiddes's statement\n\nof undisputed facts, which said that the November 21 e-mail set out\n\ntwo earlier e-mails \"that reflected Mann's termination of the\n\nparties'   relationship    and   Robert   Fiddes'     acceptance    of   that\n\ntermination.\"   (emphasis   added).       Paragraph    No.   27   referenced\n\nExhibit AA, which reproduced the Mann to Gooding e-mail of November\n\n19 at 12:18 a.m. (\"[I]t is over. Period.\") and the Gooding to Mann\n\ne-mail of 9:21 a.m.   Edwards does not point to any communication by\n\nit   withdrawing   the    termination     before    Fiddes   accepted     it.\n\nEdwards's admissions thus establish that the two e-mails on the\n\nmorning of November 19 terminated the contract.         See Drinkwater v.\n\nPatten Realty Corp., 563 A.2d 772, 775 (Me. 1989) (\"An agreement to\n\nrescind a contract is itself a contract . . . .\"); Simpson v.\n\nEmmons, 99 A. 658, 660 (Me. 1917) (where one party to a contract\n\nrepudiates it, the other party is authorized to rescind); Listman\n\nMill Co. v. Dufresne, 88 A. 354, 355 (Me. 1913) (if one party's\n\nrenunciation of an executory contract is accepted by the other\n\nparty, the contract is rescinded).        Edwards’s position on appeal\n\nthat Mann's words were \"merely expressing frustration\" is nothing\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fbut   an    attempt    to   take    back    its    earlier     admission    without\n\nforthrightly asking for such relief.              The Magistrate Judge did not\n\nerr   in   entering     summary    judgment       on    the   basis   of   Edwards's\n\nadmission. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (authorizing entry of summary\n\njudgment based, inter alia, on admissions on file).\n\n                                       II.\n\n                Edwards's next argument is that the Magistrate Judge\n\nerred      in     denying   its     requested          anticipatory     repudiation\n\ninstruction.           Edwards     contends       that    Fiddes      committed   an\n\nanticipatory repudiation before November 19 by failing to provide\n\nthe letter for the imaginary \"banker.\"                  Edwards contends that by\n\nasking for a letter to give to a banker, Edwards was in effect\n\nasking for assurance of Fiddes's performance to which Edwards was\n\nentitled by law, and that Fiddes's failure to provide the letter\n\nthus amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the contract.\n\n                A district court's refusal to give a particular requested\n\ninstruction is reversible error only if the instruction proffered\n\nwas a correct statement of the substantive law, which was not\n\ncovered in the instructions given and which was integral to an\n\nimportant point in the case.4              Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87\n\n\n\n      4\n      Additionally, the party requesting the instruction must\nobject after the jury has been charged but before it has retired to\ndeliberate. Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999); Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 51(c). The parties dispute whether Edwards preserved\nthe objection; we need not delve into this question, because even\nif preserved, the point has no merit.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f(1st Cir. 1999).    A district court may not refuse to instruct on an\n\narea of law central to the case merely because of technical defects\n\nin a proffered instruction, Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp.,\n\n214 F.3d 57, 64 n.7 (1st Cir. 2000), but a party that presents its\n\nlegal theory to the court only in the form of a substantially\n\nflawed instruction \"cannot fault the district court either for\n\nfailing to separate wheat from chaff or for refusing to give the\n\nrequested instruction,\" id. at 63.\n\n            Edwards proffered an instruction stating:\n\n                 \"Anticipatory      repudiation\"       or\n            \"anticipatory breach\" of a contract exists\n            where one party fails or refuses to comply\n            with the terms of the contract.\n                 If you determine that the defendant by\n            its conduct anticipatorily repudiated or\n            breached the contract, such conduct is in\n            breach of the terms of the contract, and both\n            discharges the obligation of the plaintiff,\n            and allows the plaintiff to receive damages\n            reasonably caused by the repudiation.\n\n\n            Under   Maine   law,   “an   anticipatory    repudiation    of   a\n\ncontract is 'a definite and unequivocal manifestation of intention\n\non the part of the repudiator that he will not render the promised\n\nperformance when the time fixed for it in the contract arrives.'\"\n\nWholesale Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. Decker, 630 A.2d 710, 711 (Me.\n\n1993) (quoting 4 Corbin, Corbin on Contracts § 973 (1951)).             \"The\n\nwords or conduct evidencing [the anticipatory repudiation] must be\n\ndefinite,    unequivocal,    and   absolute.\"      Id.      Moreover,    the\n\nrepudiation must concern obligations or promises going to the whole\n\n                                    -10-\n\fconsideration.      Martell Bros. v. Donbury, Inc., 577 A.2d 334, 337\n\nn.1 (Me. 1990).\n\n            Edwards argues that it was entitled to request and\n\nreceive assurance of Fiddes's intent to perform and that failure to\n\nprovide the assurance constituted anticipatory repudiation, but\n\nEdwards cites no authority governing when a party is entitled to\n\nassurance or what form the assurance must take.                  Our own research\n\nshows that Maine has applied the Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\nrule concerning requests for assurance of performance.                   Drinkwater\n\nv. Patten Realty Corp., 563 A.2d 772, 776 (Me. 1989) (applying\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 251).\n\n            Fiddes contends it was proper to deny the instruction\n\nbecause    there    was    no    evidence   from   which    a    jury    could   have\n\nconcluded that Fiddes repudiated the contract.                   It would be more\n\naccurate    to     say    that    the   record     includes      admissions      that\n\ndemonstrate that the request for a letter was not a request for\n\nassurance of Fiddes's performance of the June-August 2000 contract.\n\nThe trial record is clear that Mann never asked for a letter for\n\nhimself, but instead wrote Gooding that the letter was for the\n\n\"banker.\"        Mann     sent    Gooding   a    detailed       e-mail   about    his\n\nconversation with the banker.5          The e-mail did not reveal that the\n\n\n     5\n      Mann’s e-mail said the banker asked Mann to call on Monday to\nget an appointment to see him, the banker insisted Mann should meet\nwith him and a legal team who wanted to take his case “for\nfree,”and the banker mentioned punitive damages and “approximately\n1 million in 'Goodwill.'”\n\n                                        -11-\n\f“banker” was Mann himself, when he was sitting in his other chair.\n\nA demand for assurance must be made in accord with the duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.    Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 251,\n\ncmt. d; see id. § 205, cmt. a (referring to good faith as “honesty\n\nin fact”).\n\n            Mann never supplied the terms he was asking Fiddes to\n\nagree to, instead putting the onus on Fiddes to reduce the parties'\n\nvoluminous communications to something that would satisfy the\n\n\"banker.\"    See Mann to Fiddes, November 17, 2001 (\"I was going to\n\ncontact you with some of the details the letter must contain, but\n\nbasically, it is exactly the same as we have been operating under.\n\n. . . So you know what it needs to say, yes??\").    The record also\n\nshows that Gooding interpreted Mann's request as a demand for \"a\n\nletter offering you exclusive distribution of our products into 34\n\nstates for the next two years.\"     Mann's own trial testimony was\n\nthat the letter was supposed to confirm a \"new deal\" discussed at\n\na meeting between Gooding and Mann in New York in November 20016\n\ninvolving making Edwards \"the only importer of [Fiddes] wood\n\nfinishing products into the United States within two years.\"\n\nEdwards also filed a Statement of Material Facts in Dispute stating\n\nthat Mann's request for a letter \"grew\" out of the November meeting\n\nin New York.    Similarly, in its brief opposing summary judgment,\n\n\n     6\n      There is some confusion in the record as to whether the\nmeeting occurred in October or November; the discrepancy is\nimmaterial.\n\n                                -12-\n\fEdwards said, \"[T]he request for a 'letter' was triggered by a\n\nseparate deal under discussion.         That deal involved 'spray wax,'\n\nand machinery, which was a huge new and additional undertaking . .\n\n. It is for that reason that a letter was requested subsequent to\n\nthe October [sic], 2001 meeting.\"            It is undisputed that the\n\ncontract memorialized in the June-August 2000 e-mails did not\n\ninclude    a     two-year   term   or   an   exclusive    distributorship.\n\nTherefore, Edwards has represented to the court that Mann was\n\nasking for something different from assurance that Fiddes would\n\nperform under the June-August 2000 contract.\n\n           Moreover, Edwards's theory was only presented to the\n\ncourt in the form of a proposed instruction with substantial legal\n\nerrors.   Edwards's complaint pleaded breach of the distributorship\n\ncontract by Fiddes selling into the territory, but did not mention\n\na repudiation theory or a request for assurance of performance.\n\nNeither Mann's affidavit in opposition to summary judgment nor his\n\nsummary judgment brief mentioned this theory. Edwards mentioned in\n\ninterrogatory answers that Fiddes \"withheld\" a letter, but Edwards\n\ndid not characterize the incident as denial of a request for\n\nassurance or otherwise explain why Fiddes would be obliged to\n\nsupply    such    a   letter.      Edwards   introduced   its   theory   of\n\nrepudiation-by-failure-to-provide-assurance in argument during the\n\ntrial.\n\n           The instruction Edwards presented entirely omitted the\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fconcepts that the anticipatory repudiation must be definite and\n\nunequivocal, that anticipatory repudiation occurs in advance of the\n\ntime fixed for performance, and that the repudiation must go to the\n\nwhole of the consideration.           The instruction did not discuss the\n\npossibility of repudiation by failure to provide assurance.                   The\n\ninstruction as proffered describes an ordinary breach, not an\n\nanticipatory repudiation.           It states tautologically that if the\n\ndefendant breached the contract, this conduct was in breach of the\n\ncontract.    Thus, the instruction proffered was both inaccurate and\n\nmisleadingly incomplete.\n\n             The court gave another, general instruction concerning\n\nbreach of contract, to which Edwards did not object.               Having given\n\na general instruction on breach of contract, the Magistrate Judge\n\nhad no further obligation to piece together an unpleaded theory\n\nthat     Edwards   had    only     hinted   at    by   proposing   a   defective\n\ninstruction.       \"It is hornbook law that a trial court does not\n\ncommit error when it instructs generally about a legal principle\n\nand then declines a party's request for a further instruction that\n\nis misleading, legally incorrect, or incomplete.\" Febres, 214 F.3d\n\nat 63.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            Finally, Edwards argues that the Magistrate Judge erred\n\nin   holding   that      because    Edwards      contended   the   contract   was\n\nterminated on January 18, 2002, Edwards could not claim lost\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fprofits after that date.      See 245 F. Supp. 2d at 262.        This point\n\nis moot, since the Magistrate Judge held immediately afterwards\n\nthat Edwards terminated the contract earlier than January 18, 2002\n\n(on November 19, 2001) and Fiddes accepted the termination.              Id.\n\nEdwards cannot argue that it is entitled to lost profits on account\n\nof Fiddes's failure to give it reasonable notice of termination,\n\nsince Edwards, not Fiddes, terminated the contract.                Nor can\n\nEdwards   argue   that   it   lost   profits   after   January   18,   2002,\n\nresulting from a breach committed by Fiddes before November 19,\n\n2001, since the jury found Fiddes did not breach the contract.\n\n           We therefore put this litigation to a well-deserved rest.\n\n           The judgment in No. 03-2096 is affirmed and No. 03-2195\n\nis dismissed as moot.     Costs shall be taxed in favor of defendant-\n\nappellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f",

Edwards had been distributing a furniture wax called \"Briwax\" since 1988. In June 2000, Mann entered negotiations with Fiddes, a British wax manufacturer based in Cardiff, Wales, about becoming a distributor for Fiddes. In e-mails exchanged from June to August 7, 2000, Mann and Fiddes's principal, Robert Fiddes Gooding, worked out a trial distributorship agreement. The terms were never memorialized in one contract document, but must be gleaned from the exchange of lengthy e-mails. Mann asked for certain states as \"protected territory.\" Gooding responded, \"We would grant territorial rights to the 34 states as requested, with a periodic review rather based on both quantity sold and efforts extended. I would like to discuss this in greater detail with you....\" Mann urged Gooding to finalize the agreement, and Gooding responded, \"I. . . am pleased to grant territorial rights to those states requested.\" On August 7, Mann e-mailed: \"Sounds good &#8212; we have a deal.\" The parties stipulated that the agreement did not have a specified termination date and was not for a fixed duration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards began buying Fiddes products in September 2000. By November 2001, the relationship was beginning to fray, with Mann complaining about inadequate promotional literature and Fiddes complaining about unpaid invoices. Mann and Gooding met in New York in November, but relations did not improve. Mann wrote Fiddes that he suspected that Fiddes was not turning over to him \"all Fiddes Supreme business of serious consequence,\" and Fiddes voiced its suspicions that Mann was selling his biggest customers Briwax instead of Fiddes Supreme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 2001, Mann wrote to Gooding asking for Gooding to give Mann a letter agreement to present to a banker in connection with Edwards's application for inventory financing. (Mann later testified that the \"banker\" was Mann himself, and that he had walked back and forth between two chairs during the \"conversation\" reported in the e-mails.) Mann wrote to Gooding that the banker had advised him that \"it could be worth a lot more taking you to court than following through with Fiddes Wood Care.\" Gooding did not send the requested \"letter agreement,\" and on November 19, 2001 at 12:18 a.m., Mann wrote Gooding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have to assume that by your refusal to provide a letter of our agreement, you do realize it is over.

The Magistrate Judge granted partial summary judgment based on Edwards's admissions of key facts stated in Fiddes's summary of undisputed facts. <i>Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes &amp; Son, Ltd.,</i> 245 F.Supp.2d 251, 261 (D.Me.2003). Fiddes stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">27.

The statement thus references a November 21 e-mail that in turn reproduced the two November 19 e-mails that Fiddes said terminated the contract. The Exhibit AA referred to in the statement actually reproduces three e-mails, rather than two, but Exhibit AA does include two November 19 communications. In the first of these, at 12:18 a.m., Mann stated, \"[I]t is over. Period. today [sic] for that matter, we're done.\" Goodings's response at 9:21 a.m. on the same day stated, \"Your clear decision to revoke all official distribution rights ... is indeed disappointing, however not surprising.\" Edwards admitted paragraph 27 of Fiddes's statement, which characterized the November 19 e-mails as \"Mann's termination\" and \"Fiddes' acceptance of that termination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this admission, the Magistrate Judge held that Edwards terminated the contract on November 19, 2001, and Fiddes accepted the termination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> 245 F.Supp.2d at 262. Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge held that Edwards could not recover damages that accrued after November 19, 2001, and Edwards was not entitled to specific performance. <i>Id.</i> at 262-63. However, the Magistrate Judge held that Edwards was entitled to trial on the issue of breach and damages before November 19. <i>Id.</i> at 263.

Philip Morris, Inc.,</i> 201 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits on file show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \"Conjectural allegations, conclusory assertions, and inconsequential evidence\" do not suffice to establish a genuine issue of fact. <i>Nicolo,</i> 201 F.3d at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards contends that the Magistrate Judge erred in holding that Edwards had admitted that Mann terminated the contract on November 19 and that Fiddes accepted that termination. Edwards states: \"Plaintiff made no such admission.\" The record shows Edwards did indeed make such an admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards admitted paragraph No. 27 in Fiddes's statement of undisputed facts, which said that the November 21 e-mail set out two earlier e-mails <i>\"that reflected Mann's termination of the parties' relationship and Robert Fiddes' acceptance of that termination.\"</i> (emphasis added). Paragraph No. 27 referenced Exhibit AA, which reproduced the Mann to Gooding e-mail of November 19 at 12:18 a.m. (\"[I]t is over. Period.\") and the Gooding to Mann e-mail of 9:21 a.m. Edwards does not point to any communication by it withdrawing the termination before Fiddes accepted it. Edwards's admissions thus establish that the two e-mails on the morning of November 19 terminated the contract. <i>See Drinkwater v. Patten Realty Corp.,</i> 563 A.2d 772, 775 (Me.1989) (\"An agreement to rescind a contract is itself a contract. . . .\"); <i>Simpson v. Emmons,</i> 116 Me. 14, 99 A. 658, 660 (1917) (where one party to a contract repudiates it, the other party is authorized to rescind); <i>Listman Mill Co. v. Dufresne,</i> 111 Me. 104, 88 A. 354, 355 (1913) (if one party's renunciation of an executory contract is accepted by the other party, the contract is rescinded). Edwards's position on appeal that Mann's words were \"merely expressing frustration\" is nothing but an attempt to take back its earlier admission without forthrightly asking for such relief. The Magistrate Judge did not err in entering summary judgment on the basis of Edwards's admission. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (authorizing entry of summary judgment based, <i>inter alia,</i> on admissions on file).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards's next argument is that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying its requested anticipatory repudiation instruction. Edwards contends that Fiddes committed an anticipatory repudiation before November 19 by failing to provide the letter for the imaginary \"banker.\" Edwards contends that by asking for a letter to give to a banker, Edwards was in effect asking for assurance of Fiddes's performance to which Edwards was entitled by law, and that Fiddes's failure to provide the letter thus amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's refusal to give a particular requested instruction is reversible error only if the instruction proffered was a correct statement of the substantive law, which was not covered in the instructions given and which was integral to an important point in the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Faigin v. Kelly,</i> 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir.1999). A district court may not refuse to instruct on an area of law central to the case merely because of technical defects in a proffered instruction, <i>Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp.,</i> 214 F.3d 57, 64 n. 7 (1st Cir.2000), but a party that presents its legal theory to the court only in the form of a substantially flawed instruction \"cannot fault the district court either for failing to separate wheat from chaff or for refusing to give the requested instruction,\" <i>id.</i> at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Edwards proffered an instruction stating:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Anticipatory repudiation\" or \"anticipatory breach\" of a contract exists where one party fails or refuses to comply with the terms of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you determine that the defendant by its conduct anticipatorily repudiated or breached the contract, such conduct is in breach of the terms of the contract, and both discharges the obligation of the plaintiff, and allows the plaintiff to receive damages reasonably caused by the repudiation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, \"an anticipatory repudiation of a contract is `a definite and unequivocal manifestation of intention on the part of the repudiator that he will not render the promised performance when the time fixed for it in the contract arrives.'\" <i>Wholesale Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. Decker,</i> 630 A.2d 710, 711 (Me.1993) (quoting 4 Corbin, <i>Corbin on Contracts</i> &#167; 973 (1951)). \"The words or conduct evidencing [the anticipatory repudiation] must be definite, unequivocal, and absolute.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the repudiation must concern obligations or promises going to the whole consideration. <i>Martell Bros. v.

Our own research shows that Maine has applied the Restatement (Second) of Contracts rule concerning requests for assurance of performance. <i>Drinkwater v. Patten Realty Corp.,</i> 563 A.2d 772, 776 (Me.1989) (applying Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 251).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fiddes contends it was proper to deny the instruction because there was no evidence from which a jury could have concluded that Fiddes repudiated the contract. It would be more accurate to say that the record includes admissions that demonstrate that the request for a letter was not a request for assurance of Fiddes's performance of the June-August 2000 contract. The trial record is clear that Mann never asked for a letter for himself, but instead wrote Gooding that the letter was for the \"banker.\" Mann sent Gooding a detailed e-mail about his conversation with the banker.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The e-mail did not reveal that the \"banker\" was Mann himself, when he was sitting in his other chair. A demand for assurance must be made in accord with the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 251, cmt. d; <i>see id.</i> &#167; 205, cmt. a (referring to good faith as \"honesty in fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mann never supplied the terms he was asking Fiddes to agree to, instead putting the onus on Fiddes to reduce the parties' voluminous communications to something that would satisfy the \"banker.\" <i>See</i> Mann to Fiddes, November 17, 2001 (\"I was going to contact you with some of the details the letter must contain, but basically, it is exactly the same as we have been operating under.... So you know what it needs to say, yes? ?\"). The record also shows that Gooding interpreted Mann's request as a demand for \"a letter offering you exclusive distribution of our products into 34 states for the next two years.\" Mann's own trial testimony was that the letter was supposed to confirm a \"new deal\" discussed at a meeting between Gooding and Mann in New York in November 2001<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> involving making Edwards \"the only importer of [Fiddes] wood finishing products into the United States within two years.\" Edwards also filed a Statement of Material Facts in Dispute stating that Mann's request for a letter \"grew\" out of the November meeting in New York. Similarly, in its brief opposing summary judgment, Edwards said, \"[T]he request for a `letter' was triggered by a separate deal under discussion. That deal involved `spray wax,' and machinery, which was a huge new and additional undertaking ... It is for that reason that a letter was requested subsequent to the October [sic], 2001 meeting.\" It is undisputed that the contract memorialized in the June-August 2000 e-mails did not include a two-year term or an exclusive distributorship. Therefore, Edwards has represented to the court that Mann was asking for something different from assurance that Fiddes would perform under the June-August 2000 contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Edwards's theory was only presented to the court in the form of a proposed instruction with substantial legal errors. Edwards's complaint pleaded breach of the distributorship contract by Fiddes selling into the territory, but did not mention a repudiation theory or a request for assurance of performance. Neither Mann's affidavit in opposition to summary judgment nor his summary judgment brief mentioned this theory. Edwards mentioned in interrogatory answers that Fiddes \"withheld\" a letter, but Edwards did not characterize the incident as denial of a request for assurance or otherwise explain why Fiddes would be obliged to supply such a letter. Edwards introduced its theory of repudiation-by-failure-to-provide-assurance in argument during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction Edwards presented entirely omitted the concepts that the anticipatory repudiation must be definite and unequivocal, that anticipatory repudiation occurs in advance of the time fixed for performance, and that the repudiation must go to the whole of the consideration. The instruction did not discuss the possibility of repudiation by failure to provide assurance. The instruction as proffered describes an ordinary breach, not an anticipatory repudiation.

Having given a general instruction on breach of contract, the Magistrate Judge had no further obligation to piece together an unpleaded theory that Edwards had only hinted at by proposing a defective instruction. \"It is hornbook law that a trial court does not commit error when it instructs generally about a legal principle and then declines a party's request for a further instruction that is misleading, legally incorrect, or incomplete.\" <i>Febres,</i> 214 F.3d at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Edwards argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in holding that because Edwards contended the contract was terminated on January 18, 2002, Edwards could not claim lost profits after that date. <i>See</i> 245 F.Supp.2d at 262. This point is moot, since the Magistrate Judge held immediately afterwards that Edwards terminated the contract earlier than January 18, 2002 (on November 19, 2001) and Fiddes accepted the termination. <i>Id.</i> Edwards cannot argue that it is entitled to lost profits on account of Fiddes's failure to give it reasonable notice of termination, since Edwards, not Fiddes, terminated the contract. Nor can Edwards argue that it lost profits after January 18, 2002, resulting from a breach committed by Fiddes before November 19, 2001, since the jury found Fiddes did not breach the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore put this litigation to a well-deserved rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment in No. 03-2096 is <i>affirmed</i> and No. 03-2195 is <i>dismissed</i> as moot.

Edwards contends that the Magistrate Judge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> erred in entering partial summary judgment based on the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that the contract had been terminated by an e-mail from Edwards stating, \"[I]t is over ...

Edwards had been distributing a furniture wax called \"Briwax\" since 1988. In June 2000, Mann entered negotiations with Fiddes, a British wax manufacturer based in Cardiff, Wales, about becoming a distributor for Fiddes. In e-mails exchanged from June to August 7, 2000, Mann and Fiddes's principal, Robert Fiddes Gooding, worked out a trial distributorship agreement. The terms were never memorialized in one contract document, but must be gleaned from the exchange of lengthy e-mails. Mann asked for certain states as \"protected territory.\" Gooding responded, \"We would grant territorial rights to the 34 states as requested, with a periodic review rather based on both quantity sold and efforts extended. I would like to discuss this in greater detail with you....\" Mann urged Gooding to finalize the agreement, and Gooding responded, \"I. . . am pleased to grant territorial rights to those states requested.\" On August 7, Mann e-mailed: \"Sounds good &#8212; we have a deal.\" The parties stipulated that the agreement did not have a specified termination date and was not for a fixed duration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards began buying Fiddes products in September 2000. By November 2001, the relationship was beginning to fray, with Mann complaining about inadequate promotional literature and Fiddes complaining about unpaid invoices. Mann and Gooding met in New York in November, but relations did not improve. Mann wrote Fiddes that he suspected that Fiddes was not turning over to him \"all Fiddes Supreme business of serious consequence,\" and Fiddes voiced its suspicions that Mann was selling his biggest customers Briwax instead of Fiddes Supreme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 17, 2001, Mann wrote to Gooding asking for Gooding to give Mann a letter agreement to present to a banker in connection with Edwards's application for inventory financing. (Mann later testified that the \"banker\" was Mann himself, and that he had walked back and forth between two chairs during the \"conversation\" reported in the e-mails.) Mann wrote to Gooding that the banker had advised him that \"it could be worth a lot more taking you to court than following through with Fiddes Wood Care.\" Gooding did not send the requested \"letter agreement,\" and on November 19, 2001 at 12:18 a.m., Mann wrote Gooding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I have to assume that by your refusal to provide a letter of our agreement, you do realize it is over.

The Magistrate Judge granted partial summary judgment based on Edwards's admissions of key facts stated in Fiddes's summary of undisputed facts. <i>Roger Edwards, LLC v.

Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge held that Edwards could not recover damages that accrued after November 19, 2001, and Edwards was not entitled to specific performance. <i>Id.</i> at 262-63.

Paragraph No. 27 referenced Exhibit AA, which reproduced the Mann to Gooding e-mail of November 19 at 12:18 a.m. (\"[I]t is over. Period.\") and the Gooding to Mann e-mail of 9:21 a.m. Edwards does not point to any communication by it withdrawing the termination before Fiddes accepted it. Edwards's admissions thus establish that the two e-mails on the morning of November 19 terminated the contract. <i>See Drinkwater v.

Edwards's position on appeal that Mann's words were \"merely expressing frustration\" is nothing but an attempt to take back its earlier admission without forthrightly asking for such relief. The Magistrate Judge did not err in entering summary judgment on the basis of Edwards's admission. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (authorizing entry of summary judgment based, <i>inter alia,</i> on admissions on file).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edwards's next argument is that the Magistrate Judge erred in denying its requested anticipatory repudiation instruction. Edwards contends that Fiddes committed an anticipatory repudiation before November 19 by failing to provide the letter for the imaginary \"banker.\" Edwards contends that by asking for a letter to give to a banker, Edwards was in effect asking for assurance of Fiddes's performance to which Edwards was entitled by law, and that Fiddes's failure to provide the letter thus amounted to an anticipatory repudiation of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's refusal to give a particular requested instruction is reversible error only if the instruction proffered was a correct statement of the substantive law, which was not covered in the instructions given and which was integral to an important point in the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Faigin v.

Our own research shows that Maine has applied the Restatement (Second) of Contracts rule concerning requests for assurance of performance. <i>Drinkwater v.

It would be more accurate to say that the record includes admissions that demonstrate that the request for a letter was not a request for assurance of Fiddes's performance of the June-August 2000 contract. The trial record is clear that Mann never asked for a letter for himself, but instead wrote Gooding that the letter was for the \"banker.\" Mann sent Gooding a detailed e-mail about his conversation with the banker.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The e-mail did not reveal that the \"banker\" was Mann himself, when he was sitting in his other chair. A demand for assurance must be made in accord with the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 251, cmt. d; <i>see id.</i> &#167; 205, cmt. a (referring to good faith as \"honesty in fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mann never supplied the terms he was asking Fiddes to agree to, instead putting the onus on Fiddes to reduce the parties' voluminous communications to something that would satisfy the \"banker.\" <i>See</i> Mann to Fiddes, November 17, 2001 (\"I was going to contact you with some of the details the letter must contain, but basically, it is exactly the same as we have been operating under.... So you know what it needs to say, yes? ?\"). The record also shows that Gooding interpreted Mann's request as a demand for \"a letter offering you exclusive distribution of our products into 34 states for the next two years.\" Mann's own trial testimony was that the letter was supposed to confirm a \"new deal\" discussed at a meeting between Gooding and Mann in New York in November 2001<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> involving making Edwards \"the only importer of [Fiddes] wood finishing products into the United States within two years.\" Edwards also filed a Statement of Material Facts in Dispute stating that Mann's request for a letter \"grew\" out of the November meeting in New York. Similarly, in its brief opposing summary judgment, Edwards said, \"[T]he request for a `letter' was triggered by a separate deal under discussion. That deal involved `spray wax,' and machinery, which was a huge new and additional undertaking ... It is for that reason that a letter was requested subsequent to the October [sic], 2001 meeting.\" It is undisputed that the contract memorialized in the June-August 2000 e-mails did not include a two-year term or an exclusive distributorship. Therefore, Edwards has represented to the court that Mann was asking for something different from assurance that Fiddes would perform under the June-August 2000 contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Edwards's theory was only presented to the court in the form of a proposed instruction with substantial legal errors. Edwards's complaint pleaded breach of the distributorship contract by Fiddes selling into the territory, but did not mention a repudiation theory or a request for assurance of performance. Neither Mann's affidavit in opposition to summary judgment nor his summary judgment brief mentioned this theory. Edwards mentioned in interrogatory answers that Fiddes \"withheld\" a letter, but Edwards did not characterize the incident as denial of a request for assurance or otherwise explain why Fiddes would be obliged to supply such a letter. Edwards introduced its theory of repudiation-by-failure-to-provide-assurance in argument during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instruction Edwards presented entirely omitted the concepts that the anticipatory repudiation must be definite and unequivocal, that anticipatory repudiation occurs in advance of the time fixed for performance, and that the repudiation must go to the whole of the consideration. The instruction did not discuss the possibility of repudiation by failure to provide assurance. The instruction as proffered describes an ordinary breach, not an anticipatory repudiation. It states tautologically that if the defendant breached the contract, this conduct was in breach of the contract. Thus, the instruction proffered was both inaccurate and misleadingly incomplete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court gave another, general instruction concerning breach of contract, to which Edwards did not object. Having given a general instruction on breach of contract, the Magistrate Judge had no further obligation to piece together an unpleaded theory that Edwards had only hinted at by proposing a defective instruction. \"It is hornbook law that a trial court does not commit error when it instructs generally about a legal principle and then declines a party's request for a further instruction that is misleading, legally incorrect, or incomplete.\" <i>Febres,</i> 214 F.3d at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Edwards argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in holding that because Edwards contended the contract was terminated on January 18, 2002, Edwards could not claim lost profits after that date. <i>See</i> 245 F.Supp.2d at 262. This point is moot, since the Magistrate Judge held immediately afterwards that Edwards terminated the contract earlier than January 18, 2002 (on November 19, 2001) and Fiddes accepted the termination. <i>Id.</i> Edwards cannot argue that it is entitled to lost profits on account of Fiddes's failure to give it reasonable notice of termination, since Edwards, not Fiddes, terminated the contract. Nor can Edwards argue that it lost profits after January 18, 2002, resulting from a breach committed by Fiddes before November 19, 2001, since the jury found Fiddes did not breach the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore put this litigation to a well-deserved rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment in No. 03-2096 is <i>affirmed</i> and No. 03-2195 is <i>dismissed</i> as moot.
