Plaintiff-appellant Raymond D.\n\nLeavitt, an inmate of the Maine corrections system, seeks a civil\n\nrights remedy for the alleged denial of adequate medical care for\n\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by healthcare professionals at\n\nthe York County Jail (YCJ) and the Maine State Prison (MSP).\n\nClaiming that correctional medical officials acted with deliberate\n\nindifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the\n\nEighth Amendment, Leavitt brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n\nagainst    a    number   of   defendants,   including   Alfred   Cichon,   a\n\nphysician assistant at YCJ; Correctional Medical Services, Inc.\n\n(CMS), the private contractor that provided medical care at MSP;\n\nand CMS employees Todd Tritch, Edie Woodward, Charlene Watkins, and\n\nTeresa Kesteloot.1       In separate orders, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for Cichon and the CMS defendants, and Leavitt\n\nappeals.\n\n               We agree with the district court that Leavitt's evidence\n\ncould not, as a matter of law, establish that the CMS defendants'\n\nactions violated the Eighth Amendment.          However, we conclude that\n\nLeavitt has established a material dispute as to whether Alfred\n\nCichon acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical\n\nneeds.     We thus affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      We refer to defendants CMS and its employees collectively as\n\"the CMS defendants.\"\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe CMS defendants, reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor\n\nof Cichon, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            Appellant is, and was at all times material to this case,\n\nHIV-positive.    He was incarcerated at YCJ from September 6, 2006,\n\nthrough February 17, 2007, at which point he was transferred to\n\nMSP.     He claims that the defendants inappropriately denied him\n\ntreatment for HIV for the entirety of his 167-day stay at YCJ and\n\nfor nearly seventeen months of his incarceration at MSP.          This\n\ndelay in the reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV,\n\nLeavitt alleges, \"constituted a continuum of harm,\" which resulted\n\nin short- and long-term negative consequences for his health.      We\n\nchronicle his treatment history in some detail as presented in the\n\nsummary judgment record, presenting the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to Leavitt and drawing all reasonable inferences in his\n\nfavor.    Burrell v. Hampshire Cnty., 307 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nA. Leavitt's Treatment at YCJ\n\n            1. Initial Clinic Visit\n\n            At the time of his incarceration at YCJ, Leavitt suffered\n\nfrom     HIV,   hepatitis   C,   bipolar   disorder,   anxiety,    and\n\nhypothyroidism.     On October 5, 2006, about one month into his\n\ndetention at YCJ, Leavitt had his first -- and only -- clinical\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\finteraction   with   defendant   Alfred     Cichon.2     Cichon     was   the\n\nphysician assistant who worked at the jail most frequently, about\n\nsixteen hours per week, and he also was president of Allied\n\nResources for Correctional Health, Inc. (ARCH), the corporation\n\nthat provided contract healthcare services to inmates at YCJ.\n\n           At the October 5 clinic visit, Cichon performed a routine\n\nphysical examination of Leavitt, concluding that the latter's\n\nhealth in general was \"normal.\"       Appellant told Cichon that he was\n\nHIV-positive; said that he was experiencing night sweats, chills,\n\nfever,   nausea,   and   vomiting;   and   complained   that   he   had   not\n\nreceived his antiretroviral medications. He also lamented that \"it\n\nwasn't right he was being kept off his HIV meds since they had been\n\nkeeping him alive for the past 10 years and keeping his symptoms\n\nand low blood count from claiming him as a victim of AIDS.\"\n\n           At this point, Cichon purportedly made a statement that\n\nconstitutes the key fact in dispute in Leavitt's case against him.\n\nHe said, \"We don't give away [HIV] medications here at this jail[,]\n\nbecause the jail is so small and we are not equipped financially to\n\nhold the burden of providing expensive medication\"; \"[you will]\n\n\n\n     2\n        Leavitt's Statement of Material Facts raises a few\nallegations pertaining to events that took place before the October\n5 meeting, including an allegation that a jail officer refused to\naccept the HIV medications that a friend brought to YCJ for\nLeavitt. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Cichon\nknew of these events, and thus they are immaterial to the\ndetermination of whether Cichon was deliberately indifferent to\nLeavitt's medical needs.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fhave to wait until you [get] to the Maine State Prison where they\n\nare able to pay for these medications.\"               Additionally, Cichon\n\nallegedly advised Leavitt, \"You don't need to stay on the [HIV]\n\nmedications to be healthy, and just as soon as you get to the [MSP]\n\nthey'll fix you right up.\"\n\n               At the time of their meeting, Cichon knew that Leavitt\n\nhad been without his HIV medications for at least one month, as\n\nappellant had been incarcerated since September. Patients who take\n\na break from antiretroviral therapy may become resistant to one or\n\nmore of the drugs used as part of the regimen.                  Cichon thus\n\ninformed Leavitt that he could not reinstate his HIV medications or\n\nrefer    him    to   an   infectious   disease   specialist   without   first\n\nacquiring his medical history, information about his medications\n\nand compliance with taking those medications, and blood test\n\nresults for his current CD4 cell count and viral load.3            There is\n\nno dispute that this was the proper response to a request for\n\nrestarting antiretroviral treatment.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The parties state that the CD4 cell count is the best\nestimate of an HIV-positive individual's risk of short-term\nprogression to develop the clinical symptoms and risks of\ncomplications of HIV. Viral load, which measures the amount of\nvirus present in the bloodstream, is most helpful in assessing a\npatient's response to treatment, but is also generally helpful in\nassessing the risk of short-term progression of HIV. A higher CD4\ncount and lower viral load are generally desirable.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           2. After Leavitt's Clinic Visit\n\n           Cichon    directed      the    ARCH    nursing    staff     to   obtain\n\nLeavitt's medical records from the various facilities where he had\n\nbeen treated for HIV.        Cichon also ordered lab work to determine\n\nLeavitt's complete blood count differential, CD4 cell count, and\n\nviral load.     These labs, like all tests and medications prescribed\n\nfor inmates, were paid for by YCJ.\n\n           In    short    order,   Leavitt's      medical    records    from    the\n\nAndroscoggin     County    Jail    (ACJ),      Cumberland   County     Jail,    and\n\nPositive Health Care were faxed to YCJ, where they were reviewed\n\nand initialed by Cichon.       The records indicated that Leavitt had a\n\nlong history of HIV and that he previously had been prescribed the\n\nantiretroviral     drugs    Truvada      and   Kaletra.     The   records      also\n\nestablished that Leavitt's labs on April 6, 2006 had shown an\n\nundetectable viral load of less than 75 and an abnormally low CD4\n\ncell count of 355.         Moreover, they showed that at the time of\n\nLeavitt's incarceration at ACJ on July 11, 2006, his medical\n\ncondition was normal and he did not complain of fatigue, night\n\nsweats, or any objective symptoms of HIV.                 Finally, the records\n\ndisclosed that Leavitt had a history of alcohol abuse that may have\n\nimpeded   his   compliance    with    antiretroviral        therapy,    and    that\n\nLeavitt had been at various points non-compliant with taking his\n\nHIV medications.     Although Leavitt concedes the veracity of these\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\frecords, he insists he had been taking his HIV medications \"on a\n\nregular basis\" before he entered YCJ.\n\n           The lab reports from the blood work Cichon ordered were\n\naddressed to him and routed to the medical office at YCJ, where in\n\nthe ordinary course of business they would have been placed on a\n\nclipboard and reviewed by Cichon each time he visited the jail.\n\nThe CD4 cell count report indicated that Leavitt had a lower than\n\nnormal count of 415 and noted that the \"[m]ild decrease in CD4\n\nlevel    and   increase   in   CD8     subset\"   was   \"indicative   of\n\nimmunodeficiency state and/or recent viral infection.\"           Cichon\n\nclaims no recollection of seeing these results, but acknowledges\n\nthat his initial appears on the first page of the lab report, which\n\nwould signal that he had reviewed them.4\n\n           The viral load report indicated a higher than normal\n\nviral load of 143,000.    Cichon also claims not to have seen this\n\nreport; the copy of it subpoenaed from YCJ and entered into the\n\nrecord does not bear his initial.        He asserts that this is the\n\nfirst time in seventeen years that an omission of this type\n\noccurred, that he would have considered a viral load of 143,000 to\n\nbe higher \"than [he] would like to see it,\" and that he would have\n\n\"move[d] precipitously\" to refer Leavitt to an infectious disease\n\nspecialist if he had reviewed the report.        Cichon understood that\n\n\n     4\n       Leavitt's medical records from ACJ and the CD4 cell count\nand viral load reports were subpoenaed from YCJ and entered into\nthe summary judgment record as part of Cichon's affidavit.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fHIV   is   a   serious    and   potentially   life-threatening       medical\n\ncondition.\n\n           3. The Remainder of Leavitt's Stay at YCJ\n\n           It is undisputed that during the four months between the\n\nOctober 5 clinic appointment and Leavitt's transfer to MSP, Cichon\n\nnever saw Leavitt again, did not refer Leavitt to a specialist, or\n\ntake any other steps to follow up on Leavitt's HIV condition.\n\nLeavitt did not see an infectious disease specialist or restart\n\nantiretroviral treatment for his HIV while at YCJ.\n\n           Although      appellant   was   aware   that   the    method   for\n\nrequesting medical treatment or medications at YCJ was to file an\n\nInmate Medical Request Form (IMRF), he did not submit one related\n\nto treatment for HIV or HIV-related symptoms.5                  Leavitt did,\n\nhowever, write one or more letters to YCJ's medical department,\n\nincluding one to Cichon, requesting the resumption of his HIV\n\nmedications.    He submitted these letters to a YCJ officer at some\n\npoint prior to his appointment with Cichon.\n\n           Symptoms of HIV include fevers, night sweats, loss of\n\nappetite, weight loss, wasting syndrome, chronic diarrhea, thrush,\n\nleukoplakia (a white, film-like protrusion on the lateral side of\n\nthe tongue), psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis.                During the\n\nperiod of his incarceration at YCJ, Leavitt suffered from night\n\n\n      5\n       Leavitt filed three non-HIV-related IMRFs, in which he\nrequested Fixadent for his dentures and cream to treat his\npsoriasis. Cichon denied all three requests.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fsweats,   chills,    fever,   fatigue,     psoriasis,      nausea,     and\n\ngastrointestinal problems, including vomiting and constipation.\n\n          4. ARCH's Contractual Relationship with YCJ\n\n          In addition to serving as president of ARCH, Cichon was\n\nalso its largest shareholder, with ownership of over a quarter of\n\nits stock.   Cichon testified at his deposition that YCJ put its\n\nhealthcare services contract out for bid every two years, that\n\nbeginning November 2004 ARCH had a two-year contract with YCJ with\n\nthe possibility of extensions, and that such extensions were\n\ndependent on whether YCJ was \"happy with [ARCH].\"6          Cichon also\n\ntestified that ARCH eventually lost the YCJ contract to CMS in June\n\n2009 because YCJ \"perceived that there [would be] a cost savings\n\nthere.\"\n\n          5. Cichon's Professional Record\n\n          Cichon was given several \"letters of guidance\" by the\n\nMaine State Board of Licensure in Medicine (\"Medical Board\") for\n\nvarious infractions involving other patients that happened around\n\nthe time of Leavitt's incarceration.      These infractions included\n\nchanging the frequency of dosage of a medication for another\n\npatient   without   first   informing    the   patient,7   as   well    as\n\n\n     6\n       YCJ had previously contracted with ARCH for healthcare\nservices from around 1996 to 2003. ARCH was then replaced by the\nUniversity of New England, before regaining the contract in 2004.\n     7\n        The frequency of medications was changed from the\nphysician's prescription of four times a day to two times a day\nbecause the jail contracted for staff to distribute medications\n\n                                -10-\n\fwithholding medications from a patient with a chronic health\n\ncondition \"without appropriate evaluation\" and \"with no clear\n\nreason that the patient could not receive them.\"8    Moreover, the\n\nMedical Board suspended Cichon's physician assistant license for\n\nninety days as a sanction for his providing medical services\n\nwithout a licensed supervisory physician.9    Subsequently, Cichon\n\nalso entered into a consent agreement with the Maine Board of\n\nOsteopathic Licensure in January 2008, in which he admitted to,\n\namong other things, the violations of his physician assistant's\n\nlicense for which he was disciplined by the Medical Board.   Under\n\nthe terms of the consent agreement, Cichon's license to practice\n\nwas subject to a number of probationary conditions, including\n\nheightened supervision and reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\nonly twice a day. The Board found that Cichon should have informed\nthe inmate; however, it concluded that because Cichon had consulted\nwith the inmate's physician before implementing the change, his\n\"behavior did not rise to a level of misconduct sufficient to\nwarrant disciplinary action.\"\n     8\n      The other letters of guidance issued by the Board related to\nCichon making inappropriate comments about race and sex to\npatients.\n     9\n       The Medical Board concluded that Cichon was \"providing\nmedical services as a physician assistant without having a\nsupervisory [allopathic] physician\" licensed by the Medical Board,\n\"failing to notify the Medical Board that he no longer had a\nsupervisory physician licensed by the Medical Board,\" and/or\n\"misrepresenting to Medical Board staff the status of his license\nand supervisory relationship\" for the period from November 2, 2006,\nto at least March 15, 2007.\n\n                               -11-\n\fB. Leavitt's Treatment at MSP\n\n            On February 17, 2007, Leavitt transferred from YCJ to\n\nMSP.   By contract, CMS provides medical care at MSP, as well as\n\nsome   other      facilities    operated      by    the    Maine    Department   of\n\nCorrections       (MDOC).      CMS   employed      the    four   other   individual\n\ndefendants involved in this appeal: Dr. Todd Tritch as the Regional\n\nMedical Director of CMS in Maine; Edie Woodward, a physician\n\nassistant, and Charlene Watkins, a family practitioner nurse, as\n\nhealthcare providers at MSP; and Teresa Kesteloot as the Health\n\nServices Administrator at MSP.\n\n            Since MSP's medical department operates on a clinic\n\nmodel, patients are usually not followed by particular providers.\n\nInmates with chronic diseases, including HIV, are assigned to the\n\nchronic care clinic, in which they are seen typically at three-\n\nmonth intervals.\n\n            1. Leavitt's Initial Treatment at MSP\n\n            Leavitt's first clinical interaction at MSP came in the\n\nform   of   an    intake    appointment     with    a     CMS-employed   physician\n\nassistant three days after his transfer.                   At this time, Leavitt\n\nsaid   he   was    HIV-positive      and   asked    to     resume   antiretroviral\n\ntreatment.       The physician assistant ordered a new round of blood\n\ntests and requested Leavitt's treatment records.                    Leavitt's labs\n\nwere subsequently drawn and reported, showing an abnormal CD4 cell\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fcount of 460 and an elevated viral load over 97,000.10                The\n\nphysician assistant also ordered an appointment \"ASAP\" with an\n\ninfectious disease specialist.       Generally, CMS providers use the\n\nterm \"ASAP\" when there is some degree of concern about a patient's\n\nhealth. Nevertheless, the follow-up with the specialist never took\n\nplace.\n\n           About one month later, another CMS provider wrote an\n\norder that Leavitt be \"referred to an infectious disease doctor for\n\nstarting HIV medications.\"      That order, and all requests to refer\n\npatients to outside consultations, had to be approved by defendant\n\nTritch.\n\n           2. Leavitt's First Consultation with Specialists\n\n           With Tritch's approval, appellant was examined in May\n\n2007 by a team of HIV specialists at the Virology Treatment Center\n\n(VTC) in Portland, Maine. At that time, Leavitt again requested to\n\nbe reinstated on his HIV medications.          VTC sent a consultation\n\nreport to CMS, which stated, \"HIV: No urgent indication for . . .\n\nrx with CD4 at 460,\" meaning that Leavitt then had a good buffer in\n\nhis   immunological   reserve   to   protect   him   from   opportunistic\n\ninfections or other consequences of HIV/AIDS.11             VTC's medical\n\n\n      10\n       Although this CD4 count represents a slight improvement over\nthe reported results from April and October 2006, Leavitt's expert\nrepresents that there can be a lag in CD4 count decline after\nantiretroviral therapy is discontinued.\n      11\n        VTC's medical director represented that by \"[n]o urgent\nindication,\" he anticipated that a follow-up appointment or another\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdirector    subsequently    explained    that   he     decided   to   defer\n\nreinitiating antiretroviral treatment so that he could obtain\n\nadditional information about Leavitt's immune status, viral load,\n\nmedication history, and previous drug resistance testing.              His\n\ndecision also relied on Department of Health and Human Services\n\n(DHHS)    guidelines   recommending   the   deferral   of   antiretroviral\n\ntreatment for patients with CD4 cell counts above 350 who did not\n\nhave an AIDS-defining illness or severe symptoms of HIV infection.12\n\nThe consultation report recommended that Leavitt return for a\n\nfollow-up appointment in four to six weeks.            At the end of May\n\n2007, a CMS provider noted VTC's recommendation and ordered a\n\nfollow-up appointment for Leavitt.\n\n            3. Leavitt's Treatment in Summer and Fall of 2007\n\n            Leavitt was next seen at the chronic care clinic by CMS\n\ndefendant Edie Woodward in June 2007, when she treated him for a\n\n\nround of blood tests would take place within three months. This\ntime frame was in accordance with usual practice to check an HIV\npatient's CD4 and viral load counts every three to four months as\na way of monitoring the patient's condition, regardless of whether\nthe patient is on antiretroviral therapy.\n     12\n         These DHHS guidelines were explicitly addressed to\n\"treatment-naive\" patients โ- HIV-positive patients who had never\nbeen on antiretroviral therapy. However, in 2007-2008 VTC used the\nsame information and recommendations to guide treatment of patients\nwho had been on medications for a time and then stopped. At the\ntime, there was disagreement in the medical community as to the\nwisdom of the deferred treatment approach.        Leavitt's expert\ntestified that although Leavitt's CD4 count was above DHHS's cut-\noff point, Leavitt should nonetheless have been immediately\nrestarted on antiretroviral therapy because of his history of low\nCD4 counts and because he suffered from hepatitis C.\n\n                                  -14-\n\frash. Woodward assumed the follow-up appointment with VTC had been\n\nor was being scheduled, and she accordingly entered an order for\n\n\"follow up with [VTC] as scheduled.\"\n\n          On August 10, 2007, Leavitt submitted a prison sick-call\n\nslip in which he complained: \"As a result of being denied meds for\n\nHIV+ my immune system is low resulting in thrush[,] and it seems as\n\nthough I'm being denied meds for that also.\"   That same day, Tritch\n\nexamined Leavitt.   Tritch confirmed that the latter was suffering\n\nfrom thrush and ordered updated blood work to assess the condition\n\nof his HIV.   Tritch also submitted an order for Leavitt to return\n\nfor a follow-up visit specifically with him the next month.    That\n\nappointment, however, was not scheduled as Tritch ordered, and it\n\nnever took place.\n\n          The results from the lab tests Tritch ordered reported\n\nthat Leavitt's CD4 cell count had fallen to 424 and that his viral\n\nload had risen to greater than 100,000.13        It was not until\n\nNovember, however, that Tritch, without having seen Leavitt again\n\nas promised, approved Leavitt's referral to VTC.\n\n          In the interim, Leavitt saw Woodward at the chronic care\n\nclinic on September 1 and October 22, 2007.        At the September\n\nclinic, Leavitt complained of a rash on his underarms, fatigue, and\n\n\n\n     13\n       In responding to a complaint to the Medical Board brought\nagainst him by Leavitt, Tritch stated that Leavitt's \"HIV viral\nload was undetectable\" as of August 2007.       Tritch has never\ncorrected this inaccurate assertion to the Board.\n\n                               -15-\n\fwhite, cracked, and painful toes -- all symptoms she recognized\n\ncould have been attributable to HIV.          Woodward prescribed an\n\nantifungal cream for Leavitt's skin and feet. Even though she knew\n\nthat the one-month follow-up consultation recommended by VTC in May\n\nnever occurred, she did not determine why the appointment did not\n\ntake place or take any steps to expedite the process.\n\n           At the October clinic, Leavitt complained of intermittent\n\nthrush and a rash.       He again requested HIV and hepatitis C\n\ntreatment.    Woodward ordered various medications to treat his\n\nimmediate complaints, requested updated blood work, and put in a\n\nnew order for the follow-up appointment that Leavitt was supposed\n\nto have with Tritch.    She did not, however, put in a second order\n\nfor the referral to VTC.\n\n           4. The December Follow-up Appointment at VTC and Its\n           Aftermath\n\n           Leavitt did not return to VTC until December, six months\n\nafter his initial consult with the specialists there.            At the\n\nDecember appointment, Leavitt complained of fatigue and presented\n\nwith   symptoms,   including   thrush,   leukoplakia,   and   seborrheic\n\ndermatitis, that VTC interpreted as indications of immunological\n\ndecline from HIV.     VTC reported to CMS that Leavitt now met the\n\ncriteria for starting antiretroviral therapy for HIV, requested an\n\nupdated CD4 cell count and viral load to provide a baseline for\n\ntreatment, and recommended genotype testing to determine Leavitt's\n\nresistance to particular HIV medications.     VTC also suggested that\n\n                                  -16-\n\fLeavitt return in four to six weeks, noting that it would \"likely\n\nmake recommendations for therapy at that time.\"                   Later that month,\n\nWoodward reviewed these recommendations and ordered an HIV viral\n\nload, an immune function panel, and a follow-up appointment with\n\nVTC in one month.\n\n             In early January, Woodward entered an order to \"add\n\ngenotype\" to the lab work she had requested for Leavitt the\n\nprevious month.       Those lab results were reported on January 18 but\n\ndid not include a genotype as ordered.               Apparently, Bio Reference,\n\nthe   lab    that    processed     Leavitt's    blood      work,    experienced        a\n\ntechnical problem; in its report to CMS, it stated that it would\n\ncontact     the    prison   for   additional    information.            There   is   no\n\nevidence in Leavitt's chart of any subsequent communication between\n\nBio Reference and CMS, and Woodward did not take steps to obtain\n\nthe genotype results from Bio Reference.\n\n             On January 23, 2008, Woodward observed in her progress\n\nnotes   that      Leavitt's   follow-up      visit    to   VTC    was     overdue    and\n\nreordered it.       The next month, Woodward stopped working full time\n\nat MSP.      She wrote an order in February related to Leavitt's\n\nhepatitis C treatment, but from that point forward was no longer\n\ninvolved in his care.\n\n             CMS    defendant     Charlene    Watkins      took    over    Woodward's\n\nposition.      Watkins first saw Leavitt on February 26, 2008, when he\n\ncomplained of a rash, which she knew could have been a fungal\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\finfection and a symptom of HIV.     She observed in her progress notes\n\nthat Leavitt was due for a follow-up visit to VTC.\n\n            5. Leavitt's March Visit to VTC\n\n            That follow-up visit, which was scheduled for February\n\n27, was delayed on account of bad weather, and Leavitt did not\n\nreturn to VTC until March 12.        About a month later, Leavitt saw\n\nWatkins at the chronic care clinic, whereupon he asked her why his\n\nmedications had not been restarted following his March 12 visit to\n\nVTC.    It turned out that no consultation report from, or record of,\n\nthat visit had been placed in his CMS file.         Watkins told him that\n\nit was her fault for not sending a fax to VTC.           She then promptly\n\nrequested and received from VTC a faxed copy of its note from\n\nLeavitt's visit, which stated: \"HIV disease: Needs to restart HIV\n\ntherapy.      Has been on many agents prior and likely has some\n\nresistance.     Unfortunately we do not have his genotype at this\n\ntime.    Will need to start him back on Truvada/Kaletra now.           Will\n\nrecommend they obtain a CD4, [viral load,] and a genotype.\"             VTC\n\nrequested a follow-up appointment in one month.\n\n            Watkins   did   not   start   Leavitt   on    his   medications\n\nimmediately.    Instead, on April 14, Watkins ordered updated blood\n\nwork and a follow-up visit to VTC.        The lab results indicated that\n\nhis CD4 cell count had plummeted to 296 and his viral load had\n\nescalated to 297,562. Watkins reviewed these results a little over\n\na week later, but still did not start Leavitt on antiretroviral\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fdrugs.      Nor did she confirm if the follow-up visit to VTC had\n\nactually been scheduled. Ultimately, Leavitt did not return to VTC\n\nuntil almost two and a half months later.\n\n              6. Leavitt's Filing of a Formal Grievance\n\n              In   the   intervening    period,   Leavitt    filed   a   formal\n\ngrievance with MDOC through CMS defendant Teresa Kesteloot, in\n\nwhich he protested that he was not receiving treatment for his\n\nHIV.14 Kesteloot, who was responsible for reviewing all healthcare-\n\nrelated complaints brought by MSP inmates, received the grievance\n\nno later than May 1, at which point she spoke with Leavitt,\n\nreviewed a portion of his medical chart, and discussed his care\n\nwith    CMS   nursing    staff.    Kesteloot's     focus    in   investigating\n\nLeavitt's complaint was not on trying to determine whether past\n\ntreatment had been appropriate -- a determination that she was not\n\nqualified to make -- but solely on whether Leavitt's current\n\nconcerns were being addressed.\n\n              In the course of her inquiry, Kesteloot learned that\n\nLeavitt had been seen recently at the chronic care clinic, and that\n\nsince his last visit to VTC on March 12, labs had been drawn and a\n\nfollow-up appointment had been scheduled.          She thus concluded in a\n\n\n\n       14\n        Leavitt wrote a letter on April 1, 2007 to Kesteloot's\npredecessor with a similar grievance, and attached a copy of that\nletter to his complaint to Kesteloot. Kesteloot became aware of\nthe April 1 letter at some point after she assumed her position,\nbut does not know if her predecessor ever acted on Leavitt's first\ncomplaint.\n\n                                       -19-\n\fmemorandum to her MDOC supervisors that Leavitt \"appears to have\n\nbeen followed appropriately.\"15       She took no additional steps to\n\ninvestigate whether the delay in Leavitt's treatment was part of a\n\nbroader problem in the care of HIV-positive inmates at MSP or to\n\nfollow up on Leavitt to ensure that there would be no further\n\ndelays in his treatment.\n\n            7. The Reinitiation of Leavitt's HIV Treatment\n\n            Leavitt finally saw the VTC specialists again on June 25.\n\nVTC subsequently sent a consultation report to CMS in which it\n\nobserved that Leavitt was \"close to AIDS,\" that he had thrush on\n\nhis tongue and swollen nodes on his neck, and that he needed to\n\n\"start HIV antiviral meds ASAP.\"      The next day, Tritch, who had not\n\nseen Leavitt for over ten months, reviewed Leavitt's chart and\n\nconcluded that his HIV medications should have been started sooner.\n\nHe then prescribed him Kaletra and Truvada.\n\n            Leavitt finally restarted antiretroviral therapy on July\n\n7, 2008, over seven months after VTC deemed him eligible under the\n\nDHHS    guidelines.    During   the   seventeen   months   he   had   been\n\nincarcerated at MSP, Leavitt on three occasions submitted sick-call\n\n\n\n\n       15\n       MSP's grievance review officer reviewed Kesteloot's memo and\ndenied Leavitt's grievance. Leavitt's appeal of that decision to\nMSP's chief administrative officer was also denied.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fslips to the MDOC expressly for HIV,16 and on thirteen occasions\n\nsubmitted sick-call slips for thrush, rashes, or diarrhea.17\n\nC. Leavitt's Current Health and Prognosis\n\n                After Leavitt started antiretroviral medications, his\n\nthrush disappeared and he no longer experienced night sweats and\n\nchills.        By July 2008, Leavitt's CD4 cell count had rebounded to\n\n429 (from 296 in April), and by December 2008, his CD4 cell count\n\nhad risen to 550, thus indicating the reconstitution of his immune\n\nsystem.         In his labs of February 27, 2009, he dropped to a\n\ndramatically low CD4 cell count of 252.                 But as of June 2009,\n\nLeavitt's HIV disease was stable.               Currently, he is at a healthy\n\nweight of 170 pounds.            He still suffers from warts and rashes,\n\nworsening fatigue and malaise, and \"great fear and uncertainty\n\nregarding his future as a result of his HIV drug interruption.\"\n\n                As examples of this uncertainty, Leavitt points to a 2006\n\nstudy        showing   that   patients   with   CD4   counts   above   350   whose\n\nantiretroviral therapy was interrupted and not restarted until\n\ntheir CD4 count dropped to 250 experienced a significant increase\n\nin the risk of opportunistic disease or death from any cause over\n\nthe course of the trial, as compared with patients who received\n\ncontinuous antiretroviral therapy. Leavitt also references a great\n\n\n\n     16\n       Those slips were submitted on August 10, 2007, January 6,\n2008, and July 4, 2008.\n        17\n             These dates range from July 26, 2007, to July 4, 2008.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fbody of medical literature suggesting that the lower a patient's\n\nCD4   cell   count   is   when   he   starts   or   restarts   antiretroviral\n\ntreatment, the lesser the expectation of long-term immunologic\n\nrecovery and the greater the risk of HIV- and non-HIV-related\n\ncomplications over the short term.           Leavitt further cites studies\n\nindicating that patients who begin treatment at lower CD4 cell\n\ncounts have a greater risk of not fully reconstituting the normal\n\nnumbers of CD4 subsets. His expert testified that the interruption\n\nof Leavitt's antiretroviral therapy from September 2006 to July\n\n2008 constituted a \"continuum\" of harm that makes him statistically\n\nmore likely to be susceptible to opportunistic infections and/or\n\ncancer in the future.\n\nD. Procedural History\n\n             Leavitt filed the pro se complaint underlying this case\n\nin April 2008, when his antiretroviral therapy had not yet been\n\nrestarted.    In that original complaint, he brought suit for money\n\ndamages and injunctive relief against CMS, YCJ, MSP, and various\n\ncorrectional officials and healthcare providers in their individual\n\nand official capacities, alleging that their refusal to administer\n\nhis HIV medications constituted violations of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).             He later voluntarily\n\ndismissed his claims against YCJ and MSP and filed an amended\n\ncomplaint in October 2008, also pro se, naming as defendants only\n\nCMS, a number of its employees, various persons employed by MDOC,\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fand the Warden of MSP.             Leavitt later filed a pro se complaint\n\nagainst Cichon, which the district court consolidated on December\n\n9, 2008 with the previous complaint into what the court styled as\n\na second amended complaint.\n\n                   Leavitt eventually obtained the services of an attorney\n\nin February 2009. Seven months later, all the defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment. The magistrate judge recommended on December 31,\n\n2009, and the district court granted on March 2, 2010, summary\n\njudgment in favor of all of the defendants, on the ground that\n\nthere        was    insufficient   evidence   that   defendants   acted   with\n\n\"deliberate indifference\" to Leavitt's medical needs, as required\n\nunder the Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.18                 On\n\nappeal, Leavitt challenges the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of Cichon, Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, Kesteloot,\n\nand CMS.19          The only theory that he continues to press is their\n\nliability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for the violation of his Eighth\n\nAmendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.20\n\n\n\n\n     18\n       They also offered an alternative ground for granting summary\njudgment in favor of Cichon: that Leavitt offered \"insubstantial\nproof of injury.\"\n        19\n        The district court granted summary judgment against a\nvariety of other defendants, including those employed by MDOC,\nunder a separate order, from which Leavitt does not appeal.\n     20\n       Leavitt no longer pursues his ADA claim against any of the\ndefendants.\n\n                                       -23-\n\f                                  II.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n            We review a district court's summary judgment ruling de\n\nnovo. Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue\n\nof material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.    Feeney v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 464 F.3d 158,\n\n161 (1st Cir. 2006).    Although a \"state-of-mind issue such as the\n\nexistence   of   deliberate   indifference   usually   presents   a   jury\n\nquestion,\" Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1991),\n\n\"a party against whom summary judgment is sought is [not] entitled\n\nto a trial simply because he has asserted a cause of action to\n\nwhich state of mind is a material element,\" Hahn v. Sargent, 523\n\nF.2d 461, 468 (1st Cir. 1975).     The non-moving party must present\n\ncompetent evidence that shows a genuine issue for trial. Ruiz-Rosa\n\nv. Rullรกn, 485 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nB. Analysis\n\n            \"The Constitution 'does not mandate comfortable prisons,'\n\nbut neither does it permit inhumane ones\"; accordingly, \"it is now\n\nsettled that 'the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the\n\nconditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under\n\nthe Eighth Amendment.'\"21      Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832\n\n\n     21\n       The record is unclear as to whether Leavitt was being held\nat YCJ as a probation violator or as a pre-trial detainee, but\nLeavitt's precise status makes no difference to our analysis, as\n\"the standard applied under the Fourteenth Amendment [governing the\nclaims of pre-trial detainees] is the same as the Eighth Amendment\n\n                                  -24-\n\f(1994) (quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 349 (1981);\n\nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (1993)).             The failure of\n\ncorrectional officials to provide inmates with adequate medical\n\ncare may offend the Eighth Amendment if their \"acts or omissions\n\n[are] sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to\n\nserious medical needs.\"        Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106\n\n(1976).\n\n          To    succeed   on   an   Eighth   Amendment   claim    based    on\n\ninadequate or delayed medical care, a plaintiff must satisfy both\n\na subjective and objective inquiry: he must show first, \"that\n\nprison officials possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind,\n\nnamely one of 'deliberate indifference' to an inmate's health or\n\nsafety,\" and second, that the deprivation alleged was \"objectively,\n\nsufficiently serious.\"     Burrell, 307 F.3d at 8.\n\n          For   the   subjective     inquiry,   the   Supreme    Court    has\n\nspecified that deliberate indifference requires that \"the official\n\nmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\n\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also\n\ndraw the inference.\"      Farmer 511 U.S. at 837; see also Ruiz-Rosa,\n\n485 F.3d at 156.       The standard encompasses a \"narrow band of\n\nconduct\": subpar care amounting to negligence or even malpractice\n\ndoes not give rise to a constitutional claim, Feeney, 464 F.3d at\n\n\n\nstandard [governing the claims of convicted inmates].\"           Ruiz-Rosa,\n485 F.3d at 155.\n\n                                    -25-\n\f162; rather, the treatment provided must have been so inadequate as\n\n\"to constitute 'an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' or to\n\nbe 'repugnant to the conscience of mankind,'\" Estelle, 429 U.S. at\n\n105-06; see also Alsina-Ortiz v. Laboy, 400 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (\"Willful blindness and deliberate indifference are not mere\n\nnegligence; these concepts are directed at a form of scienter in\n\nwhich the official culpably ignores or turns away from what is\n\notherwise     apparent.\").        We   have    concluded     that   \"[d]eliberate\n\nindifference in this context may be shown by the denial of needed\n\ncare   as    punishment    and    by   decisions     about   medical    care   made\n\nrecklessly     with     'actual    knowledge    of    impending     harm,   easily\n\npreventable.'\" Ruiz-Rosa, 485 F.3d at 156 (citing Feeney, 464 F.3d\n\nat 162 (quoting Watson v. Caton, 984 F.2d 537, 540 (1st Cir.\n\n1993))).\n\n             As to the second inquiry, that of a \"serious\" deprivation\n\nor medical need, we have held that \"[a] medical need is 'serious'\n\nif it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating\n\ntreatment, or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would\n\neasily      recognize    the     necessity     for   a   doctor's      attention.\"\n\nGaudreault v. Municipality of Salem, 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).       \"The 'seriousness' of an inmate's needs may also be\n\ndetermined by reference to the effect of the delay of treatment.\"\n\nId. (citing Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro,\n\n834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)).              We note that \"the subjective\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fdeliberate indifference inquiry may overlap with the objective\n\nserious medical need determination\"; \"[s]imilar evidence, including\n\nevidence of adverse effects, may be relevant to both components.\"\n\nSmith v. Carpenter, 316 F.3d 178, 187 n. 12 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing\n\nDesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n          1. Leavitt's Claim Against Cichon\n\n                   a. Deliberate Indifference\n\n          Leavitt argues that Cichon's failure to refer him to an\n\ninfectious disease specialist or to otherwise treat his HIV in a\n\ntimely manner constitutes deliberate indifference to his serious\n\nmedical needs.    The cornerstone of his claim is the missed viral\n\nload report.     That Cichon missed this report and neglected to\n\nfollow up is at a minimum sub-optimal, perhaps even negligent.\n\nCichon acknowledges that his failure to account for the report was\n\n\"unfortunate\" and that a referral to a specialist ought to have\n\nbeen made.     But carelessness or inadvertence falls short of the\n\nEighth Amendment standard of deliberate indifference.   See Feeney,\n\n464 F.3d at 162; cf. Montgomery v. Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 500 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (\"[T]he mere loss . . . of . . . medical records does\n\nnot rise to the requisite level of deliberate indifference.\").   To\n\nsurvive summary judgment, Leavitt must present enough evidence for\n\na factfinder to conclude that Cichon ignored the viral load report,\n\neither intentionally or recklessly, \"'not in the tort law sense but\n\nin the appreciably stricter criminal-law sense, requiring actual\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fknowledge of impending harm, easily preventable.'\"              Feeney, 464\n\nF.3d at 162 (quoting Watson, 984 F.2d at 540).\n\n                It is undisputed that Cichon knew that Leavitt suffered\n\nfrom     HIV,    a   medical   condition   that   the   physician   assistant\n\nunderstood was serious and potentially life-threatening if left\n\nuntreated; that Leavitt had not had access to his prescribed\n\nantiretroviral regimen for at least a month, if not longer, by the\n\ntime he was seen at the clinic; and that Leavitt's CD4 count was\n\nabnormally low the last two times he was tested, in April and\n\nOctober 2006.22        According to Leavitt, he had also complained to\n\nCichon about an array of symptoms, including night sweats, chills,\n\nfever, and nausea, and told the physician assistant that he needed\n\nhis antiretroviral drugs to keep him alive.               A jury could thus\n\nreasonably infer that Cichon was aware that Leavitt's health was at\n\nrisk.        See Ruiz-Rosa, 485 F.3d at 157.\n\n                A jury could further infer that Cichon had a financial\n\ninterest in not confirming that the risk was imminent and, hence,\n\nthat Cichon required immediate treatment.           See Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n843 n.8 (noting that a prison official \"would not escape liability\n\nif the evidence showed that he merely refused to verify underlying\n\nfacts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm\n\n\n        22\n        Even though Cichon claims not to recollect seeing Leavitt's\nOctober 2006 CD4 test report, it is undisputed that he initialed\nit. Moreover, it is undisputed that he reviewed Leavitt's records\nfrom ACJ, which indicated that appellant had a below-normal CD4\ncell count of 355 as recently as April 2006.\n\n                                     -28-\n\finferences of risk that he strongly suspected to exist\"); see also\n\nMata v. Saiz, 427 F.3d 745, 752 (10th Cir. 2005) (reiterating the\n\nabove rule from Farmer and noting that \"this level of intent can be\n\ndemonstrated through circumstantial evidence\").             After all, Cichon\n\npurportedly said to Leavitt that he would not provide him with HIV\n\nmedications      because    they   are    too    costly.   Moreover,      as   the\n\npresident   of    ARCH     and   its   largest    shareholder,   Cichon    had   a\n\nfinancial stake in keeping treatment and referral costs low to\n\nsatisfy CMS and to remain competitive against other contractors.\n\nCichon testified that ARCH had a two-year contract with the jail\n\nwith the possibility of extensions and that the renewal of ARCH's\n\ncontract depended on keeping YCJ \"happy.\"              He also testified that\n\nin June 2009 ARCH lost the contract to CMS because of the \"cost\n\nsavings\" that the latter apparently provided.\n\n            As further support for his theory, Leavitt points out\n\nthat Cichon had been admonished by the state medical licensing\n\nauthorities for unprofessional conduct that could be interpreted as\n\nevidence of his desire to lower the costs of medical care at YCJ.\n\nThe Medical Board found that he withheld medications from a patient\n\nwith a chronic health condition \"without appropriate evaluation\"\n\nand \"with no clear reason that the patient could not receive them.\"\n\nHe also changed the frequency of dosage of medication for another\n\npatient from four to two times a day because the jail contracted\n\nfor staff to distribute medications only twice a day. Furthermore,\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fhe provided medical care without a supervising physician -- a\n\ncontractor for whom ARCH presumably would have had to pay.\n\n           Finally, Cichon stated that in seventeen years, he had\n\nnever neglected to review any other patient report.            Given the\n\nevidence   of   Cichon's   financial   interest   in   minimizing   costs,\n\nincluding his own explicit statement to that effect, the past\n\ninstances in which he acted allegedly to advance that interest, and\n\nthe fact that he had never before missed a lab report, a reasonable\n\njury could conclude that Cichon acted with deliberate indifference\n\nby choosing not to review the viral load report, as its results\n\nwould have obliged him, in his own words, \"to move precipitously\"\n\nto deal with Leavitt's chronic medical condition.           See Monmouth\n\nCnty., 834 F.3d at 346 (\"[W]here 'knowledge of the need for medical\n\ncare [is accompanied by the] . . . intentional refusal to provide\n\nthat care,' the deliberate indifference standard has been met.\"\n\n(second and third alterations in original) (citation omitted)\n\n(quoting Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th\n\nCir. 1985))); cf. Montgomery, 294 F.3d at 500 (holding that inmate\n\nstated a prima facie Eighth Amendment case, where he alleged that\n\ndefendants refused to provide him with treatment for his HIV over\n\na nine-month period despite their prior determination that the\n\ntreatment was necessary).\n\n           In granting summary judgment for Cichon, the district\n\ncourt emphasized that even after Cichon purportedly made the\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fstatement about not treating HIV because of cost constraints, he\n\ndirected ARCH nursing staff to gather Leavitt's medical history,\n\nordered blood tests, and reviewed Leavitt's records. This conduct,\n\nwhile certainly relevant to Cichon's defense, does not preclude a\n\njury from finding that his subsequent failure to examine the viral\n\nload report and to follow up on Leavitt's condition, in combination\n\nwith other evidence in the summary judgment record, added up to\n\ndeliberate indifference.23       As Leavitt suggests, Cichon may well\n\nhave ordered the lab tests and medical reports simply to \"paper his\n\nfile\" or to \"lull[ Leavitt] into complacency.\"         The district court\n\nwas too quick to decide that Cichon's version was credible and\n\nLeavitt's not.     This is precisely the sort of genuine and material\n\ndispute that ought to be resolved by a jury.24            See Anderson v.\n\nLiberty   Lobby,   Inc.,   477   U.S.   242,   255   (1986)   (\"Credibility\n\n\n     23\n       Indeed, Leavitt himself does not take issue with Cichon's\ndecision to order the lab tests and medical history; it is\nundisputed that this was the proper course of action prior to\nrestarting antiretroviral treatment.\n     24\n       In making this credibility determination, the district court\nalso assigned significant weight to the fact that Leavitt did not\nsubmit any IMRFs or make further complaints to the medical\ndepartment about his HIV after the October clinic appointment.\nWhile a jury is free to consider this fact in determining whether\nCichon acted with deliberate indifference, we do not see how\nLeavitt's actions would, as a matter of law, excuse Cichon's\npurposeful or reckless decision to ignore the viral load report or\nto refuse to provide Leavitt with a referral or other treatment.\nCf. Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 303 (1991) (emphasizing that\n\"assuming the conduct is harmful enough to satisfy the objective\ncomponent of an Eighth Amendment claim,\" the \"wantonness\" of an\nofficial's conduct depends only \"upon the constraints facing the\nofficial\").\n\n                                   -31-\n\fdeterminations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of\n\nlegitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those\n\nof a judge . . . .\").\n\n                 b. Serious Medical Need\n\n          \"Because   '[t]he    objective   component   of   an    Eighth\n\nAmendment claim is . . . [necessarily] contextual' and fact-\n\nspecific, the serious medical need inquiry must be tailored to the\n\nspecific circumstances of each case.\"        Smith, 316 F.3d at 185\n\n(alterations in original) (citation omitted) (quoting Hudson v.\n\nMcMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8 (1992)).       It is obvious that HIV is a\n\nserious medical condition, as the condition can be life-threatening\n\nif not properly treated.   See Brown v. Johnson, 387 F.3d 1344, 1351\n\n(11th Cir. 2004); Montgomery, 294 F.3d at 500.          Nevertheless,\n\nCichon argues that the seriousness of the underlying medical\n\ncondition does not alone establish the \"serious medical need\" prong\n\nof the Eighth Amendment inquiry.     He insists that the inquiry must\n\nbe more particularized.    Because Leavitt's case against Cichon is\n\npredicated on the physician assistant's failure to review and\n\nfollow up on the results of the viral load test, Cichon argues that\n\nwe should focus on the seriousness of the effects of this omission.\n\nSee Gaudreault, 923 F.2d at 208; see also Smith, 316 F.3d at 186\n\n(\"[I]t's the particular risk of harm faced by a prisoner due to the\n\nchallenged deprivation of care, rather than the severity of the\n\nprisoner's   underlying    medical   condition,   considered     in   the\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\fabstract, that is relevant for Eighth Amendment purposes.\"); Napier\n\nv. Madison Cnty., 238 F.3d 739, 742 (6th Cir. 2001).    We conclude\n\nthat even under the version of the objective inquiry that Cichon\n\nurges us to undertake, Leavitt has presented sufficient evidence to\n\nreach a jury on the issue of serious medical need.\n\n           To begin, Cichon himself concedes that if he had seen the\n\nviral load report indicating that Leavitt's viral load was 143,000,\n\nhe would have found that number to be sufficiently alarming that he\n\nwould have \"move[d] precipitously\" to refer Leavitt to a specialist.\n\nCf. Sealock v. Colo., 218 F.3d 1205, 1211-12 (10th Cir. 2000)\n\n(relying on similarly \"candid testimony\" to reverse a district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment in favor of a correctional\n\nhealthcare provider).   Leavitt presented expert testimony that if\n\nthat referral had been made, he would have been put back onto his\n\nantiretroviral regimen in short order and would not have suffered\n\nthe various adverse effects of untreated HIV.25      With regard to\n\nthese effects, Leavitt submitted affidavit evidence that during his\n\nincarceration at YCJ he suffered from nightsweats, chills, fevers,\n\n\n\n     25\n       Leavitt's medical expert testified that if Leavitt had been\nreferred to him for care in October 2006 and presented with a CD4\ncount of 415, he would have gathered the necessary medical\ninformation and followed up in \"about a week\" with the chosen\ntreatment regimen. The expert also testified that \"knowing the\n[HIV specialists] out there, the majority of people would have\nfound a regimen for him and gotten him back on antiretroviral\ntherapy\" immediately because Leavitt is \"not a novel patient,\" but\n\"a patient with ongoing HIV disease who has a history of very low\nCD4 counts.\"\n\n                               -33-\n\ffatigue,    gastrointestinal        problems,      including      vomiting    and\n\nconstipation, and psoriasis -- symptoms that he attributed to his\n\nuntreated     HIV    and   to    \"detoxing\"      from    the     withdrawal     of\n\nantiretroviral treatment.\n\n            Leavitt presented evidence that Cichon's omission not\n\nonly exposed him to these short-term effects, but also led to the\n\nexacerbation of his underlying condition.                 Soon after Leavitt\n\narrived at MSP, he began suffering from thrush, leukoplakia, and\n\nseborrheic dermatitis -- conditions that VTC providers interpreted\n\nas indications of immunological decline from HIV.                He continues to\n\nsuffer from rashes, warts, fatigue, and malaise.                   Leavitt also\n\npresented expert testimony that he suffered a detrimental decrease\n\nin his CD4 count because of the \"continuum\" of inadequate treatment\n\nhe received at YCJ and MSP.          See Monmouth Cnty., 834 F.2d at 347\n\n(\"[W]here denial or delay causes an inmate to suffer a life-long\n\nhandicap    or    permanent     loss,   the    medical   need    is   considered\n\nserious.\").      The wealth of evidence he presented also shows that he\n\nis statistically more likely to be susceptible to opportunistic\n\ninfections and cancer in the future.\n\n            From    this   record,      a   factfinder   could    conclude    that\n\nCichon's deprivation of care subjected Leavitt to serious harm, both\n\nshort-term and long-term. See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33 (holding that\n\ncorrectional officials may not ignore medical conditions that are\n\n\"very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering\" in the\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\ffuture, and that such prospective harm can be the basis of an Eighth\n\nAmendment   claim,      even   if   the   inmate   has   \"no    serious       current\n\nsymptoms\"); see also Smith, 316 F.3d at 188 (holding that \"an Eighth\n\nAmendment claim may be based on a defendant's conduct in exposing\n\nan inmate to an unreasonable risk of future harm\").                           We thus\n\nconclude that Leavitt has established a material dispute as to\n\nwhether Cichon acted with deliberate indifference to his serious\n\nmedical needs and that the district court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of Cichon.26\n\n            2. Leavitt's Claims Against the Individual CMS Defendants\n\n            Leavitt     also   appeals     the   district      court's       grant   of\n\nsummary judgment on his ยง 1983 claim against CMS employees Tritch,\n\nWoodward, Watkins, and Kesteloot in their individual and official\n\ncapacities.      We focus first on the claims against these defendants\n\nin their individual capacities.\n\n            In    his   brief,      Leavitt   appears    to    press     a    mix    of\n\ncollective and vicarious liability theories. He alleges that \"[a]ll\n\n\n     26\n        As an alternative for granting summary judgment in favor of\nCichon,    the  district   court   concluded  that   \"Leavitt   has\ninsubstantial proof of injury caused by Cichon\" as required under\nยง 1983. See Sullivan v. City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st\nCir. 2009). Given the amount of evidence on causation and injury\navailable in the record, this issue cannot be resolved at the\nsummary judgment stage. See, e.g., Gayton v. McCoy, 593 F.3d 610,\n624 (7th Cir. 2010) (holding that \"only in the rare instance that\na plaintiff can proffer no evidence that a delay in medical\ntreatment exacerbated an injury should summary judgment be granted\non the issue of causation,\" and thus reversing the district court's\nentry of summary judgment in favor of a nurse on an inmate's Eighth\nAmendment claim).\n\n                                       -35-\n\fthe CMS defendants\" knew he had HIV, a disease that, if left\n\nuntreated, could be fatal; were aware of his active HIV symptoms;\n\nhad access to his medical charts; had the ability to communicate\n\nwith VTC about his care; and were working for the same employer and\n\ncould communicate with each other.          These allegations, he contends,\n\ncoupled with the simple fact that it took over seventeen months to\n\nreinitiate    his   antiretroviral    therapy,    are   enough   to   put   the\n\nquestion of the defendants' deliberate indifference to a jury.\n\n             Leavitt's group liability theory may accurately reflect\n\nsome deficiencies in the provision of health services at MSP.               The\n\nprison's medical department operates on a clinic model. Inmates see\n\nvarious providers, each of whom is not charged with following a\n\nparticular patient but instead attends to whoever shows up at the\n\nclinic at the time he or she is working.           Regardless, this theory\n\ncannot provide the basis for recovery: \"It is axiomatic that the\n\nliability of persons sued in their individual capacities under\n\nsection 1983 must be gauged in terms of their own actions.\"             Rogan\n\nv. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).             Nor can supervisory\n\nofficials, like Tritch, be held liable for the conduct of their\n\nsubordinates solely under a theory of respondeat superior.            Sanchez\n\nv. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 49 (1st Cir. 2009) (reiterating\n\nthe principle that government officials may be held liable only \"on\n\nthe basis of their own acts or omissions,\" and not \"for the\n\nunconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\frespondeat superior\" (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937,\n\n1948 (2009))).27        It may be true that the care Leavitt received at\n\nMSP was generally inadequate.            However, to make out a cognizable\n\nEighth      Amendment   claim   against    healthcare   providers   in   their\n\nindividual capacity, he must demonstrate that there is sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that each CMS\n\ndefendant was \"aware of facts from which the inference could be\n\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\" and that each\n\ndefendant did, in fact, \"draw the inference.\"            Farmer 511 U.S. at\n\n837.   We cannot conclude that Leavitt has satisfied his burden.\n\n                        a. Todd Tritch\n\n              Leavitt's grievance appears to be that Tritch acted with\n\ndeliberate indifference in failing first to sign off on necessary\n\nreferrals to specialists and second to follow up on Leavitt after\n\ncommitting to intervene more personally in his care.           Leavitt only\n\ninsinuates the first theory, and the record simply does not bear out\n\nthe latter.     Tritch did not became personally involved in Leavitt's\n\ncare until August 10, 2007.28      After examining appellant, Tritch not\n\n\n\n       27\n       Leavitt does not allege that any particular CMS defendant\n\"supervise[d], train[ed], or hire[d] a subordinate with deliberate\nindifference toward the possibility that deficient performance of\nthe task eventually may contribute to a civil rights deprivation.\"\nSanchez, 590 F.3d at 49 (quoting Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d\n41, 44 (1st Cir.1999)).\n       28\n       Tritch approved Leavitt's referrals to outside specialists\nprior to August 2007, but Leavitt does not allege any specific\nwrongdoing on Tritch's part in dealing with referrals.\n\n                                     -37-\n\fonly ordered updated blood work, but also took the unusual step of\n\nordering that Leavitt's follow-up appointment specifically be with\n\nhim.   While the appointment never took place, there is no evidence\n\nthat this omission was anything more than an unfortunate scheduling\n\nglitch.   It is undisputed that when Tritch finally saw the August\n\nlab results in November, he approved Leavitt's referral to VTC.        It\n\nis also undisputed that in June 2008, it was Tritch who reviewed\n\nLeavitt's chart, concluded that his HIV medications should have been\n\nstarted sooner, and put in the order for antiretroviral drugs.\n\n           Based on this series of events, no reasonable factfinder\n\ncould conclude that Tritch acted with deliberate indifference.         To\n\nthe contrary, each time he became aware of potentially serious harm\n\nto Leavitt, he reacted expeditiously.       Perhaps Tritch was not as\n\naware as one would like a medical professional to be, but \"an\n\nofficial's failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should\n\nhave perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot\n\n. . . be condemned as the infliction of punishment,\" let alone\n\npunishment cruel and unusual.     Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838.\n\n                     b. Edie Woodward and Charlene Watkins\n\n           Against    Woodward   and   Watkins,   Leavitt's   allegations\n\nreduce to the theory that they ought to have been more proactive in\n\nfollowing up on his care -- that, for example, Woodward should have\n\npursued the results of Leavitt's genotype test when Bio Reference\n\nfailed to report them, and Watkins should have taken steps to\n\n\n                                  -38-\n\fconfirm that an appointment with VTC had been scheduled as ordered.\n\nLeavitt offers nothing beyond conclusory allegations that their\n\nfailure to do so was a symptom of deliberate indifference.                 See\n\nRuiz-Rosa, 485 F.3d at 156 (\"Allegations made in a plaintiffโs\n\ncomplaint, standing alone, are not enough to oppose a properly\n\nsupported motion for summary judgment.\").            The record shows that\n\nWoodward and Watkins behaved in ways consistent with their professed\n\nintention to treat Leavitt: each saw him in the chronic care clinic\n\non myriad occasions, treated him for his immediate complaints, and\n\nordered     testing   and   follow-up    appointments      when   appropriate.\n\nCertainly, they both relied on inaccurate or imperfect data in\n\nLeavitt's chart that appointments had been ordered or that follow-up\n\nphone calls would be made, but there is no evidence that their\n\nreliance was not in good faith.          See Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S.\n\n312, 319 (1986) (\"It is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence\n\nor error in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited by\n\nthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\"); Battista v. Clarke, __\n\nF.3d ___, 2011 WL 1902165, at *5 (1st Cir. May 20, 2011) (\"[S]o long\n\nas the balancing judgments are within the realm of reason and made\n\nin   good    faith,   the   officials'     actions   are    not    \"deliberate\n\nindifference.\").\n\n             With respect to Watkins, Leavitt points to one other\n\nincident as a ground for his deliberate indifference claim.                 He\n\nasserts that when Watkins received the consultation report from his\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\fMarch appointment at VTC, stating \"Will need to start him back on\n\nTruvada/Kaletra now,\" she should have started his antiretroviral\n\ntherapy immediately.            Watkins claims that because the report also\n\nrecommended that \"they obtain a CD4, [viral load,] and a genotype,\"\n\nshe interpreted it to mean that Leavitt should not restart treatment\n\nuntil   after     a    new    round      of   blood    tests.       Even   if   Watkins's\n\ninterpretation         was    incorrect,        it    is   uncontroverted       that     she\n\nproceeded in accordance with that interpretation, ordering the\n\nupdated lab work she thought was required before Leavitt could be\n\nput   back   on       Truvada      and    Kaletra.         In   this    context,    their\n\ndisagreement      over       the   interpretation          of   VTC's   instruction      is\n\ntantamount to a dispute over the exercise of professional judgment\n\nand insufficient to support a constitutional claim.                        See Torraco,\n\n923 F.2d at 234 (observing that \"'[w]here the dispute concerns not\n\nthe   absence     of    help,      but    the   choice     of   a   certain     course   of\n\ntreatment,'\" deliberate indifference may be found [only if] the\n\nattention received is 'so clearly inadequate as to amount to a\n\nrefusal to provide essential care'\" (quoting Sires v. Berman, 834\n\nF.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1987); Miranda v. Munoz, 770 F.2d 255, 259 (1st\n\nCir. 1985))); Ferranti v. Moran, 618 F.2d 888, 891 (1st Cir. 1980)\n\n(holding that \"disagreement on the appropriate course of treatment\n\n. . . may present a colorable claim of negligence[] but . . . falls\n\nshort of alleging a constitutional violation\").\n\n\n\n\n                                              -40-\n\f                       c. Teresa Kesteloot29\n\n             Leavitt     takes   issue    with   Kesteloot's   failure,   in\n\ninvestigating his May complaint, to review earlier entries in his\n\nchart, including lab results from March that indicated a low CD4\n\ncell count and high viral load.          Relatedly, Leavitt complains that\n\nKesteloot did not look into why his antiretroviral therapy had been\n\ndelayed until he filed his grievance. These allegations have little\n\nforce when Leavitt himself acknowledges that Kesteloot's only focus\n\nin investigating his complaint was on whether his current concerns\n\nwere being addressed, and not on whether past treatment had been\n\nappropriate.     Kesteloot concluded her investigation after being\n\nsatisfied that Leavitt had recently been seen by clinic providers,\n\nthat his labs had just been drawn, and that a follow-up appointment\n\nwith VTC was scheduled. This was a reasonable response to Leavitt's\n\ncomplaint.     See Burrell, 307 F.3d at 8 (\"[P]rison officials . . .\n\ncannot be deliberately indifferent if they responded reasonably to\n\nthe risk, even if the harm ultimately was not avoided.\").             It is\n\ntrue that Kesteloot did not investigate whether Leavitt's treatment\n\nwas evidence of a systemic problem at MSP or follow up on Leavitt\n\nto insure that there would be no further delays in his treatment.\n\n\n\n     29\n       The CMS defendants argue that Leavitt has waived his claim\nagainst Kesteloot by failing to \"separately address\" that claim in\nhis consolidated objection to the magistrate judge's recommended\ndecisions. We need not resolve the issue of waiver; we conclude on\nthe merits that Leavitt does not have a triable claim against\nKesteloot.\n\n                                    -41-\n\fHowever, her failure to take these affirmative steps is, without\n\nmore, insufficient to allow a jury to find deliberate indifference.\n\n            3. Leavitt's Claims Against CMS and Its Employees in\n            Their Official Capacities\n\n            Finally, we reach Leavitt's claims against CMS and its\n\nemployees in their official capacities.               CMS concedes that as a\n\nprivate entity operating in its capacity at MSP at the time in\n\nquestion, it can be held liable as a municipality for the purpose\n\nof suits filed under ยง 1983.30         As for the CMS employees, \"[a]\n\ndamages    suit   against   an   official   in   an    official   capacity    is\n\ntantamount to a suit against the entity of which the official is an\n\nagent.\" Burrell, 307 F.3d at 7. Thus the question is whether there\n\nis any basis for imposing liability against the entity.\n\n            An underlying constitutional tort is required to proceed\n\nunder a municipal liability theory.          Where, as here, there is no\n\nconstitutional violation by the employees of the municipality, there\n\ncan be no liability predicated on municipal policy or custom.                See\n\nKennedy v. Town of Billerica, 617 F.3d 520, 531-32 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).31\n\n\n\n      30\n       This circuit has not expressly held that private entities\nshould be treated analogously to municipalities for the purpose of\nยง 1983 liability. Still, the parties agree that CMS may be held\nliable as though it were a municipality, and so we have proceeded\naccordingly.\n      31\n       Having concluded that Leavitt failed to put forth sufficient\nevidence of the CMS defendants' deliberate indifference, we see no\nneed to reach the issue of \"serious medical need.\"\n\n                                    -42-\n\f                               III.\n\n           Although we conclude that the record is insufficient to\n\nallow Leavitt's Eighth Amendment claims against the CMS defendants\n\nto go to a jury because of the stringent constitutional standard,\n\nwe note the acknowledgment of the CMS defendants that \"the care\n\n[Leavitt] received ultimately fell short of the mark.\"          Those\n\nresponsible for the operation of the Maine correctional healthcare\n\nsystem, including MDOC, should focus on the troubling implications\n\nof that acknowledgment.\n\n           For the reasons set forth, we vacate the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Cichon; affirm the grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of CMS, Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, and\n\nKesteloot; and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.   Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -43-\n\f",

Leavitt, an inmate of the Maine corrections system, seeks a civil rights remedy for the alleged denial of adequate medical care for human <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by healthcare professionals at the York County Jail (YCJ) and the Maine State Prison (MSP). Claiming that correctional medical officials acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment, Leavitt brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against a number of defendants, including Alfred Cichon, a physician assistant at YCJ; Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (CMS), the private contractor that provided medical care at MSP; and CMS employees Todd Tritch, Edie Woodward, Charlene Watkins, and Teresa Kesteloot.<sup>[1]</sup> In separate orders, the district court granted summary judgment for Cichon and the CMS defendants, and Leavitt appeals.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that Leavitt's evidence could not, as a matter of law, establish that the CMS defendants' actions violated the Eighth Amendment. However, we conclude that Leavitt has established a material dispute as to whether Alfred Cichon acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We thus affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of the CMS defendants, reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of Cichon, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Appellant is, and was at all times material to this case, HIV-positive. He was incarcerated at YCJ from September 6, 2006, through February 17, 2007, at which point he was transferred to MSP. He claims that the defendants inappropriately denied him treatment for HIV for the entirety of his 167-day stay at YCJ and for nearly seventeen months of his incarceration at MSP. This delay in the reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV, Leavitt alleges, \"constituted a continuum of harm,\" which resulted in short- and long-term negative consequences for his health. We chronicle his treatment history in some detail as presented in the summary judgment record, presenting the facts in the light most favorable to Leavitt and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Burrell v. Hampshire Cnty.,</i> 307 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Leavitt's Treatment at YCJ</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Initial Clinic Visit</h2>\n<p>At the time of his incarceration at YCJ, Leavitt suffered from HIV, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and hypothyroidism. On October 5, 2006, about one month into his detention at YCJ, Leavitt had his firstยand onlyยclinical interaction with defendant Alfred Cichon.<sup>[2]</sup> Cichon was the physician assistant who worked at the jail most frequently, about sixteen hours per week, and he also was president of Allied Resources for Correctional Health, Inc. (ARCH), the corporation that provided contract healthcare services to inmates at YCJ.</p>\n<p>At the October 5 clinic visit, Cichon performed a routine physical examination of Leavitt, concluding that the latter's health in general was \"normal.\" Appellant told Cichon that he was HIV-positive; said that he was experiencing night sweats, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting; and complained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> that he had not received his antiretroviral medications. He also lamented that \"it wasn't right he was being kept off his HIV meds since they had been keeping him alive for the past 10 years and keeping his symptoms and low blood count from claiming him as a victim of AIDS.\"</p>\n<p>At this point, Cichon purportedly made a statement that constitutes the key fact in dispute in Leavitt's case against him. He said, \"We don't give away [HIV] medications here at this jail[,] because the jail is so small and we are not equipped financially to hold the burden of providing expensive medication\"; \"[you will] have to wait until you [get] to the Maine State Prison where they are able to pay for these medications.\" Additionally, Cichon allegedly advised Leavitt, \"You don't need to stay on the [HIV] medications to be healthy, and just as soon as you get to the [MSP] they'll fix you right up.\"</p>\n<p>At the time of their meeting, Cichon knew that Leavitt had been without his HIV medications for at least one month, as appellant had been incarcerated since September. Patients who take a break from antiretroviral therapy may become resistant to one or more of the drugs used as part of the regimen. Cichon thus informed Leavitt that he could not reinstate his HIV medications or refer him to an infectious disease specialist without first acquiring his medical history, information about his medications and compliance with taking those medications, and blood test results for his current CD4 cell count and viral load.<sup>[3]</sup> There is no dispute that this was the proper response to a request for restarting antiretroviral treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. After Leavitt's Clinic Visit</h2>\n<p>Cichon directed the ARCH nursing staff to obtain Leavitt's medical records from the various facilities where he had been treated for HIV. Cichon also ordered lab work to determine Leavitt's complete blood count differential, CD4 cell count, and viral load. These labs, like all tests and medications prescribed for inmates, were paid for by YCJ.</p>\n<p>In short order, Leavitt's medical records from the Androscoggin County Jail (ACJ), Cumberland County Jail, and Positive Health Care were faxed to YCJ, where they were reviewed and initialed by Cichon. The records indicated that Leavitt had a long history of HIV and that he previously had been prescribed the antiretroviral drugs Truvada and Kaletra. The records also established that Leavitt's labs on April 6, 2006 had shown an undetectable viral load of less than 75 and an abnormally low CD4 cell count of 355. Moreover, they showed that at the time of Leavitt's incarceration at ACJ on July 11, 2006, his medical condition was normal and he did not complain of fatigue, night sweats, or any objective symptoms of HIV. Finally, the records disclosed that Leavitt had a history of alcohol abuse that may have impeded his compliance with antiretroviral therapy, and that Leavitt had been at various points non-compliant with taking his HIV medications. Although Leavitt concedes the veracity of these records, he insists he had been taking his HIV medications \"on a regular basis\" before he entered YCJ.</p>\n<p>The lab reports from the blood work Cichon ordered were addressed to him and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> routed to the medical office at YCJ, where in the ordinary course of business they would have been placed on a clipboard and reviewed by Cichon each time he visited the jail. The CD4 cell count report indicated that Leavitt had a lower than normal count of 415 and noted that the \"[m]ild decrease in CD4 level and increase in CD8 subset\" was \"indicative of immunodeficiency state and/or recent viral infection.\" Cichon claims no recollection of seeing these results, but acknowledges that his initial appears on the first page of the lab report, which would signal that he had reviewed them.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The viral load report indicated a higher than normal viral load of 143,000. Cichon also claims not to have seen this report; the copy of it subpoenaed from YCJ and entered into the record does not bear his initial. He asserts that this is the first time in seventeen years that an omission of this type occurred, that he would have considered a viral load of 143,000 to be higher \"than [he] would like to see it,\" and that he would have \"move[d] precipitously\" to refer Leavitt to an infectious disease specialist if he had reviewed the report. Cichon understood that HIV is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Remainder of Leavitt's Stay at YCJ</h2>\n<p>It is undisputed that during the four months between the October 5 clinic appointment and Leavitt's transfer to MSP, Cichon never saw Leavitt again, did not refer Leavitt to a specialist, or take any other steps to follow up on Leavitt's HIV condition. Leavitt did not see an infectious disease specialist or restart antiretroviral treatment for his HIV while at YCJ.</p>\n<p>Although appellant was aware that the method for requesting medical treatment or medications at YCJ was to file an Inmate Medical Request Form (IMRF), he did not submit one related to treatment for HIV or HIV-related symptoms.<sup>[5]</sup> Leavitt did, however, write one or more letters to YCJ's medical department, including one to Cichon, requesting the resumption of his HIV medications. He submitted these letters to a YCJ officer at some point prior to his appointment with Cichon.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of HIV include fevers, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, wasting syndrome, chronic diarrhea, thrush, leukoplakia (a white, film-like protrusion on the lateral side of the tongue), psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. During the period of his incarceration at YCJ, Leavitt suffered from night sweats, chills, fever, fatigue, psoriasis, nausea, and gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting and constipation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. ARCH's Contractual Relationship with YCJ</h2>\n<p>In addition to serving as president of ARCH, Cichon was also its largest shareholder, with ownership of over a quarter of its stock. Cichon testified at his deposition that YCJ put its healthcare services contract out for bid every two years, that beginning November 2004 ARCH had a two-year contract with YCJ with the possibility of extensions, and that such extensions were dependent on whether YCJ was \"happy with [ARCH].\"<sup>[6]</sup> Cichon also testified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> that ARCH eventually lost the YCJ contract to CMS in June 2009 because YCJ \"perceived that there [would be] a cost savings there.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Cichon's Professional Record</h2>\n<p>Cichon was given several \"letters of guidance\" by the Maine State Board of Licensure in Medicine (\"Medical Board\") for various infractions involving other patients that happened around the time of Leavitt's incarceration. These infractions included changing the frequency of dosage of a medication for another patient without first informing the patient,<sup>[7]</sup> as well as withholding medications from a patient with a chronic health condition \"without appropriate evaluation\" and \"with no clear reason that the patient could not receive them.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Moreover, the Medical Board suspended Cichon's physician assistant license for ninety days as a sanction for his providing medical services without a licensed supervisory physician.<sup>[9]</sup> Subsequently, Cichon also entered into a consent agreement with the Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure in January 2008, in which he admitted to, among other things, the violations of his physician assistant's license for which he was disciplined by the Medical Board. Under the terms of the consent agreement, Cichon's license to practice was subject to a number of probationary conditions, including heightened supervision and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Leavitt's Treatment at MSP</h2>\n<p>On February 17, 2007, Leavitt transferred from YCJ to MSP. By contract, CMS provides medical care at MSP, as well as some other facilities operated by the Maine Department of Corrections (MDOC). CMS employed the four other individual defendants involved in this appeal: Dr. Todd Tritch as the Regional Medical Director of CMS in Maine; Edie Woodward, a physician assistant, and Charlene Watkins, a family practitioner nurse, as healthcare providers at MSP; and Teresa Kesteloot as the Health Services Administrator at MSP.</p>\n<p>Since MSP's medical department operates on a clinic model, patients are usually not followed by particular providers. Inmates with chronic diseases, including HIV, are assigned to the chronic care clinic, in which they are seen typically at three-month intervals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Leavitt's Initial Treatment at MSP</h2>\n<p>Leavitt's first clinical interaction at MSP came in the form of an intake appointment with a CMS-employed physician assistant three days after his transfer. At this time, Leavitt said he was HIV-positive and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> asked to resume antiretroviral treatment. The physician assistant ordered a new round of blood tests and requested Leavitt's treatment records. Leavitt's labs were subsequently drawn and reported, showing an abnormal CD4 cell count of 460 and an elevated viral load over 97,000.<sup>[10]</sup> The physician assistant also ordered an appointment \"ASAP\" with an infectious disease specialist. Generally, CMS providers use the term \"ASAP\" when there is some degree of concern about a patient's health. Nevertheless, the follow-up with the specialist never took place.</p>\n<p>About one month later, another CMS provider wrote an order that Leavitt be \"referred to an infectious disease doctor for starting HIV medications.\" That order, and all requests to refer patients to outside consultations, had to be approved by defendant Tritch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Leavitt's First Consultation with Specialists</h2>\n<p>With Tritch's approval, appellant was examined in May 2007 by a team of HIV specialists at the Virology Treatment Center (VTC) in Portland, Maine. At that time, Leavitt again requested to be reinstated on his HIV medications. VTC sent a consultation report to CMS, which stated, \"HIV: No urgent indication for . . . rx with CD4 at 460,\" meaning that Leavitt then had a good buffer in his immunological reserve to protect him from opportunistic infections or other consequences of HIV/AIDS.<sup>[11]</sup> VTC's medical director subsequently explained that he decided to defer reinitiating antiretroviral treatment so that he could obtain additional information about Leavitt's immune status, viral load, medication history, and previous drug resistance testing. His decision also relied on Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines recommending the deferral of antiretroviral treatment for patients with CD4 cell counts above 350 who did not have an AIDS-defining illness or severe symptoms of HIV infection.<sup>[12]</sup> The consultation report recommended that Leavitt return for a follow-up appointment in four to six weeks. At the end of May 2007, a CMS provider noted VTC's recommendation and ordered a follow-up appointment for Leavitt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Leavitt's Treatment in Summer and Fall of 2007</h2>\n<p>Leavitt was next seen at the chronic care clinic by CMS defendant Edie Woodward in June 2007, when she treated him for a rash. Woodward assumed the follow-up <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> appointment with VTC had been or was being scheduled, and she accordingly entered an order for \"follow up with [VTC] as scheduled.\"</p>\n<p>On August 10, 2007, Leavitt submitted a prison sick-call slip in which he complained: \"As a result of being denied meds for HIV+ my immune system is low resulting in thrush[,] and it seems as though I'm being denied meds for that also.\" That same day, Tritch examined Leavitt. Tritch confirmed that the latter was suffering from thrush and ordered updated blood work to assess the condition of his HIV. Tritch also submitted an order for Leavitt to return for a follow-up visit specifically with him the next month. That appointment, however, was not scheduled as Tritch ordered, and it never took place.</p>\n<p>The results from the lab tests Tritch ordered reported that Leavitt's CD4 cell count had fallen to 424 and that his viral load had risen to greater than 100,000.<sup>[13]</sup> It was not until November, however, that Tritch, without having seen Leavitt again as promised, approved Leavitt's referral to VTC.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Leavitt saw Woodward at the chronic care clinic on September 1 and October 22, 2007. At the September clinic, Leavitt complained of a rash on his underarms, fatigue, and white, cracked, and painful toesยall symptoms she recognized could have been attributable to HIV. Woodward prescribed an antifungal cream for Leavitt's skin and feet. Even though she knew that the one-month follow-up consultation recommended by VTC in May never occurred, she did not determine why the appointment did not take place or take any steps to expedite the process.</p>\n<p>At the October clinic, Leavitt complained of intermittent thrush and a rash. He again requested HIV and hepatitis C treatment. Woodward ordered various medications to treat his immediate complaints, requested updated blood work, and put in a new order for the follow-up appointment that Leavitt was supposed to have with Tritch. She did not, however, put in a second order for the referral to VTC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The December Follow-up Appointment at VTC and Its Aftermath</h2>\n<p>Leavitt did not return to VTC until December, six months after his initial consult with the specialists there. At the December appointment, Leavitt complained of fatigue and presented with symptoms, including thrush, leukoplakia, and seborrheic dermatitis, that VTC interpreted as indications of immunological decline from HIV. VTC reported to CMS that Leavitt now met the criteria for starting antiretroviral therapy for HIV, requested an updated CD4 cell count and viral load to provide a baseline for treatment, and recommended genotype testing to determine Leavitt's resistance to particular HIV medications. VTC also suggested that Leavitt return in four to six weeks, noting that it would \"likely make recommendations for therapy at that time.\" Later that month, Woodward reviewed these recommendations and ordered an HIV viral load, an immune function panel, and a follow-up appointment with VTC in one month.</p>\n<p>In early January, Woodward entered an order to \"add genotype\" to the lab work she had requested for Leavitt the previous month. Those lab results were reported on January 18 but did not include a genotype as ordered. Apparently, Bio Reference, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> the lab that processed Leavitt's blood work, experienced a technical problem; in its report to CMS, it stated that it would contact the prison for additional information. There is no evidence in Leavitt's chart of any subsequent communication between Bio Reference and CMS, and Woodward did not take steps to obtain the genotype results from Bio Reference.</p>\n<p>On January 23, 2008, Woodward observed in her progress notes that Leavitt's follow-up visit to VTC was overdue and reordered it. The next month, Woodward stopped working full time at MSP. She wrote an order in February related to Leavitt's hepatitis C treatment, but from that point forward was no longer involved in his care.</p>\n<p>CMS defendant Charlene Watkins took over Woodward's position. Watkins first saw Leavitt on February 26, 2008, when he complained of a rash, which she knew could have been a fungal infection and a symptom of HIV. She observed in her progress notes that Leavitt was due for a follow-up visit to VTC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Leavitt's March Visit to VTC</h2>\n<p>That follow-up visit, which was scheduled for February 27, was delayed on account of bad weather, and Leavitt did not return to VTC until March 12. About a month later, Leavitt saw Watkins at the chronic care clinic, whereupon he asked her why his medications had not been restarted following his March 12 visit to VTC. It turned out that no consultation report from, or record of, that visit had been placed in his CMS file. Watkins told him that it was her fault for not sending a fax to VTC. She then promptly requested and received from VTC a faxed copy of its note from Leavitt's visit, which stated: \"HIV disease: Needs to restart HIV therapy. Has been on many agents prior and likely has some resistance. Unfortunately we do not have his genotype at this time. Will need to start him back on Truvada/Kaletra now. Will recommend they obtain a CD4, [viral load,] and a genotype.\" VTC requested a follow-up appointment in one month.</p>\n<p>Watkins did not start Leavitt on his medications immediately. Instead, on April 14, Watkins ordered updated blood work and a follow-up visit to VTC. The lab results indicated that his CD4 cell count had plummeted to 296 and his viral load had escalated to 297,562. Watkins reviewed these results a little over a week later, but still did not start Leavitt on antiretroviral drugs. Nor did she confirm if the follow-up visit to VTC had actually been scheduled. Ultimately, Leavitt did not return to VTC until almost two and a half months later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Leavitt's Filing of a Formal Grievance</h2>\n<p>In the intervening period, Leavitt filed a formal grievance with MDOC through CMS defendant Teresa Kesteloot, in which he protested that he was not receiving treatment for his HIV.<sup>[14]</sup> Kesteloot, who was responsible for reviewing all healthcare-related complaints brought by MSP inmates, received the grievance no later than May 1, at which point she spoke with Leavitt, reviewed a portion of his medical chart, and discussed his care with CMS nursing staff. Kesteloot's focus in investigating Leavitt's complaint was not on trying to determine whether past treatment had been appropriateยa determination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> that she was not qualified to makeยbut solely on whether Leavitt's current concerns were being addressed.</p>\n<p>In the course of her inquiry, Kesteloot learned that Leavitt had been seen recently at the chronic care clinic, and that since his last visit to VTC on March 12, labs had been drawn and a follow-up appointment had been scheduled. She thus concluded in a memorandum to her MDOC supervisors that Leavitt \"appears to have been followed appropriately.\"<sup>[15]</sup> She took no additional steps to investigate whether the delay in Leavitt's treatment was part of a broader problem in the care of HIV-positive inmates at MSP or to follow up on Leavitt to ensure that there would be no further delays in his treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. The Reinitiation of Leavitt's HIV Treatment</h2>\n<p>Leavitt finally saw the VTC specialists again on June 25. VTC subsequently sent a consultation report to CMS in which it observed that Leavitt was \"close to AIDS,\" that he had thrush on his tongue and swollen nodes on his neck, and that he needed to \"start HIV antiviral meds ASAP.\" The next day, Tritch, who had not seen Leavitt for over ten months, reviewed Leavitt's chart and concluded that his HIV medications should have been started sooner. He then prescribed him Kaletra and Truvada.</p>\n<p>Leavitt finally restarted antiretroviral therapy on July 7, 2008, over seven months after VTC deemed him eligible under the DHHS guidelines. During the seventeen months he had been incarcerated at MSP, Leavitt on three occasions submitted sick-call slips to the MDOC expressly for HIV,<sup>[16]</sup> and on thirteen occasions submitted sick-call slips for thrush, rashes, or diarrhea.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Leavitt's Current Health and Prognosis</h2>\n<p>After Leavitt started antiretroviral medications, his thrush disappeared and he no longer experienced night sweats and chills. By July 2008, Leavitt's CD4 cell count had rebounded to 429 (from 296 in April), and by December 2008, his CD4 cell count had risen to 550, thus indicating the reconstitution of his immune system. In his labs of February 27, 2009, he dropped to a dramatically low CD4 cell count of 252. But as of June 2009, Leavitt's HIV disease was stable. Currently, he is at a healthy weight of 170 pounds. He still suffers from warts and rashes, worsening fatigue and malaise, and \"great fear and uncertainty regarding his future as a result of his HIV drug interruption.\"</p>\n<p>As examples of this uncertainty, Leavitt points to a 2006 study showing that patients with CD4 counts above 350 whose antiretroviral therapy was interrupted and not restarted until their CD4 count dropped to 250 experienced a significant increase in the risk of opportunistic disease or death from any cause over the course of the trial, as compared with patients who received continuous antiretroviral therapy. Leavitt also references a great body of medical literature suggesting that the lower a patient's CD4 cell count is when he starts or restarts antiretroviral treatment, the lesser the expectation of long-term immunologic recovery and the greater the risk of HIV- and non-HIV-related <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> complications over the short term. Leavitt further cites studies indicating that patients who begin treatment at lower CD4 cell counts have a greater risk of not fully reconstituting the normal numbers of CD4 subsets. His expert testified that the interruption of Leavitt's antiretroviral therapy from September 2006 to July 2008 constituted a \"continuum\" of harm that makes him statistically more likely to be susceptible to opportunistic infections and/or cancer in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>Leavitt filed the pro se complaint underlying this case in April 2008, when his antiretroviral therapy had not yet been restarted. In that original complaint, he brought suit for money damages and injunctive relief against CMS, YCJ, MSP, and various correctional officials and healthcare providers in their individual and official capacities, alleging that their refusal to administer his HIV medications constituted violations of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). He later voluntarily dismissed his claims against YCJ and MSP and filed an amended complaint in October 2008, also pro se, naming as defendants only CMS, a number of its employees, various persons employed by MDOC, and the Warden of MSP. Leavitt later filed a pro se complaint against Cichon, which the district court consolidated on December 9, 2008 with the previous complaint into what the court styled as a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p>Leavitt eventually obtained the services of an attorney in February 2009. Seven months later, all the defendants moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge recommended on December 31, 2009, and the district court granted on March 2, 2010, summary judgment in favor of all of the defendants, on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that defendants acted with \"deliberate indifference\" to Leavitt's medical needs, as required under the Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.<sup>[18]</sup> On appeal, Leavitt challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cichon, Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, Kesteloot, and CMS.<sup>[19]</sup> The only theory that he continues to press is their liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for the violation of his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's summary judgment ruling de novo. Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Feeney v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc.,</i> 464 F.3d 158, 161 (1st Cir.2006). Although a \"state-of-mind issue such as the existence of deliberate indifference usually presents a jury question,\" <i>Torraco v. Maloney,</i> 923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir.1991), \"a party against whom summary judgment is sought is [not] entitled to a trial simply because he has asserted a cause of action to which state of mind is a material element,\" <i>Hahn v. Sargent,</i> 523 F.2d 461, 468 (1st Cir.1975). The non-moving party must present competent evidence that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*497</span> shows a genuine issue for trial. <i>Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullรกn,</i> 485 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Analysis</h2>\n<p>\"The Constitution `does not mandate comfortable prisons,' but neither does it permit inhumane ones\"; accordingly, \"it is now settled that `the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment.'\"<sup>[21]</sup><i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (quoting <i>Rhodes v. Chapman,</i> 452 U.S. 337, 349, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); <i>Helling v. McKinney,</i> 509 U.S. 25, 31, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993)). The failure of correctional officials to provide inmates with adequate medical care may offend the Eighth Amendment if their \"acts or omissions [are] sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\" <i>Estelle v. Gamble,</i> 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p>To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim based on inadequate or delayed medical care, a plaintiff must satisfy both a subjective and objective inquiry: he must show first, \"that prison officials possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind, namely one of `deliberate indifference' to an inmate's health or safety,\" and second, that the deprivation alleged was \"objectively, sufficiently serious.\" <i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p>For the subjective inquiry, the Supreme Court has specified that deliberate indifference requires that \"the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a sub-stantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\" <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970; <i>see also </i><i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 156. The standard encompasses a \"narrow band of conduct\": subpar care amounting to negligence or even malpractice does not give rise to a constitutional claim, <i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162; rather, the treatment provided must have been so inadequate as \"to constitute `an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' or to be `repugnant to the conscience of mankind,'\" <i>Estelle,</i> 429 U.S. at 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285; <i>see also </i><i>Alsina-Ortiz v. Laboy,</i> 400 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Willful blindness and deliberate indifference are not mere negligence; these concepts are directed at a form of scienter in which the official culpably ignores or turns away from what is otherwise apparent.\"). We have concluded that \"[d]eliberate indifference in this context may be shown by the denial of needed care as punishment and by decisions about medical care made recklessly with `actual knowledge of impending harm, easily preventable.'\" <i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 156 (citing <i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162 (quoting <i>Watson v. Caton,</i> 984 F.2d 537, 540 (1st Cir.1993))).</p>\n<p>As to the second inquiry, that of a \"serious\" deprivation or medical need, we have held that \"[a] medical need is `serious' if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment, or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention.\" <i>Gaudreault v. Municipality of Salem,</i> 923 F.2d 203, 208 (1st Cir.1990). \"The `seriousness' of an inmate's needs may also be determined by reference to the effect of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*498</span> delay of treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro,</i> 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987)). We note that \"the subjective deliberate indifference inquiry may overlap with the objective serious medical need determination\"; \"[s]imilar evidence, including evidence of adverse effects, may be relevant to both components.\" <i>Smith v. Carpenter,</i> 316 F.3d 178, 187 n. 12 (2d Cir.2003) (citing <i>DesRosiers v. Moran,</i> 949 F.2d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Leavitt's Claim Against Cichon</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Deliberate Indifference</h2>\n<p>Leavitt argues that Cichon's failure to refer him to an infectious disease specialist or to otherwise treat his HIV in a timely manner constitutes deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The cornerstone of his claim is the missed viral load report. That Cichon missed this report and neglected to follow up is at a minimum sub-optimal, perhaps even negligent. Cichon acknowledges that his failure to account for the report was \"unfortunate\" and that a referral to a specialist ought to have been made. But carelessness or inadvertence falls short of the Eighth Amendment standard of deliberate indifference. <i>See </i><i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162; <i>cf. </i><i>Montgomery v. Pinchak,</i> 294 F.3d 492, 500 (3d Cir.2002) (\"[T]he mere loss . . . of. . . medical records does not rise to the requisite level of deliberate indifference.\"). To survive summary judgment, Leavitt must present enough evidence for a factfinder to conclude that Cichon ignored the viral load report, either intentionally or recklessly, \"`not in the tort law sense but in the appreciably stricter criminal-law sense, requiring actual knowledge of impending harm, easily preventable.'\" <i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162 (quoting <i>Watson,</i> 984 F.2d at 540).</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that Cichon knew that Leavitt suffered from HIV, a medical condition that the physician assistant understood was serious and potentially life-threatening if left untreated; that Leavitt had not had access to his prescribed antiretroviral regimen for at least a month, if not longer, by the time he was seen at the clinic; and that Leavitt's CD4 count was abnormally low the last two times he was tested, in April and October 2006.<sup>[22]</sup> According to Leavitt, he had also complained to Cichon about an array of symptoms, including night sweats, chills, fever, and nausea, and told the physician assistant that he needed his antiretroviral drugs to keep him alive. A jury could thus reasonably infer that Cichon was aware that Leavitt's health was at risk. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 157.</p>\n<p>A jury could further infer that Cichon had a financial interest in not confirming that the risk was imminent and, hence, that Cichon required immediate treatment. <i>See </i><i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 843 n. 8, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (noting that a prison official \"would not escape liability if the evidence showed that he merely refused to verify underlying facts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that he strongly suspected to exist\"); <i>see also </i><i>Mata v. Saiz,</i> 427 F.3d 745, 752 (10th Cir.2005) (reiterating the above rule from <i>Farmer</i> and noting that \"this level of intent can be demonstrated through circumstantial evidence\"). After all, Cichon purportedly said to Leavitt that he would not provide him with HIV medications because they are too costly. Moreover, as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*499</span> the president of ARCH and its largest shareholder, Cichon had a financial stake in keeping treatment and referral costs low to satisfy CMS and to remain competitive against other contractors. Cichon testified that ARCH had a two-year contract with the jail with the possibility of extensions and that the renewal of ARCH's contract depended on keeping YCJ \"happy.\" He also testified that in June 2009 ARCH lost the contract to CMS because of the \"cost savings\" that the latter apparently provided.</p>\n<p>As further support for his theory, Leavitt points out that Cichon had been admonished by the state medical licensing authorities for unprofessional conduct that could be interpreted as evidence of his desire to lower the costs of medical care at YCJ. The Medical Board found that he withheld medications from a patient with a chronic health condition \"without appropriate evaluation\" and \"with no clear reason that the patient could not receive them.\" He also changed the frequency of dosage of medication for another patient from four to two times a day because the jail contracted for staff to distribute medications only twice a day. Furthermore, he provided medical care without a supervising physicianยa contractor for whom ARCH presumably would have had to pay.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cichon stated that in seventeen years, he had never neglected to review any other patient report. Given the evidence of Cichon's financial interest in minimizing costs, including his own explicit statement to that effect, the past instances in which he acted allegedly to advance that interest, and the fact that he had never before missed a lab report, a reasonable jury could conclude that Cichon acted with deliberate indifference by choosing not to review the viral load report, as its results would have obliged him, in his own words, \"to move precipitously\" to deal with Leavitt's chronic medical condition. <i>See </i><i>Monmouth Cnty.,</i> 834 F.2d at 346 (\"[W]here `knowledge of the need for medical care [is accompanied by the] . . . intentional refusal to provide that care,' the deliberate indifference standard has been met.\" (second and third alterations in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Ancata v. Prison Health Servs.,</i> 769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir.1985))); <i>cf. </i><i>Montgomery,</i> 294 F.3d at 500 (holding that inmate stated a prima facie Eighth Amendment case, where he alleged that defendants refused to provide him with treatment for his HIV over a nine-month period despite their prior determination that the treatment was necessary).</p>\n<p>In granting summary judgment for Cichon, the district court emphasized that even after Cichon purportedly made the statement about not treating HIV because of cost constraints, he directed ARCH nursing staff to gather Leavitt's medical history, ordered blood tests, and reviewed Leavitt's records. This conduct, while certainly relevant to Cichon's defense, does not preclude a jury from finding that his <i>subsequent</i> failure to examine the viral load report and to follow up on Leavitt's condition, in combination with other evidence in the summary judgment record, added up to deliberate indifference.<sup>[23]</sup> As Leavitt suggests, Cichon may well have ordered the lab tests and medical reports simply to \"paper his file\" or to \"lull [Leavitt] into complacency.\" The district court was too quick to decide that Cichon's version was credible and Leavitt's not. This is precisely the sort of genuine and material dispute that ought to be resolved by a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*500</span> jury.<sup>[24]</sup><i>See </i><i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge. . . .\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Serious Medical Need</h2>\n<p>\"Because `[t]he objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim is. . . [necessarily] contextual' and fact-specific, the serious medical need inquiry must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each case.\" <i>Smith,</i> 316 F.3d at 185 (alterations in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Hudson v. McMillian,</i> 503 U.S. 1, 8, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992)). It is obvious that HIV is a serious medical condition, as the condition can be life-threatening if not properly treated. <i>See </i><i>Brown v. Johnson,</i> 387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004); <i>Montgomery,</i> 294 F.3d at 500. Nevertheless, Cichon argues that the seriousness of the underlying medical condition does not alone establish the \"serious medical need\" prong of the Eighth Amendment inquiry. He insists that the inquiry must be more particularized. Because Leavitt's case against Cichon is predicated on the physician assistant's failure to review and follow up on the results of the viral load test, Cichon argues that we should focus on the seriousness of the effects of <i>this</i> omission. <i>See </i><i>Gaudreault,</i> 923 F.2d at 208; <i>see also </i><i>Smith,</i> 316 F.3d at 186 (\"[I]t's the particular risk of harm faced by a prisoner due to the challenged deprivation of care, rather than the severity of the prisoner's underlying medical condition, considered in the abstract, that is relevant for Eighth Amendment purposes.\"); <i>Napier v. Madison Cnty.,</i> 238 F.3d 739, 742 (6th Cir.2001). We conclude that even under the version of the objective inquiry that Cichon urges us to undertake, Leavitt has presented sufficient evidence to reach a jury on the issue of serious medical need.</p>\n<p>To begin, Cichon himself concedes that if he had seen the viral load report indicating that Leavitt's viral load was 143,000, he would have found that number to be sufficiently alarming that he would have \"move[d] precipitously\" to refer Leavitt to a specialist. <i>Cf. </i><i>Sealock v. Colo.,</i> 218 F.3d 1205, 1211-12 (10th Cir.2000) (relying on similarly \"candid testimony\" to reverse a district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of a correctional healthcare provider). Leavitt presented expert testimony that if that referral had been made, he would have been put back onto his antiretroviral regimen in short order and would not have suffered the various adverse effects of untreated HIV.<sup>[25]</sup> With regard <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> to these effects, Leavitt submitted affidavit evidence that during his incarceration at YCJ he suffered from nightsweats, chills, fevers, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting and constipation, and psoriasisยsymptoms that he attributed to his untreated HIV and to \"detoxing\" from the withdrawal of antiretroviral treatment.</p>\n<p>Leavitt presented evidence that Cichon's omission not only exposed him to these short-term effects, but also led to the exacerbation of his underlying condition. Soon after Leavitt arrived at MSP, he began suffering from thrush, leukoplakia, and seborrheic dermatitisยconditions that VTC providers interpreted as indications of immunological decline from HIV. He continues to suffer from rashes, warts, fatigue, and malaise. Leavitt also presented expert testimony that he suffered a detrimental decrease in his CD4 count because of the \"continuum\" of inadequate treatment he received at YCJ and MSP. <i>See </i><i>Monmouth Cnty.,</i> 834 F.2d at 347 (\"[W]here denial or delay causes an inmate to suffer a life-long handicap or permanent loss, the medical need is considered serious.\"). The wealth of evidence he presented also shows that he is statistically more likely to be susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancer in the future.</p>\n<p>From this record, a factfinder could conclude that Cichon's deprivation of care subjected Leavitt to serious harm, both short-term and long-term. <i>See </i><i>Helling,</i> 509 U.S. at 33, 113 S.Ct. 2475 (holding that correctional officials may not ignore medical conditions that are \"very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering\" in the future, and that such prospective harm can be the basis of an Eighth Amendment claim, even if the inmate has \"no serious current symptoms\"); <i>see also </i><i>Smith,</i> 316 F.3d at 188 (holding that \"an Eighth Amendment claim may be based on a defendant's conduct in exposing an inmate to an unreasonable risk of future harm\"). We thus conclude that Leavitt has established a material dispute as to whether Cichon acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Cichon.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Leavitt's Claims Against the Individual CMS Defendants</h2>\n<p>Leavitt also appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment on his ยง 1983 claim against CMS employees Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, and Kesteloot in their individual and official capacities. We focus first on the claims against these defendants in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p>In his brief, Leavitt appears to press a mix of collective and vicarious liability theories. He alleges that \"[a]ll the CMS defendants\" knew he had HIV, a disease that, if left untreated, could be fatal; were aware of his active HIV symptoms; had access to his medical charts; had the ability to communicate with VTC about his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> care; and were working for the same employer and could communicate with each other. These allegations, he contends, coupled with the simple fact that it took over seventeen months to reinitiate his antiretroviral therapy, are enough to put the question of the defendants' deliberate indifference to a jury.</p>\n<p>Leavitt's group liability theory may accurately reflect some deficiencies in the provision of health services at MSP. The prison's medical department operates on a clinic model. Inmates see various providers, each of whom is not charged with following a particular patient but instead attends to whoever shows up at the clinic at the time he or she is working. Regardless, this theory cannot provide the basis for recovery: \"It is axiomatic that the liability of persons sued in their individual capacities under section 1983 must be gauged in terms of their own actions.\" <i>Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.1999). Nor can supervisory officials, like Tritch, be held liable for the conduct of their subordinates solely under a theory of respondeat superior. <i>Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo,</i> 590 F.3d 31, 49 (1st Cir. 2009) (reiterating the principle that government officials may be held liable only \"on the basis of their own acts or omissions,\" and not \"for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior\" (quoting <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1948, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009))).<sup>[27]</sup> It may be true that the care Leavitt received at MSP was generally inadequate. However, to make out a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim against healthcare providers in their <i>individual</i> capacity, he must demonstrate that there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that <i>each</i> CMS defendant was \"aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\" and that <i>each</i> defendant did, in fact, \"draw the inference.\" <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. We cannot conclude that Leavitt has satisfied his burden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Todd Tritch</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Leavitt's grievance appears to be that Tritch acted with deliberate indifference in failing first to sign off on necessary referrals to specialists and second to follow up on Leavitt after committing to intervene more personally in his care. Leavitt only insinuates the first theory, and the record simply does not bear out the latter. Tritch did not became personally involved in Leavitt's care until August 10, 2007.<sup>[28]</sup> After examining appellant, Tritch not only ordered updated blood work, but also took the unusual step of ordering that Leavitt's follow-up appointment specifically be with him. While the appointment never took place, there is no evidence that this omission was anything more than an unfortunate scheduling glitch. It is undisputed that when Tritch finally saw the August lab results in November, he approved Leavitt's referral to VTC. It is also undisputed that in June 2008, it was Tritch who reviewed Leavitt's chart, concluded that his HIV medications should have been started sooner, and put in the order for antiretroviral drugs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> Based on this series of events, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that Tritch acted with deliberate indifference. To the contrary, each time he became aware of potentially serious harm to Leavitt, he reacted expeditiously. Perhaps Tritch was not as aware as one would like a medical professional to be, but \"an official's failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot. . . be condemned as the infliction of punishment,\" let alone punishment cruel and unusual. <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 838, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Edie Woodward and Charlene Watkins</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Against Woodward and Watkins, Leavitt's allegations reduce to the theory that they ought to have been more proactive in following up on his careยthat, for example, Woodward should have pursued the results of Leavitt's genotype test when Bio Reference failed to report them, and Watkins should have taken steps to confirm that an appointment with VTC had been scheduled as ordered. Leavitt offers nothing beyond conclusory allegations that their failure to do so was a symptom of deliberate indifference. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 156 (\"Allegations made in a plaintiff's complaint, standing alone, are not enough to oppose a properly supported motion for summary judgment.\"). The record shows that Woodward and Watkins behaved in ways consistent with their professed intention to treat Leavitt: each saw him in the chronic care clinic on myriad occasions, treated him for his immediate complaints, and ordered testing and follow-up appointments when appropriate. Certainly, they both relied on inaccurate or imperfect data in Leavitt's chart that appointments had been ordered or that follow-up phone calls would be made, but there is no evidence that their reliance was not in good faith. <i>See </i><i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> 475 U.S. 312, 319, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986) (\"It is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\"); <i>Battista v. Clarke,</i> 645 F.3d 449, 454 (1st Cir.2011) (\"[S]o long as the balancing judgments are within the realm of reason and made in good faith, the officials' actions are not `deliberate indifference.'\").</p>\n<p>With respect to Watkins, Leavitt points to one other incident as a ground for his deliberate indifference claim. He asserts that when Watkins received the consultation report from his March appointment at VTC, stating \"Will need to start him back on Truvada/Kaletra now,\" she should have started his antiretroviral therapy immediately. Watkins claims that because the report also recommended that \"they obtain a CD4, [viral load,] and a genotype,\" she interpreted it to mean that Leavitt should not restart treatment until after a new round of blood tests. Even if Watkins's interpretation was incorrect, it is uncontroverted that she proceeded in accordance with that interpretation, ordering the updated lab work she thought was required before Leavitt could be put back on Truvada and Kaletra. In this context, their disagreement over the interpretation of VTC's instruction is tantamount to a dispute over the exercise of professional judgment and insufficient to support a constitutional claim. <i>See </i><i>Torraco,</i> 923 F.2d at 234 (observing that \"`[w]here the dispute concerns not the absence of help, but the choice of a certain course of treatment,'\" deliberate indifference may be found [only if] the attention received is `so clearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to provide essential care'\" (quoting <i>Sires v. Berman,</i> 834 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir.1987); <i>Miranda v. Munoz,</i> 770 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1985))); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> <i>Ferranti v. Moran,</i> 618 F.2d 888, 891 (1st Cir.1980) (holding that \"disagreement on the appropriate course of treatment . . . may present a colorable claim of negligence[] but . . . falls short of alleging a constitutional violation\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Teresa Kesteloot</i><sup>[29]</sup></h2>\n<p>Leavitt takes issue with Kesteloot's failure, in investigating his May complaint, to review earlier entries in his chart, including lab results from March that indicated a low CD4 cell count and high viral load. Relatedly, Leavitt complains that Kesteloot did not look into why his antiretroviral therapy had been delayed until he filed his grievance. These allegations have little force when Leavitt himself acknowledges that Kesteloot's only focus in investigating his complaint was on whether his current concerns were being addressed, and not on whether past treatment had been appropriate. Kesteloot concluded her investigation after being satisfied that Leavitt had recently been seen by clinic providers, that his labs had just been drawn, and that a follow-up appointment with VTC was scheduled. This was a reasonable response to Leavitt's complaint. <i>See </i><i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 8 (\"[P]rison officials . . . cannot be deliberately indifferent if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not avoided.\"). It is true that Kesteloot did not investigate whether Leavitt's treatment was evidence of a systemic problem at MSP or follow up on Leavitt to insure that there would be no further delays in his treatment. However, her failure to take these affirmative steps is, without more, insufficient to allow a jury to find deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Leavitt's Claims Against CMS and Its Employees in Their Official Capacities</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reach Leavitt's claims against CMS and its employees in their official capacities. CMS concedes that as a private entity operating in its capacity at MSP at the time in question, it can be held liable as a municipality for the purpose of suits filed under ยง 1983.<sup>[30]</sup> As for the CMS employees, \"[a] damages suit against an official in an official capacity is tantamount to a suit against the entity of which the official is an agent.\" <i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 7. Thus the question is whether there is any basis for imposing liability against the entity.</p>\n<p>An underlying constitutional tort is required to proceed under a municipal liability theory. Where, as here, there is no constitutional violation by the employees of the municipality, there can be no liability predicated on municipal policy or custom. <i>See </i><i>Kennedy v. Town of Billerica,</i> 617 F.3d 520, 531-32 (1st Cir.2010).<sup>[31]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Although we conclude that the record is insufficient to allow Leavitt's Eighth. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> Amendment claims against the CMS defendants to go to a jury because of the stringent constitutional standard, we note the acknowledgment of the CMS defendants that \"the care [Leavitt] received ultimately fell short of the mark.\" Those responsible for the operation of the Maine correctional healthcare system, including MDOC, should focus on the troubling implications of that acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth, we <i>vacate</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cichon; <i>affirm</i> the grant of summary judgment in favor of CMS, Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, and Kesteloot; and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We refer to defendants CMS and its employees collectively as \"the CMS defendants.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Leavitt's Statement of Material Facts raises a few allegations pertaining to events that took place before the October 5 meeting, including an allegation that a jail officer refused to accept the HIV medications that a friend brought to YCJ for Leavitt. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Cichon knew of these events, and thus they are immaterial to the determination of whether Cichon was deliberately indifferent to Leavitt's medical needs.</p>\n<p>[3]  The parties state that the CD4 cell count is the best estimate of an HIV-positive individual's risk of short-term progression to develop the clinical symptoms and risks of complications of HIV. Viral load, which measures the amount of virus present in the bloodstream, is most helpful in assessing a patient's response to treatment, but is also generally helpful in assessing the risk of short-term progression of HIV. A higher CD4 count and lower viral load are generally desirable.</p>\n<p>[4]  Leavitt's medical records from ACJ and the CD4 cell count and viral load reports were subpoenaed from YCJ and entered into the summary judgment record as part of Cichon's affidavit.</p>\n<p>[5]  Leavitt filed three non-HIV-related IMRFs, in which he requested Fixadent for his dentures and cream to treat his psoriasis. Cichon denied all three requests.</p>\n<p>[6]  YCJ had previously contracted with ARCH for healthcare services from around 1996 to 2003. ARCH was then replaced by the University of New England, before regaining the contract in 2004.</p>\n<p>[7]  The frequency of medications was changed from the physician's prescription of four times a day to two times a day because the jail contracted for staff to distribute medications only twice a day. The Board found that Cichon should have informed the inmate; however, it concluded that because Cichon had consulted with the inmate's physician before implementing the change, his \"behavior did not rise to a level of misconduct sufficient to warrant disciplinary action.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  The other letters of guidance issued by the Board related to Cichon making inappropriate comments about race and sex to patients.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Medical Board concluded that Cichon was \"providing medical services as a physician assistant without having a supervisory [allopathic] physician\" licensed by the Medical Board, \"failing to notify the Medical Board that he no longer had a supervisory physician licensed by the Medical Board,\" and/or \"misrepresenting to Medical Board staff the status of his license and supervisory relationship\" for the period from November 2, 2006, to at least March 15, 2007.</p>\n<p>[10]  Although this CD4 count represents a slight improvement over the reported results from April and October 2006, Leavitt's expert represents that there can be a lag in CD4 count decline after antiretroviral therapy is discontinued.</p>\n<p>[11]  VTC's medical director represented that by \"[n]o urgent indication,\" he anticipated that a follow-up appointment or another round of blood tests would take place within three months. This time frame was in accordance with usual practice to check an HIV patient's CD4 and viral load counts every three to four months as a way of monitoring the patient's condition, regardless of whether the patient is on antiretroviral therapy.</p>\n<p>[12]  These DHHS guidelines were explicitly addressed to \"treatment-naive\" patientsยHIV-positive patients who had never been on antiretroviral therapy. However, in 2007-2008 VTC used the same information and recommendations to guide treatment of patients who had been on medications for a time and then stopped. At the time, there was disagreement in the medical community as to the wisdom of the deferred treatment approach. Leavitt's expert testified that although Leavitt's CD4 count was above DHHS's cut-off point, Leavitt should nonetheless have been immediately restarted on antiretroviral therapy because of his history of low CD4 counts and because he suffered from hepatitis C.</p>\n<p>[13]  In responding to a complaint to the Medical Board brought against him by Leavitt, Tritch stated that Leavitt's \"HIV viral load was undetectable\" as of August 2007. Tritch has never corrected this inaccurate assertion to the Board.</p>\n<p>[14]  Leavitt wrote a letter on April 1, 2007 to Kesteloot's predecessor with a similar grievance, and attached a copy of that letter to his complaint to Kesteloot. Kesteloot became aware of the April 1 letter at some point after she assumed her position, but does not know if her predecessor ever acted on Leavitt's first complaint.</p>\n<p>[15]  MSP's grievance review officer reviewed Kesteloot's memo and denied Leavitt's grievance. Leavitt's appeal of that decision to MSP's chief administrative officer was also denied.</p>\n<p>[16]  Those slips were submitted on August 10, 2007, January 6, 2008, and July 4, 2008.</p>\n<p>[17]  These dates range from July 26, 2007, to July 4, 2008.</p>\n<p>[18]  They also offered an alternative ground for granting summary judgment in favor of Cichon: that Leavitt offered \"insubstantial proof of injury.\"</p>\n<p>[19]  The district court granted summary judgment against a variety of other defendants, including those employed by MDOC, under a separate order, from which Leavitt does not appeal.</p>\n<p>[20]  Leavitt no longer pursues his ADA claim against any of the defendants.</p>\n<p>[21]  The record is unclear as to whether Leavitt was being held at YCJ as a probation violator or as a pre-trial detainee, but Leavitt's precise status makes no difference to our analysis, as \"the standard applied under the Fourteenth Amendment [governing the claims of pre-trial detainees] is the same as the Eighth Amendment standard [governing the claims of convicted inmates].\" <i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 155.</p>\n<p>[22]  Even though Cichon claims not to recollect seeing Leavitt's October 2006 CD4 test report, it is undisputed that he initialed it. Moreover, it is undisputed that he reviewed Leavitt's records from ACJ, which indicated that appellant had a below-normal CD4 cell count of 355 as recently as April 2006.</p>\n<p>[23]  Indeed, Leavitt himself does not take issue with Cichon's decision to order the lab tests and medical history; it is undisputed that this was the proper course of action prior to restarting antiretroviral treatment.</p>\n<p>[24]  In making this credibility determination, the district court also assigned significant weight to the fact that Leavitt did not submit any IMRFs or make further complaints to the medical department about his HIV after the October clinic appointment. While a jury is free to consider this fact in determining whether Cichon acted with deliberate indifference, we do not see how Leavitt's actions would, as a matter of law, excuse Cichon's purposeful or reckless decision to ignore the viral load report or to refuse to provide Leavitt with a referral or other treatment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Wilson v. Seiter,</i> 501 U.S. 294, 303, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (emphasizing that \"assuming the conduct is harmful enough to satisfy the objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim,\" the \"wantonness\" of an official's conduct depends only \"upon the constraints facing the <i>official</i>\").</p>\n<p>[25]  Leavitt's medical expert testified that if Leavitt had been referred to him for care in October 2006 and presented with a CD4 count of 415, he would have gathered the necessary medical information and followed up in \"about a week\" with the chosen treatment regimen. The expert also testified that \"knowing the [HIV specialists] out there, the majority of people would have found a regimen for him and gotten him back on antiretroviral therapy\" immediately because Leavitt is \"not a novel patient,\" but \"a patient with ongoing HIV disease who has a history of very low CD4 counts.\"</p>\n<p>[26]  As an alternative for granting summary judgment in favor of Cichon, the district court concluded that \"Leavitt has insubstantial proof of injury caused by Cichon\" as required under ยง 1983. <i>See </i><i>Sullivan v. City of Springfield,</i> 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2009). Given the amount of evidence on causation and injury available in the record, this issue cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Gayton v. McCoy,</i> 593 F.3d 610, 624 (7th Cir.2010) (holding that \"only in the rare instance that a plaintiff can proffer no evidence that a delay in medical treatment exacerbated an injury should summary judgment be granted on the issue of causation,\" and thus reversing the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of a nurse on an inmate's Eighth Amendment claim).</p>\n<p>[27]  Leavitt does not allege that any particular CMS defendant \"supervise[d], train[ed], or hire[d] a subordinate with deliberate indifference toward the possibility that deficient performance of the task eventually may contribute to a civil rights deprivation.\" <i>Sanchez,</i> 590 F.3d at 49 (quoting <i>Camilo-Robles v. Zapata,</i> 175 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p>[28]  Tritch approved Leavitt's referrals to outside specialists prior to August 2007, but Leavitt does not allege any specific wrongdoing on Tritch's part in dealing with referrals.</p>\n<p>[29]  The CMS defendants argue that Leavitt has waived his claim against Kesteloot by failing to \"separately address\" that claim in his consolidated objection to the magistrate judge's recommended decisions. We need not resolve the issue of waiver; we conclude on the merits that Leavitt does not have a triable claim against Kesteloot.</p>\n<p>[30]  This circuit has not expressly held that private entities should be treated analogously to municipalities for the purpose of ยง 1983 liability. Still, the parties agree that CMS may be held liable as though it were a municipality, and so we have proceeded accordingly.</p>\n<p>[31]  Having concluded that Leavitt failed to put forth sufficient evidence of the CMS defendants' deliberate indifference, we see no need to reach the issue of \"serious medical need.\"</p>\n\n</div>",

Leavitt, an inmate of the Maine corrections system, seeks a civil rights remedy for the alleged denial of adequate medical care for human <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by healthcare professionals at the York County Jail (YCJ) and the Maine State Prison (MSP). Claiming that correctional medical officials acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment, Leavitt brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against a number of defendants, including Alfred Cichon, a physician assistant at YCJ; Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (CMS), the private contractor that provided medical care at MSP; and CMS employees Todd Tritch, Edie Woodward, Charlene Watkins, and Teresa Kesteloot.<sup>[1]</sup> In separate orders, the district court granted summary judgment for Cichon and the CMS defendants, and Leavitt appeals.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that Leavitt's evidence could not, as a matter of law, establish that the CMS defendants' actions violated the Eighth Amendment. However, we conclude that Leavitt has established a material dispute as to whether Alfred Cichon acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. We thus affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of the CMS defendants, reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of Cichon, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Appellant is, and was at all times material to this case, HIV-positive. He was incarcerated at YCJ from September 6, 2006, through February 17, 2007, at which point he was transferred to MSP. He claims that the defendants inappropriately denied him treatment for HIV for the entirety of his 167-day stay at YCJ and for nearly seventeen months of his incarceration at MSP. This delay in the reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV, Leavitt alleges, \"constituted a continuum of harm,\" which resulted in short- and long-term negative consequences for his health. We chronicle his treatment history in some detail as presented in the summary judgment record, presenting the facts in the light most favorable to Leavitt and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Burrell v. Hampshire Cnty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200148\"><a href=\"/opinion/200148/burrell-v-hampshire-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Leavitt's Treatment at YCJ</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Initial Clinic Visit</h2>\n<p>At the time of his incarceration at YCJ, Leavitt suffered from HIV, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and hypothyroidism. On October 5, 2006, about one month into his detention at YCJ, Leavitt had his firstยand onlyยclinical interaction with defendant Alfred Cichon.<sup>[2]</sup> Cichon was the physician assistant who worked at the jail most frequently, about sixteen hours per week, and he also was president of Allied Resources for Correctional Health, Inc. (ARCH), the corporation that provided contract healthcare services to inmates at YCJ.</p>\n<p>At the October 5 clinic visit, Cichon performed a routine physical examination of Leavitt, concluding that the latter's health in general was \"normal.\" Appellant told Cichon that he was HIV-positive; said that he was experiencing night sweats, chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting; and complained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> that he had not received his antiretroviral medications. He also lamented that \"it wasn't right he was being kept off his HIV meds since they had been keeping him alive for the past 10 years and keeping his symptoms and low blood count from claiming him as a victim of AIDS.\"</p>\n<p>At this point, Cichon purportedly made a statement that constitutes the key fact in dispute in Leavitt's case against him. He said, \"We don't give away [HIV] medications here at this jail[,] because the jail is so small and we are not equipped financially to hold the burden of providing expensive medication\"; \"[you will] have to wait until you [get] to the Maine State Prison where they are able to pay for these medications.\" Additionally, Cichon allegedly advised Leavitt, \"You don't need to stay on the [HIV] medications to be healthy, and just as soon as you get to the [MSP] they'll fix you right up.\"</p>\n<p>At the time of their meeting, Cichon knew that Leavitt had been without his HIV medications for at least one month, as appellant had been incarcerated since September. Patients who take a break from antiretroviral therapy may become resistant to one or more of the drugs used as part of the regimen. Cichon thus informed Leavitt that he could not reinstate his HIV medications or refer him to an infectious disease specialist without first acquiring his medical history, information about his medications and compliance with taking those medications, and blood test results for his current CD4 cell count and viral load.<sup>[3]</sup> There is no dispute that this was the proper response to a request for restarting antiretroviral treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. After Leavitt's Clinic Visit</h2>\n<p>Cichon directed the ARCH nursing staff to obtain Leavitt's medical records from the various facilities where he had been treated for HIV. Cichon also ordered lab work to determine Leavitt's complete blood count differential, CD4 cell count, and viral load. These labs, like all tests and medications prescribed for inmates, were paid for by YCJ.</p>\n<p>In short order, Leavitt's medical records from the Androscoggin County Jail (ACJ), Cumberland County Jail, and Positive Health Care were faxed to YCJ, where they were reviewed and initialed by Cichon. The records indicated that Leavitt had a long history of HIV and that he previously had been prescribed the antiretroviral drugs Truvada and Kaletra. The records also established that Leavitt's labs on April 6, 2006 had shown an undetectable viral load of less than 75 and an abnormally low CD4 cell count of 355. Moreover, they showed that at the time of Leavitt's incarceration at ACJ on July 11, 2006, his medical condition was normal and he did not complain of fatigue, night sweats, or any objective symptoms of HIV. Finally, the records disclosed that Leavitt had a history of alcohol abuse that may have impeded his compliance with antiretroviral therapy, and that Leavitt had been at various points non-compliant with taking his HIV medications. Although Leavitt concedes the veracity of these records, he insists he had been taking his HIV medications \"on a regular basis\" before he entered YCJ.</p>\n<p>The lab reports from the blood work Cichon ordered were addressed to him and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> routed to the medical office at YCJ, where in the ordinary course of business they would have been placed on a clipboard and reviewed by Cichon each time he visited the jail. The CD4 cell count report indicated that Leavitt had a lower than normal count of 415 and noted that the \"[m]ild decrease in CD4 level and increase in CD8 subset\" was \"indicative of immunodeficiency state and/or recent viral infection.\" Cichon claims no recollection of seeing these results, but acknowledges that his initial appears on the first page of the lab report, which would signal that he had reviewed them.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The viral load report indicated a higher than normal viral load of 143,000. Cichon also claims not to have seen this report; the copy of it subpoenaed from YCJ and entered into the record does not bear his initial. He asserts that this is the first time in seventeen years that an omission of this type occurred, that he would have considered a viral load of 143,000 to be higher \"than [he] would like to see it,\" and that he would have \"move[d] precipitously\" to refer Leavitt to an infectious disease specialist if he had reviewed the report. Cichon understood that HIV is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Remainder of Leavitt's Stay at YCJ</h2>\n<p>It is undisputed that during the four months between the October 5 clinic appointment and Leavitt's transfer to MSP, Cichon never saw Leavitt again, did not refer Leavitt to a specialist, or take any other steps to follow up on Leavitt's HIV condition. Leavitt did not see an infectious disease specialist or restart antiretroviral treatment for his HIV while at YCJ.</p>\n<p>Although appellant was aware that the method for requesting medical treatment or medications at YCJ was to file an Inmate Medical Request Form (IMRF), he did not submit one related to treatment for HIV or HIV-related symptoms.<sup>[5]</sup> Leavitt did, however, write one or more letters to YCJ's medical department, including one to Cichon, requesting the resumption of his HIV medications. He submitted these letters to a YCJ officer at some point prior to his appointment with Cichon.</p>\n<p>Symptoms of HIV include fevers, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, wasting syndrome, chronic diarrhea, thrush, leukoplakia (a white, film-like protrusion on the lateral side of the tongue), psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. During the period of his incarceration at YCJ, Leavitt suffered from night sweats, chills, fever, fatigue, psoriasis, nausea, and gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting and constipation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. ARCH's Contractual Relationship with YCJ</h2>\n<p>In addition to serving as president of ARCH, Cichon was also its largest shareholder, with ownership of over a quarter of its stock. Cichon testified at his deposition that YCJ put its healthcare services contract out for bid every two years, that beginning November 2004 ARCH had a two-year contract with YCJ with the possibility of extensions, and that such extensions were dependent on whether YCJ was \"happy with [ARCH].\"<sup>[6]</sup> Cichon also testified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> that ARCH eventually lost the YCJ contract to CMS in June 2009 because YCJ \"perceived that there [would be] a cost savings there.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Cichon's Professional Record</h2>\n<p>Cichon was given several \"letters of guidance\" by the Maine State Board of Licensure in Medicine (\"Medical Board\") for various infractions involving other patients that happened around the time of Leavitt's incarceration. These infractions included changing the frequency of dosage of a medication for another patient without first informing the patient,<sup>[7]</sup> as well as withholding medications from a patient with a chronic health condition \"without appropriate evaluation\" and \"with no clear reason that the patient could not receive them.\"<sup>[8]</sup> Moreover, the Medical Board suspended Cichon's physician assistant license for ninety days as a sanction for his providing medical services without a licensed supervisory physician.<sup>[9]</sup> Subsequently, Cichon also entered into a consent agreement with the Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure in January 2008, in which he admitted to, among other things, the violations of his physician assistant's license for which he was disciplined by the Medical Board. Under the terms of the consent agreement, Cichon's license to practice was subject to a number of probationary conditions, including heightened supervision and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Leavitt's Treatment at MSP</h2>\n<p>On February 17, 2007, Leavitt transferred from YCJ to MSP. By contract, CMS provides medical care at MSP, as well as some other facilities operated by the Maine Department of Corrections (MDOC). CMS employed the four other individual defendants involved in this appeal: Dr. Todd Tritch as the Regional Medical Director of CMS in Maine; Edie Woodward, a physician assistant, and Charlene Watkins, a family practitioner nurse, as healthcare providers at MSP; and Teresa Kesteloot as the Health Services Administrator at MSP.</p>\n<p>Since MSP's medical department operates on a clinic model, patients are usually not followed by particular providers. Inmates with chronic diseases, including HIV, are assigned to the chronic care clinic, in which they are seen typically at three-month intervals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Leavitt's Initial Treatment at MSP</h2>\n<p>Leavitt's first clinical interaction at MSP came in the form of an intake appointment with a CMS-employed physician assistant three days after his transfer. At this time, Leavitt said he was HIV-positive and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> asked to resume antiretroviral treatment. The physician assistant ordered a new round of blood tests and requested Leavitt's treatment records. Leavitt's labs were subsequently drawn and reported, showing an abnormal CD4 cell count of 460 and an elevated viral load over 97,000.<sup>[10]</sup> The physician assistant also ordered an appointment \"ASAP\" with an infectious disease specialist. Generally, CMS providers use the term \"ASAP\" when there is some degree of concern about a patient's health. Nevertheless, the follow-up with the specialist never took place.</p>\n<p>About one month later, another CMS provider wrote an order that Leavitt be \"referred to an infectious disease doctor for starting HIV medications.\" That order, and all requests to refer patients to outside consultations, had to be approved by defendant Tritch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Leavitt's First Consultation with Specialists</h2>\n<p>With Tritch's approval, appellant was examined in May 2007 by a team of HIV specialists at the Virology Treatment Center (VTC) in Portland, Maine. At that time, Leavitt again requested to be reinstated on his HIV medications. VTC sent a consultation report to CMS, which stated, \"HIV: No urgent indication for . . . rx with CD4 at 460,\" meaning that Leavitt then had a good buffer in his immunological reserve to protect him from opportunistic infections or other consequences of HIV/AIDS.<sup>[11]</sup> VTC's medical director subsequently explained that he decided to defer reinitiating antiretroviral treatment so that he could obtain additional information about Leavitt's immune status, viral load, medication history, and previous drug resistance testing. His decision also relied on Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines recommending the deferral of antiretroviral treatment for patients with CD4 cell counts above 350 who did not have an AIDS-defining illness or severe symptoms of HIV infection.<sup>[12]</sup> The consultation report recommended that Leavitt return for a follow-up appointment in four to six weeks. At the end of May 2007, a CMS provider noted VTC's recommendation and ordered a follow-up appointment for Leavitt.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Leavitt's Treatment in Summer and Fall of 2007</h2>\n<p>Leavitt was next seen at the chronic care clinic by CMS defendant Edie Woodward in June 2007, when she treated him for a rash. Woodward assumed the follow-up <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> appointment with VTC had been or was being scheduled, and she accordingly entered an order for \"follow up with [VTC] as scheduled.\"</p>\n<p>On August 10, 2007, Leavitt submitted a prison sick-call slip in which he complained: \"As a result of being denied meds for HIV+ my immune system is low resulting in thrush[,] and it seems as though I'm being denied meds for that also.\" That same day, Tritch examined Leavitt. Tritch confirmed that the latter was suffering from thrush and ordered updated blood work to assess the condition of his HIV. Tritch also submitted an order for Leavitt to return for a follow-up visit specifically with him the next month. That appointment, however, was not scheduled as Tritch ordered, and it never took place.</p>\n<p>The results from the lab tests Tritch ordered reported that Leavitt's CD4 cell count had fallen to 424 and that his viral load had risen to greater than 100,000.<sup>[13]</sup> It was not until November, however, that Tritch, without having seen Leavitt again as promised, approved Leavitt's referral to VTC.</p>\n<p>In the interim, Leavitt saw Woodward at the chronic care clinic on September 1 and October 22, 2007. At the September clinic, Leavitt complained of a rash on his underarms, fatigue, and white, cracked, and painful toesยall symptoms she recognized could have been attributable to HIV. Woodward prescribed an antifungal cream for Leavitt's skin and feet. Even though she knew that the one-month follow-up consultation recommended by VTC in May never occurred, she did not determine why the appointment did not take place or take any steps to expedite the process.</p>\n<p>At the October clinic, Leavitt complained of intermittent thrush and a rash. He again requested HIV and hepatitis C treatment. Woodward ordered various medications to treat his immediate complaints, requested updated blood work, and put in a new order for the follow-up appointment that Leavitt was supposed to have with Tritch. She did not, however, put in a second order for the referral to VTC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The December Follow-up Appointment at VTC and Its Aftermath</h2>\n<p>Leavitt did not return to VTC until December, six months after his initial consult with the specialists there. At the December appointment, Leavitt complained of fatigue and presented with symptoms, including thrush, leukoplakia, and seborrheic dermatitis, that VTC interpreted as indications of immunological decline from HIV. VTC reported to CMS that Leavitt now met the criteria for starting antiretroviral therapy for HIV, requested an updated CD4 cell count and viral load to provide a baseline for treatment, and recommended genotype testing to determine Leavitt's resistance to particular HIV medications. VTC also suggested that Leavitt return in four to six weeks, noting that it would \"likely make recommendations for therapy at that time.\" Later that month, Woodward reviewed these recommendations and ordered an HIV viral load, an immune function panel, and a follow-up appointment with VTC in one month.</p>\n<p>In early January, Woodward entered an order to \"add genotype\" to the lab work she had requested for Leavitt the previous month. Those lab results were reported on January 18 but did not include a genotype as ordered. Apparently, Bio Reference, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> the lab that processed Leavitt's blood work, experienced a technical problem; in its report to CMS, it stated that it would contact the prison for additional information. There is no evidence in Leavitt's chart of any subsequent communication between Bio Reference and CMS, and Woodward did not take steps to obtain the genotype results from Bio Reference.</p>\n<p>On January 23, 2008, Woodward observed in her progress notes that Leavitt's follow-up visit to VTC was overdue and reordered it. The next month, Woodward stopped working full time at MSP. She wrote an order in February related to Leavitt's hepatitis C treatment, but from that point forward was no longer involved in his care.</p>\n<p>CMS defendant Charlene Watkins took over Woodward's position. Watkins first saw Leavitt on February 26, 2008, when he complained of a rash, which she knew could have been a fungal infection and a symptom of HIV. She observed in her progress notes that Leavitt was due for a follow-up visit to VTC.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Leavitt's March Visit to VTC</h2>\n<p>That follow-up visit, which was scheduled for February 27, was delayed on account of bad weather, and Leavitt did not return to VTC until March 12. About a month later, Leavitt saw Watkins at the chronic care clinic, whereupon he asked her why his medications had not been restarted following his March 12 visit to VTC. It turned out that no consultation report from, or record of, that visit had been placed in his CMS file. Watkins told him that it was her fault for not sending a fax to VTC. She then promptly requested and received from VTC a faxed copy of its note from Leavitt's visit, which stated: \"HIV disease: Needs to restart HIV therapy. Has been on many agents prior and likely has some resistance. Unfortunately we do not have his genotype at this time. Will need to start him back on Truvada/Kaletra now. Will recommend they obtain a CD4, [viral load,] and a genotype.\" VTC requested a follow-up appointment in one month.</p>\n<p>Watkins did not start Leavitt on his medications immediately. Instead, on April 14, Watkins ordered updated blood work and a follow-up visit to VTC. The lab results indicated that his CD4 cell count had plummeted to 296 and his viral load had escalated to 297,562. Watkins reviewed these results a little over a week later, but still did not start Leavitt on antiretroviral drugs. Nor did she confirm if the follow-up visit to VTC had actually been scheduled. Ultimately, Leavitt did not return to VTC until almost two and a half months later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Leavitt's Filing of a Formal Grievance</h2>\n<p>In the intervening period, Leavitt filed a formal grievance with MDOC through CMS defendant Teresa Kesteloot, in which he protested that he was not receiving treatment for his HIV.<sup>[14]</sup> Kesteloot, who was responsible for reviewing all healthcare-related complaints brought by MSP inmates, received the grievance no later than May 1, at which point she spoke with Leavitt, reviewed a portion of his medical chart, and discussed his care with CMS nursing staff. Kesteloot's focus in investigating Leavitt's complaint was not on trying to determine whether past treatment had been appropriateยa determination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> that she was not qualified to makeยbut solely on whether Leavitt's current concerns were being addressed.</p>\n<p>In the course of her inquiry, Kesteloot learned that Leavitt had been seen recently at the chronic care clinic, and that since his last visit to VTC on March 12, labs had been drawn and a follow-up appointment had been scheduled. She thus concluded in a memorandum to her MDOC supervisors that Leavitt \"appears to have been followed appropriately.\"<sup>[15]</sup> She took no additional steps to investigate whether the delay in Leavitt's treatment was part of a broader problem in the care of HIV-positive inmates at MSP or to follow up on Leavitt to ensure that there would be no further delays in his treatment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7. The Reinitiation of Leavitt's HIV Treatment</h2>\n<p>Leavitt finally saw the VTC specialists again on June 25. VTC subsequently sent a consultation report to CMS in which it observed that Leavitt was \"close to AIDS,\" that he had thrush on his tongue and swollen nodes on his neck, and that he needed to \"start HIV antiviral meds ASAP.\" The next day, Tritch, who had not seen Leavitt for over ten months, reviewed Leavitt's chart and concluded that his HIV medications should have been started sooner. He then prescribed him Kaletra and Truvada.</p>\n<p>Leavitt finally restarted antiretroviral therapy on July 7, 2008, over seven months after VTC deemed him eligible under the DHHS guidelines. During the seventeen months he had been incarcerated at MSP, Leavitt on three occasions submitted sick-call slips to the MDOC expressly for HIV,<sup>[16]</sup> and on thirteen occasions submitted sick-call slips for thrush, rashes, or diarrhea.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Leavitt's Current Health and Prognosis</h2>\n<p>After Leavitt started antiretroviral medications, his thrush disappeared and he no longer experienced night sweats and chills. By July 2008, Leavitt's CD4 cell count had rebounded to 429 (from 296 in April), and by December 2008, his CD4 cell count had risen to 550, thus indicating the reconstitution of his immune system. In his labs of February 27, 2009, he dropped to a dramatically low CD4 cell count of 252. But as of June 2009, Leavitt's HIV disease was stable. Currently, he is at a healthy weight of 170 pounds. He still suffers from warts and rashes, worsening fatigue and malaise, and \"great fear and uncertainty regarding his future as a result of his HIV drug interruption.\"</p>\n<p>As examples of this uncertainty, Leavitt points to a 2006 study showing that patients with CD4 counts above 350 whose antiretroviral therapy was interrupted and not restarted until their CD4 count dropped to 250 experienced a significant increase in the risk of opportunistic disease or death from any cause over the course of the trial, as compared with patients who received continuous antiretroviral therapy. Leavitt also references a great body of medical literature suggesting that the lower a patient's CD4 cell count is when he starts or restarts antiretroviral treatment, the lesser the expectation of long-term immunologic recovery and the greater the risk of HIV- and non-HIV-related <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> complications over the short term. Leavitt further cites studies indicating that patients who begin treatment at lower CD4 cell counts have a greater risk of not fully reconstituting the normal numbers of CD4 subsets. His expert testified that the interruption of Leavitt's antiretroviral therapy from September 2006 to July 2008 constituted a \"continuum\" of harm that makes him statistically more likely to be susceptible to opportunistic infections and/or cancer in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>Leavitt filed the pro se complaint underlying this case in April 2008, when his antiretroviral therapy had not yet been restarted. In that original complaint, he brought suit for money damages and injunctive relief against CMS, YCJ, MSP, and various correctional officials and healthcare providers in their individual and official capacities, alleging that their refusal to administer his HIV medications constituted violations of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). He later voluntarily dismissed his claims against YCJ and MSP and filed an amended complaint in October 2008, also pro se, naming as defendants only CMS, a number of its employees, various persons employed by MDOC, and the Warden of MSP. Leavitt later filed a pro se complaint against Cichon, which the district court consolidated on December 9, 2008 with the previous complaint into what the court styled as a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p>Leavitt eventually obtained the services of an attorney in February 2009. Seven months later, all the defendants moved for summary judgment. The magistrate judge recommended on December 31, 2009, and the district court granted on March 2, 2010, summary judgment in favor of all of the defendants, on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that defendants acted with \"deliberate indifference\" to Leavitt's medical needs, as required under the Supreme Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.<sup>[18]</sup> On appeal, Leavitt challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cichon, Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, Kesteloot, and CMS.<sup>[19]</sup> The only theory that he continues to press is their liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for the violation of his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

Leavitt's Claim Against Cichon</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Deliberate Indifference</h2>\n<p>Leavitt argues that Cichon's failure to refer him to an infectious disease specialist or to otherwise treat his HIV in a timely manner constitutes deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The cornerstone of his claim is the missed viral load report. That Cichon missed this report and neglected to follow up is at a minimum sub-optimal, perhaps even negligent. Cichon acknowledges that his failure to account for the report was \"unfortunate\" and that a referral to a specialist ought to have been made. But carelessness or inadvertence falls short of the Eighth Amendment standard of deliberate indifference. <i>See </i><i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162; <i>cf. </i><i>Montgomery v. Pinchak,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778087\"><a href=\"/opinion/778087/jeffery-montgomery-v-steven-pinchak-al-ortiz-terry-moore-c-naficy-mr/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 500 (3d Cir.2002) (\"[T]he mere loss . . . of. . . medical records does not rise to the requisite level of deliberate indifference.\"). To survive summary judgment, Leavitt must present enough evidence for a factfinder to conclude that Cichon ignored the viral load report, either intentionally or recklessly, \"`not in the tort law sense but in the appreciably stricter criminal-law sense, requiring actual knowledge of impending harm, easily preventable.'\" <i>Feeney,</i> 464 F.3d at 162 (quoting <i>Watson,</i> 984 F.2d at 540).</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that Cichon knew that Leavitt suffered from HIV, a medical condition that the physician assistant understood was serious and potentially life-threatening if left untreated; that Leavitt had not had access to his prescribed antiretroviral regimen for at least a month, if not longer, by the time he was seen at the clinic; and that Leavitt's CD4 count was abnormally low the last two times he was tested, in April and October 2006.<sup>[22]</sup> According to Leavitt, he had also complained to Cichon about an array of symptoms, including night sweats, chills, fever, and nausea, and told the physician assistant that he needed his antiretroviral drugs to keep him alive. A jury could thus reasonably infer that Cichon was aware that Leavitt's health was at risk. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 157.</p>\n<p>A jury could further infer that Cichon had a financial interest in not confirming that the risk was imminent and, hence, that Cichon required immediate treatment. <i>See </i><i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 843 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1970</span></a></span> (noting that a prison official \"would not escape liability if the evidence showed that he merely refused to verify underlying facts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that he strongly suspected to exist\"); <i>see also </i><i>Mata v. Saiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166569\"><a href=\"/opinion/166569/mata-v-saiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>, 752 (10th Cir.2005) (reiterating the above rule from <i>Farmer</i> and noting that \"this level of intent can be demonstrated through circumstantial evidence\"). After all, Cichon purportedly said to Leavitt that he would not provide him with HIV medications because they are too costly. Moreover, as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*499</span> the president of ARCH and its largest shareholder, Cichon had a financial stake in keeping treatment and referral costs low to satisfy CMS and to remain competitive against other contractors. Cichon testified that ARCH had a two-year contract with the jail with the possibility of extensions and that the renewal of ARCH's contract depended on keeping YCJ \"happy.\" He also testified that in June 2009 ARCH lost the contract to CMS because of the \"cost savings\" that the latter apparently provided.</p>\n<p>As further support for his theory, Leavitt points out that Cichon had been admonished by the state medical licensing authorities for unprofessional conduct that could be interpreted as evidence of his desire to lower the costs of medical care at YCJ. The Medical Board found that he withheld medications from a patient with a chronic health condition \"without appropriate evaluation\" and \"with no clear reason that the patient could not receive them.\" He also changed the frequency of dosage of medication for another patient from four to two times a day because the jail contracted for staff to distribute medications only twice a day. Furthermore, he provided medical care without a supervising physicianยa contractor for whom ARCH presumably would have had to pay.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cichon stated that in seventeen years, he had never neglected to review any other patient report. Given the evidence of Cichon's financial interest in minimizing costs, including his own explicit statement to that effect, the past instances in which he acted allegedly to advance that interest, and the fact that he had never before missed a lab report, a reasonable jury could conclude that Cichon acted with deliberate indifference by choosing not to review the viral load report, as its results would have obliged him, in his own words, \"to move precipitously\" to deal with Leavitt's chronic medical condition. <i>See </i><i>Monmouth Cnty.,</i> 834 F.2d at 346 (\"[W]here `knowledge of the need for medical care [is accompanied by the] . . . intentional refusal to provide that care,' the deliberate indifference standard has been met.\" (second and third alterations in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <i>Ancata v.

This conduct, while certainly relevant to Cichon's defense, does not preclude a jury from finding that his <i>subsequent</i> failure to examine the viral load report and to follow up on Leavitt's condition, in combination with other evidence in the summary judgment record, added up to deliberate indifference.<sup>[23]</sup> As Leavitt suggests, Cichon may well have ordered the lab tests and medical reports simply to \"paper his file\" or to \"lull [Leavitt] into complacency.\" The district court was too quick to decide that Cichon's version was credible and Leavitt's not.

Because Leavitt's case against Cichon is predicated on the physician assistant's failure to review and follow up on the results of the viral load test, Cichon argues that we should focus on the seriousness of the effects of <i>this</i> omission. <i>See </i><i>Gaudreault,</i> 923 F.2d at 208; <i>see also </i><i>Smith,</i> 316 F.3d at 186 (\"[I]t's the particular risk of harm faced by a prisoner due to the challenged deprivation of care, rather than the severity of the prisoner's underlying medical condition, considered in the abstract, that is relevant for Eighth Amendment purposes.\"); <i>Napier v. Madison Cnty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771860\"><a href=\"/opinion/771860/jeffrey-l-napier-v-madison-county-kentucky-ron-devere-jailer/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 742 (6th Cir.2001). We conclude that even under the version of the objective inquiry that Cichon urges us to undertake, Leavitt has presented sufficient evidence to reach a jury on the issue of serious medical need.</p>\n<p>To begin, Cichon himself concedes that if he had seen the viral load report indicating that Leavitt's viral load was 143,000, he would have found that number to be sufficiently alarming that he would have \"move[d] precipitously\" to refer Leavitt to a specialist. <i>Cf. </i><i>Sealock v. Colo.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159878\"><a href=\"/opinion/159878/sealock-v-state-of-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span>, 1211-12 (10th Cir.2000) (relying on similarly \"candid testimony\" to reverse a district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of a correctional healthcare provider). Leavitt presented expert testimony that if that referral had been made, he would have been put back onto his antiretroviral regimen in short order and would not have suffered the various adverse effects of untreated HIV.<sup>[25]</sup> With regard <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> to these effects, Leavitt submitted affidavit evidence that during his incarceration at YCJ he suffered from nightsweats, chills, fevers, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting and constipation, and psoriasisยsymptoms that he attributed to his untreated HIV and to \"detoxing\" from the withdrawal of antiretroviral treatment.</p>\n<p>Leavitt presented evidence that Cichon's omission not only exposed him to these short-term effects, but also led to the exacerbation of his underlying condition. Soon after Leavitt arrived at MSP, he began suffering from thrush, leukoplakia, and seborrheic dermatitisยconditions that VTC providers interpreted as indications of immunological decline from HIV. He continues to suffer from rashes, warts, fatigue, and malaise. Leavitt also presented expert testimony that he suffered a detrimental decrease in his CD4 count because of the \"continuum\" of inadequate treatment he received at YCJ and MSP. <i>See </i><i>Monmouth Cnty.,</i> 834 F.2d at 347 (\"[W]here denial or delay causes an inmate to suffer a life-long handicap or permanent loss, the medical need is considered serious.\"). The wealth of evidence he presented also shows that he is statistically more likely to be susceptible to opportunistic infections and cancer in the future.</p>\n<p>From this record, a factfinder could conclude that Cichon's deprivation of care subjected Leavitt to serious harm, both short-term and long-term. <i>See </i><i>Helling,</i> 509 U.S. at 33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2475</span></a></span> (holding that correctional officials may not ignore medical conditions that are \"very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering\" in the future, and that such prospective harm can be the basis of an Eighth Amendment claim, even if the inmate has \"no serious current symptoms\"); <i>see also </i><i>Smith,</i> 316 F.3d at 188 (holding that \"an Eighth Amendment claim may be based on a defendant's conduct in exposing an inmate to an unreasonable risk of future harm\"). We thus conclude that Leavitt has established a material dispute as to whether Cichon acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Cichon.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Leavitt's Claims Against the Individual CMS Defendants</h2>\n<p>Leavitt also appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment on his ยง 1983 claim against CMS employees Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, and Kesteloot in their individual and official capacities. We focus first on the claims against these defendants in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p>In his brief, Leavitt appears to press a mix of collective and vicarious liability theories. He alleges that \"[a]ll the CMS defendants\" knew he had HIV, a disease that, if left untreated, could be fatal; were aware of his active HIV symptoms; had access to his medical charts; had the ability to communicate with VTC about his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> care; and were working for the same employer and could communicate with each other. These allegations, he contends, coupled with the simple fact that it took over seventeen months to reinitiate his antiretroviral therapy, are enough to put the question of the defendants' deliberate indifference to a jury.</p>\n<p>Leavitt's group liability theory may accurately reflect some deficiencies in the provision of health services at MSP. The prison's medical department operates on a clinic model. Inmates see various providers, each of whom is not charged with following a particular patient but instead attends to whoever shows up at the clinic at the time he or she is working. Regardless, this theory cannot provide the basis for recovery: \"It is axiomatic that the liability of persons sued in their individual capacities under section 1983 must be gauged in terms of their own actions.\" <i>Rogan v. Menino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198447\"><a href=\"/opinion/198447/rogan-v-menino/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.1999). Nor can supervisory officials, like Tritch, be held liable for the conduct of their subordinates solely under a theory of respondeat superior. <i>Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204120\"><a href=\"/opinion/204120/sanchez-v-pereira-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 2009) (reiterating the principle that government officials may be held liable only \"on the basis of their own acts or omissions,\" and not \"for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior\" (quoting <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span> (2009))).<sup>[27]</sup> It may be true that the care Leavitt received at MSP was generally inadequate. However, to make out a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim against healthcare providers in their <i>individual</i> capacity, he must demonstrate that there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that <i>each</i> CMS defendant was \"aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\" and that <i>each</i> defendant did, in fact, \"draw the inference.\" <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 837, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1970</span></a></span>. We cannot conclude that Leavitt has satisfied his burden.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>Todd Tritch</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Leavitt's grievance appears to be that Tritch acted with deliberate indifference in failing first to sign off on necessary referrals to specialists and second to follow up on Leavitt after committing to intervene more personally in his care. Leavitt only insinuates the first theory, and the record simply does not bear out the latter. Tritch did not became personally involved in Leavitt's care until August 10, 2007.<sup>[28]</sup> After examining appellant, Tritch not only ordered updated blood work, but also took the unusual step of ordering that Leavitt's follow-up appointment specifically be with him. While the appointment never took place, there is no evidence that this omission was anything more than an unfortunate scheduling glitch. It is undisputed that when Tritch finally saw the August lab results in November, he approved Leavitt's referral to VTC. It is also undisputed that in June 2008, it was Tritch who reviewed Leavitt's chart, concluded that his HIV medications should have been started sooner, and put in the order for antiretroviral drugs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> Based on this series of events, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that Tritch acted with deliberate indifference. To the contrary, each time he became aware of potentially serious harm to Leavitt, he reacted expeditiously. Perhaps Tritch was not as aware as one would like a medical professional to be, but \"an official's failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot. . . be condemned as the infliction of punishment,\" let alone punishment cruel and unusual. <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 838, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1970</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Edie Woodward and Charlene Watkins</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Against Woodward and Watkins, Leavitt's allegations reduce to the theory that they ought to have been more proactive in following up on his careยthat, for example, Woodward should have pursued the results of Leavitt's genotype test when Bio Reference failed to report them, and Watkins should have taken steps to confirm that an appointment with VTC had been scheduled as ordered. Leavitt offers nothing beyond conclusory allegations that their failure to do so was a symptom of deliberate indifference. <i>See </i><i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 156 (\"Allegations made in a plaintiff's complaint, standing alone, are not enough to oppose a properly supported motion for summary judgment.\"). The record shows that Woodward and Watkins behaved in ways consistent with their professed intention to treat Leavitt: each saw him in the chronic care clinic on myriad occasions, treated him for his immediate complaints, and ordered testing and follow-up appointments when appropriate. Certainly, they both relied on inaccurate or imperfect data in Leavitt's chart that appointments had been ordered or that follow-up phone calls would be made, but there is no evidence that their reliance was not in good faith. <i>See </i><i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He asserts that when Watkins received the consultation report from his March appointment at VTC, stating \"Will need to start him back on Truvada/Kaletra now,\" she should have started his antiretroviral therapy immediately. Watkins claims that because the report also recommended that \"they obtain a CD4, [viral load,] and a genotype,\" she interpreted it to mean that Leavitt should not restart treatment until after a new round of blood tests. Even if Watkins's interpretation was incorrect, it is uncontroverted that she proceeded in accordance with that interpretation, ordering the updated lab work she thought was required before Leavitt could be put back on Truvada and Kaletra. In this context, their disagreement over the interpretation of VTC's instruction is tantamount to a dispute over the exercise of professional judgment and insufficient to support a constitutional claim. <i>See </i><i>Torraco,</i> 923 F.2d at 234 (observing that \"`[w]here the dispute concerns not the absence of help, but the choice of a certain course of treatment,'\" deliberate indifference may be found [only if] the attention received is `so clearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to provide essential care'\" (quoting <i>Sires v.

Relatedly, Leavitt complains that Kesteloot did not look into why his antiretroviral therapy had been delayed until he filed his grievance. These allegations have little force when Leavitt himself acknowledges that Kesteloot's only focus in investigating his complaint was on whether his current concerns were being addressed, and not on whether past treatment had been appropriate. Kesteloot concluded her investigation after being satisfied that Leavitt had recently been seen by clinic providers, that his labs had just been drawn, and that a follow-up appointment with VTC was scheduled. This was a reasonable response to Leavitt's complaint. <i>See </i><i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 8 (\"[P]rison officials . . . cannot be deliberately indifferent if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not avoided.\"). It is true that Kesteloot did not investigate whether Leavitt's treatment was evidence of a systemic problem at MSP or follow up on Leavitt to insure that there would be no further delays in his treatment. However, her failure to take these affirmative steps is, without more, insufficient to allow a jury to find deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Leavitt's Claims Against CMS and Its Employees in Their Official Capacities</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reach Leavitt's claims against CMS and its employees in their official capacities. CMS concedes that as a private entity operating in its capacity at MSP at the time in question, it can be held liable as a municipality for the purpose of suits filed under ยง 1983.<sup>[30]</sup> As for the CMS employees, \"[a] damages suit against an official in an official capacity is tantamount to a suit against the entity of which the official is an agent.\" <i>Burrell,</i> 307 F.3d at 7. Thus the question is whether there is any basis for imposing liability against the entity.</p>\n<p>An underlying constitutional tort is required to proceed under a municipal liability theory. Where, as here, there is no constitutional violation by the employees of the municipality, there can be no liability predicated on municipal policy or custom. <i>See </i><i>Kennedy v. Town of Billerica,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150526\"><a href=\"/opinion/150526/kennedy-v-town-of-billerica/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 531-32 (1st Cir.2010).<sup>[31]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Although we conclude that the record is insufficient to allow Leavitt's Eighth. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> Amendment claims against the CMS defendants to go to a jury because of the stringent constitutional standard, we note the acknowledgment of the CMS defendants that \"the care [Leavitt] received ultimately fell short of the mark.\" Those responsible for the operation of the Maine correctional healthcare system, including MDOC, should focus on the troubling implications of that acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth, we <i>vacate</i> the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cichon; <i>affirm</i> the grant of summary judgment in favor of CMS, Tritch, Woodward, Watkins, and Kesteloot; and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We refer to defendants CMS and its employees collectively as \"the CMS defendants.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Leavitt's Statement of Material Facts raises a few allegations pertaining to events that took place before the October 5 meeting, including an allegation that a jail officer refused to accept the HIV medications that a friend brought to YCJ for Leavitt. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Cichon knew of these events, and thus they are immaterial to the determination of whether Cichon was deliberately indifferent to Leavitt's medical needs.</p>\n<p>[3]  The parties state that the CD4 cell count is the best estimate of an HIV-positive individual's risk of short-term progression to develop the clinical symptoms and risks of complications of HIV. Viral load, which measures the amount of virus present in the bloodstream, is most helpful in assessing a patient's response to treatment, but is also generally helpful in assessing the risk of short-term progression of HIV. A higher CD4 count and lower viral load are generally desirable.</p>\n<p>[4]  Leavitt's medical records from ACJ and the CD4 cell count and viral load reports were subpoenaed from YCJ and entered into the summary judgment record as part of Cichon's affidavit.</p>\n<p>[5]  Leavitt filed three non-HIV-related IMRFs, in which he requested Fixadent for his dentures and cream to treat his psoriasis. Cichon denied all three requests.</p>\n<p>[6]  YCJ had previously contracted with ARCH for healthcare services from around 1996 to 2003. ARCH was then replaced by the University of New England, before regaining the contract in 2004.</p>\n<p>[7]  The frequency of medications was changed from the physician's prescription of four times a day to two times a day because the jail contracted for staff to distribute medications only twice a day. The Board found that Cichon should have informed the inmate; however, it concluded that because Cichon had consulted with the inmate's physician before implementing the change, his \"behavior did not rise to a level of misconduct sufficient to warrant disciplinary action.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  The other letters of guidance issued by the Board related to Cichon making inappropriate comments about race and sex to patients.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Medical Board concluded that Cichon was \"providing medical services as a physician assistant without having a supervisory [allopathic] physician\" licensed by the Medical Board, \"failing to notify the Medical Board that he no longer had a supervisory physician licensed by the Medical Board,\" and/or \"misrepresenting to Medical Board staff the status of his license and supervisory relationship\" for the period from November 2, 2006, to at least March 15, 2007.</p>\n<p>[10]  Although this CD4 count represents a slight improvement over the reported results from April and October 2006, Leavitt's expert represents that there can be a lag in CD4 count decline after antiretroviral therapy is discontinued.</p>\n<p>[11]  VTC's medical director represented that by \"[n]o urgent indication,\" he anticipated that a follow-up appointment or another round of blood tests would take place within three months. This time frame was in accordance with usual practice to check an HIV patient's CD4 and viral load counts every three to four months as a way of monitoring the patient's condition, regardless of whether the patient is on antiretroviral therapy.</p>\n<p>[12]  These DHHS guidelines were explicitly addressed to \"treatment-naive\" patientsยHIV-positive patients who had never been on antiretroviral therapy. However, in 2007-2008 VTC used the same information and recommendations to guide treatment of patients who had been on medications for a time and then stopped. At the time, there was disagreement in the medical community as to the wisdom of the deferred treatment approach. Leavitt's expert testified that although Leavitt's CD4 count was above DHHS's cut-off point, Leavitt should nonetheless have been immediately restarted on antiretroviral therapy because of his history of low CD4 counts and because he suffered from hepatitis C.</p>\n<p>[13]  In responding to a complaint to the Medical Board brought against him by Leavitt, Tritch stated that Leavitt's \"HIV viral load was undetectable\" as of August 2007. Tritch has never corrected this inaccurate assertion to the Board.</p>\n<p>[14]  Leavitt wrote a letter on April 1, 2007 to Kesteloot's predecessor with a similar grievance, and attached a copy of that letter to his complaint to Kesteloot. Kesteloot became aware of the April 1 letter at some point after she assumed her position, but does not know if her predecessor ever acted on Leavitt's first complaint.</p>\n<p>[15]  MSP's grievance review officer reviewed Kesteloot's memo and denied Leavitt's grievance. Leavitt's appeal of that decision to MSP's chief administrative officer was also denied.</p>\n<p>[16]  Those slips were submitted on August 10, 2007, January 6, 2008, and July 4, 2008.</p>\n<p>[17]  These dates range from July 26, 2007, to July 4, 2008.</p>\n<p>[18]  They also offered an alternative ground for granting summary judgment in favor of Cichon: that Leavitt offered \"insubstantial proof of injury.\"</p>\n<p>[19]  The district court granted summary judgment against a variety of other defendants, including those employed by MDOC, under a separate order, from which Leavitt does not appeal.</p>\n<p>[20]  Leavitt no longer pursues his ADA claim against any of the defendants.</p>\n<p>[21]  The record is unclear as to whether Leavitt was being held at YCJ as a probation violator or as a pre-trial detainee, but Leavitt's precise status makes no difference to our analysis, as \"the standard applied under the Fourteenth Amendment [governing the claims of pre-trial detainees] is the same as the Eighth Amendment standard [governing the claims of convicted inmates].\" <i>Ruiz-Rosa,</i> 485 F.3d at 155.</p>\n<p>[22]  Even though Cichon claims not to recollect seeing Leavitt's October 2006 CD4 test report, it is undisputed that he initialed it. Moreover, it is undisputed that he reviewed Leavitt's records from ACJ, which indicated that appellant had a below-normal CD4 cell count of 355 as recently as April 2006.</p>\n<p>[23]  Indeed, Leavitt himself does not take issue with Cichon's decision to order the lab tests and medical history; it is undisputed that this was the proper course of action prior to restarting antiretroviral treatment.</p>\n<p>[24]  In making this credibility determination, the district court also assigned significant weight to the fact that Leavitt did not submit any IMRFs or make further complaints to the medical department about his HIV after the October clinic appointment. While a jury is free to consider this fact in determining whether Cichon acted with deliberate indifference, we do not see how Leavitt's actions would, as a matter of law, excuse Cichon's purposeful or reckless decision to ignore the viral load report or to refuse to provide Leavitt with a referral or other treatment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Wilson v.

The expert also testified that \"knowing the [HIV specialists] out there, the majority of people would have found a regimen for him and gotten him back on antiretroviral therapy\" immediately because Leavitt is \"not a novel patient,\" but \"a patient with ongoing HIV disease who has a history of very low CD4 counts.\"</p>\n<p>[26]  As an alternative for granting summary judgment in favor of Cichon, the district court concluded that \"Leavitt has insubstantial proof of injury caused by Cichon\" as required under ยง 1983. <i>See </i><i>Sullivan v.
