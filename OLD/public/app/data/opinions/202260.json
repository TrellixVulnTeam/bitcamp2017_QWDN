Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Richard N. Foley on brief for appellants.\n     William G. Scott and Boynton, Waldron, Doleac, Woodman &\nScott, P.A., on brief for appellees City of Portsmouth, Attorney\nRobert Sullivan, Bradley Russ, and Chief Michael Magnant.\n     Paul McEachern and Shaines & McEachern, P.A., on brief for\nappellees, Worth Development Corporation, Stuart Shaines and Robert\nShaines.\n\n\n                              June 13, 2006\n\f              Per Curiam.      This case arises from the nonrenewal of a\n\ncommercial lease between the tenant-plaintiffs, K & N                    Hospitality\n\nGroup and its principals (collectively, \"K & N\"), and the landlord-\n\ndefendants,         Worth    Development          Corp.   and     its     principals\n\n(collectively, \"the Worth Defendants\") for premises in Portsmouth,\n\nNew Hampshire, where K & N had been operating a nightclub catering\n\nto African-American clientele.              K & N claimed that the refusal to\n\nrenew or modify its lease was based on racial animus on the part of\n\nthe   Worth    Defendants      and    various      officials     of     the   City   of\n\nPortsmouth (collectively, \"the Municipal Defendants\"), who, K & N\n\nclaimed, denied various permits and pressured the Worth Defendants\n\nnot to modify or renew the lease.\n\n              The Worth Defendants have moved for summary affirmance on\n\nthe one appellate issue involving them--whether the district court\n\nerred in dismissing K & N's breach of contract claim against them\n\nbased on the statute of frauds.              For the reasons discussed below,\n\nwe grant that motion.              In addition, for reasons also discussed\n\nbelow, we summarily affirm, sua sponte, the remaining district\n\ncourt rulings challenged by K & N on appeal, namely, (1) the\n\ndismissal      of    K   &   N's    claim    of    tortious     interference     with\n\ncontractual relations and (2) the exclusion of evidence of K & N's\n\nfuture lost profits.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fA.        Dismissal of Breach of Contract Claim Based on\n          Statute of Frauds\n\n          The district court dismissed K & N's claim that the Worth\n\nDefendants had breached a five-year lease (Count VI) as barred by\n\nthe New Hampshire statute of frauds, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 506:1.\n\nAs the district court recognized, under that       statute, to be\n\nenforceable, a lease for a term of years must be in writing and\n\nsigned by the prospective defendant. Id. at 4 (citing Byblos Corp.\n\nv. Salem Farm Realty Trust, 692 A.2d 514, 517 (N.H. 1997)).\n\n          K & N does not dispute that general principle or the\n\nabsence of a signed five-year lease. However, it attempts to avoid\n\nstrict enforcement of the statute of frauds by alluding to the\n\nWorth Defendants' \"unclean hands\" in their interactions with K & N\n\nand the Municipal Defendants.   That conclusory allegation, without\n\nfurther development, does not rise to the level of a cognizable\n\nappellate argument, United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990), much less bring this case within the narrow exception\n\nto the statute of frauds cited in Halstead v. Murray, 547 A.2d 202\n\n(N.H. 1988), on which K & N relies.   See Weale v. Mass. Gen. Hous.\n\nCorp., 374 A.2d 925, 928 (N.H. 1977) (stating that \"mere refusal to\n\ncarry out an oral promise to convey land standing by itself is not\n\nfraud or ground for relief\" from statute of frauds); see also\n\nMartin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (declining to extend the fraud exception to cover \"any sort\n\nof contractual unfairness\").    Moreover, to the extent that, by\n\n                                -3-\n\f\"unclean hands,\" K & N is referring to its allegations that the\n\nWorth    Defendants   acted   in   bad    faith   or   engaged   in   fraud   or\n\nmisrepresentation, summary judgment was entered against K & N on\n\nthose very claims.     Hence, K & G cannot rely on those allegations\n\nto circumvent the bar imposed by the statute of frauds.\n\nB.          Judgment as a Matter of Law on Claim of Tortious\n            Interference with Advantageous Contractual Relations\n\n            At the close of evidence, the district court granted the\n\nMunicipal Defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law on K\n\n& N's claim of tortious interference with advantageous contractual\n\nrelations (Count III) on the grounds that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to submit that claim to the jury and that, in any event,\n\nit was duplicative of K & N's claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and\n\n1982.     On appeal, K & N attempts to distinguish its tortious\n\ninterference claim from its statutory civil rights claims by saying\n\nthat only the latter claims allege that the interference with\n\ncontractual relations was motivated by racial animus; the former\n\nclaim alleges only interference per se.                The problem with that\n\nargument is that, without a claim of racial animus or some other\n\nunlawful motive or means of interference, there is no valid claim\n\nof   tortious    interference      with   contractual     relations.      Mere\n\ninterference, in itself, is legally insufficient to state a claim.\n\nRather, \"[o]nly improper interference is deemed tortious in New\n\nHampshire.\"     Roberts v. Gen. Motors Corp., 643 A.2d 956, 961 (N.H.\n\n1994).    Here, the only interference K & N relies upon consists of\n\n                                      -4-\n\fstatements by the Municipal Defendants to the Worth Defendants\n\nthat, because of public safety problems at the existing social\n\nclub, they did not want the lease to be modified to permit the\n\noperation of a restaurant, which would be eligible for a liquor\n\nlicense, on the premises.        We see nothing \"improper\" about such\n\ncommunications.     Therefore, the district court correctly concluded\n\nthat K & N's tortious interference claim was duplicative of its\n\nstatutory civil rights claims.\n\nC.          Exclusion of Evidence of Future Lost Profits\n\n            The district court excluded evidence of K & N's future\n\nlost profits on the ground that \"New Hampshire law places the\n\nburden on the plaintiff to reduce future lost profits to net\n\npresent value and that expert testimony is necessary to do so.\"1\n\nWe   need   not   decide   whether   the    district   court   misstated   New\n\nHampshire law, as K & N argues, or otherwise abused its discretion\n\nin excluding this evidence, United States v. Guerrier, 428 F.3d 76,\n\n79 & n.1 (1st Cir. 2005) (stating the applicable standard of\n\nreview), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1640 (2006), because any such\n\nerror or abuse was harmless.         Because the jury found the Municipal\n\nDefendants not liable on all counts, it never reached the issue of\n\ndamages, future or otherwise.          Therefore, its judgment could not\n\nhave been \"substantially swayed\" by the absence of evidence of\n\n\n      1\n      The district court properly looked to New Hampshire law on\nthis issue. See Cummings v. Standard Register Co., 265 F.3d 56, 67\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                      -5-\n\ffuture lost profits, and so any error in excluding that evidence\n\nwas harmless.   Tiller v. Baghdady, 244 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's judgment is affirmed in\n\nall respects.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
