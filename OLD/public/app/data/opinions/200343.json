The Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n\nand   its   Commissioners    of     Insurance   and   Banks     (collectively,\n\n\"Massachusetts\") have filed a petition asking that we \"vacate, set\n\naside,   or    otherwise   annul\"    an    opinion   of   the   Office    of   the\n\nComptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\").          Massachusetts objects to the\n\nOCC's    determination     that   the     Gramm-Leach-Bliley     Act     of    1999\n\n(\"GLBA\"),      Pub. L. No. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338 (1999), preempts\n\nthree provisions of a Massachusetts consumer protection statute and\n\ntheir corresponding regulations.\n\n              In filing the petition with this Court, Massachusetts\n\nrelies on GLBA § 304(a), 15 U.S.C. § 6714(a), which provides:\n\n                     In the case of a regulatory conflict\n              between a State insurance regulator and a\n              Federal regulator regarding insurance issues,\n              including   whether   a   State   law,   rule,\n              regulation, order, or interpretation regarding\n              any insurance sales or solicitation activity\n              is properly treated as preempted under Federal\n              law, the Federal or State regulator may seek\n              expedited    judicial     review    of    such\n              determination by the United States Court of\n              Appeals for the circuit in which the State is\n              located or in the United States Court of\n              Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n              by filing a petition for review in such court.\n\n              Because the OCC's determination was set forth in an\n\ninformal opinion letter which does not appear to carry the force of\n\nlaw, presage imminent coercive conduct, or seemingly otherwise bind\n\nMassachusetts, we became concerned that the petition seeks an\n\nadvisory opinion and thus fails to describe a \"regulatory conflict\"\n\namounting to a case or controversy.             Accordingly, we solicited\n\n                                        -3-\n\fsupplemental briefs addressing our subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de\n\nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 701-02 (1982) (recognizing that the federal\n\njudicial power conferred by U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1,\n\nextends only to cases and controversies and that a court must on\n\nits own motion raise the issue if doubtful about its power to\n\nadjudicate a matter).         Having considered the parties' submissions,\n\nwe   conclude   that    the    OCC   opinion   letter   does    not   create   a\n\njusticiable \"regulatory conflict\" within the meaning of the GLBA.\n\nWe therefore dismiss the petition.\n\n           The facts relevant to our jurisdictional analysis are\n\nundisputed.     The GLBA, which became effective in 1999, amended\n\nseveral federal statutes that govern financial institutions. Among\n\nits many goals, the GLBA sought to facilitate affiliations between\n\nbanks and insurance companies and to permit depository institutions\n\nand their affiliates to offer insurance products.               See generally,\n\nPub. L. No. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338, tit. I (codified in scattered\n\nsections   of   12     and    15   U.S.C.).     Because   the    states   have\n\nhistorically regulated the insurance industry, see, e.g., the\n\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, 15 U.S.C. § 1101 (recognizing this\n\npractice and declaring it to be in the public interest), the GLBA\n\nincludes a number of provisions specifying whether and how much it\n\npreempts otherwise applicable state insurance laws.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            Of particular concern for present purposes is GLBA §\n\n104(d)(2), 15 U.S.C. § 6701(d)(2), which addresses the extent to\n\nwhich the states may continue to regulate the insurance sales,\n\nsolicitation,    and     cross-marketing     activities    of   depository\n\ninstitutions and their affiliates.         GLBA § 104(d)(2)(A), 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 6701(d)(2)(A), sets forth a general preemption provision.             The\n\nprovision reads:\n\n               In accordance with the legal standards for\n            preemption set forth in the decision of the\n            Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett\n            Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S.\n            25   (1996),   no  State   may,  by   statute,\n            regulation, order, interpretation, or other\n            action, prevent or significantly interfere\n            with the ability of a depository institution,\n            or an affiliate thereof, to engage, directly\n            or indirectly, either by itself or in\n            conjunction with an affiliate or any other\n            person, in any insurance sales, solicitation,\n            or crossmarketing activity.\n\nGLBA § 104(d)(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. § 6701(d)(2)(B), refines the scope\n\nof subparagraph (A)'s general preemption provision by stating that\n\nstate laws regulating the sales, solicitation, and cross-marketing\n\nactivities of depository institutions and their affiliates are not\n\npreempted under subparagraph (A) so long as they \"are substantially\n\nthe same as but no more burdensome or restrictive than\" thirteen\n\nstatutory   categories    described   in    subsequent    clauses.   GLBA   §\n\n104(d)(2)(C)(iii), 15 U.S.C. § 6701(d)(2)(C)(iii), provides this\n\nadditional interpretive gloss:\n\n            Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed -\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              (I) to limit the applicability of the\n          decision of the Supreme Court in Barnett Bank\n          of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25\n          (1996) with respect to any State statute,\n          regulation, order, interpretation, or other\n          action that is not referred to or described in\n          subparagraph (B); or\n\n              (II) to create any inference with respect\n          to any State statute, regulation, order\n          interpretation, or other action that is not\n          described in this paragraph.\n\n          On May 30, 2000, the Massachusetts Bankers Association,\n\na trade association, requested the OCC's opinion whether GLBA §\n\n104(d)(2) preempts three provisions of a Massachusetts statute\n\nentitled \"An Act Providing Consumer Protection Relative to the Sale\n\nof Insurance by Banks.\"       That state law regulates the sales,\n\nsolicitation,    and   cross-marketing   activities   of   banks   within\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n         The first of the three provisions discussed in the letter\n\nprohibits non-licensed bank personnel from referring bank customers\n\nto a licensed insurance agent or broker except upon an inquiry\n\ninitiated by the customer.      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167F, § 2A\n\n(1998); see also Mass. Regs. Code tit. 211, § 142.05(3) (1998);\n\nMass. Regs. Code tit. 209, § 49.06(3) (1998). The second prohibits\n\nnon-licensed bank personnel from receiving additional compensation\n\nfor insurance referrals regardless whether the compensation is\n\nconditioned upon the sale of insurance.       See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n167F, § 2A (1998); see also Mass. Regs. Code tit. 211, § 142.05(3)\n\n(1998); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 209, § 49.06(3) (1998).         The third\n\n                                  -6-\n\fprohibits banks from making an insurance solicitation in connection\n\nwith an application for an extension of credit until after the\n\napplication has been approved and, in the case of an extension of\n\ncredit secured by a mortgage on real estate, until after the\n\ncustomer has accepted the bank's written commitment to extend\n\ncredit.   See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167F, §§ 2A(b)(4)(ii) and (iii);\n\nsee also 211 Mass. Regs. Code tit. 211, § 142.06; Mass. Regs. Code\n\ntit. 209, § 49.06(5).\n\n           The OCC published notice of the preemption request, see\n\n65 Fed. Reg. 43827 (July 14, 2000), and solicited comments on\n\nwhether GLBA § 104(d)(2) preempts the state laws in question.       The\n\nOCC received a total of 110 comments in response to the notice,\n\nincluding comments submitted by Massachusetts.           Some comments\n\nargued in favor of preemption, some argued against, and some\n\nquestioned the OCC's authority to weigh in on the subject at all\n\nbecause Congress did not delegate to the OCC authority to determine\n\nwhether specific state laws are preempted by GLBA § 104(d)(2).\n\n           On March 18, 2002, the OCC issued a letter opining that\n\nGLBA § 104(d)(2) does indeed preempt the Massachusetts laws at\n\nissue.    The opinion almost immediately led a number of banking\n\ninterests to file waiver requests with state regulators seeking\n\npermission to engage in activities proscribed by these laws.\n\nMassachusetts   has   held   these   requests   in   abeyance,   pending\n\nresolution of its petition.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          In the letter, the OCC responded to comments questioning\n\nits right to take a position on the preemptive effect of GLBA §\n\n104(d)(2) by pointing to case law and statutes recognizing, with\n\nvarying degrees of explicitness, its authority \"to interpret, in\n\nthe first instance, federal laws affecting national bank powers.\"\n\nImportantly, the OCC implicitly conceded that Congress did not\n\nauthorize it to effect specific GLBA § 104(d)(2) preemptions\n\nthrough administrative conduct - e.g., promulgating regulations,\n\nconducting adjudications, issuing licenses - that carries the force\n\nof law.   No party or amicus curiae has taken a contrary position,\n\nand our independent review of the GLBA persuades us that the OCC\n\nreasonably has concluded that, in the present context, it may do\n\nnothing more than provide \"informal agency guidance of a sort\n\ncommonly and traditionally offered by the OCC in its role as\n\nsupervisor of national banks.\"    OCC Brief, at 19 (characterizing\n\nthe nature of the March 18, 2002 opinion letter).1\n\n          Because the opinion letter constitutes no more than\n\ninformal agency guidance to banks and other interested parties, it\n\ndoes not in these circumstances create a \"regulatory conflict\"\n\ngiving rise to a case or controversy between OCC and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because we conclude that Massachusetts's petition does not\ndescribe a \"regulatory conflict\" within the meaning of GLBA §\n304(a), we do not resolve whether the OCC's issuance of the opinion\nletter was ultra vires, as the Commonwealth and certain amici\nargue.   Rather, for purposes of our analysis, we shall assume\narguendo that the opinion letter was authorized.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fIt is true that informal agency action not carrying the force or\n\neffect of law can give rise to a case or controversy where it meets\n\nthe test for ripeness set forth in Abbott Laboratories, Inc. v.\n\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967) (matter is ripe if it is fit\n\nfor judicial decision and if withholding court consideration would\n\ncause the parties hardship). For example, the opinion letter might\n\nwell   affect   banking   and    insurance   interests    differently      and\n\nsufficiently to give rise to a case or controversy between such\n\ninterests and the OCC.        But Abbott requires a showing that the\n\ninformal action somehow imposes a legal or practical constraint on\n\nthe party seeking to invoke federal court jurisdiction.                 See\n\ngenerally N.Y. Stock Exch. v. Bloom, 562 F.2d 736, 741-43 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1977) (declining to find Abbott's hardship requirement met\n\nwhere informal agency action had no immediate effect on the parties\n\ninvoking the court's jurisdiction); Pierce, Administrative Law\n\nTreatise, § 15.15 (4th ed. 2002) (discussing how courts assessing\n\nthe justiciability of informal agency action under Abbott have\n\nfocused on whether the action has some \"binding effect\" on the\n\nplaintiff or petitioner); cf. Nat'l Automatic Laundry and Cleaning\n\nCouncil v. Schultz, 443 F.2d 689, 696-97 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (holding\n\nthat Labor Department opinion letter concluding that plaintiff's\n\nmembers were violating the Fair Labor Standards Act gave rise to a\n\njusticiable     controversy     because   plaintiff's    members   faced    a\n\n\"Hobson's choice\" of either conforming their business practices to\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe agency's view or risking strong statutory sanctions in any\n\nenforcement action under the Act).               Here, there has been no such\n\nshowing with respect to Massachusetts.\n\n             In their supplemental briefs, the parties assert that the\n\nopinion letter impairs Massachusetts's ability to enforce its laws.\n\nBut as we already have observed, the letter neither has legal\n\neffect nor presages future coercion by the OCC, which claims no\n\nentitlement to restrain the states from enforcing preempted law or\n\nto authorize third parties to engage in conduct forbidden by\n\npreempted law.        We thus fail to see how the letter circumscribes\n\nMassachusetts's ability to enforce its laws in any meaningful way.\n\nIf banks within Massachusetts were to act in defiance of state\n\nlaw,   the    opinion    letter     in    no     way   affects   Massachusetts's\n\nentitlement      or     ability      to         take   responsive       action.\n\n             The parties also suggest that the OCC's issuance of the\n\nopinion letter gives rise to a case or controversy because it so\n\nstrengthened    the     hand   of   banking       interests   seeking    to   avoid\n\nMassachusetts law that it led them to file waiver requests.                   But it\n\nis difficult to see how the filing of a waiver request intrudes on\n\nstate prerogatives sufficiently to cause the State constitutional\n\ninjury.   See Vt. Agency of Natural Resources v. United States, 529\n\nU.S. 765, 771 (2000) (describing the \"injury in fact\" requirement\n\nof Article III standing).           We have found no authority for the\n\nproposition that a state may bring an action in an Article III\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fcourt against the author of, say, an authoritative but non-binding\n\nlegal opinion expressed in a Securities and Exchange Commission no-\n\naction letter or an Internal Revenue Service private-letter ruling\n\n(or, for that matter, in a law review article or treatise) simply\n\nbecause the expression of the opinion prompts a third party to\n\nchallenge the lawfulness of some state enactment under federal law.\n\nSo too here.     Because we are unable to discern how the opinion\n\nletter constrains Massachusetts in such a way as to give rise to a\n\ncase or controversy between Massachusetts and the OCC, we do not\n\nregard this matter to be a \"regulatory conflict\" within the meaning\n\nof GLBA § 304(a).       We so read the statute because a contrary\n\nconstruction would raise grave concerns about its constitutionality\n\nas applied here, see, e.g., Harris v. United States, 122 S. Ct.\n\n2406, 2413 (2002), and because there are situations governed by\n\nGLBA § 304(a) that raise no Article III concerns, see Petitioner's\n\nInitial Brief at 24-25 (listing clearly justiciable conflicts\n\ncovered by GLBA § 304(a)).        Our holding therefore does not render\n\nthe statute insignificant or superfluous.           See, e.g., Duncan v.\n\nWalker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001) (counseling against statutory\n\nconstructions          that       have     su c h      effects).\n\n          We   close    on    a    practical   note.      The   questions\n\nMassachusetts's petition seeks to have us adjudicate are unlikely\n\nto be purely legal.    It is apparent that, in deciding whether state\n\nlaws are preempted by GLBA § 104(d)(2), courts are going to have to\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fmake judgment calls about the extent to which the laws hinder the\n\nability   of   depository   institutions   to   engage   in   sales,\n\nsolicitation, and cross-marketing activities, as a factual matter.\n\nSuch judgment calls will often be better made on an evidentiary\n\nrecord created in litigation in the trial court.   See Toilet Goods\n\nAssn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158, 163-64 (1967).\n\n          Petition dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

The second prohibits non-licensed bank personnel from receiving additional compensation for insurance referrals regardless whether the compensation is conditioned upon the sale of insurance. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167F, &#167; 2A (1998); <i>see also</i> Mass. Regs.Code tit. 211, &#167; 142.05(3) (1998); Mass. Regs.Code tit. 209, &#167; 49.06(3) (1998). The third prohibits banks from making an insurance solicitation in connection with an application for an extension of credit until after the application has been approved and, in the case of an extension of credit secured by a mortgage on real estate, until after the customer has accepted the bank's written commitment to extend credit. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167F, &#167;&#167; 2A(b)(4)(ii) and (iii); <i>see also</i> 211 Mass. Regs.Code tit. 211, &#167; 142.06; Mass.

The OCC received a total of 110 comments in response to the notice, including comments submitted by Massachusetts. Some comments argued in favor of preemption, some argued against, and some questioned the OCC's authority to weigh in on the subject at all because Congress did not delegate to the OCC authority to determine whether specific state laws are preempted by GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 2002, the OCC issued a letter opining that GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2) does indeed preempt the Massachusetts laws at issue. The opinion almost immediately led a number of banking interests to file waiver requests with state regulators seeking permission to engage in activities proscribed by these laws. Massachusetts has held these requests in abeyance, pending resolution of its petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the letter, the OCC responded to comments questioning its right to take a position on the preemptive effect of GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2) by pointing to case law and statutes recognizing, with varying degrees of explicitness, its authority \"to interpret, in the first instance, federal laws affecting national bank powers.\" Importantly, the OCC implicitly conceded that Congress did not authorize it to effect specific GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2) preemptions through administrative conduct &#8212; e.g., promulgating regulations, conducting adjudications, issuing licenses &#8212; that carries the force of law. No party or <i>amicus curiae</i> has taken a contrary position, and our independent review of the GLBA persuades us that the OCC reasonably has concluded that, in the present context, it may do nothing more than provide \"informal agency guidance of a sort commonly and traditionally offered by the OCC in its role as supervisor of national banks.\" OCC Brief, at 19 (characterizing the nature of the March 18, 2002 opinion letter).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the opinion letter constitutes no more than informal agency guidance to banks and other interested parties, it does not in these circumstances create a \"regulatory conflict\" giving rise to a case or controversy between OCC and <i>Massachusetts.</i> It is true that informal agency action not carrying the force or effect of law can give rise to a case or controversy where it meets the test for ripeness set forth in <i>Abbott Laboratories, Inc. v. Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967) (matter is ripe if it is fit for judicial decision and if withholding court consideration would cause the parties hardship). For example, the opinion letter might well affect banking and insurance interests differently and sufficiently to give rise to a case or controversy between such interests and the OCC. But <i>Abbott</i> requires a showing that the informal action somehow imposes a legal or practical constraint on the party seeking to invoke federal court jurisdiction. <i>See generally N.Y. Stock Exch. v. Bloom,</i> 562 F.2d 736, 741-43 (D.C.Cir.1977) (declining to find <i>Abbott</i>'s hardship requirement met where informal agency action had no immediate effect on the parties invoking the court's jurisdiction); Pierce, <i>Administrative Law Treatise,</i> &#167; 15.15 (4th ed.2002) (discussing how courts assessing the justiciability of informal agency action under <i>Abbott</i> have focused on whether the action has some \"binding effect\" on the plaintiff or petitioner); <i>cf. Nat'l Automatic Laundry and Cleaning Council v. Shultz,</i> 443 F.2d 689, 696-97 (D.C.Cir.1971) (holding that Labor Department opinion letter concluding that plaintiff's members were violating the Fair Labor Standards Act gave rise to a justiciable controversy because plaintiff's members faced a \"Hobson's choice\" of either conforming their business practices to the agency's view or risking strong statutory sanctions in any enforcement action under the Act). Here, there has been no such showing with respect to Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their supplemental briefs, the parties assert that the opinion letter impairs Massachusetts's ability to enforce its laws. But as we already have observed, the letter neither has legal effect nor presages future coercion by the OCC, which claims no entitlement to restrain the states from enforcing preempted law or to authorize third parties to engage in conduct forbidden by preempted law. We thus fail to see how the letter circumscribes Massachusetts's ability to enforce its laws in any meaningful way. If banks within Massachusetts were to act in defiance of state law, the opinion letter in no way affects Massachusetts's entitlement or ability to take responsive action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also suggest that the OCC's issuance of the opinion letter gives rise to a case or controversy because it so strengthened the hand of banking interests seeking to avoid Massachusetts law that it led them to file waiver requests. But it is difficult to see how the filing of a waiver request intrudes on state prerogatives sufficiently to cause the State constitutional injury. <i>See Vt. Agency of Natural Resources v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 765, 771, 120 S.Ct. 1858, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000) (describing the \"injury in fact\" requirement of Article III standing). We have found no authority for the proposition that a state may bring an action in an Article III court against the author of, say, an authoritative but non-binding legal opinion expressed in a Securities and Exchange Commission no-action letter or an Internal Revenue Service private-letter ruling (or, for that matter, in a law review article or treatise) simply because the expression of the opinion prompts a third party to challenge the lawfulness of some state enactment under federal law. So too here. Because we are unable to discern how the opinion letter constrains Massachusetts in such a way as to give rise to a case or controversy between Massachusetts and the OCC, we do not regard this matter to be a \"regulatory conflict\" within the meaning of GLBA &#167; 304(a). We so read the statute because a contrary construction would raise grave concerns about its constitutionality as applied here, <i>see, e.g., Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2413, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), and because there <i>are</i> situations governed by GLBA &#167; 304(a) that raise no Article III concerns, <i>see</i> Petitioner's Initial Brief at 24-25 (listing clearly justiciable conflicts covered by GLBA &#167; 304(a)). Our holding therefore does not render the statute insignificant or superfluous. <i>See, e.g., Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (counseling against statutory constructions that have such effects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We close on a practical note. The questions Massachusetts's petition seeks to have us adjudicate are unlikely to be purely legal. It is apparent that, in deciding whether state laws are preempted by GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2), courts are going to have to make judgment calls about the extent to which the laws hinder the ability of depository institutions to engage in sales, solicitation, and cross-marketing activities, as a factual matter. Such judgment calls will often be better made on an evidentiary record created in litigation in the trial court. <i>See Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner,</i> 387 U.S. 158, 163-64, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Petition dismissed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because we conclude that Massachusetts's petition does not describe a \"regulatory conflict\" within the meaning of GLBA &#167; 304(a), we do not resolve whether the OCC's issuance of the opinion letter was<i>ultra vires,</i> as the Commonwealth and certain <i>amici</i> argue.

Gen. Laws ch. 167F, &#167; 2A (1998); <i>see also</i> Mass. Regs. Code tit. 211, &#167; 142.05(3) (1998); Mass. Regs.Code tit. 209, &#167; 49.06(3) (1998). The second prohibits non-licensed bank personnel from receiving additional compensation for insurance referrals regardless whether the compensation is conditioned upon the sale of insurance. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167F, &#167; 2A (1998); <i>see also</i> Mass. Regs.Code tit. 211, &#167; 142.05(3) (1998); Mass. Regs.Code tit. 209, &#167; 49.06(3) (1998). The third prohibits banks from making an insurance solicitation in connection with an application for an extension of credit until after the application has been approved and, in the case of an extension of credit secured by a mortgage on real estate, until after the customer has accepted the bank's written commitment to extend credit. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167F, &#167;&#167; 2A(b)(4)(ii) and (iii); <i>see also</i> 211 Mass. Regs.Code tit. 211, &#167; 142.06; Mass.

The OCC received a total of 110 comments in response to the notice, including comments submitted by Massachusetts. Some comments argued in favor of preemption, some argued against, and some questioned the OCC's authority to weigh in on the subject at all because Congress did not delegate to the OCC authority to determine whether specific state laws are preempted by GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 18, 2002, the OCC issued a letter opining that GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2) does indeed preempt the Massachusetts laws at issue. The opinion almost immediately led a number of banking interests to file waiver requests with state regulators seeking permission to engage in activities proscribed by these laws. Massachusetts has held these requests in abeyance, pending resolution of its petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the letter, the OCC responded to comments questioning its right to take a position on the preemptive effect of GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2) by pointing to case law and statutes recognizing, with varying degrees of explicitness, its authority \"to interpret, in the first instance, federal laws affecting national bank powers.\" Importantly, the OCC implicitly conceded that Congress did not authorize it to effect specific GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2) preemptions through administrative conduct &#8212; e.g., promulgating regulations, conducting adjudications, issuing licenses &#8212; that carries the force of law. No party or <i>amicus curiae</i> has taken a contrary position, and our independent review of the GLBA persuades us that the OCC reasonably has concluded that, in the present context, it may do nothing more than provide \"informal agency guidance of a sort commonly and traditionally offered by the OCC in its role as supervisor of national banks.\" OCC Brief, at 19 (characterizing the nature of the March 18, 2002 opinion letter).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the opinion letter constitutes no more than informal agency guidance to banks and other interested parties, it does not in these circumstances create a \"regulatory conflict\" giving rise to a case or controversy between OCC and <i>Massachusetts.</i> It is true that informal agency action not carrying the force or effect of law can give rise to a case or controversy where it meets the test for ripeness set forth in <i>Abbott Laboratories, Inc. v. Gardner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 148-49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span> (1967) (matter is ripe if it is fit for judicial decision and if withholding court consideration would cause the parties hardship). For example, the opinion letter might well affect banking and insurance interests differently and sufficiently to give rise to a case or controversy between such interests and the OCC. But <i>Abbott</i> requires a showing that the informal action somehow imposes a legal or practical constraint on the party seeking to invoke federal court jurisdiction. <i>See generally N.Y. Stock Exch. v. Bloom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349334\"><a href=\"/opinion/349334/new-york-stock-exchange-inc-and-investment-company-institute-v-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span>, 741-43 (D.C.Cir.1977) (declining to find <i>Abbott</i>'s hardship requirement met where informal agency action had no immediate effect on the parties invoking the court's jurisdiction); Pierce, <i>Administrative Law Treatise,</i> &#167; 15.15 (4th ed.2002) (discussing how courts assessing the justiciability of informal agency action under <i>Abbott</i> have focused on whether the action has some \"binding effect\" on the plaintiff or petitioner); <i>cf. Nat'l Automatic Laundry and Cleaning Council v. Shultz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297065\"><a href=\"/opinion/297065/national-automatic-laundry-and-cleaning-council-v-george-p-shultz/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 696-97 (D.C.Cir.1971) (holding that Labor Department opinion letter concluding that plaintiff's members were violating the Fair Labor Standards Act gave rise to a justiciable controversy because plaintiff's members faced a \"Hobson's choice\" of either conforming their business practices to the agency's view or risking strong statutory sanctions in any enforcement action under the Act). Here, there has been no such showing with respect to Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their supplemental briefs, the parties assert that the opinion letter impairs Massachusetts's ability to enforce its laws. But as we already have observed, the letter neither has legal effect nor presages future coercion by the OCC, which claims no entitlement to restrain the states from enforcing preempted law or to authorize third parties to engage in conduct forbidden by preempted law. We thus fail to see how the letter circumscribes Massachusetts's ability to enforce its laws in any meaningful way. If banks within Massachusetts were to act in defiance of state law, the opinion letter in no way affects Massachusetts's entitlement or ability to take responsive action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also suggest that the OCC's issuance of the opinion letter gives rise to a case or controversy because it so strengthened the hand of banking interests seeking to avoid Massachusetts law that it led them to file waiver requests. But it is difficult to see how the filing of a waiver request intrudes on state prerogatives sufficiently to cause the State constitutional injury. <i>See Vt. Agency of Natural Resources v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118368\"><a href=\"/opinion/118368/vermont-agency-of-natural-resources-v-united-states-ex-rel-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 771, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118368\"><a href=\"/opinion/118368/vermont-agency-of-natural-resources-v-united-states-ex-rel-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span> (2000) (describing the \"injury in fact\" requirement of Article III standing). We have found no authority for the proposition that a state may bring an action in an Article III court against the author of, say, an authoritative but non-binding legal opinion expressed in a Securities and Exchange Commission no-action letter or an Internal Revenue Service private-letter ruling (or, for that matter, in a law review article or treatise) simply because the expression of the opinion prompts a third party to challenge the lawfulness of some state enactment under federal law. So too here. Because we are unable to discern how the opinion letter constrains Massachusetts in such a way as to give rise to a case or controversy between Massachusetts and the OCC, we do not regard this matter to be a \"regulatory conflict\" within the meaning of GLBA &#167; 304(a). We so read the statute because a contrary construction would raise grave concerns about its constitutionality as applied here, <i>see, e.g., Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span> (2002), and because there <i>are</i> situations governed by GLBA &#167; 304(a) that raise no Article III concerns, <i>see</i> Petitioner's Initial Brief at 24-25 (listing clearly justiciable conflicts covered by GLBA &#167; 304(a)). Our holding therefore does not render the statute insignificant or superfluous. <i>See, e.g., Duncan v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118447\"><a href=\"/opinion/118447/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 174, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118447\"><a href=\"/opinion/118447/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The questions Massachusetts's petition seeks to have us adjudicate are unlikely to be purely legal. It is apparent that, in deciding whether state laws are preempted by GLBA &#167; 104(d)(2), courts are going to have to make judgment calls about the extent to which the laws hinder the ability of depository institutions to engage in sales, solicitation, and cross-marketing activities, as a factual matter. Such judgment calls will often be better made on an evidentiary record created in litigation in the trial court. <i>See Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v.
