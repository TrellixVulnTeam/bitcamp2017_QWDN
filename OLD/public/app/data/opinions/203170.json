Lee Henry pleaded guilty to\n\npossession with intent to distribute heroin and contempt of court.\n\nThe district court sentenced him to 144 months' imprisonment for\n\nthe   drug    trafficking    crime     and     an   additional       24   months'\n\nimprisonment for contempt, to be served consecutively.                He appeals\n\nhis conviction for contempt and his sentence for drug trafficking,\n\nasserting     that   the   district    court      erred   by   convicting    and\n\nsentencing him in violation of the Fifth Amendment's prohibition\n\nagainst   double     jeopardy,     failing   to     conduct    the    sentencing\n\nenhancement colloquy mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 851(b), and the\n\ncourt's determining that two prior offenses were unrelated for\n\nGuidelines purposes.        We find no plain error in the district\n\ncourt's treatment of Henry's first two claims and hold that the\n\nthird claim is barred by the law of the case.\n\n                              I.    BACKGROUND\n\n             On October 23, 2003, a federal grand jury charged Henry\n\nin a four-count indictment with distributing controlled substances\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).              Following his arrest, a\n\nmagistrate judge released Henry on bail pending trial, subject to\n\ncertain conditions, among them that he not commit any additional\n\noffenses while on pretrial release.1           Undeterred by the magistrate\n\n\n\n      1\n      Following a jury trial, Henry was convicted of three of the\nfour counts charged in the indictment, and his convictions were\naffirmed on appeal. See United States v. Henry, 482 F.3d 27 (1st\nCir. 2007).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fjudge's admonition, Henry was arrested less than forty-eight hours\n\nlater, at which point police discovered ten bags of heroin on his\n\nperson and forty more in his automobile, with an aggregate weight\n\nof 1.99 grams.   On March 17, 2005, Henry was indicted by a grand\n\njury for possession and possession with the intent to distribute\n\nheroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and, in a separate\n\nindictment based on the same underlying conduct, contempt of court,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3).\n\n          On   October   7,   2005,   Henry   pleaded   guilty   to   both\n\nindictments at a single hearing, and was duly sentenced for both\n\ncrimes at a subsequent proceeding.2       The 144-month sentence for\n\ndrug trafficking was based, in part, on the district court's\n\ndetermination that Henry should be classified as a career offender\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, predicated upon two prior Connecticut state\n\ncourt convictions for drug trafficking.         Although the relevant\n\ncalculations resulted in a suggested Guidelines range of 188 to 235\n\nmonths, the district court issued a downward departure after\n\nfinding that the prior state convictions overrepresented Henry's\n\ncriminal history and that Henry suffered from diminished capacity,\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Henry was also sentenced for his original drug-trafficking\noffense during this proceeding. He was, however, represented by\ndifferent counsel for that offense--apparently, Henry's original\ncounsel refused to represent him in the matter currently on appeal\ndue to her distaste for his violation of the terms of his pretrial\nrelease.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fstemming     from   a   traumatic   experience   that   occurred   during\n\nchildhood.\n\n           Following Henry's timely notices of appeal, his original\n\nappellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California,\n\n386 U.S. 738 (1967), stating that Henry's appeals did not present\n\nany nonfrivolous issues for review, including the question of\n\nwhether Henry's two prior Connecticut state court convictions\n\nshould be considered \"related\" offenses under the Guidelines.         On\n\nApril 3, 2007, we issued an order providing for summary disposition\n\nof the matters addressed by the Anders brief, but we requested\n\nfurther briefing concerning two issues raised by Henry's pro se\n\nbrief--more specifically, his double jeopardy claim and § 851(b)\n\nchallenge.\n\n                             II.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Double Jeopardy\n\n           Henry argues that his October 7, 2005, dual convictions\n\nfor contempt of court and drug trafficking are barred by the Fifth\n\nAmendment's prohibition against double jeopardy.3         Because Henry\n\n\n      3\n      Henry, in his brief, seemingly attempts to use his double\njeopardy argument to bootstrap an ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim into the instant appeal.      We will not consider any such\nclaim, however, as it has been waived for purposes of this appeal.\nUnited States v. Jiminez, 498 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting\n\"the well-settled appellate rule that 'issues adverted to in a\nperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived'\" (quoting United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990))). Moreover, \"[w]e have\nheld with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-\nspecific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut\n\n                                     -4-\n\fdid not object on such grounds at trial, we review only for plain\n\nerror.   United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 631 (2002); United\n\nStates v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1, 46 (1st Cir. 2003).                      To\n\nestablish plain error, a defendant must show the existence of (1)\n\nan error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affected his substantial\n\nrights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.            United States v. Roy,\n\n506 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 732 (1993)).        Essentially, we will only reverse if the\n\ntrial court committed \"blockbuster[]\" errors.               United States v.\n\nMoran, 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2004) (alteration in original)\n\n(internal   quotation      marks   omitted)   (quoting      United   States   v.\n\nGriffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n            The   Double    Jeopardy    Clause   of   the    Fifth   Amendment\n\ncommands that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to\n\nbe twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"            U.S. Const. amend V.\n\nGenerally, this prohibition against double jeopardy \"shields a\n\ndefendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after\n\neither conviction or acquittal, and it also prohibits multiple\n\npunishments for the same offense.\"           United States v. Pacheco, 434\n\nF.3d 106, 111-12 (1st Cir. 2006) (citation omitted); accord North\n\nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969).            We assume arguendo\n\n\non direct review . . . .\" United States v. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401,\n410 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\nUnited States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe    charges    for   contempt       and    drug    trafficking    against       Henry\n\nconstitute the \"same offense\" for double jeopardy purposes, because\n\nproving the contempt violation required the government to prove the\n\nunderlying offense of drug trafficking.                       See United States v.\n\nDixon, 509 U.S. 688, 700 (1993) (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy,\n\nJ.); see also Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304\n\n(1932) (holding that the test \"to determine whether there are two\n\noffenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of\n\na fact which the other does not\").\n\n            Here, Henry pleaded guilty to both the contempt and the\n\ndrug    trafficking       charges      at    the     same    proceeding,    rendering\n\ninapplicable the bar against successive prosecutions.                       Thus, our\n\nanalysis is restricted to whether the imposition of multiple\n\npunishments      violated    Henry's         constitutional      rights.      Not    all\n\nmultiple punishments run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMissouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 365-66 (1983); United States v.\n\nLeMoure,    474    F.3d     37,   43    (1st       Cir.     2007).   A     defendant's\n\nconstitutional rights are not implicated where \"the legislature\n\nclearly intended to impose multiple punishments for the offense.\"\n\nUnited States v. Perez-Gonzalez, 445 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\"Thus, to determine whether multiple punishments are authorized, we\n\nmust . . . seek to determine the legislature's intent.\"                      Id.\n\n            Henry was convicted of contempt of court pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 401, which provides that:\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f           A court of the United States shall have power\n           to punish by fine or imprisonment, or both, at\n           its   discretion,   such   contempt   of   its\n           authority, and none other, as--\n\n           (1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence\n           or so near thereto as to obstruct the\n           administration of justice;\n\n           (2)   Misbehavior of any of its officers in\n           their official transactions; [and]\n\n           (3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful\n           writ, process, order, rule, decree, or\n           command.\n\nAs   a   condition   of   pretrial    release,   the   magistrate   judge\n\nspecifically forbade Henry from violating any federal, state, or\n\nlocal law.     By committing the underlying drug offense, Henry\n\nclearly flouted the magistrate judge's order--as he acknowledged by\n\npleading guilty.\n\n           As an initial matter, we observe that the nature of the\n\ncontempt statute arguably presupposes the notion that Congress\n\nintended multiple punishments in situations where the breach of a\n\ncourt's order is likewise a violation of substantive criminal law.4\n\nEnforcement of a contempt statute vindicates interests wholly\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) does not\nelucidate the matter. We note, however, that Henry's sentence for\ncontempt was enhanced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3147. Section 3147\nprovides that \"[a] person convicted of an offense committed\" while\non pretrial release shall serve a term of imprisonment \"consecutive\nto any other sentence of imprisonment,\" thus lending support to the\ngovernment's position. 18 U.S.C. § 3147.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fseparate from those related to punishing drug dealers.5          See Young\n\nv. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils, 481 U.S. 787, 800 (1987)\n\n(explaining that contempt \"proceedings are not intended to punish\n\nconduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws\" but\n\nrather to \"vindicat[e] the authority of the court\").             Thus, the\n\ngravamen of Henry's § 401(3) violation is not his act of drug\n\ntrafficking, but rather his failure to obey the court's command\n\nthat he refrain from any illegal act while on pretrial release.\n\nSee United States v. Woodward, 469 U.S. 105, 109 (1985) (permitting\n\nan   inference   of   congressional   intent    to   authorize    multiple\n\npunishments where the relevant statutes guard against different\n\nevils).\n\n           Henry's arguments to the contrary are not sufficiently\n\npersuasive to establish plain error.           First, we reject Henry's\n\nargument that Dixon requires reversal.           In relevant part, the\n\nmajority holding of Dixon stands for the narrow proposition that an\n\nindividual may not be prosecuted for an underlying, substantive\n\noffense and criminal contempt in temporally separate proceedings.\n\nSee 509 U.S. at 712.    The divided court left open the possibility\n\nthat an individual could be punished for both contempt and an\n\nunderlying offense in a single proceeding without implicating\n\n\n\n     5\n      Indeed, at sentencing, the district judge expressed his\nconcern that Henry's contempt of court would not only tarnish the\nreputation of the courts, but also harm future defendants by\ndiscouraging the courts from releasing them.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fconstitutional concerns.6         See id. at 714 (Rehnquist, C.J., joined\n\nby O'Connor and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart) (rejecting proposition that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\n\neven separate prosecutions for contempt and underlying offenses);\n\nid. at 723-24 (White, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.,\n\nconcurring    in    the    judgment    in   part    and   dissenting    in    part)\n\n(discussing possible constitutionality of multiple punishments for\n\ncontempt     and    underlying      offenses       if   imposed    in   a    single\n\nproceeding);       id.   at   742-43   (Blackmun,       J.,   concurring     in   the\n\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (asserting that contempt\n\nproceedings should not be subject to traditional double jeopardy\n\nanalysis); id. at 745-46 (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring    in    the    judgment    in   part    and   dissenting    in    part)\n\n(reserving judgment on whether cumulative punishments for the same\n\noffense are permissible when clearly intended by the legislature).\n\nThus, Dixon does not answer the question when punishments for\n\ncontempt and for the underlying crime (from which the contempt\n\norder is derived) are administered in a single proceeding.\n\n            Second,       Henry   argues    that    the   canons   of   statutory\n\ninterpretation militate in favor of a determination that Congress\n\ndid not intend to impose multiple punishments in cases involving\n\n§ 401.     He notes that, in 18 U.S.C. § 3285, Congress explicitly\n\n\n     6\n      Some limited case law supports this interpretation.  See\nUnited States v. Wildergren, C-94-20452, 1995 WL 249266, at *4\n(N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 1995).\n\n                                        -9-\n\fdeclared that criminal contempt proceedings instituted pursuant to\n\n18 U.S.C. § 402 do not \"bar . . . any criminal prosecution for the\n\nsame act[,]\" but that Congress has remained silent concerning\n\n§ 401.      Thus, Henry reasons that the absence of any similar\n\nspecific authorization with respect to § 401 compels the negative\n\ninference that Congress did not intend for multiple punishments to\n\nbe imposed for contempt of court under § 401 and underlying\n\noffenses.    See United States v. Lahey Clinic Hosp., Inc., 399 F.3d\n\n1, 10 (1st Cir. 2005) (recognizing that statutory provisions should\n\nbe read in harmony with each other).\n\n            While not bereft of persuasive force, the permissive,\n\nnegative inference espoused by Henry lacks the thrust necessary to\n\novercome the significant hurdle of plain error review.       First,\n\nHenry does not even attempt to explain why Congress would wish the\n\ncourts to implement § 401 and § 402 differently.   A brief review of\n\nthe two sections, moreover, reveals that § 402 deals exclusively\n\nwith acts that also constitute \"criminal offense[s].\"   Conversely,\n\n§ 401 is more general in scope, and authorizes contempt proceedings\n\nfor actions that may not constitute independent violations of law.\n\nThus, we understand why Congress might have decided to make its\n\nintent explicit regarding multiple punishments under § 402, but not\n\n§ 401, without ever intending inconsistent treatment.\n\n            At best, Henry has postulated that there is room for\n\nreasonable minds to disagree whether double jeopardy concerns arise\n\n\n                                -10-\n\funder these circumstances.          He has not, however, met his burden of\n\nproving that the district court committed plain error in convicting\n\nhim of and sentencing him for both drug trafficking and contempt\n\nfor violating the law after pretrial release. See United States v.\n\nMastera, 435 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting that we cannot\n\nfind plain error where the law is unsettled).               He has not cited to\n\nany prior case law mandating--or even directly supporting--the\n\nrelief    that    he   requests.7      See    United   States   v.    Caraballo-\n\nRodriguez, 480 F.3d 62, 70 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that plain\n\nerror    cannot   be   found   in   case     law   absent   clear    and   binding\n\nprecedent).       Certainly, we cannot say that any error \"seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"       Roy, 506 F.3d at 30 (citation omitted).                To the\n\ncontrary, one might reasonably opine that treating an individual\n\nsuch as Henry the same as any other offender (save for Guidelines\n\npurposes), ignoring the fact that he procured his pretrial release,\n\nat least in part, by promising to abide by a judicial command to\n\nfollow the law but then brazenly engaged in drug trafficking within\n\nforty-eight hours of the magistrate judge's act of leniency, would\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Indeed, Henry points to our decision in United States v.\nColon-Osorio for the much more limited proposition that we have not\nyet definitively resolved this issue adversely to him. See 10 F.3d\n41, 43-44 (1st Cir. 1993). If Henry's best case merely holds the\ndoor ajar, even by his own estimation, then his challenge based on\nplain error falls well short.\n\n                                      -11-\n\fundermine the \"public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" See id.\n\nAccordingly, Henry's claim of double jeopardy must be rejected.\n\nB.   Section 851(b)\n\n             Next, Henry maintains that the district court erred by\n\nfailing to conduct the colloquy mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 851(b).\n\nHenry reasons that, because he timely objected to the district\n\ncourt's failure to conduct the colloquy, his substantive objection\n\nto his sentence is subject to harmless error review.       We disagree.\n\nThe mere failure to conduct a § 851(b) colloquy is harmless error.\n\nUnited States v. Romero-Carrion, 54 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThus, any reversible error could only stem from specific problems\n\nrelated   to   the   predicate   convictions.   Henry   was   obligated,\n\ntherefore, to specify the basis for his objection to provide the\n\ntrial court with an opportunity to consider the issue now presented\n\non appeal.     See United States v. Vargas, 471 F.3d 255, 262-63 (1st\n\nCir. 2006). At sentencing, Henry's counsel tendered only a general\n\nobjection to the absence of a § 851 colloquy.           Moreover, it is\n\ntransparent from a review of Henry's sentencing memorandum, the\n\ntranscript of the sentencing hearing, and the November 29, 2005,\n\naffidavit, submitted by his attorney, William O'Neil, in support of\n\na continuance, that Henry's actual objections to the application of\n\nthe career offender enhancement were limited to the relatedness and\n\nvalidity of the predicate convictions.          The record is utterly\n\nsilent concerning the specific objection now raised on appeal.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fAccordingly, we review only for plain error.                     United States v.\n\nDickerson, ___ F.3d ___, ___, 2008 WL 192295, at *3 (1st Cir. Jan.\n\n24, 2008).\n\n             Pursuant to § 851(b), a district court must \"inquire of\n\nthe defendant whether he or she contests the validity of any of the\n\nprior enhancing convictions in the information.\"                  Dickerson, 2008\n\nWL 192295, at *3; accord 21 U.S.C. § 851(b).                A defendant may not,\n\nhowever, challenge the validity of any prior conviction that\n\noccurred more than five years prior to the date the relevant\n\ninformation was filed.         See 21 U.S.C. § 851(e); accord Dickerson,\n\n2008 WL 192295, at *3 & n.5.             Here, Henry concedes that both of the\n\nconvictions the court relied upon in enhancing his sentence were\n\nmore    than   five   years        old    when   the    Information    was    filed.\n\nNevertheless, he maintains that § 851(e) is inapplicable because it\n\ndoes not encompass situations in which a defendant alleges that he\n\nwas    not   the   person    convicted      of   the   offense    charged     by   the\n\nInformation.        Although       Henry    correctly     recites     the    abstract\n\nprinciple of law, it does not apply under these circumstances.\n\n             In his sentencing memorandum to the district court, Henry\n\nacknowledged that he pleaded guilty to both of the offenses alleged\n\nin the Information.         Even now, on appeal, he merely argues that the\n\nfacts    described    in     the    Presentence        Report    (\"PSR\")    and    the\n\nInformation are not the same facts he admitted to during his plea\n\nhearing in Connecticut state court in Docket No. 98-0523584-S.\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fCrucially, Henry does not deny that he was the individual who\n\npleaded guilty in Connecticut state court to the drug-related\n\noffense charged in Docket No. 98-0523584-S.            Thus, he has quite\n\npossibly failed even to implicate the defense of mistaken identity-\n\n-he certainly has not shown plain error on this basis.\n\n          Moreover,    he   does     not   assert    that    the    purported\n\ndifference was material--for example, by suggesting that the actual\n\nfacts of the crime to which he indisputably pleaded guilty are not\n\nsubject to the sentencing enhancement imposed by the district\n\ncourt.   Henry might well be correct that the PSR and Information\n\nshould have alleged a slightly different set of facts.             Yet, he can\n\nhardly expect to obtain relief now, when he failed to raise the\n\nissue of an entirely technical difference in the proceedings below.\n\nSee Romero-Carrion, 54 F.3d at 18 (holding that irregularities that\n\ndo not affect substantial rights are harmless).             Certainly, Henry\n\nhas not shown that the Information was so deficient as to fail to\n\nprovide notice of the convictions on which the government sought to\n\nrely for the purposes of the sentencing enhancement.               See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Severino, 316 F.3d 939, 943-44 (9th Cir. 2003) (en\n\nbanc) (holding that discrepancies in an information render it\n\ninadequate   only   where   the    inaccuracies     actually    mislead   the\n\ndefendant) (citing United States v. Steen, 55 F.3d 1022, 1028 (5th\n\nCir. 1995)).    Indeed, Henry's principal arguments to the trial\n\ncourt--that the relevant state court convictions were related and\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthat he should be given additional time to contest their validity\n\nin Connecticut state court--demonstrate that Henry fully understood\n\nwhich convictions were referenced in the Information.\n\n              Significantly, we note that the district court provided\n\nHenry with many of the substantive protections contemplated by\n\n§ 851(b).         See, e.g., United States v. Campbell, 980 F.2d 245, 252\n\n(4th       Cir.    1992)   (affirming    sentence   where   the    substantive\n\nprotections contemplated by § 851 were provided, despite technical\n\nnoncompliance). The district court addressed Henry's objections to\n\nthe PSR based on the purported invalidity of the Connecticut state\n\ncourt convictions, as well as his argument that the two predicate\n\nconvictions underpinning the career offender enhancement should be\n\ndeemed related offenses.8        See id. at 252 n.12 & 13.        Whatever else\n\nmay be said, Henry has not shown plain error.9\n\nC.   Related Offenses\n\n              Finally, Henry argues that the district court erred by\n\nrejecting his contention that the two predicate offenses were\n\n\"related\" under the Sentencing Guidelines, rendering the sentencing\n\n\n       8\n      Although the district judge rejected Henry's contention that\nthe two predicate convictions were related, he nevertheless granted\na downward departure on the basis that they overrepresented Henry's\ncriminal history. It is pellucid from the record that the district\ncourt gave earnest and thoughtful consideration to the nature of\nHenry's prior convictions.\n       9\n      We likewise reject the ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim that Henry has attempted to incorporate into his § 851(b)\nclaim. See Leahy, 473 F.3d at 410 (rejecting, as a general rule,\nineffective assistance claims on direct appeal).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fenhancement unsustainable.          See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2).            This\n\nargument, however, is foreclosed by our April 3, 2007, order\n\ngranting summary disposition of this ground of appeal.           See United\n\nStates v. Vigneau, 337 F.3d 62, 67-68 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that\n\nthe law of the case doctrine forbids \"relitigation of the legal\n\nissues presented in successive stages of a single case once those\n\nissues    have   been   decided\"    (internal   quotation    marks   omitted)\n\n(quoting Field v.

Moreover,    Henry   has   not\n\ndemonstrated--nor even suggested--any unusual circumstances that\n\nwould warrant an exception to this general rule.            See Vigneau, 337\n\nF.3d at 68.      Thus, we reject Henry's third and final claim for\n\nrelief.\n\n                             III.    CONCLUSION\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Henry's convictions\n\nand sentences.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, and STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Lee Henry pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute heroin and contempt of court. The district court sentenced him to 144 months' imprisonment for the drug trafficking crime and an additional 24 months' imprisonment for contempt, to be served consecutively. He appeals his conviction for contempt and his sentence for drug trafficking, asserting that the district court erred by convicting and sentencing him in violation of the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy, failing to conduct the sentencing enhancement colloquy mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 851(b), and the court's determining that two prior offenses were unrelated for Guidelines purposes. We find no plain error in the district court's treatment of Henry's first two claims and hold that the third claim is barred by the law of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On October 23, 2003, a federal grand jury charged Henry in a four-count indictment with distributing controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Following his arrest, a magistrate judge released Henry on bail pending trial, subject to certain conditions, among them that he not commit any additional offenses while on pretrial release.<sup>[1]</sup> Undeterred by the magistrate judge's admonition, Henry was arrested less than forty-eight hours later, at which point police discovered ten bags of heroin on his person and forty more in his automobile, with an aggregate weight of 1.99 grams. On March 17, 2005, Henry was indicted by a grand jury for possession and possession with the intent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and, in a separate indictment based on the same underlying conduct, contempt of court, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3).</p>\n<p>On October 7, 2005, Henry pleaded guilty to both indictments at a single hearing, and was duly sentenced for both crimes at a subsequent proceeding.<sup>[2]</sup> The 144-month sentence for drug trafficking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> was based, in part, on the district court's determination that Henry should be classified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, predicated upon two prior Connecticut state court convictions for drug trafficking. Although the relevant calculations resulted in a suggested Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months, the district court issued a downward departure after finding that the prior state convictions overrepresented Henry's criminal history and that Henry suffered from diminished capacity, stemming from a traumatic experience that occurred during childhood.</p>\n<p>Following Henry's timely notices of appeal, his original appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <i>Anders v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that Henry's appeals did not present any nonfrivolous issues for review, including the question of whether Henry's two prior Connecticut state court convictions should be considered \"related\" offenses under the Guidelines. On April 3, 2007, we issued an order providing for summary disposition of the matters addressed by the <i>Anders</i> brief, but we requested further briefing concerning two issues raised by Henry's pro se brief  more specifically, his double jeopardy claim and § 851(b) challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>A. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p>Henry argues that his October 7, 2005, dual convictions for contempt of court and drug trafficking are barred by the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy.<sup>[3]</sup> Because Henry did not object on such grounds at trial, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <i>United States v. Soto-Beniquez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 46 (1st Cir.2003). To establish plain error, a defendant must show the existence of (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affected his substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Roy,</i> 506 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Essentially, we will only reverse if the trial court committed \"blockbuster[]\" errors. <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2004) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p>The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment commands that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend V. Generally, this prohibition against double jeopardy \"shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after either conviction or acquittal, and it also prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\" <i>United</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> <i>States v. Pacheco,</i> 434 F.3d 106, 111-12 (1st Cir.2006) (citation omitted); <i>accord </i><i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). We assume <i>arguendo</i> the charges for contempt and drug trafficking against Henry constitute the \"same offense\" for double jeopardy purposes, because proving the contempt violation required the government to prove the underlying offense of drug trafficking. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 509 U.S. 688, 700, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993) (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy, J.); <i>see also </i><i>Blockburger v. United States,</i> 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) (holding that the test \"to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not\").</p>\n<p>Here, Henry pleaded guilty to both the contempt and the drug trafficking charges at the same proceeding, rendering inapplicable the bar against successive prosecutions. Thus, our analysis is restricted to whether the imposition of multiple punishments violated Henry's constitutional rights. Not all multiple punishments run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <i>Missouri v. Hunter,</i> 459 U.S. 359, 365-66, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983); <i>United States v. LeMoure,</i> 474 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.2007). A defendant's constitutional rights are not implicated where \"the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments for the offense.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Gonzalez,</i> 445 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.2006). \"Thus, to determine whether multiple punishments are authorized, we must . . . seek to determine the legislature's intent.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Henry was convicted of contempt of court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 401, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, or both, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) Misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.</blockquote>\n<p>As a condition of pretrial release, the magistrate judge specifically forbade Henry from violating any federal, state, or local law. By committing the underlying drug offense, Henry clearly flouted the magistrate judge's orderas he acknowledged by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, we observe that the nature of the contempt statute arguably presupposes the notion that Congress intended multiple punishments in situations where the breach of a court's order is likewise a violation of substantive criminal law.<sup>[4]</sup> Enforcement of a contempt statute vindicates interests wholly separate from those related to punishing drug dealers.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils,</i> 481 U.S. 787, 800, 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> S.Ct. 2124, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987) (explaining that contempt \"proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws\" but rather to \"vindicat[e] the authority of the court\"). Thus, the gravamen of Henry's § 401(3) violation is not his act of drug trafficking, but rather his failure to obey the court's command that he refrain from <i>any</i> illegal act while on pretrial release. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 469 U.S. 105, 109, 105 S.Ct. 611, 83 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (permitting an inference of congressional intent to authorize multiple punishments where the relevant statutes guard against different evils).</p>\n<p>Henry's arguments to the contrary are not sufficiently persuasive to establish plain error. First, we reject Henry's argument that <i>Dixon</i> requires reversal. In relevant part, the majority holding of <i>Dixon</i> stands for the narrow proposition that an individual may not be prosecuted for an underlying, substantive offense and criminal contempt in temporally separate proceedings. <i>See</i> 509 U.S. at 712, 113 S.Ct. 2849. The divided court left open the possibility that an individual could be punished for both contempt and an underlying offense in a single proceeding without implicating constitutional concerns.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 714, 113 S.Ct. 2849 (Rehnquist, C.J., joined by O'Connor and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting proposition that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars even separate prosecutions for contempt and underlying offenses); <i>id.</i> at 723-24, 113 S.Ct. 2849 (White, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (discussing possible constitutionality of multiple punishments for contempt and underlying offenses if imposed in a single proceeding); <i>id.</i> at 742-43, 113 S.Ct. 2849 (Blackmun, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (asserting that contempt proceedings should not be subject to traditional double jeopardy analysis); <i>id.</i> at 745-46, 113 S.Ct. 2849 (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (reserving judgment on whether cumulative punishments for the same offense are permissible when clearly intended by the legislature). Thus, <i>Dixon</i> does not answer the question when punishments for contempt and for the underlying crime (from which the contempt order is derived) are administered in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p>Second, Henry argues that the canons of statutory interpretation militate in favor of a determination that Congress did not intend to impose multiple punishments in cases involving § 401. He notes that, in 18 U.S.C. § 3285, Congress explicitly declared that criminal contempt proceedings instituted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 402 do not \"bar . . . any criminal prosecution for the same act[,]\" but that Congress has remained silent concerning § 401. Thus, Henry reasons that the absence of any similar specific authorization with respect to § 401 compels the negative inference that Congress did not intend for multiple punishments to be imposed for contempt of court under § 401 and underlying offenses. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lahey Clinic Hosp., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2005) (recognizing that statutory provisions should be read in harmony with each other).</p>\n<p>While not bereft of persuasive force, the permissive, negative inference espoused by Henry lacks the thrust necessary to overcome the significant hurdle of plain error review. First, Henry does not even attempt to explain why Congress would wish <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> the courts to implement § 401 and § 402 differently. A brief review of the two sections, moreover, reveals that § 402 deals exclusively with acts that also constitute \"criminal offense[s].\" Conversely, § 401 is more general in scope, and authorizes contempt proceedings for actions that may not constitute independent violations of law. Thus, we understand why Congress might have decided to make its intent explicit regarding multiple punishments under § 402, but not § 401, without ever intending inconsistent treatment.</p>\n<p>At best, Henry has postulated that there is room for reasonable minds to disagree whether double jeopardy concerns arise under these circumstances. He has not, however, met his burden of proving that the district court committed plain error in convicting him of and sentencing him for both drug trafficking and contempt for violating the law after pretrial release. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mastera,</i> 435 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that we cannot find plain error where the law is unsettled). He has not cited to any prior case law mandatingor even directly supportingthe relief that he requests.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> 480 F.3d 62, 70 (1st Cir.2007) (holding that plain error cannot be found in case law absent clear and binding precedent). Certainly, we cannot say that any error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Roy,</i> 506 F.3d at 30 (citation omitted). To the contrary, one might reasonably opine that treating an individual such as Henry the same as any other offender (save for Guidelines purposes), ignoring the fact that he procured his pretrial release, at least in part, by promising to abide by a judicial command to follow the law but then brazenly engaged in drug trafficking within forty-eight hours of the magistrate judge's act of leniency, would undermine the \"public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>See id.</i> Accordingly, Henry's claim of double jeopardy must be rejected.</p>\n<p>B. Section 851(b)</p>\n<p>Next, Henry maintains that the district court erred by failing to conduct the colloquy mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 851(b). Henry reasons that, because he timely objected to the district court's failure to conduct the colloquy, his substantive objection to his sentence is subject to harmless error review. We disagree. The mere failure to conduct a § 851(b) colloquy is harmless error. <i>United States v. Romero-Carrion,</i> 54 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, any reversible error could only stem from specific problems related to the predicate convictions. Henry was obligated, therefore, to specify the basis for his objection to provide the trial court with an opportunity to consider the issue now presented on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vargas,</i> 471 F.3d 255, 262-63 (1st Cir. 2006). At sentencing, Henry's counsel tendered only a general objection to the absence of a § 851 colloquy. Moreover, it is transparent from a review of Henry's sentencing memorandum, the transcript of the sentencing hearing, and the November 29, 2005, affidavit, submitted by his attorney, William O'Neil, in support of a continuance, that Henry's actual objections to the application of the career offender enhancement were limited to the relatedness and validity of the predicate convictions. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> record is utterly silent concerning the specific objection now raised on appeal. Accordingly, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Dickerson,</i> 514 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to § 851(b), a district court must \"inquire of the defendant whether he or she contests the validity of any of the prior enhancing convictions in the information.\" <i>Dickerson,</i> 514 F.3d 60, 62; <i>accord</i> 21 U.S.C. § 851(b). A defendant may not, however, challenge the validity of any prior conviction that occurred more than five years prior to the date the relevant information was filed. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 851(e); <i>accord </i><i>Dickerson,</i> 514 F.3d 60, 65 &amp; n. 5. Here, Henry concedes that both of the convictions the court relied upon in enhancing his sentence were more than five years old when the Information was filed. Nevertheless, he maintains that § 851(e) is inapplicable because it does not encompass situations in which a defendant alleges that he was not the person convicted of the offense charged by the Information. Although Henry correctly recites the abstract principle of law, it does not apply under these circumstances.</p>\n<p>In his sentencing memorandum to the district court, Henry acknowledged that he pleaded guilty to both of the offenses alleged in the Information. Even now, on appeal, he merely argues that the facts described in the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") and the Information are not the same facts he admitted to during his plea hearing in Connecticut state court in Docket No. 98-0523584-S. Crucially, Henry does not deny that he was the individual who pleaded guilty in Connecticut state court to the drug-related offense charged in Docket No. 98-0523584-S. Thus, he has quite possibly failed even to implicate the defense of mistaken identity-he certainly has not shown plain error on this basis.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he does not assert that the purported difference was materialfor example, by suggesting that the actual facts of the crime to which he indisputably pleaded guilty are not subject to the sentencing enhancement imposed by the district court. Henry might well be correct that the PSR and Information should have alleged a slightly different set of facts. Yet, he can hardly expect to obtain relief now, when he failed to raise the issue of an entirely technical difference in the proceedings below. <i>See </i><i>Romero-Carrion,</i> 54 F.3d at 18 (holding that irregularities that do not affect substantial rights are harmless). Certainly, Henry has not shown that the Information was so deficient as to fail to provide notice of the convictions on which the government sought to rely for the purposes of the sentencing enhancement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Severino,</i> 316 F.3d 939, 943-44 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (holding that discrepancies in an information render it inadequate only where the inaccuracies actually mislead the defendant) (citing <i>United States v. Steen,</i> 55 F.3d 1022, 1028 (5th Cir.1995)). Indeed, Henry's principal arguments to the trial courtthat the relevant state court convictions were related and that he should be given additional time to contest their validity in Connecticut state courtdemonstrate that Henry fully understood which convictions were referenced in the Information.</p>\n<p>Significantly, we note that the district court provided Henry with many of the substantive protections contemplated by § 851(b). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Campbell,</i> 980 F.2d 245, 252 (4th Cir.1992) (affirming sentence where the substantive protections contemplated by § 851 were provided, despite technical noncompliance). The district court addressed Henry's objections <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> to the PSR based on the purported invalidity of the Connecticut state court convictions, as well as his argument that the two predicate convictions underpinning the career offender enhancement should be deemed related offenses.<sup>[8]</sup> See <i>id.</i> at 252 n. 12 &amp; 13. Whatever else may be said, Henry has not shown plain error.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>C. Related Offenses</p>\n<p>Finally, Henry argues that the district court erred by rejecting his contention that the two predicate offenses were \"related\" under the Sentencing Guidelines, rendering the sentencing enhancement unsustainable. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2). This argument, however, is foreclosed by our April 3, 2007, order granting summary disposition of this ground of appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d 62, 67-68 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that the law of the case doctrine forbids \"relitigation of the legal issues presented in successive stages of a single case once those issues have been decided\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Field v. Mans,</i> 157 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 1998))); <i>see also </i><i>Teti v. Bender,</i> 507 F.3d 50, 56-57 (1st Cir.2007) (indicating that the closely related doctrine of res judicata applies to claims resolved by summary disposition). Moreover, Henry has not demonstratednor even suggestedany unusual circumstances that would warrant an exception to this general rule. <i>See </i><i>Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d at 68. Thus, we reject Henry's third and final claim for relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Henry's convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Following a jury trial, Henry was convicted of three of the four counts charged in the indictment, and his convictions were affirmed on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Henry,</i> 482 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  Henry was also sentenced for his original drug-trafficking offense during this proceeding. He was, however, represented by different counsel for that offenseapparently, Henry's original counsel refused to represent him in the matter currently on appeal due to her distaste for his violation of the terms of his pretrial release.</p>\n<p>[3]  Henry, in his brief, seemingly attempts to use his double jeopardy argument to bootstrap an ineffective assistance of counsel claim into the instant appeal. We will not consider any such claim, however, as it has been waived for purposes of this appeal. <i>United States v. Jiminez,</i> 498 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir.2007) (noting \"the well-settled appellate rule that `issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990))). Moreover, \"[w]e have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review. . . .\" <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p>[4]  The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) does not elucidate the matter. We note, however, that Henry's sentence for contempt was enhanced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3147. Section 3147 provides that \"[a] person convicted of an offense committed\" while on pretrial release shall serve a term of imprisonment \"consecutive to any other sentence of imprisonment,\" thus lending support to the government's position. 18 U.S.C. § 3147.</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, at sentencing, the district judge expressed his concern that Henry's contempt of court would not only tarnish the reputation of the courts, but also harm future defendants by discouraging the courts from releasing them.</p>\n<p>[6]  Some limited case law supports this interpretation. <i>See United States v. Wildergren,</i> C-94-20452, 1995 WL 249266, at *4 (N.D.Cal. Apr.25, 1995).</p>\n<p>[7]  Indeed, Henry points to our decision in <i>United States v. Colon-Osorio</i> for the much more limited proposition that we have not yet definitively resolved this issue adversely to him. <i>See</i> 10 F.3d 41, 43-44 (1st Cir.1993). If Henry's best case merely holds the door ajar, even by his own estimation, then his challenge based on plain error falls well short.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the district judge rejected Henry's contention that the two predicate convictions were related, he nevertheless granted a downward departure on the basis that they overrepresented Henry's criminal history. It is pellucid from the record that the district court gave earnest and thoughtful consideration to the nature of Henry's prior convictions.</p>\n<p>[9]  We likewise reject the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that Henry has attempted to incorporate into his § 851(b) claim. <i>See </i><i>Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d at 410 (rejecting, as a general rule, ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal).</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court sentenced him to 144 months' imprisonment for the drug trafficking crime and an additional 24 months' imprisonment for contempt, to be served consecutively. He appeals his conviction for contempt and his sentence for drug trafficking, asserting that the district court erred by convicting and sentencing him in violation of the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy, failing to conduct the sentencing enhancement colloquy mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 851(b), and the court's determining that two prior offenses were unrelated for Guidelines purposes. We find no plain error in the district court's treatment of Henry's first two claims and hold that the third claim is barred by the law of the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On October 23, 2003, a federal grand jury charged Henry in a four-count indictment with distributing controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Following his arrest, a magistrate judge released Henry on bail pending trial, subject to certain conditions, among them that he not commit any additional offenses while on pretrial release.<sup>[1]</sup> Undeterred by the magistrate judge's admonition, Henry was arrested less than forty-eight hours later, at which point police discovered ten bags of heroin on his person and forty more in his automobile, with an aggregate weight of 1.99 grams. On March 17, 2005, Henry was indicted by a grand jury for possession and possession with the intent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and, in a separate indictment based on the same underlying conduct, contempt of court, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3).</p>\n<p>On October 7, 2005, Henry pleaded guilty to both indictments at a single hearing, and was duly sentenced for both crimes at a subsequent proceeding.<sup>[2]</sup> The 144-month sentence for drug trafficking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> was based, in part, on the district court's determination that Henry should be classified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, predicated upon two prior Connecticut state court convictions for drug trafficking. Although the relevant calculations resulted in a suggested Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months, the district court issued a downward departure after finding that the prior state convictions overrepresented Henry's criminal history and that Henry suffered from diminished capacity, stemming from a traumatic experience that occurred during childhood.</p>\n<p>Following Henry's timely notices of appeal, his original appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <i>Anders v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On April 3, 2007, we issued an order providing for summary disposition of the matters addressed by the <i>Anders</i> brief, but we requested further briefing concerning two issues raised by Henry's pro se brief  more specifically, his double jeopardy claim and § 851(b) challenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>A. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p>Henry argues that his October 7, 2005, dual convictions for contempt of court and drug trafficking are barred by the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double jeopardy.<sup>[3]</sup> Because Henry did not object on such grounds at trial, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v.

Thus, our analysis is restricted to whether the imposition of multiple punishments violated Henry's constitutional rights. Not all multiple punishments run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <i>Missouri v.

A defendant's constitutional rights are not implicated where \"the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments for the offense.\" <i>United States v.

By committing the underlying drug offense, Henry clearly flouted the magistrate judge's orderas he acknowledged by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, we observe that the nature of the contempt statute arguably presupposes the notion that Congress intended multiple punishments in situations where the breach of a court's order is likewise a violation of substantive criminal law.<sup>[4]</sup> Enforcement of a contempt statute vindicates interests wholly separate from those related to punishing drug dealers.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111893\"><a href=\"/opinion/111893/young-v-united-states-ex-rel-vuitton-et-fils-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 800, 107 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> S.Ct. 2124, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111893\"><a href=\"/opinion/111893/young-v-united-states-ex-rel-vuitton-et-fils-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Thus, the gravamen of Henry's § 401(3) violation is not his act of drug trafficking, but rather his failure to obey the court's command that he refrain from <i>any</i> illegal act while on pretrial release. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111289\"><a href=\"/opinion/111289/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 109, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111289\"><a href=\"/opinion/111289/united-states-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span> (1985) (permitting an inference of congressional intent to authorize multiple punishments where the relevant statutes guard against different evils).</p>\n<p>Henry's arguments to the contrary are not sufficiently persuasive to establish plain error. First, we reject Henry's argument that <i>Dixon</i> requires reversal. In relevant part, the majority holding of <i>Dixon</i> stands for the narrow proposition that an individual may not be prosecuted for an underlying, substantive offense and criminal contempt in temporally separate proceedings. <i>See</i> 509 U.S. at 712, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2849</span></a></span>. The divided court left open the possibility that an individual could be punished for both contempt and an underlying offense in a single proceeding without implicating constitutional concerns.<sup>[6]</sup><i>See id.</i> at 714, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112906\"><a href=\"/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, <i>Dixon</i> does not answer the question when punishments for contempt and for the underlying crime (from which the contempt order is derived) are administered in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p>Second, Henry argues that the canons of statutory interpretation militate in favor of a determination that Congress did not intend to impose multiple punishments in cases involving § 401. He notes that, in 18 U.S.C. § 3285, Congress explicitly declared that criminal contempt proceedings instituted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 402 do not \"bar . . . any criminal prosecution for the same act[,]\" but that Congress has remained silent concerning § 401. Thus, Henry reasons that the absence of any similar specific authorization with respect to § 401 compels the negative inference that Congress did not intend for multiple punishments to be imposed for contempt of court under § 401 and underlying offenses. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lahey Clinic Hosp., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201432\"><a href=\"/opinion/201432/united-states-v-lahey-clinic/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2005) (recognizing that statutory provisions should be read in harmony with each other).</p>\n<p>While not bereft of persuasive force, the permissive, negative inference espoused by Henry lacks the thrust necessary to overcome the significant hurdle of plain error review. First, Henry does not even attempt to explain why Congress would wish <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> the courts to implement § 401 and § 402 differently. A brief review of the two sections, moreover, reveals that § 402 deals exclusively with acts that also constitute \"criminal offense[s].\" Conversely, § 401 is more general in scope, and authorizes contempt proceedings for actions that may not constitute independent violations of law. Thus, we understand why Congress might have decided to make its intent explicit regarding multiple punishments under § 402, but not § 401, without ever intending inconsistent treatment.</p>\n<p>At best, Henry has postulated that there is room for reasonable minds to disagree whether double jeopardy concerns arise under these circumstances. He has not, however, met his burden of proving that the district court committed plain error in convicting him of and sentencing him for both drug trafficking and contempt for violating the law after pretrial release. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Mastera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202030\"><a href=\"/opinion/202030/united-states-v-mastera/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that we cannot find plain error where the law is unsettled). He has not cited to any prior case law mandatingor even directly supportingthe relief that he requests.<sup>[7]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Caraballo-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202665\"><a href=\"/opinion/202665/united-states-v-caraballo-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2007) (holding that plain error cannot be found in case law absent clear and binding precedent). Certainly, we cannot say that any error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Roy,</i> 506 F.3d at 30 (citation omitted). To the contrary, one might reasonably opine that treating an individual such as Henry the same as any other offender (save for Guidelines purposes), ignoring the fact that he procured his pretrial release, at least in part, by promising to abide by a judicial command to follow the law but then brazenly engaged in drug trafficking within forty-eight hours of the magistrate judge's act of leniency, would undermine the \"public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>See id.</i> Accordingly, Henry's claim of double jeopardy must be rejected.</p>\n<p>B. Section 851(b)</p>\n<p>Next, Henry maintains that the district court erred by failing to conduct the colloquy mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 851(b). Henry reasons that, because he timely objected to the district court's failure to conduct the colloquy, his substantive objection to his sentence is subject to harmless error review. We disagree. The mere failure to conduct a § 851(b) colloquy is harmless error. <i>United States v. Romero-Carrion,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196057\"><a href=\"/opinion/196057/united-states-v-romero-carrion/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, any reversible error could only stem from specific problems related to the predicate convictions. Henry was obligated, therefore, to specify the basis for his objection to provide the trial court with an opportunity to consider the issue now presented on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vargas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202568\"><a href=\"/opinion/202568/united-states-v-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 262-63 (1st Cir. 2006). At sentencing, Henry's counsel tendered only a general objection to the absence of a § 851 colloquy. Moreover, it is transparent from a review of Henry's sentencing memorandum, the transcript of the sentencing hearing, and the November 29, 2005, affidavit, submitted by his attorney, William O'Neil, in support of a continuance, that Henry's actual objections to the application of the career offender enhancement were limited to the relatedness and validity of the predicate convictions. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> record is utterly silent concerning the specific objection now raised on appeal. Accordingly, we review only for plain error. <i>United States v. Dickerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203115\"><a href=\"/opinion/203115/united-states-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to § 851(b), a district court must \"inquire of the defendant whether he or she contests the validity of any of the prior enhancing convictions in the information.\" <i>Dickerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203115\"><a href=\"/opinion/203115/united-states-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62; <i>accord</i> 21 U.S.C. § 851(b). A defendant may not, however, challenge the validity of any prior conviction that occurred more than five years prior to the date the relevant information was filed. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 851(e); <i>accord </i><i>Dickerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203115\"><a href=\"/opinion/203115/united-states-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 65 &amp; n. 5. Here, Henry concedes that both of the convictions the court relied upon in enhancing his sentence were more than five years old when the Information was filed. Nevertheless, he maintains that § 851(e) is inapplicable because it does not encompass situations in which a defendant alleges that he was not the person convicted of the offense charged by the Information. Although Henry correctly recites the abstract principle of law, it does not apply under these circumstances.</p>\n<p>In his sentencing memorandum to the district court, Henry acknowledged that he pleaded guilty to both of the offenses alleged in the Information. Even now, on appeal, he merely argues that the facts described in the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") and the Information are not the same facts he admitted to during his plea hearing in Connecticut state court in Docket No. 98-0523584-S. Crucially, Henry does not deny that he was the individual who pleaded guilty in Connecticut state court to the drug-related offense charged in Docket No. 98-0523584-S. Thus, he has quite possibly failed even to implicate the defense of mistaken identity-he certainly has not shown plain error on this basis.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he does not assert that the purported difference was materialfor example, by suggesting that the actual facts of the crime to which he indisputably pleaded guilty are not subject to the sentencing enhancement imposed by the district court. Henry might well be correct that the PSR and Information should have alleged a slightly different set of facts. Yet, he can hardly expect to obtain relief now, when he failed to raise the issue of an entirely technical difference in the proceedings below. <i>See </i><i>Romero-Carrion,</i> 54 F.3d at 18 (holding that irregularities that do not affect substantial rights are harmless). Certainly, Henry has not shown that the Information was so deficient as to fail to provide notice of the convictions on which the government sought to rely for the purposes of the sentencing enhancement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Severino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780564\"><a href=\"/opinion/780564/united-states-v-felix-severino/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">939</span></a></span>, 943-44 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (holding that discrepancies in an information render it inadequate only where the inaccuracies actually mislead the defendant) (citing <i>United States v. Steen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7175\"><a href=\"/opinion/7175/united-states-v-steen/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1022</span></a></span>, 1028 (5th Cir.1995)). Indeed, Henry's principal arguments to the trial courtthat the relevant state court convictions were related and that he should be given additional time to contest their validity in Connecticut state courtdemonstrate that Henry fully understood which convictions were referenced in the Information.</p>\n<p>Significantly, we note that the district court provided Henry with many of the substantive protections contemplated by § 851(b). <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595504\"><a href=\"/opinion/595504/united-states-v-howard-quinton-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 252 (4th Cir.1992) (affirming sentence where the substantive protections contemplated by § 851 were provided, despite technical noncompliance). The district court addressed Henry's objections <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> to the PSR based on the purported invalidity of the Connecticut state court convictions, as well as his argument that the two predicate convictions underpinning the career offender enhancement should be deemed related offenses.<sup>[8]</sup> See <i>id.</i> at 252 n. 12 &amp; 13. Whatever else may be said, Henry has not shown plain error.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>C. Related Offenses</p>\n<p>Finally, Henry argues that the district court erred by rejecting his contention that the two predicate offenses were \"related\" under the Sentencing Guidelines, rendering the sentencing enhancement unsustainable. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2). This argument, however, is foreclosed by our April 3, 2007, order granting summary disposition of this ground of appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vigneau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200569\"><a href=\"/opinion/200569/united-states-v-vigneau/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 67-68 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that the law of the case doctrine forbids \"relitigation of the legal issues presented in successive stages of a single case once those issues have been decided\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Field v. Mans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198162\"><a href=\"/opinion/198162/field-v-mans/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 1998))); <i>see also </i><i>Teti v. Bender,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203020\"><a href=\"/opinion/203020/teti-v-bender/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56-57 (1st Cir.2007) (indicating that the closely related doctrine of res judicata applies to claims resolved by summary disposition). Moreover, Henry has not demonstratednor even suggestedany unusual circumstances that would warrant an exception to this general rule. <i>See </i><i>Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d at 68. Thus, we reject Henry's third and final claim for relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Henry's convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Following a jury trial, Henry was convicted of three of the four counts charged in the indictment, and his convictions were affirmed on appeal. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Henry,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span> (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  Henry was also sentenced for his original drug-trafficking offense during this proceeding. He was, however, represented by different counsel for that offenseapparently, Henry's original counsel refused to represent him in the matter currently on appeal due to her distaste for his violation of the terms of his pretrial release.</p>\n<p>[3]  Henry, in his brief, seemingly attempts to use his double jeopardy argument to bootstrap an ineffective assistance of counsel claim into the instant appeal. We will not consider any such claim, however, as it has been waived for purposes of this appeal. <i>United States v. Jiminez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202892\"><a href=\"/opinion/202892/united-states-v-jiminez/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir.2007) (noting \"the well-settled appellate rule that `issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990))). Moreover, \"[w]e have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review. . . .\" <i>United States v. Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 410 (1st Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Mala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p>[4]  The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) does not elucidate the matter. We note, however, that Henry's sentence for contempt was enhanced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3147. Section 3147 provides that \"[a] person convicted of an offense committed\" while on pretrial release shall serve a term of imprisonment \"consecutive to any other sentence of imprisonment,\" thus lending support to the government's position. 18 U.S.C. § 3147.</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, at sentencing, the district judge expressed his concern that Henry's contempt of court would not only tarnish the reputation of the courts, but also harm future defendants by discouraging the courts from releasing them.</p>\n<p>[6]  Some limited case law supports this interpretation. <i>See United States v. Wildergren,</i> C-94-20452, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">249266</span></span>, at *4 (N.D.Cal. Apr.25, 1995).</p>\n<p>[7]  Indeed, Henry points to our decision in <i>United States v. Colon-Osorio</i> for the much more limited proposition that we have not yet definitively resolved this issue adversely to him. <i>See</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658096\"><a href=\"/opinion/658096/united-states-v-luis-a-colon-osorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43-44 (1st Cir.1993). If Henry's best case merely holds the door ajar, even by his own estimation, then his challenge based on plain error falls well short.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the district judge rejected Henry's contention that the two predicate convictions were related, he nevertheless granted a downward departure on the basis that they overrepresented Henry's criminal history. It is pellucid from the record that the district court gave earnest and thoughtful consideration to the nature of Henry's prior convictions.</p>\n<p>[9]  We likewise reject the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that Henry has attempted to incorporate into his § 851(b) claim. <i>See </i><i>Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d at 410 (rejecting, as a general rule, ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal).</p>\n\n</div>",
