Kersey on memorandum for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         March 25, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.     Attorney    George       E. Kersey was ordered\n\ndisbarred by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in February 2004 and\n\nthen,   in    reciprocal    fashion,    by   a   single       justice   of    the\n\nMassachusetts     Supreme   Judicial    Court    in    July    of   that     year.\n\nInitiating our own reciprocal discipline proceeding in September\n\n2004, we directed Kersey to show cause why this court should not\n\nimpose a similar sanction.      Having reviewed his written responses\n\nand held oral argument, we now order that Kersey be disbarred from\n\nthe practice of law before this court.\n\n             Our recent decision in In re Williams, 398 F.3d 116 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (per curiam), outlined the methodology that applies in\n\nthis context.     \"As a general rule,\" we stated, \"discipline similar\n\nto that imposed in the state court will be imposed in a reciprocal\n\nproceeding.\"      Id. at 119.   An exception can arise if one of the\n\ncircumstances listed in Selling v. Radford, 243 U.S. 46, 51 (1917),\n\nand memorialized in Rule II.C of this court's Rules of Attorney\n\nDisciplinary Enforcement (2002), is involved.             That rule provides\n\nthat this court will impose substantially the same discipline as\n\nthe original court unless it is persuaded:\n\n             1.   that the procedure used by           the other\n                  court was so lacking in              notice or\n                  opportunity to be heard as to        constitute\n                  a deprivation of due process;        or\n\n             2.   that there was such an infirmity of proof\n                  establishing the misconduct as to give\n                  rise to the clear conviction that this\n                  Court could not, consistent with its\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f                    duty, accept as final the conclusion on\n                    that subject; or\n\n              3.    that the imposition of substantially\n                    similar discipline by this Court would\n                    result in grave injustice; or\n\n              4.    that the misconduct established is deemed\n                    by this Court to warrant different\n                    discipline.\n\n1st Cir. Discip. R. II.C.         We also explained in Williams that the\n\nrespondent attorney bore twin burdens in such a proceeding: first,\n\nto \"ensure that th[e] whole of the record is furnished to the court\n\nin a timely manner and to identify the parts of the record upon\n\nwhich he relies,\" 398 F.3d at 119; and, second, to \"carry the\n\ndevoir of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence, that\n\nimposition of reciprocal discipline is unwarranted,\" id.                     We\n\nemphasized that \"[g]iven the limited nature of our inquiry, the\n\nnorm   will    be   for   this   court    to   impose   discipline   which   is\n\nsubstantially similar to that imposed by the state court.\"              Id.\n\n              The New Hampshire Supreme Court disbarred Kersey after\n\nfinding him in contempt of court in three respects in connection\n\nwith two of its orders.          See In re Kersey, 147 N.H. 659, 797 A.2d\n\n864 (2002) (holding him in contempt); In re Kersey, 150 N.H. 585,\n\n842 A.2d 121 (2004) (ordering disbarment).                 Specifically, it\n\nconcluded that Kersey had violated: (i) a September 2001 order by\n\ncontinuing to practice law after being suspended from practice;\n\n(ii) that same order by failing to turn over his client files to a\n\ndesignated attorney; and (iii) a December 2001 order by failing to\n\n                                         -3-\n\fbring his client files to a scheduled hearing before a referee.\n\nKersey now denies that he continued to practice law following his\n\nsuspension and insists that he had a reasonable basis for refusing\n\nto produce his client files.\n\n          The   continued-law-practice        charge      arose   out   of   the\n\nfollowing events.    The state supreme court's suspension order was\n\nitself the product of a reciprocal discipline proceeding, which had\n\nbeen prompted by outstanding contempt citations in Vermont and an\n\nensuing disciplinary sanction in Massachusetts. The September 2001\n\norder suspended Kersey from the practice of law for three months,\n\nbeginning on October 20, 2001.       On October 19, Kersey appealed to\n\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court from the dismissal of a case he had\n\nbrought on behalf of several clients.         And the following month he\n\nfiled two pleadings in that appeal.            According to Kersey, his\n\npursuit of   the    appeal   did   not    violate   the   suspension    order,\n\ninasmuch as he was there only for the purpose of challenging an\n\naward of attorneys' fees against him personally (and, therefore, he\n\nwas   the real party in interest).        In other words, because he was\n\nrepresenting himself rather than his clients–-indeed, because only\n\nhe (not his clients) had standing to pursue such a challenge on\n\nappeal–-he was not engaged in the practice of law.\n\n           The state supreme court disagreed, noting that \"[t]he\n\nappeal in question was filed by [Kersey] in his capacity as his\n\nclients' attorney, and stemmed from a case in which [he] was acting\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fas his clients' attorney.\"        797 A.2d at 866-67.      Accordingly, when\n\nKersey in November \"filed with this court two pleadings ..., he\n\nviolated the September order.\"        Id. at 867.   Kersey now claims that\n\nthis analysis was flawed.1\n\n          An initial obstacle encountered by Kersey is that he has\n\nnot supplied many of the relevant state court papers, despite our\n\nrequest that he do so (and despite his burden in this regard).            In\n\nparticular, we have none of the materials from the state court\n\nlitigation--such as the award of attorneys' fees, the notice of\n\nappeal, and the two subsequent pleadings cited by the state supreme\n\ncourt.   We thus cannot confirm, for example, that the fees award\n\nwas directed only against Kersey personally.          Regardless, even if\n\nwe accept all of Kersey's factual allegations as true, we would\n\nstill conclude that Kersey has failed to establish by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that a lesser sanction was warranted.\n\n              The state supreme court's finding that the suspension\n\norder was violated necessarily rested on a determination, as a\n\nmatter   of    state   law,    that   Kersey's   pursuit    of   the   appeal\n\nconstituted the practice of law.            In challenging that finding,\n\nKersey is asking us to conclude, in essence, that the state court\n\nmisapplied state law.         It is not within the province of a federal\n\n\n     1\n       Kersey also had two cases pending in federal district court\nduring this period.   While a referee relied on them as well in\nfinding the continued practice of law, the state supreme court did\nnot. Accordingly, we need not pursue Kersey's argument that the\nsuspension order did not apply to federal litigation.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcourt to render such a judgment.      See, e.g., Wainwright v. Goode,\n\n464 U.S. 78, 84 (1983) (per curiam) (\"the views of the State's\n\nhighest court with respect to state law are binding on the federal\n\ncourts\"); Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 91 (2005)\n\n(similar).   Nor is the state supreme court's analysis obviously\n\nflawed.   The court stated, and Kersey has not disputed, that he\n\nfiled the appeal in his capacity as his clients' attorney.    We take\n\nthis to mean that Kersey's intent to appeal only on his own behalf\n\nwas not apparent from the face of his appellate pleadings.     It is\n\nhardly unreasonable, when a suspended attorney appears in court, to\n\ndemand clear evidence of such intent from the outset.2\n\n          This raises a related consideration.      Even if Kersey's\n\ninterpretation of the suspension order could be viewed as plausible\n\nat the time, it was by no means airtight.     The attorney who was to\n\ncollect his client files, for example, had advised him that his\n\nposition was untenable.   Under these circumstances, and especially\n\nwhere Kersey was serving a suspension precisely because of earlier\n\ncontempt citations, his decision to press ahead without first\n\nseeking guidance from the state supreme court reflects a level of\n\nrecklessness that is deserving of little sympathy.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Nor, for that matter, is it even clear that the state court\nwould adopt the standing principles upon which Kersey relies. He\nhas pointed to federal case law in this regard but has cited no\nrelevant state precedents.\n\n                                -6-\n\f           Kersey's refusal to hand over his client files, in\n\nviolation of two court orders, further supports the state court's\n\nchoice of discipline.      To be sure, disbarment might well be\n\nunwarranted on the basis of these violations alone.      The first\n\norder imposed no explicit command on Kersey in this respect; Kersey\n\nhad what he presumably thought were legitimate reasons to withhold\n\nthe files; his noncompliance was somewhat short-lived; and his\n\nformer clients suffered no evident prejudice.      In one respect,\n\nhowever, the second violation here could be deemed more egregious\n\nthan the practicing-law offense: while Kersey might plausibly (if\n\nerroneously) have believed that his participation in the state\n\nappeal did not contravene the suspension order, he could have\n\nharbored no doubt that he was in direct defiance of the December\n\norder.    These violations thus reinforce the reasonableness of the\n\nstate court's sanction.\n\n            For these reasons, we conclude that cause has not been\n\nshown why reciprocal discipline substantially similar to that\n\nordered by the New Hampshire Supreme Court should not be imposed\n\nhere.    Accordingly, Attorney George E. Kersey is hereby disbarred\n\nfrom the practice of law before this court.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

Kersey was ordered disbarred by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in February 2004 and then, in reciprocal fashion, by a single justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in July of that year. Initiating our own reciprocal discipline proceeding in September 2004, we directed Kersey to show cause why this court should not impose a similar sanction. Having reviewed his written responses and held oral argument, we now order that Kersey be disbarred from the practice of law before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our recent decision in <i>In re Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201451\"><a href=\"/opinion/201451/in-re-williams-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam), outlined the methodology that applies in this context. \"As a general rule,\" we stated, \"discipline similar to that imposed in the state court will be imposed in a reciprocal proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 119.

Specifically, it concluded that Kersey had violated: (i) a September 2001 order by continuing to practice law after being suspended from practice; (ii) that same order by failing to turn over his client files to a designated attorney; and (iii) a December 2001 order by failing to bring his client files to a scheduled hearing before a referee. Kersey now denies that he continued to practice law following his suspension and insists that he had a reasonable basis for refusing to produce his client files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The continued-law-practice charge arose out of the following events. The state supreme court's suspension order was itself the product of a reciprocal discipline proceeding, which had been prompted by outstanding contempt citations in Vermont and an ensuing disciplinary sanction in Massachusetts. The September 2001 order suspended Kersey from the practice of law for three months, beginning on October 20, 2001. On October 19, Kersey appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court from the dismissal of a case he had brought on behalf of several clients. And the following month he filed two pleadings in that appeal. According to Kersey, his pursuit of the appeal did not violate the suspension order, inasmuch as he was there only for the purpose of challenging an award of attorneys' fees against him personally (and, therefore, he was the real party in interest). In other words, because he was representing himself rather than his clients &#8212; indeed, because only he (not his clients) had standing to pursue such a challenge on appeal &#8212; he was not engaged in the practice of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state supreme court disagreed, noting that \"[t]he appeal in question was filed by [Kersey] in his capacity as his clients' attorney, and stemmed from a case in which [he] was acting as his clients' attorney.\" 797 A.2d at 866-67. Accordingly, when Kersey in November \"filed with this court two pleadings..., he violated the September order.\" <i>Id.</i> at 867. Kersey now claims that this analysis was flawed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An initial obstacle encountered by Kersey is that he has not supplied many of the relevant state court papers, despite our request that he do so (and despite his burden in this regard). In particular, we have none of the materials from the state court litigation &#8212; such as the award of attorneys' fees, the notice of appeal, and the two subsequent pleadings cited by the state supreme court. We thus cannot confirm, for example, that the fees award was directed only against Kersey personally. Regardless, even if we accept all of Kersey's factual allegations as true, we would still conclude that Kersey has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that a lesser sanction was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state supreme court's finding that the suspension order was violated necessarily rested on a determination, as a matter of state law, that Kersey's pursuit of the appeal constituted the practice of law. In challenging that finding, Kersey is asking us to conclude, in essence, that the state court misapplied state law. It is not within the province of a federal court to render such a judgment. <i>See, e.g., Wainwright v. Goode,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111048\"><a href=\"/opinion/111048/wainwright-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111048\"><a href=\"/opinion/111048/wainwright-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111048\"><a href=\"/opinion/111048/wainwright-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span> (1983) (per curiam) (\"the views of the State's highest court with respect to state law are binding on the federal courts\"); <i>Noviello v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201453\"><a href=\"/opinion/201453/noviello-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 91 (2005) (similar). Nor is the state supreme court's analysis obviously flawed. The court stated, and Kersey has not disputed, that he filed the appeal in his capacity as his clients' attorney. We take this to mean that Kersey's intent to appeal only on his own behalf was not apparent from the face of his appellate pleadings. It is hardly unreasonable, when a suspended attorney appears in court, to demand clear evidence of such intent from the outset.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This raises a related consideration. Even if Kersey's interpretation of the suspension order could be viewed as plausible at the time, it was by no means airtight. The attorney who was to collect his client files, for example, had advised him that his position was untenable. Under these circumstances, and especially where Kersey was serving a suspension precisely because of earlier contempt citations, his decision to press ahead without first seeking guidance from the state supreme court reflects a level of recklessness that is deserving of little sympathy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kersey's refusal to hand over his client files, in violation of two court orders, further supports the state court's choice of discipline. To be sure, disbarment might well be unwarranted on the basis of these violations alone. The first order imposed no explicit command on Kersey in this respect; Kersey had what he presumably thought were legitimate reasons to withhold the files; his noncompliance was somewhat short-lived; and his former clients suffered no evident prejudice. In one respect, however, the second violation here could be deemed more egregious than the practicing-law offense: while Kersey might plausibly (if erroneously) have believed that his participation in the state appeal did not contravene the suspension order, he could have harbored no doubt that he was in direct defiance of the December order. These violations thus reinforce the reasonableness of the state court's sanction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that cause has not been shown why reciprocal discipline substantially similar to that ordered by the New Hampshire Supreme Court should not be imposed here. Accordingly, Attorney George E. Kersey is hereby disbarred from the practice of law before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Kersey also had two cases pending in federal district court during this period. While a referee relied on them as well in finding the continued practice of law, the state supreme court did not. Accordingly, we need not pursue Kersey's argument that the suspension order did not apply to federal litigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Nor, for that matter, is it even clear that the state court would adopt the standing principles upon which Kersey relies. He has pointed to federal case law in this regard but has cited no relevant state precedents</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
