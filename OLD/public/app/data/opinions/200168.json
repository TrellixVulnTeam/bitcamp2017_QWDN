Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Donald L. Martin on brief for appellant.\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, David L.\nBroderick, Assistant United States Attorney, Robert J. Triba,\nRegional Chief Counsel, and Joseph E. Dunn, Assistant Regional\nCounsel, Social Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        October 18, 2002\n\f             Per Curiam. Claimant Donald L. Martin appeals the\n\ndenial of his application for disability benefits by the\n\nCommissioner of Social Security. After carefully reviewing the\n\nparties'     briefs   and   the    record,   we    find   that    there    is\n\nconflicting evidence in the record concerning the impact of\n\nclaimant's mental impairments on his ability to engage in work-\n\nrelated activities. Such conflicts are for the Commissioner to\n\nresolve, not the courts.         See Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health\n\nand Human Services, 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n             In    particular,    the   residual    functional     capacity\n\nassessments completed during the relevant time period (prior to\n\nthe expiration of claimant's insured status on December 31,\n\n1998) fully support the hypothetical that the administrative\n\nlaw judge (ALJ) posed to the vocational expert (VE).               Based on\n\nthis hypothetical, the VE listed specific jobs in the national\n\neconomy which claimant could perform.               Claimant's arguments\n\nthat   the   ALJ    interpreted    raw    medical    data,   ignored      the\n\ndiagnosis of Dr. Jenkusky, gave undue weight to the opinions of\n\nsocial worker John Moran, and did not fully consider all of\n\nclaimant's impairments simply are without merit.\n\n             Claimant's other arguments also fail.               First, the\n\ndistrict court had no jurisdiction to review the denial of\n\nbenefits which had occurred at the initial review.                  Simply,\n\nthis denial was not the \"final\" decision of the Commissioner.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fSee 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) (judicial review is limited to \"any\n\nfinal decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made\n\nafter a hearing\").       See also Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 107\n\n(2000) (where the Appeals Council denies review, as here, \"the\n\nALJ's opinion becomes the final decision\").\n\n            Second, claimant's argument that only medical doctors\n\nare permitted to perform initial reviews is meritless.                   That\n\nis, the regulations specifically state that such reviews should\n\nbe performed by qualified psychologists.           See, e.g., 20 C.F.R.\n\n§ 404.1615(d) (an initial decision concerning disability in a\n\ncase where there is a mental impairment, \"will be made only\n\nafter every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that a\n\nqualified    psychiatrist    or   psychologist      has    completed      the\n\nmedical portion of the case review and any applicable residual\n\nfunctional capacity assessment).          Claimant does not dispute\n\nthat the two psychologists who reviewed his records were\n\nqualified.\n\n             Finally, the district court did not err in denying\n\ncounsel's motion to withdraw.          That is, both sides had filed\n\ntheir   memoranda   in    opposition    to   and   in     support   of    the\n\nCommissioner's decision when the motion was filed.              Thus, the\n\nmotion arguably was late.          In any event, and contrary to\n\nclaimant's position, the court did allow claimant to file\n\npleadings, and the court did rule on these pleadings.                    As a\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fresult,    claimant   essentially   was   permitted   to   represent\n\nhimself.\n\n            Affirmed.
