SHINDERMAN, M.D.,\n\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                      FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Selya, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael A. Cunniff, with whom Jay P. McCloskey, Thimi R. Mina,\nand McCloskey, Mina, Cunniff & Dilworth, LLC were on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 29, 2008\n\f             SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.      The admonition \"physician,\n\nheal thyself\" is a biblical proverb, Luke 4:23 (King James),\n\nsuggesting that people should address their own failings.               In the\n\ncase at hand, this admonition has both literal and figurative\n\napplication.     The tale follows.\n\n             Mark S. Shinderman, M.D., is a physician specializing in\n\npsychiatry and the treatment of addiction.           The federal government\n\nindicted him on a gallimaufry of criminal charges stemming from his\n\nunauthorized use of another doctor's name and Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) registration number.            A jury convicted him on\n\nmany of those charges.\n\n             On appeal, the defendant challenges both his convictions\n\nand his sentence.       He advances four assignments of error, which\n\nimpugn (i) the district court's refusal to apply the exclusionary\n\nrule    to   evidence   allegedly   obtained    in    violation   of   federal\n\nregulations designed to protect the confidentiality of substance\n\nabuse     treatment   records,   (ii)   the   foreclosure    of   a    proposed\n\nentrapment defense, (iii) an evidentiary ruling, and (iv) the use\n\nof   an   obstruction    of   justice   enhancement     during    sentencing.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that each and all of these animadversions\n\nlack merit, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           We rehearse here only those facts that are necessary to\n\nplace this appeal in perspective.          Other facts are added in our\n\nsubsequent discussion of particular issues.\n\n           Following a dramatic increase in drug-overdose deaths in\n\nMaine, the United States Department of Health and Human Services\n\n(HHS) began investigating possible links between this spike in\n\nmortality and health-care clinics specializing in the treatment of\n\ndrug addiction.    One of the providers scrutinized in the course of\n\nthis administrative inquiry was CAP Quality Care, a high-dose\n\nmethadone treatment clinic located in Westbrook, Maine.\n\n           The   defendant,   an   advocate     of   the   combined     use   of\n\nmethadone and benzodiazepine in the treatment of patients addicted\n\nto opiates, served as CAP's sponsor and national medical director.\n\nFederal law stipulates that any doctor who prescribes a controlled\n\nsubstance must possess a state-specific DEA registration number.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 822(a), (e).              When CAP opened in 2001, the\n\ndefendant had only an Illinois medical license and DEA number\n\n(although he had obtained a temporary license to practice medicine\n\nin Maine).\n\n           In the course of HHS's administrative inquiry into CAP's\n\naffairs, its investigators took a hard look at the defendant's\n\nprescription-writing practices. The defendant apparently attempted\n\nto write prescriptions for controlled substances using his Illinois\n\nDEA   number.     After   Maine    pharmacies    refused    to   fill    those\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fprescriptions, he started writing benzodiazepine prescriptions\n\nunder the name and Maine-specific DEA number of Dr. Steven Keefe,\n\na fully credentialled physician affiliated with CAP.\n\n            At that point, the inquiry intensified. The government's\n\nnext step was to subpoena CAP's Medicaid records.               Under statutes\n\nand   regulations    governing    the     disclosure     of   substance    abuse\n\ntreatment records, the government was required to obtain court\n\nauthorization to use the subpoenaed documents for prosecutorial\n\npurposes.      See 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(C); 42 C.F.R. § 2.66(a).\n\n            On April 24, 2003 — shortly after the government launched\n\na   criminal    investigation    aimed    at   the   defendant   —   a   federal\n\nmagistrate judge granted an ex parte motion seeking leave to\n\ndisclose to federal law enforcement personnel the Medicaid records\n\ngarnered    from   CAP   pursuant    to     HHS's    original   administrative\n\nsubpoena.      On August 22, the magistrate judge granted a second ex\n\nparte motion seeking authorization to release CAP patient treatment\n\nrecords to the prosecutors.         On September 5, the magistrate judge\n\ngranted yet a third ex parte motion; this motion sought access to\n\nmedical records seized in the course of executing a search warrant.\n\n            In each instance, the magistrate judge found good cause\n\nfor disclosure and honored the government's supplication that he\n\ndelay notice of the order granting the motion to avoid compromising\n\nthe criminal investigation.          To that end, the magistrate judge\n\nmaintained the orders under seal and decreed that notice to the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdefendant and all other affected parties could be deferred for up\n\nto ninety days.1                The    record contains copies of the notices\n\nsubsequently sent by the government to the defendant as well as an\n\naffidavit        from    an     HHS    official      attesting    that   notice      of   the\n\nissuance     of    the        disclosure    orders      had   been    given     within    the\n\nallotted time frame.\n\n             The dénouement came much later. On August 25, 2005 — the\n\nsame date on which the government filed a civil action against CAP\n\nfor, among other things, Medicaid fraud — a federal grand jury\n\nhanded up a sixty-eight count indictment.                        The first twenty-five\n\ncounts      charged       the     defendant       with     unlawful      use    of   a    DEA\n\nregistration number issued to another physician, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 843(a)(2).             Counts 26 through 50 charged him with aiding\n\nand    abetting         the    acquisition        of   a   controlled       substance      by\n\nmisrepresentation, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(3).                            Counts\n\n51    and   52    charged        him    with   falsifying        pharmacy      records,    in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(4)(A).                        The last sixteen counts\n\ncharged him with making false statements related to the delivery of\n\nor payment for health-care benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1035(a)(2).\n\n             The defendant filed a host of motions, seeking among\n\nother things to suppress the fruits of the administrative subpoenas\n\n\n       1\n      On July 20, 2003, the magistrate judge granted the government\nan additional sixty days within which to furnish notice of the\nissuance of the April 24 disclosure order.\n\n                                               -5-\n\fand the search.        Pertinently, he argued that all of the evidence\n\ndisclosed in pursuance of the ex parte court orders should be\n\nexcluded because the government had flouted the notice requirements\n\nimposed by federal substance abuse treatment regulations.\n\n             The district court found that the reprieve for the giving\n\nof notice granted by the magistrate judge had no legal basis and\n\nthat the defendant should have been given notice as soon as the\n\npatient records were disclosed to prosecutors.               United States v.\n\nShinderman, 432 F. Supp. 2d 149, 154 (D. Me. 2006).                 The court\n\nnevertheless refused to suppress the evidence, reasoning that\n\nsuppression was too drastic a remedy.             Id.\n\n             The trial lasted for nearly two weeks.           A parade of CAP\n\npatients testified to having seen the defendant write Keefe's name\n\nand   DEA    number    on    controlled     substance   prescriptions.     The\n\ncenterpiece of the government's case was Keefe's testimony that,\n\nwhile   he    agreed    to     provide     the   defendant   with   pre-signed\n\nprescription blanks, he never authorized the defendant to sign his\n\nname or use his DEA number.              In the defense case, the defendant\n\ntestified that Keefe had given him such permission.\n\n             After a day and a half of deliberations, the jury found\n\nthe   defendant   guilty      on   the    twenty-five   counts   that   alleged\n\nunlawful use of a DEA number belonging to another physician,\n\ntwenty-four of the twenty-five aiding and abetting counts, both\n\ncounts dealing with falsification of pharmacy records, and seven of\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe sixteen false statement counts.          The government voluntarily\n\ndismissed the remaining aiding and abetting count, and the jury\n\nacquitted the defendant on nine of the false statement counts.\n\n           The   sentencing    phase   followed.       The    district   court\n\napplied enhancements for obstruction of justice and abuse of a\n\nposition of trust, and set the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at\n\n15 to 21 months.     The court then departed downward and imposed a\n\nsix-month incarcerative sentence.         This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We separate the defendant's asseverational array into its\n\nfour component parts and treat those parts sequentially.\n\n                              A. Suppression.\n\n           In the interest of guaranteeing the efficacy of substance\n\nabuse treatment programs, Congress has directed that all substance\n\nabuse treatment records be kept confidential.                See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n290dd-2(a).      Disclosure   is   permitted    only   in    narrow   sets   of\n\ncircumstances.    These include consent, id. § 290dd-2(b)(1); audit,\n\nid. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(B); and court order, id. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(C).\n\n           Applicable regulations confirm and elaborate upon the\n\nstatute's commitment to confidentiality.           See 42 C.F.R. §§ 2.1-\n\n2.67. The regulations warn that such records \"may be disclosed or\n\nused only as permitted by these regulations and may not otherwise\n\nbe disclosed or used in any civil, criminal, administrative, or\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\flegislative proceedings conducted by any Federal, State, or local\n\nauthority.\"    Id. § 2.13.\n\n           The regulatory mosaic provides safeguards attendant to\n\nthe disclosure and use of substance abuse treatment records in\n\nconnection with a criminal case.          See id. §§ 2.65-2.67.          To\n\ninvestigate or prosecute either a substance abuse \"program\" or a\n\n\"person holding the records,\" law enforcement personnel must obtain\n\na court order premised upon a showing of good cause, id. § 2.66(c)\n\n(cross-referencing    §   2.64(d)-(e)),    and   must   employ    certain\n\nprophylactic   measures   to   shield   patients'   identities,    id.    §\n\n2.66(d).   While a court may issue a disclosure order without any\n\nparticular form of prior notice, the regulations require that \"upon\n\nimplementation of an order\" the program, the person holding the\n\nrecords, and any patient whose records are disclosed — a group whom\n\nwe shall call \"the protected parties\" — \"must be afforded an\n\nopportunity to seek revocation or amendment of that order.\"         Id. §\n\n2.66(b).\n\n           The district court found that the defendant (as the\n\nsponsor of CAP) qualified as a \"program\" for purposes of this\n\nregulation and, thus, was entitled to seek revocation or amendment\n\nof the ex parte disclosure orders issued by the magistrate judge.2\n\n\n     2\n      The term \"program\" includes \"an individual or entity . . .\nwho holds itself out as providing, and provides, alcohol or drug\nabuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment.\" 42 C.F.R.\n§ 2.11. We assume arguendo (and neither review nor pass upon) the\ncorrectness of the district court's holding that the defendant\n\n                                  -8-\n\fShinderman, 432 F. Supp. 2d at 154.           Building on this foundation,\n\nthe court ruled that the \"opportunity\" to revoke or amend each\n\norder arose immediately upon disclosure of the records in question\n\nto   law   enforcement    personnel,    that    the       regulations   mandated\n\nimmediate notice to the protected parties at that juncture, and\n\nthat the window of delay countenanced by the magistrate judge\n\nviolated section 2.66(b).       Id.   The court concluded, however, that\n\nsince neither bad faith nor prejudice to the defendant existed,\n\nsuppression \"was too drastic a remedy.\"             Id.\n\n            Before us, the defendant claims that once the district\n\ncourt found a regulatory violation, another section of the rules —\n\n42 C.F.R. § 2.13 — required the suppression of any evidence\n\ndisclosed    pursuant    to   the   tainted    order.        His   claim    raises\n\npotentially    important      questions     anent     the     meaning      of   the\n\nregulations and the appropriate use of the exclusionary rule to\n\naddress a regulatory infraction.              When all is said and done,\n\nhowever, we need not reach those questions; after all, \"[w]e are\n\nnot wedded to the lower court's rationale, but, rather, may affirm\n\nits order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.\"\n\nInterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            In this case, any application of the exclusionary rule\n\nmust be premised on an underlying regulatory violation — and we\n\n\n\nqualifies under this rubric.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdiscern none.       The regulation at issue, 42 C.F.R. § 2.66(b), is\n\nentitled \"[n]otice not required.\"                   Its principal purpose is to\n\ninvest the court with discretion to grant disclosure orders ex\n\nparte, that is, without notice to any protected party.                         It is thus\n\napparent that neither the text nor the purpose of the regulation\n\nsupports the notion that a delay in notice is per se unlawful.\n\n              To be sure, the regulation does direct that protected\n\nparties be afforded an opportunity to revoke or amend any judicial\n\ndisclosure     order.         But   in    setting     forth      that   directive,      the\n\nregulation nowhere makes explicit a duty to notify the protected\n\nparties at a particular point in time.                        As we read its plain\n\nlanguage, section 2.66(b) requires only that protected parties be\n\ngiven    a    chance     to    revoke     or    amend      the    order      \"upon    [its]\n\nimplementation.\" It would be perverse to graft an immediate notice\n\nrequirement onto a regulation that explicitly grants district\n\ncourts the discretion to relax notification requirements.\n\n              In our view, section 2.66(b) should be construed as it is\n\nwritten.     Its text demands that a court issuing a disclosure order\n\nafford    protected      parties      with     an   opportunity         to   contest    the\n\nunderlying validity and scope of the disclosure — nothing more. Of\n\ncourse,      that   opportunity       must     be    meaningful;        otherwise,      the\n\nregulation would hold out only an empty promise.                               With this\n\nqualification       in    mind      and   with      full    realization        that    each\n\nindividual case depends largely on context, we are confident that\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fnotice of a disclosure order does not always have to be coterminous\n\nwith the entry of the order.\n\n            An opportunity to challenge a judicial decree does not\n\nhave to arise instantaneously in order to be meaningful. Analogies\n\nare plentiful.    Indeed, it is commonplace for a court to delay\n\nnotice of a search or seizure in order to protect the integrity of\n\na criminal investigation.          See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d)\n\n(allowing district court to withhold notice from a person subject\n\nto a wiretap for up to ninety days after the termination of the\n\nunderlying    order);    id.   §   3103a(b)   (giving   district   courts\n\ndiscretion to delay any notice required in connection with the\n\nissuance of a search warrant intended to obtain evidence of a\n\ncriminal offense).      As long as the delay in notice does not erode\n\na protected party's right to challenge the order, we believe that\n\nsection 2.66(b) allows judges to exercise discretion as to the\n\ntiming and form of post-order notice.           Up to the point where\n\nprejudice looms, it makes no difference when the opportunity to\n\nseek the revocation or narrowing of a disclosure order arises.\n\n            This reading of section 2.66(b) does not eviscerate the\n\nconfidentiality protections afforded by the regulatory scheme.         A\n\ncourt can issue an ex parte disclosure order only after a finding\n\nof good cause.       See 42 C.F.R. § 2.66(c) (cross-referencing §\n\n2.64(d)).    Even then, no document released pursuant to such an\n\norder can be used to investigate or prosecute a patient.           Id. §\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f2.66(d)(2). In this vein, no public disclosure can be made without\n\nredaction of all patient-related information.             Id. § 2.66(d)(1).\n\nAnd, finally, all protected parties retain the right to challenge\n\nthe issuance of the order.           Given these features of section 2.66\n\nand its eschewal of pre-order notice, reading that regulation to\n\nrequire notice immediately upon release of the records to law\n\nenforcement personnel would seem to create a curious anomaly and,\n\nin the bargain, rein in the district court's normal discretion\n\nwithout advancing any significant interest in confidentiality.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the specifics of the\n\ninstant case.    The record makes manifest that the delay in notice\n\ndid not erode the defendant's ability to contest the validity and\n\nscope of the court orders.          The periods of delay authorized by the\n\nmagistrate judge were not unreasonable.               More importantly, the\n\ndistrict court found as a fact, at the hearing on the motion to\n\nsuppress,     that    the   delay    did    not   prejudice   the    defendant.\n\nShinderman,     432    F.   Supp.    2d    at   154-55.    That     finding   is\n\nunimpugnable: the defendant has identified no argument that he\n\ncould have employed immediately upon the issuance of a disclosure\n\norder that was adversely affected by a delay in notice.3\n\n\n     3\n      The absence of prejudice is unsurprising because section\n2.66(b) limits challenges \"to the presentation of evidence on the\nstatutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court\norder.\" We can perceive no argument based on those criteria that\nthe defendant might have lost in consequence of the delay. For\nexample, to issue a court order under section 2.66, a court must\nfind that \"[o]ther ways of obtaining the information are not\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            In all events, any profession of prejudice would be\n\nundone by the defendant's failure to move under section 2.66(b) for\n\nrevocation or amendment.             After all, once the government notified\n\nhim   of   the    issuance      of      the    disclosure   orders,      he       had    the\n\nopportunity      to    object      to   their    validity   and    scope      —    yet    he\n\nconspicuously failed to move for relief at that point. Instead, he\n\ndid nothing for almost two years and launched an effort to suppress\n\nthe fruits of the orders only after the grand jury handed up an\n\nindictment.\n\n            The short of it is that no prejudice occurred here.\n\nGiven this lack of prejudice, the magistrate judge's authorization\n\nof brief periods of delay in the giving of notice did not violate\n\nthe defendant's rights under the regulatory scheme.                           The lower\n\ncourt's    denial       of   the     defendant's     motion       to   suppress         was,\n\ntherefore, unexceptionable.\n\n                                   B.    Entrapment.\n\n            The       defendant      next     challenges    the    district       court's\n\nrefusal to instruct the jury on his envisioned entrapment defense.\n\nWe review a claim of erroneous failure to instruct a criminal jury\n\non a proffered theory of defense de novo.                         United States v.\n\nSánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 76 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v.\n\n\n\navailable or would not be effective,\" 42 C.F.R. § 2.64(d)(1), and\nthat \"[t]he public interest and need for the disclosure outweigh\nthe potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient\nrelationship and the treatment services,\" id. § 2.64(d)(2).\n\n                                              -13-\n\fRodríguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988).          In conducting that\n\nassay, we must refrain from differential factfinding and examine\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the accused so as to\n\ndetermine whether the record supports an entrapment theory.              See\n\nUnited States v. Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d 459, 462 (1st Cir. 2007);\n\nRodríguez, 858 F.2d at 812.\n\n             Entrapment is an affirmative defense.          See United States\n\nv. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994).           To undergird that\n\ndefense, the accused must make a prima facie showing both that the\n\ngovernment induced the commission of the charged crime and that he\n\n(the accused) lacked a predisposition to engage in it.4                  See\n\nMathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 62-63 (1988); United States\n\nv. Luisi, 482 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2007).         This is merely a burden\n\nof production; once it is satisfied, the government must prove\n\nbeyond   a   reasonable    doubt   that   no   entrapment    occurred.   See\n\nSánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d at 76; Rodríguez, 858 F.2d at 814-15.\n\n             The issue here is whether the defendant satisfied his\n\nentry-level burden.       This burden, though modest, see United States\n\nv. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998), requires more than self-\n\nserving assertions. The defendant must adduce \"some hard evidence\"\n\nthat \"governmental actors induced [him] to perform a criminal act\n\n\n\n     4\n      The defendant's claim is one of classic entrapment. He has\nexpressly disavowed any claim of entrapment by estoppel.    See,\ne.g., United States v. Sousa, 468 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2006);\nUnited States v. Bunnell, 280 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthat he was not predisposed to commit.\"              Rodríguez, 858 F.2d at\n\n814.\n\n            Here, the district court concluded that the defendant had\n\nnot cleared this unprepossessing hurdle and, thus, refused to\n\ninstruct the jury on the entrapment defense.           We test the strength\n\nof this conclusion.\n\n            As    enunciated    at   trial,   the    defendant's    theory   of\n\nentrapment was configured as follows. He presented evidence which,\n\nif credited, was competent to show that he possessed only a\n\ntemporary Maine medical license; that the DEA improperly withheld\n\nthe issuance of a Maine-specific DEA registration number; that\n\nJoAnn Masar, a DEA agent, informed him that a permanent Maine\n\nmedical license was necessary in order to receive a Maine-specific\n\nDEA    number;5   that   this   information    was    incorrect;    and   that,\n\ntherefore, he had no choice but to use another physician's name and\n\nDEA number to prescribe the benzodiazepine that his patients\n\nneeded.\n\n            This evidence is inadequate to satisfy the defendant's\n\nentry-level burden of showing improper inducement.                 Taking that\n\nevidence in the light most flattering to the defendant, the most\n\n\n\n       5\n      The government contends that any conversation between Masar\nand the defendant occurred after the defendant had forged Keefe's\nname and DEA number. Given the reasoning through which we resolve\nthe entrapment issue, we need not deal with this chronological\ndispute.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthat can be said is that Masar's incorrect information and the\n\nDEA's improper withholding of a Maine-specific DEA number were \"but\n\nfor\" causes of the later criminal conduct.             That is not enough: the\n\ntort   concept   of   \"but   for\"    causation       does   not   constitute   the\n\nappropriate test for inducement, and that concept is ultimately too\n\nattenuated   a   link   on   which    to     hinge    an    entrapment   defense.\n\nImproper inducement requires a showing not only that the government\n\nafforded a defendant an opportunity to commit a crime but also that\n\nit brought to bear \"something more — something akin to excessive\n\npressure, threats, or the exploitation of an unfair advantage.\"\n\nRamos-Paulino, 488 F.3d at 462; see also Sorrells v. United States,\n\n287 U.S. 435, 454 (1932) (Roberts, J., concurring) (defining\n\nentrapment as \"the conception and planning of an offense by an\n\nofficer, and his procurement of its commission by one who would not\n\nhave perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion, or fraud\n\nof the officer\").\n\n           In this instance, the defendant's evidence does not even\n\nshow that the government furnished him with an opportunity to\n\ncommit a crime, much less that the government took unfair advantage\n\nof him. We cannot tease from the defendant's proffer anything that\n\nmight reasonably be expected to encourage an individual to engage\n\nin criminality. See, e.g., Gamache, 156 F.3d at 9 (explaining that\n\ngovernment action must \"create[] a risk of causing an otherwise\n\nunwilling person to commit the crime charged\").                     Even if the\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fdefendant was fed incorrect information and the issuance of a DEA\n\nnumber was wrongfully withheld, there is simply no evidence that\n\nMasar ever urged or instructed the defendant, nor even hinted to\n\nhim, that he should try to evade the law either by using another\n\nphysician's DEA number or by forging another physician's signature.\n\n          The archetypical entrapment case involves a government\n\n\"sting\" operation, see, e.g., United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d\n\n955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994), or some other situation in which the\n\ngovernment procures the defendant's commission of a crime, see,\n\ne.g., Sorrells, 287 U.S. at 454, or at least a situation in which\n\nthe government provides material assistance to the defendant in\n\norder to enable him to commit a crime, see, e.g., United States v.\n\nRussell, 411 U.S. 423, 427 (1973).     This case does not come close\n\nto fitting that mold.\n\n          At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that\n\neven if the government provided the defendant with the opportunity\n\nto commit a crime — which it did not — the necessary \"plus\" factor\n\nis entirely lacking.    There is no evidence of excessive pressure,\n\nthreats, or unfair exploitation on the government's part. There is\n\nno suggestion that the government used coercive tactics, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Stanton, 973 F.2d 608, 610 (8th Cir. 1992);\n\nemployed any hard-sell rhetoric or dogged insistence, see, e.g.,\n\nRodríguez, 858 F.2d at 815-16; or engaged in any arm-twisting or\n\nexploitation of economic need, see, e.g., Sherman v. United States,\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f356 U.S. 369, 376 (1958).        While such evidence, standing alone,\n\nwould be insufficient to demonstrate improper inducement, it may in\n\ncertain circumstances be a starting place for mounting a colorable\n\nshowing of inducement.\n\n          To   be   sure,   we    have    suggested    that,   in   certain\n\ncircumstances, a government agent's false statements might sustain\n\na finding of improper inducement. See Gamache, 156 F.3d at 9.          But\n\nin the classic entrapment context, false statements constitute\n\nimproper inducement only when they have the purpose or effect of\n\npreying on the sympathy, weakness, or goodwill of a defendant.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Sullivan, 919 F.2d 1403, 1419 & n.21\n\n(10th Cir. 1990) (telling defendant that undercover agent was\n\nsuicidal and in desperate need of money).        We discern no proof of\n\nany such manipulative behavior here.\n\n          We have said enough on this score.6         We conclude, without\n\nserious question, that the entrapment defense cobbled together here\n\nwas a mirage and that the district court appropriately declined to\n\ninstruct the jury on it.\n\n                       C.   Cross-Examination.\n\n          The defendant further complains that the district court\n\nviolated Rules 403 and 608(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence when\n\n\n\n     6\n      Since we find that the defendant failed to carry his entry-\nlevel burden as to the first prong of the entrapment defense, we\nneed not inquire as to whether the record contains any evidence\nshowing a lack of predisposition.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fit allowed the government to cross-examine him, over objection,\n\nabout his responses to certain questions when applying for medical\n\nlicensure in Maine.        We review the disputed ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 500 F.3d 48, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 557\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            We set the stage.        The defendant applied for a Maine\n\nmedical license in 2001 and again in 2002.                 As part of each\n\napplication, he answered \"no\" to the following question: \"have you\n\nEVER been charged, summonsed, indicted, arrested or convicted of\n\nany criminal offense, including motor vehicle offenses, but not\n\nincluding     minor   traffic   or   parking       violations?\"7      Evidence\n\navailable to the government suggested that the defendant had been\n\narrested in 1965 and again in 1970 for drug-related offenses\n\n(although neither arrest culminated in a conviction).\n\n            At trial, the defendant testified in his own behalf. The\n\ngovernment sought to cross-examine him about these answers, seeking\n\nto cast doubt upon his credibility.            The defendant objected and\n\nmoved in limine to exclude any such inquiry.              While he admitted\n\nthat he had been arrested, he asserted that the arrests had been\n\nexpunged    and    that,   therefore,   he   had    answered   the   questions\n\n\n     7\n      We quote this question substantially as it appears in the\ntranscript and in other filings, disregarding minor linguistic\nvariations. We note that the record on appeal does not contain the\noriginal applications (and, thus, does not contain the actual\nquestion).\n\n                                     -19-\n\ftruthfully and in line with the advice of counsel.              In support of\n\nthis assertion, he submitted an affidavit from his Illinois lawyer\n\nattesting that, to the best of the lawyer's recollection, the\n\narrests had been expunged.          The defendant also argued, in the\n\nalternative, that any probative value that might be derived from\n\nthe cross-examination would pale in comparison to the prejudice\n\nthat would accrue.\n\n            The district court concluded that the carefully worded\n\naffidavit    provided   \"no    convincing      ground\"     to   support     the\n\ndefendant's professed belief that the arrests had vanished and did\n\nnot have to be revealed on the license applications.             Then, in the\n\nexercise of its discretion, the court ruled that the government\n\ncould cross-examine the defendant about his arrest-related answers.\n\nWithal, the court precluded the government from introducing the\n\narrest records themselves into evidence.          The defendant ascribes\n\nerror to the former ruling.\n\n            The   touchstone   of   our    analysis   is   Federal   Rule   of\n\nEvidence 608(b), which pretermits the use of extrinsic evidence of\n\nspecific instances of a witness's conduct for the purpose of\n\nbolstering or attacking the witness's credibility.              Despite this\n\ngeneral proscription, the rule explicitly grants district courts\n\ndiscretion to allow cross-examination of a witness about specific\n\ninstances of misconduct as long as those instances are probative of\n\nhis \"character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\"\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f              Typically, a trial court's discretion to determine the\n\nscope   and    extent    of   cross-examination   is   broad.   See,   e.g.,\n\nDelaware v. Van Ardsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986); United States\n\nv. Beltrán, 761 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1985).             That discretion is\n\nnonetheless subject to the overarching need to balance probative\n\nworth against prejudicial impact.         See United States v. Simonelli,\n\n237 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2001); Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) advisory\n\ncommittee notes. That balancing function is spelled out in Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 403, which states in pertinent part that relevant\n\nevidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\n\nissues, or misleading the jury.\"\n\n              Rule     403    judgments     are   typically     battlefield\n\ndeterminations, and great deference is owed to the trial court's\n\nsuperior coign of vantage.         \"Only rarely — and in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances — will we, from the vista of a cold\n\nappellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment\n\nconcerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair\n\neffect.\"      Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).\n\n              In this instance, we discern no abuse of discretion.\n\nAfter all, a witness's willingness to lie to the government in an\n\napplication for a license is highly probative of his character for\n\ntruthfulness.        See, e.g., United States v. Carlin, 698 F.2d 1133,\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f1137 (11th Cir. 1983); see also United States v. Tse, 375 F.3d 148,\n\n166 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing false statements in employment\n\napplication).\n\n            Here, moreover, temporal considerations favored use of\n\nthe evidence; the defendant's answers were not remote in time but,\n\nrather, were roughly contemporaneous with the criminal conduct with\n\nwhich he had been charged.8    See Simonelli, 237 F.3d at 23.     And,\n\nfinally, the central factual issue at trial revolved around the\n\ndefendant's intent.    Hence, his credibility was highly relevant to\n\nthe outcome of the case.    See United States v. Mateos-Sánchez, 864\n\nF.2d 232, 237 (1st Cir. 1988).     Taking all of these factors into\n\naccount, the district court's determination that the defendant's\n\nuntruthful answers in his license applications were fair game for\n\ncross-examination   falls   comfortably   within   the   encincture   of\n\njudicial discretion.\n\n            This brings us to the question of prejudice.      While we\n\nagree with the defendant that the revelation of his prior arrests\n\ncarried with it some potential for untoward effect, we do not\n\nbelieve that effect was so stark as to compel the exclusion of the\n\nevidence.   We long have recognized that \"all evidence is meant to\n\n\n     8\n      The defendant attempts to use the gap between the dates of\nthe unreported arrests and the time of trial as a basis for a\nfinding that temporal considerations cut the other way.       This\ntactic is disingenuous. The relevant issue at trial was whether\nthe defendant had lied on his license applications in 2001 and\n2002. Consequently, the relevant temporal span is the time between\nthose answers and the occurrence of the alleged criminal acts.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fbe prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\"\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (emphasis in original).        Thus, the court appropriately could\n\ndiscount whatever prejudice flowed from the impeaching effect of\n\nthe   answers.     Beyond    that,   the    answers      themselves    were   not\n\nparticularly     inflammatory,    and    the     court   did   not   permit   the\n\ngovernment to elicit any tawdry details.\n\n            It is also noteworthy that the court took affirmative\n\nsteps to minimize any risk of unfair prejudice.                For example, it\n\nallowed   the    defendant   to   tell     the    jury   about   the   ultimate\n\ndisposition of the arrests and about his belief that they had been\n\nexpunged.       Furthermore, the court offered to give a limiting\n\ninstruction; that the defendant eschewed this course does not\n\nminimize the value of the court's offer.           Given the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we find unconvincing the argument that the court\n\ncommitted a palpable error in judgment in allowing the cross-\n\nexamination to proceed.\n\n            The defendant cites our decision in United States v. Tse\n\nfor the proposition that cross-examining a witness about responses\n\nto questions included in an employment application violated Rule\n\n608(b).   This argument misreads Tse, in which the court permitted\n\nthe defendant to cross-examine a government witness regarding his\n\nanswers in an employment application.            375 F.3d at 166.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f           Tse also upheld the trial court's discretion to deny the\n\ndefendant the opportunity to refresh the witness's recollection by\n\nshowing   him   the   application,   itself   excludable   as   extrinsic\n\nevidence under Rule 608(b).       See id.     From this portion of the\n\nopinion, the defendant selectively quotes out of context dicta to\n\nthe effect that \"[u]sing the employment application [to impeach the\n\nwitness] would be a clear violation of Rule 608(b).\" Id. (dictum).\n\n           The defendant misreads this as suggesting a barrier to\n\nany and all use of evidence deemed \"extrinsic\" under Rule 608(b) to\n\nrefresh a witness's recollection.         The statement can equally as\n\nwell be read to articulate the less controversial proposition that\n\nintroducing such extrinsic evidence for the purpose of proving the\n\nwitness's truthfulness (as opposed to using it merely to refresh\n\nthe witness's memory) would violate the express prohibition of Rule\n\n608(b).\n\n           We believe the latter reading is sounder and correctly\n\ncaptures the meaning of the Tse court.        For one thing, Rule 612,\n\nrather than rule 608(b), governs the use of evidence to refresh a\n\nwitness's recollection.       That rule never has been construed to\n\nrequire that a writing used to refresh a witness's recollection\n\nmust be independently admissible into evidence. The case law holds\n\nto the contrary.      See, e.g., United States v. Kusek, 844 F.2d 942,\n\n949 (2d Cir. 1988); United States v. Scott, 701 F.2d 1340, 1346\n\n(11th Cir. 1983).       The commentators agree.    See, e.g., Jack B.\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fWeinstein & Margaret A. Berger, 4 Weinstein's Federal Evidence §\n\n612.03[3][b], at 612-14 (2d ed. 2007).\n\n           For another thing, as stated in a leading treatise,\n\n\"[w]hile extrinsic evidence in the form of documents may not be\n\nadmitted   under   Rule   608(b)   to   impeach,    nothing    in    that   rule\n\nprohibits the use of documents merely to refresh the recollection\n\nof a witness who is the target of impeachment.\"           28 Charles Alan\n\nWright & Victor James Gold, Federal Practice & Procedure: Evidence\n\n§ 6117, at 12 (1993 & Supp. 2007) (citing United States v.\n\nChevalier, 1 F.3d 581, 584 n.2 (7th Cir. 1993)).              Thus, Tse does\n\nnot help the defendant here.\n\n                             D.    Sentencing.\n\n           In sentencing the defendant, the district court placed\n\nhim in criminal history category I, set his base offense level at\n\n10, and applied two-level enhancements for abuse of a position of\n\ntrust and obstruction of justice, see USSG §§3B1.3, 3C1.1.                  The\n\ncourt then departed downward, USSG §5K2.0, on the basis that the\n\ndefendant's   actions     were    outside   the    heartland    of    offenses\n\ntypically occurring under the principal statute of conviction, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 843(a)(3).       The court sentenced the defendant to a six-\n\nmonth term of immurement and a two-year term of supervised release.\n\n           On appeal, the defendant protests only the obstruction of\n\njustice enhancement. His protestation targets the district court's\n\nfinding that he committed perjury at trial (and, thus, obstructed\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fjustice).       Because this is a direct challenge to a factual finding\n\nmade at sentencing, our review is for clear error.                   See United\n\nStates v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 314 (1st Cir. 2006); United States\n\nv. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 229 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            The applicable sentencing guideline requires a two-level\n\nincrease in a defendant's offense level if the sentencing court\n\nfinds that \"the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or\n\nattempted to obstruct or impede the administration of justice with\n\nrespect to the investigation, prosecution, for sentencing of the\n\ninstant offense of conviction.\" USSG §3C1.1. A finding of perjury\n\nfalls within the purview of this guideline.               See United States v.\n\nDunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 92-94 (1993); USSG §3C1.1, cmt. n.4(b).\n\n            Perjury consists of false testimony under oath concerning\n\na matter material to the proceeding, as long as the testimony is\n\ngiven \"with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather\n\nthan   as   a    result   of    confusion,     mistake,   or    faulty    memory.\"\n\nDunnigan, 507 U.S. at 94 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1621(1)).                   To impose\n\nan obstruction of justice enhancement premised on perjury, a\n\nsentencing court must make an independent finding that the elements\n\nof perjury have been satisfied.          Id. at 95; Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 314.\n\n            The     record     makes   pellucid   that    the   district    court\n\nfollowed these teachings.              In a presentence order, the court\n\ncarefully evaluated the defendant's veracity, identified material\n\ninconsistencies in his trial testimony, and concluded that he had\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fprevaricated.          In the process, the court expressly found that the\n\nfabricated portions of the defendant's testimony were part and\n\nparcel of \"a willfully false reconstruction\" of what had transpired\n\nand could not \"be attributed to confusion, mistake, or faulty\n\nmemory.\"\n\n                  In particular, the court found irreconcilable differences\n\nbetween the defendant's testimony and Keefe's testimony as to\n\nwhether Keefe had authorized the defendant to coopt his name and\n\nDEA number.9         This was no garden-variety testimonial conflict about\n\na peripheral matter but, rather, a head-on clash about a central\n\nissue in the case.             Where, as here, the sentencing judge has\n\npresided over the trial, we must allow him reasonable latitude for\n\ncredibility assessments.          See Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 314-15; Akitoye,\n\n923 F.2d at 228; see also United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508\n\n(1st       Cir.    1990)   (explaining    that,    insofar   as   factfinding   is\n\nconcerned,          \"the   sentencing    court's    choice   among   supportable\n\nalternatives cannot be clearly erroneous\").\n\n\n\n\n       9\n       While it would be improper to impose an obstruction of\njustice enhancement \"merely . . . because the jury rejects the\ndefendant's explanation of the facts and finds him guilty,\" Gobbi,\n471 F.3d at 314, that verdict nonetheless can provide support for\nthe sentencing court's independent findings, see United States v.\nVillarmán-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding a\nfinding of perjury in part because the jury \"must perforce have\ndetermined that [the defendant's] testimony was false\"). Here, the\ncourt noted that the jury must have chosen to credit Keefe's\naccount. The jury's view thus supported the district court's\nrationale. See id.\n\n                                         -27-\n\f            The defendant strives to weaken this robust finding by\n\nsuggesting that there was no direct conflict between his testimony\n\nand Keefe's.    This suggestion elevates hairsplitting to an art\n\nform.   A review of the record leaves no doubt about the direct and\n\ninescapable contradiction between these two men concerning the\n\ndefendant's use of Keefe's name and DEA number.    Keefe testified\n\nunequivocally that he did not give the defendant permission to use\n\nhis name and DEA number in issuing prescriptions; the defendant\n\ntestified to the contrary.    The district court acted within its\n\nproper province in concluding that Keefe's testimony was truthful\n\nand that the defendant's was not.\n\n            The defendant offers two last arguments.      First, he\n\ncautions that in evaluating his trial testimony the district court\n\nhad to afford him \"the benefit of any plausible doubt.\"   Gobbi, 471\n\nF.3d at 314.   That is true as far as it goes — but it does not go\n\nvery far.\n\n            This cautionary language to which the defendant adverts\n\n\"does not mandate the resolution of every conflict in testimony in\n\nfavor of the defendant.\"   United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d\n\n959, 969 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting United States v. Wallace, 904\n\nF.2d 603, 605 (11th Cir. 1990)).       It merely resolves in the\n\ndefendant's favor \"those conflicts about which the judge, after\n\nweighing the evidence, has no firm conviction.\"        Id. (quoting\n\n\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fWallace, 904 F.2d at 605).     The firmness of the sentencing court's\n\nconviction here scarcely can be questioned.\n\n            Finally,   the   defendant   suggests   that   upholding   an\n\nobstruction of justice enhancement may chill a criminal defendant's\n\nexercise of his constitutional right to testify.       This suggestion\n\nis baseless: sentencing enhancements for obstruction of justice\n\npremised on perjurious trial testimony do not give rise to Sixth\n\nAmendment concerns.     See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 96; Akitoye, 923\n\nF.2d at 228.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.       For aught that appears, the\n\ndefendant was fairly tried, fairly convicted, and fairly sentenced.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f",

The admonition \"physician,\n\nheal thyself\" is a biblical proverb, Luke 4:23 (King James),\n\nsuggesting that people should address their own failings.               In the\n\ncase at hand, this admonition has both literal and figurative\n\napplication.     The tale follows.\n\n             Mark S. Shinderman, M.D., is a physician specializing in\n\npsychiatry and the treatment of addiction.           The federal government\n\nindicted him on a gallimaufry of criminal charges stemming from his\n\nunauthorized use of another doctor's name and Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) registration number.            A jury convicted him on\n\nmany of those charges.\n\n             On appeal, the defendant challenges both his convictions\n\nand his sentence.       He advances four assignments of error, which\n\nimpugn (i) the district court's refusal to apply the exclusionary\n\nrule    to   evidence   allegedly   obtained    in    violation   of   federal\n\nregulations designed to protect the confidentiality of substance\n\nabuse     treatment   records,   (ii)   the   foreclosure    of   a    proposed\n\nentrapment defense, (iii) an evidentiary ruling, and (iv) the use\n\nof   an   obstruction    of   justice   enhancement     during    sentencing.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that each and all of these animadversions\n\nlack merit, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           We rehearse here only those facts that are necessary to\n\nplace this appeal in perspective.          Other facts are added in our\n\nsubsequent discussion of particular issues.\n\n           Following a dramatic increase in drug-overdose deaths in\n\nMaine, the United States Department of Health and Human Services\n\n(HHS) began investigating possible links between this spike in\n\nmortality and health-care clinics specializing in the treatment of\n\ndrug addiction.    One of the providers scrutinized in the course of\n\nthis administrative inquiry was CAP Quality Care, a high-dose\n\nmethadone treatment clinic located in Westbrook, Maine.\n\n           The   defendant,   an   advocate     of   the   combined     use   of\n\nmethadone and benzodiazepine in the treatment of patients addicted\n\nto opiates, served as CAP's sponsor and national medical director.\n\nFederal law stipulates that any doctor who prescribes a controlled\n\nsubstance must possess a state-specific DEA registration number.\n\nSee 21 U.S.C. § 822(a), (e).              When CAP opened in 2001, the\n\ndefendant had only an Illinois medical license and DEA number\n\n(although he had obtained a temporary license to practice medicine\n\nin Maine).\n\n           In the course of HHS's administrative inquiry into CAP's\n\naffairs, its investigators took a hard look at the defendant's\n\nprescription-writing practices. The defendant apparently attempted\n\nto write prescriptions for controlled substances using his Illinois\n\nDEA   number.     After   Maine    pharmacies    refused    to   fill    those\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fprescriptions, he started writing benzodiazepine prescriptions\n\nunder the name and Maine-specific DEA number of Dr. Steven Keefe,\n\na fully credentialled physician affiliated with CAP.\n\n            At that point, the inquiry intensified. The government's\n\nnext step was to subpoena CAP's Medicaid records.               Under statutes\n\nand   regulations    governing    the     disclosure     of   substance    abuse\n\ntreatment records, the government was required to obtain court\n\nauthorization to use the subpoenaed documents for prosecutorial\n\npurposes.      See 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(C); 42 C.F.R. § 2.66(a).\n\n            On April 24, 2003 — shortly after the government launched\n\na   criminal    investigation    aimed    at   the   defendant   —   a   federal\n\nmagistrate judge granted an ex parte motion seeking leave to\n\ndisclose to federal law enforcement personnel the Medicaid records\n\ngarnered    from   CAP   pursuant    to     HHS's    original   administrative\n\nsubpoena.      On August 22, the magistrate judge granted a second ex\n\nparte motion seeking authorization to release CAP patient treatment\n\nrecords to the prosecutors.         On September 5, the magistrate judge\n\ngranted yet a third ex parte motion; this motion sought access to\n\nmedical records seized in the course of executing a search warrant.\n\n            In each instance, the magistrate judge found good cause\n\nfor disclosure and honored the government's supplication that he\n\ndelay notice of the order granting the motion to avoid compromising\n\nthe criminal investigation.          To that end, the magistrate judge\n\nmaintained the orders under seal and decreed that notice to the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdefendant and all other affected parties could be deferred for up\n\nto ninety days.1                The    record contains copies of the notices\n\nsubsequently sent by the government to the defendant as well as an\n\naffidavit        from    an     HHS    official      attesting    that   notice      of   the\n\nissuance     of    the        disclosure    orders      had   been    given     within    the\n\nallotted time frame.\n\n             The dénouement came much later. On August 25, 2005 — the\n\nsame date on which the government filed a civil action against CAP\n\nfor, among other things, Medicaid fraud — a federal grand jury\n\nhanded up a sixty-eight count indictment.                        The first twenty-five\n\ncounts      charged       the     defendant       with     unlawful      use    of   a    DEA\n\nregistration number issued to another physician, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 843(a)(2).             Counts 26 through 50 charged him with aiding\n\nand    abetting         the    acquisition        of   a   controlled       substance      by\n\nmisrepresentation, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(3).                            Counts\n\n51    and   52    charged        him    with   falsifying        pharmacy      records,    in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(4)(A).                        The last sixteen counts\n\ncharged him with making false statements related to the delivery of\n\nor payment for health-care benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1035(a)(2).\n\n             The defendant filed a host of motions, seeking among\n\nother things to suppress the fruits of the administrative subpoenas\n\n\n       1\n      On July 20, 2003, the magistrate judge granted the government\nan additional sixty days within which to furnish notice of the\nissuance of the April 24 disclosure order.\n\n                                               -5-\n\fand the search.        Pertinently, he argued that all of the evidence\n\ndisclosed in pursuance of the ex parte court orders should be\n\nexcluded because the government had flouted the notice requirements\n\nimposed by federal substance abuse treatment regulations.\n\n             The district court found that the reprieve for the giving\n\nof notice granted by the magistrate judge had no legal basis and\n\nthat the defendant should have been given notice as soon as the\n\npatient records were disclosed to prosecutors.               United States v.\n\nShinderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414144/united-states-v-shinderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154 (D. Me. 2006).                 The court\n\nnevertheless refused to suppress the evidence, reasoning that\n\nsuppression was too drastic a remedy.             Id.\n\n             The trial lasted for nearly two weeks.           A parade of CAP\n\npatients testified to having seen the defendant write Keefe's name\n\nand   DEA    number    on    controlled     substance   prescriptions.     The\n\ncenterpiece of the government's case was Keefe's testimony that,\n\nwhile   he    agreed    to     provide     the   defendant   with   pre-signed\n\nprescription blanks, he never authorized the defendant to sign his\n\nname or use his DEA number.              In the defense case, the defendant\n\ntestified that Keefe had given him such permission.\n\n             After a day and a half of deliberations, the jury found\n\nthe   defendant   guilty      on   the    twenty-five   counts   that   alleged\n\nunlawful use of a DEA number belonging to another physician,\n\ntwenty-four of the twenty-five aiding and abetting counts, both\n\ncounts dealing with falsification of pharmacy records, and seven of\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe sixteen false statement counts.          The government voluntarily\n\ndismissed the remaining aiding and abetting count, and the jury\n\nacquitted the defendant on nine of the false statement counts.\n\n           The   sentencing    phase   followed.       The    district   court\n\napplied enhancements for obstruction of justice and abuse of a\n\nposition of trust, and set the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at\n\n15 to 21 months.     The court then departed downward and imposed a\n\nsix-month incarcerative sentence.         This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We separate the defendant's asseverational array into its\n\nfour component parts and treat those parts sequentially.\n\n                              A. Suppression.\n\n           In the interest of guaranteeing the efficacy of substance\n\nabuse treatment programs, Congress has directed that all substance\n\nabuse treatment records be kept confidential.                See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n290dd-2(a).      Disclosure   is   permitted    only   in    narrow   sets   of\n\ncircumstances.    These include consent, id. § 290dd-2(b)(1); audit,\n\nid. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(B); and court order, id. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(C).\n\n           Applicable regulations confirm and elaborate upon the\n\nstatute's commitment to confidentiality.           See 42 C.F.R. §§ 2.1-\n\n2.67. The regulations warn that such records \"may be disclosed or\n\nused only as permitted by these regulations and may not otherwise\n\nbe disclosed or used in any civil, criminal, administrative, or\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\flegislative proceedings conducted by any Federal, State, or local\n\nauthority.\"    Id. § 2.13.\n\n           The regulatory mosaic provides safeguards attendant to\n\nthe disclosure and use of substance abuse treatment records in\n\nconnection with a criminal case.          See id. §§ 2.65-2.67.          To\n\ninvestigate or prosecute either a substance abuse \"program\" or a\n\n\"person holding the records,\" law enforcement personnel must obtain\n\na court order premised upon a showing of good cause, id. § 2.66(c)\n\n(cross-referencing    §   2.64(d)-(e)),    and   must   employ    certain\n\nprophylactic   measures   to   shield   patients'   identities,    id.    §\n\n2.66(d).   While a court may issue a disclosure order without any\n\nparticular form of prior notice, the regulations require that \"upon\n\nimplementation of an order\" the program, the person holding the\n\nrecords, and any patient whose records are disclosed — a group whom\n\nwe shall call \"the protected parties\" — \"must be afforded an\n\nopportunity to seek revocation or amendment of that order.\"         Id. §\n\n2.66(b).\n\n           The district court found that the defendant (as the\n\nsponsor of CAP) qualified as a \"program\" for purposes of this\n\nregulation and, thus, was entitled to seek revocation or amendment\n\nof the ex parte disclosure orders issued by the magistrate judge.2\n\n\n     2\n      The term \"program\" includes \"an individual or entity . . .\nwho holds itself out as providing, and provides, alcohol or drug\nabuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment.\" 42 C.F.R.\n§ 2.11. We assume arguendo (and neither review nor pass upon) the\ncorrectness of the district court's holding that the defendant\n\n                                  -8-\n\fShinderman, 432 F. Supp. 2d at 154.           Building on this foundation,\n\nthe court ruled that the \"opportunity\" to revoke or amend each\n\norder arose immediately upon disclosure of the records in question\n\nto   law   enforcement    personnel,    that    the       regulations   mandated\n\nimmediate notice to the protected parties at that juncture, and\n\nthat the window of delay countenanced by the magistrate judge\n\nviolated section 2.66(b).       Id.   The court concluded, however, that\n\nsince neither bad faith nor prejudice to the defendant existed,\n\nsuppression \"was too drastic a remedy.\"             Id.\n\n            Before us, the defendant claims that once the district\n\ncourt found a regulatory violation, another section of the rules —\n\n42 C.F.R. § 2.13 — required the suppression of any evidence\n\ndisclosed    pursuant    to   the   tainted    order.        His   claim    raises\n\npotentially    important      questions     anent     the     meaning      of   the\n\nregulations and the appropriate use of the exclusionary rule to\n\naddress a regulatory infraction.              When all is said and done,\n\nhowever, we need not reach those questions; after all, \"[w]e are\n\nnot wedded to the lower court's rationale, but, rather, may affirm\n\nits order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.\"\n\nInterGen N.V. v. Grina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200660\"><a href=\"/opinion/200660/intergen-n-v-v-grina/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            In this case, any application of the exclusionary rule\n\nmust be premised on an underlying regulatory violation — and we\n\n\n\nqualifies under this rubric.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdiscern none.       The regulation at issue, 42 C.F.R. § 2.66(b), is\n\nentitled \"[n]otice not required.\"                   Its principal purpose is to\n\ninvest the court with discretion to grant disclosure orders ex\n\nparte, that is, without notice to any protected party.                         It is thus\n\napparent that neither the text nor the purpose of the regulation\n\nsupports the notion that a delay in notice is per se unlawful.\n\n              To be sure, the regulation does direct that protected\n\nparties be afforded an opportunity to revoke or amend any judicial\n\ndisclosure     order.         But   in    setting     forth      that   directive,      the\n\nregulation nowhere makes explicit a duty to notify the protected\n\nparties at a particular point in time.                        As we read its plain\n\nlanguage, section 2.66(b) requires only that protected parties be\n\ngiven    a    chance     to    revoke     or    amend      the    order      \"upon    [its]\n\nimplementation.\" It would be perverse to graft an immediate notice\n\nrequirement onto a regulation that explicitly grants district\n\ncourts the discretion to relax notification requirements.\n\n              In our view, section 2.66(b) should be construed as it is\n\nwritten.     Its text demands that a court issuing a disclosure order\n\nafford    protected      parties      with     an   opportunity         to   contest    the\n\nunderlying validity and scope of the disclosure — nothing more. Of\n\ncourse,      that   opportunity       must     be    meaningful;        otherwise,      the\n\nregulation would hold out only an empty promise.                               With this\n\nqualification       in    mind      and   with      full    realization        that    each\n\nindividual case depends largely on context, we are confident that\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fnotice of a disclosure order does not always have to be coterminous\n\nwith the entry of the order.\n\n            An opportunity to challenge a judicial decree does not\n\nhave to arise instantaneously in order to be meaningful. Analogies\n\nare plentiful.    Indeed, it is commonplace for a court to delay\n\nnotice of a search or seizure in order to protect the integrity of\n\na criminal investigation.          See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d)\n\n(allowing district court to withhold notice from a person subject\n\nto a wiretap for up to ninety days after the termination of the\n\nunderlying    order);    id.   §   3103a(b)   (giving   district   courts\n\ndiscretion to delay any notice required in connection with the\n\nissuance of a search warrant intended to obtain evidence of a\n\ncriminal offense).      As long as the delay in notice does not erode\n\na protected party's right to challenge the order, we believe that\n\nsection 2.66(b) allows judges to exercise discretion as to the\n\ntiming and form of post-order notice.           Up to the point where\n\nprejudice looms, it makes no difference when the opportunity to\n\nseek the revocation or narrowing of a disclosure order arises.\n\n            This reading of section 2.66(b) does not eviscerate the\n\nconfidentiality protections afforded by the regulatory scheme.         A\n\ncourt can issue an ex parte disclosure order only after a finding\n\nof good cause.       See 42 C.F.R. § 2.66(c) (cross-referencing §\n\n2.64(d)).    Even then, no document released pursuant to such an\n\norder can be used to investigate or prosecute a patient.           Id. §\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f2.66(d)(2). In this vein, no public disclosure can be made without\n\nredaction of all patient-related information.             Id. § 2.66(d)(1).\n\nAnd, finally, all protected parties retain the right to challenge\n\nthe issuance of the order.           Given these features of section 2.66\n\nand its eschewal of pre-order notice, reading that regulation to\n\nrequire notice immediately upon release of the records to law\n\nenforcement personnel would seem to create a curious anomaly and,\n\nin the bargain, rein in the district court's normal discretion\n\nwithout advancing any significant interest in confidentiality.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the specifics of the\n\ninstant case.    The record makes manifest that the delay in notice\n\ndid not erode the defendant's ability to contest the validity and\n\nscope of the court orders.          The periods of delay authorized by the\n\nmagistrate judge were not unreasonable.               More importantly, the\n\ndistrict court found as a fact, at the hearing on the motion to\n\nsuppress,     that    the   delay    did    not   prejudice   the    defendant.\n\nShinderman,     432    F.   Supp.    2d    at   154-55.    That     finding   is\n\nunimpugnable: the defendant has identified no argument that he\n\ncould have employed immediately upon the issuance of a disclosure\n\norder that was adversely affected by a delay in notice.3\n\n\n     3\n      The absence of prejudice is unsurprising because section\n2.66(b) limits challenges \"to the presentation of evidence on the\nstatutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court\norder.\" We can perceive no argument based on those criteria that\nthe defendant might have lost in consequence of the delay. For\nexample, to issue a court order under section 2.66, a court must\nfind that \"[o]ther ways of obtaining the information are not\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            In all events, any profession of prejudice would be\n\nundone by the defendant's failure to move under section 2.66(b) for\n\nrevocation or amendment.             After all, once the government notified\n\nhim   of   the    issuance      of      the    disclosure   orders,      he       had    the\n\nopportunity      to    object      to   their    validity   and    scope      —    yet    he\n\nconspicuously failed to move for relief at that point. Instead, he\n\ndid nothing for almost two years and launched an effort to suppress\n\nthe fruits of the orders only after the grand jury handed up an\n\nindictment.\n\n            The short of it is that no prejudice occurred here.\n\nGiven this lack of prejudice, the magistrate judge's authorization\n\nof brief periods of delay in the giving of notice did not violate\n\nthe defendant's rights under the regulatory scheme.                           The lower\n\ncourt's    denial       of   the     defendant's     motion       to   suppress         was,\n\ntherefore, unexceptionable.\n\n                                   B.    Entrapment.\n\n            The       defendant      next     challenges    the    district       court's\n\nrefusal to instruct the jury on his envisioned entrapment defense.\n\nWe review a claim of erroneous failure to instruct a criminal jury\n\non a proffered theory of defense de novo.

We test the strength\n\nof this conclusion.\n\n            As    enunciated    at   trial,   the    defendant's    theory   of\n\nentrapment was configured as follows. He presented evidence which,\n\nif credited, was competent to show that he possessed only a\n\ntemporary Maine medical license; that the DEA improperly withheld\n\nthe issuance of a Maine-specific DEA registration number; that\n\nJoAnn Masar, a DEA agent, informed him that a permanent Maine\n\nmedical license was necessary in order to receive a Maine-specific\n\nDEA    number;5   that   this   information    was    incorrect;    and   that,\n\ntherefore, he had no choice but to use another physician's name and\n\nDEA number to prescribe the benzodiazepine that his patients\n\nneeded.\n\n            This evidence is inadequate to satisfy the defendant's\n\nentry-level burden of showing improper inducement.                 Taking that\n\nevidence in the light most flattering to the defendant, the most\n\n\n\n       5\n      The government contends that any conversation between Masar\nand the defendant occurred after the defendant had forged Keefe's\nname and DEA number. Given the reasoning through which we resolve\nthe entrapment issue, we need not deal with this chronological\ndispute.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthat can be said is that Masar's incorrect information and the\n\nDEA's improper withholding of a Maine-specific DEA number were \"but\n\nfor\" causes of the later criminal conduct.             That is not enough: the\n\ntort   concept   of   \"but   for\"    causation       does   not   constitute   the\n\nappropriate test for inducement, and that concept is ultimately too\n\nattenuated   a   link   on   which    to     hinge    an    entrapment   defense.\n\nImproper inducement requires a showing not only that the government\n\nafforded a defendant an opportunity to commit a crime but also that\n\nit brought to bear \"something more — something akin to excessive\n\npressure, threats, or the exploitation of an unfair advantage.\"\n\nRamos-Paulino, 488 F.3d at 462; see also Sorrells v.

The defendant applied for a Maine\n\nmedical license in 2001 and again in 2002.                 As part of each\n\napplication, he answered \"no\" to the following question: \"have you\n\nEVER been charged, summonsed, indicted, arrested or convicted of\n\nany criminal offense, including motor vehicle offenses, but not\n\nincluding     minor   traffic   or   parking       violations?\"7      Evidence\n\navailable to the government suggested that the defendant had been\n\narrested in 1965 and again in 1970 for drug-related offenses\n\n(although neither arrest culminated in a conviction).\n\n            At trial, the defendant testified in his own behalf. The\n\ngovernment sought to cross-examine him about these answers, seeking\n\nto cast doubt upon his credibility.            The defendant objected and\n\nmoved in limine to exclude any such inquiry.              While he admitted\n\nthat he had been arrested, he asserted that the arrests had been\n\nexpunged    and    that,   therefore,   he   had    answered   the   questions\n\n\n     7\n      We quote this question substantially as it appears in the\ntranscript and in other filings, disregarding minor linguistic\nvariations. We note that the record on appeal does not contain the\noriginal applications (and, thus, does not contain the actual\nquestion).\n\n                                     -19-\n\ftruthfully and in line with the advice of counsel.              In support of\n\nthis assertion, he submitted an affidavit from his Illinois lawyer\n\nattesting that, to the best of the lawyer's recollection, the\n\narrests had been expunged.          The defendant also argued, in the\n\nalternative, that any probative value that might be derived from\n\nthe cross-examination would pale in comparison to the prejudice\n\nthat would accrue.\n\n            The district court concluded that the carefully worded\n\naffidavit    provided   \"no    convincing      ground\"     to   support     the\n\ndefendant's professed belief that the arrests had vanished and did\n\nnot have to be revealed on the license applications.             Then, in the\n\nexercise of its discretion, the court ruled that the government\n\ncould cross-examine the defendant about his arrest-related answers.\n\nWithal, the court precluded the government from introducing the\n\narrest records themselves into evidence.          The defendant ascribes\n\nerror to the former ruling.\n\n            The   touchstone   of   our    analysis   is   Federal   Rule   of\n\nEvidence 608(b), which pretermits the use of extrinsic evidence of\n\nspecific instances of a witness's conduct for the purpose of\n\nbolstering or attacking the witness's credibility.              Despite this\n\ngeneral proscription, the rule explicitly grants district courts\n\ndiscretion to allow cross-examination of a witness about specific\n\ninstances of misconduct as long as those instances are probative of\n\nhis \"character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\"\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f              Typically, a trial court's discretion to determine the\n\nscope   and    extent    of   cross-examination   is   broad.

And,\n\nfinally, the central factual issue at trial revolved around the\n\ndefendant's intent.    Hence, his credibility was highly relevant to\n\nthe outcome of the case.    See United States v. Mateos-Sánchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516169\"><a href=\"/opinion/516169/united-states-v-manuel-l-mateos-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (1st Cir. 1988).     Taking all of these factors into\n\naccount, the district court's determination that the defendant's\n\nuntruthful answers in his license applications were fair game for\n\ncross-examination   falls   comfortably   within   the   encincture   of\n\njudicial discretion.\n\n            This brings us to the question of prejudice.      While we\n\nagree with the defendant that the revelation of his prior arrests\n\ncarried with it some potential for untoward effect, we do not\n\nbelieve that effect was so stark as to compel the exclusion of the\n\nevidence.   We long have recognized that \"all evidence is meant to\n\n\n     8\n      The defendant attempts to use the gap between the dates of\nthe unreported arrests and the time of trial as a basis for a\nfinding that temporal considerations cut the other way.       This\ntactic is disingenuous. The relevant issue at trial was whether\nthe defendant had lied on his license applications in 2001 and\n2002. Consequently, the relevant temporal span is the time between\nthose answers and the occurrence of the alleged criminal acts.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fbe prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.\"\n\nUnited States v.

Thus, the court appropriately could\n\ndiscount whatever prejudice flowed from the impeaching effect of\n\nthe   answers.     Beyond    that,   the    answers      themselves    were   not\n\nparticularly     inflammatory,    and    the     court   did   not   permit   the\n\ngovernment to elicit any tawdry details.\n\n            It is also noteworthy that the court took affirmative\n\nsteps to minimize any risk of unfair prejudice.                For example, it\n\nallowed   the    defendant   to   tell     the    jury   about   the   ultimate\n\ndisposition of the arrests and about his belief that they had been\n\nexpunged.       Furthermore, the court offered to give a limiting\n\ninstruction; that the defendant eschewed this course does not\n\nminimize the value of the court's offer.           Given the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we find unconvincing the argument that the court\n\ncommitted a palpable error in judgment in allowing the cross-\n\nexamination to proceed.\n\n            The defendant cites our decision in United States v. Tse\n\nfor the proposition that cross-examining a witness about responses\n\nto questions included in an employment application violated Rule\n\n608(b).   This argument misreads Tse, in which the court permitted\n\nthe defendant to cross-examine a government witness regarding his\n\nanswers in an employment application.            375 F.3d at 166.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f           Tse also upheld the trial court's discretion to deny the\n\ndefendant the opportunity to refresh the witness's recollection by\n\nshowing   him   the   application,   itself   excludable   as   extrinsic\n\nevidence under Rule 608(b).       See id.     From this portion of the\n\nopinion, the defendant selectively quotes out of context dicta to\n\nthe effect that \"[u]sing the employment application [to impeach the\n\nwitness] would be a clear violation of Rule 608(b).\" Id. (dictum).\n\n           The defendant misreads this as suggesting a barrier to\n\nany and all use of evidence deemed \"extrinsic\" under Rule 608(b) to\n\nrefresh a witness's recollection.         The statement can equally as\n\nwell be read to articulate the less controversial proposition that\n\nintroducing such extrinsic evidence for the purpose of proving the\n\nwitness's truthfulness (as opposed to using it merely to refresh\n\nthe witness's memory) would violate the express prohibition of Rule\n\n608(b).\n\n           We believe the latter reading is sounder and correctly\n\ncaptures the meaning of the Tse court.        For one thing, Rule 612,\n\nrather than rule 608(b), governs the use of evidence to refresh a\n\nwitness's recollection.       That rule never has been construed to\n\nrequire that a writing used to refresh a witness's recollection\n\nmust be independently admissible into evidence. The case law holds\n\nto the contrary.

Sentencing.\n\n           In sentencing the defendant, the district court placed\n\nhim in criminal history category I, set his base offense level at\n\n10, and applied two-level enhancements for abuse of a position of\n\ntrust and obstruction of justice, see USSG §§3B1.3, 3C1.1.                  The\n\ncourt then departed downward, USSG §5K2.0, on the basis that the\n\ndefendant's   actions     were    outside   the    heartland    of    offenses\n\ntypically occurring under the principal statute of conviction, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 843(a)(3).       The court sentenced the defendant to a six-\n\nmonth term of immurement and a two-year term of supervised release.\n\n           On appeal, the defendant protests only the obstruction of\n\njustice enhancement.

Id. at 95; Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 314.\n\n            The     record     makes   pellucid   that    the   district    court\n\nfollowed these teachings.
