AND SYLVIE S., INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF\n                       THEIR SON ANDREW S.,\n\n                       Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                  v.\n\n                     MANCHESTER SCHOOL DISTRICT,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n           [Hon. James R. Muirhead, Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Scott F. Johnson with whom Stein, Volinsky & Callaghan, PA was\non brief for appellants.\n     Dean B. Eggert with whom Jennifer L. Murphy and Wadleigh,\nStarr & Peters, PLLC were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 1, 2004\n\f           CAMPBELL,   Senior   Circuit   Judge.     Appealing   from   an\n\nadverse judgment of the district court, the parents of Andrew S.,\n\na disabled child who is attending a Catholic elementary school,\n\nassert that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n\n20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-87, is unconstitutional as applied to their son.\n\nWhile he, like other disabled children who go to private schools,\n\nreceives some educational services under federal and state law, he\n\nis not entitled by law to the panoply of services available to\n\ndisabled public school students under the rubric of free and\n\nappropriate public education (FAPE), nor to the due process hearing\n\nprovided to public school students alone.          Appellants argue that\n\nthe difference in treatment of their disabled son, who is attending\n\na religious school, from other disabled students, who are attending\n\npublic schools, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First\n\nAmendment to the federal constitution, the Due Process and Equal\n\nProtection clauses of the federal constitution, and the federal\n\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-1\n\nto -4.\n\n           The district court considered these contentions upon\n\ncross motions for summary judgment.       Rejecting appellants' claims,\n\nit granted the appellee Manchester School District's motion for\n\nsummary   judgment   and   denied   summary   judgment   to   appellants.\n\nGary S. v. Manchester Sch. Dist., 241 F. Supp. 2d 111, 123 (D.N.H.\n\n2003).\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            On appeal, appellants reiterate their contentions. After\n\ncarefully considering them, we find ourselves in agreement with\n\nthe district court.       In disposing of this appeal, we are also in\n\nsubstantial accord with much of the reasoning contained in its\n\npublished    Memorandum    and   Order.   Id.   at   117-123.      We   see,\n\ntherefore, no need to go over yet again all of the groundwork\n\ncovered there.    Nor need we restate the background facts already\n\ndescribed in detail in the district court's opinion.            Id. at 113-\n\n17.   We add, however, at some length, our own analysis of several\n\nof the key issues.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Appellants' lead argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred in determining that the federal law did not violate\n\nAndrew's and his parents' free exercise rights under the First\n\nAmendment.    They reject the district court's assertion that the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Employment Div. Dep't of Human Res. of\n\nOregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), is controlling.               Smith,\n\naccording to the district court, exempted most \"neutral laws of\n\ngeneral applicability\" from the compelling interest test.            In the\n\ndistrict court's view,\n\n            [A] law ordinarily need not be justified by a\n            compelling interest if it is \"neutral\" in that\n            it is not targeted at religiously motivated\n            conduct and \"generally applicable\" in that it\n            does not selectively burden religious conduct.\n            See Church of Lukumi Balalu Aye, Inc. v. City\n            of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532-35, 542-43\n            (1993).\n\n                                    -3-\n\fGary S., 241 F. Supp. 2d at 120-21.\n\n             IDEA and its regulations, the district court says, do not\n\ntarget religiously motivated conduct and is \"generally applicable\"\n\nin that it does not selectively burden religious conduct.                     For\n\nthese reasons, and because appellants' First Amendment claim is not\n\n\"hybrid,\" i.e. is not linked to a separate constitutional claim,\n\nthe district court found no violation of free exercise rights. Id.\n\nWe do not disagree.\n\n             Appellants reject the district court's analysis.                They\n\nask us to read Smith as limited to instances of socially harmful or\n\ncriminal conduct.     They point out that Smith did not purport to\n\noverrule the Supreme Court's holdings in the cases of Hobbie v.\n\nUnemployment Appeals Comm'n, 480 U.S. 136 (1987), Thomas v. Review\n\nBd. of the Indian Employment Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707 (1981), and\n\nSherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963).           In Hobbie and Sherbert,\n\nthe   complainants   were     denied    unemployment     benefits    following\n\ndischarge because of their religiously-based refusal to work on\n\nSaturday,     complainant's     religion's    Sabbath.      In     Thomas,    the\n\ncomplainant was denied unemployment benefits after discharge based\n\non    his   religiously-based    refusal     to   help   produce    armaments.\n\nHolding that the denial of a public benefit in these circumstances\n\nburdened plaintiff's religion, the Court ruled that, in order to\n\njustify an action having such an effect under the free-exercise\n\nclause, the government had to demonstrate that the withholding of\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe benefit served a compelling governmental interest and was the\n\nleast restrictive means to that end.                Hobbie, 480 U.S. at 141-45;\n\nThomas, at 718-20; Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403.                      Appellants have\n\nlikened the denial of educational disability benefits here to those\n\nsituations, asking us similarly to apply strict scrutiny.                      If we\n\ndo, appellants contend, we will find that Andrew's attendance at a\n\nCatholic     school      is    mandated    by     his   parents'    sincerely-held\n\nreligious beliefs.        No compelling governmental interest is served,\n\nthey say, by withholding from him the identical benefits granted to\n\nhis peers at public schools.\n\n             It    is    not    always    easy    to    predict    what   analytical\n\nframework the Supreme Court will apply to the various, factually\n\ndissimilar free exercise cases that arise.                    Smith rejected a free\n\nexercise claim involving the religiously-based use of peyote, an\n\nillegal substance.             Writing for five of the Justices, Justice\n\nScalia   endorsed        the    constitutionality        of    neutral,   generally\n\napplicable        laws   even    when     they    impinged      incidentally     upon\n\nindividual religious practices.             Smith, 494 U.S. at 881, 885.          The\n\nSmith majority expressly limited Hobbie, Thomas and Sherbert to the\n\nunemployment compensation field.                Smith, 494 U.S. 883-84.        While,\n\nas appellants point out, Justice Scalia in Smith also distinguished\n\nHobbie, Thomas and Sherbert on the narrower ground that the use of\n\npeyote was illegal, 494 U.S. at 876, the majority's overall message\n\nis unmistakably contrary to appellants' present argument that\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fHobbie, Thomas and Sherbert -- and, in particular, the \"compelling\n\ninterest\" test -- are broadly        applicable here.        Smith, insofar as\n\ncan be told from reading the Court's more recent precedent, remains\n\ngood law, albeit reflective when written of the thinking of a\n\nnarrow majority of justices, some of whom no longer serve.                   See,\n\ne.g.,   Watchtower   Bible   and    Tract   Soc'y     of   N.Y.    v.   Vill.   of\n\nStratton, 536 U.S. 150, 159 (2002) (discussing in dicta that lower\n\ncourt relied on Smith standard); City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S.\n\n507, 536 (1997) (invalidating statute that sought to \"restore the\n\ncompelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, . . .\n\nand Wisconsin v. Yoder,\" that had been rejected in Smith); Richard\n\nC. Schragger, The Role of the Local in the Doctrine and Discourse\n\nof   Religious   Liberty,    117    Harv.   L.    Rev.     1810,    1853   (2004)\n\n(describing the \"current Smith-Boerne doctrine\"); Notes, \"They Drew\n\na Circle That Shut Me In\":           The Free Exercise Implications of\n\nZelman v.   Simmons-Harris,        117   Harv.   L.   Rev.   919,    924   (2004)\n\n(\"Although the Smith rule has been criticized by several Justices\n\n- both at the time of the decision and subsequently - the Court has\n\nreiterated its commitment to the rule and rebuffed a congressional\n\nattempt to change it.\") (footnotes omitted); Ming Hsu Chen, Note,\n\nTwo Wrongs Make a Right: Hybrid Claims of Discrimination, 79\n\nN.Y.U.L. Rev. 685, 710 (2004) (\"Notwithstanding any of its flaws,\n\n[Smith] remains good law.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f              We also agree, for the reasons the district court stated,\n\nthat this case is not a \"hybrid\" one.        Hence, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court analyzed the case under the correct standard.\n\nGary S., 241 F. Supp. 2d at 121.\n\n              While we could perhaps leave the free exercise analysis\n\nthere,   an    even   more   fundamental   reason   causes   us    to   reject\n\nappellants'      First   Amendment   arguments.       We     cannot     accept\n\nappellants' contention that providing to all disabled attendees at\n\nprivate schools, both sectarian and secular, fewer benefits than\n\nthose granted to public school attendees is truly analogous to\n\ndenying unemployment benefits to persons fired because of their\n\nreligiously-inspired insistence upon celebrating the Sabbath or not\n\nproducing weapons.\n\n              The state unemployment benefits denied in Hobbie, Thomas,\n\nSherbert were public benefits, available to all.           Plaintiffs would\n\nhave received them had their religiously-motivated refusal to work\n\non a certain day or at a certain job not been erroneously viewed by\n\nlocal authorities as misconduct.       While appellants say their son's\n\nattendance at a Catholic school is likewise a religiously-motivated\n\nact, there is a basic difference.            He and they are not being\n\ndeprived of a generally available public benefit.                 Rather, the\n\nbenefits to which appellants lay claim under the First Amendment\n\nare benefits the federal government has earmarked solely for\n\nstudents enrolled in the nation's public schools -- benefits still\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\favailable for Andrew were he sent to a public school, though not\n\notherwise.   Since the early days of public education in this\n\ncountry, public financial aid has commonly been limited to public\n\nrather than independent schools.         While the parents of private\n\nschool attendees pay the same taxes as public school parents, the\n\nformer's tax money normally supports their own children's education\n\nonly if they transfer them to a public school.       To be sure, parents\n\nhave a protected right to send their children to private schools if\n\nthey so desire.   Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-35\n\n(1925) (state law compelling public school attendance \"unreasonably\n\ninterferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the\n\nupbringing and education of children under their control\"). But as\n\nthe very term \"private\" denotes, it is not ordinarily expected that\n\nsuch schools will be publicly funded, and there is no precedent\n\nrequiring such funding.    Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 462\n\n(1973) (in   affirming   \"right   of    private   schools   to   exist   and\n\noperate . . . [Pierce] said nothing of any supposed right of\n\nprivate or parochial schools to share with public schools in state\n\nlargesse, on an equal basis or otherwise.\").1\n\n\n\n     1\n      To be sure, the Court has recently permitted a state\nlegislature to provide for attendance at private schools at public\nexpense if it so desires. Cf. Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S.\n639, 662-63 (2002) (Ohio pilot school voucher program in which 96%\nof participating students in Cleveland received publicly-funded\ntuition aid to attend religious schools did not violate\nEstablishment Clause). But the voucher approach remains so far the\nexception rather than the rule in our nation as a whole.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          Given the traditional pattern that has so far prevailed\n\nof financing public education via the public schools, it would be\n\nunreasonable and inconsistent to premise a free exercise violation\n\nupon Congress's mere failure to provide to disabled children\n\nattending private religious schools the identical financial and\n\nother benefits it confers upon those attending public schools.\n\nUnlike unemployment benefits that are equally available to all,\n\nprivate school parents can have no legitimate expectancy that they\n\nor their children's schools will receive the same federal or state\n\nfinancial benefits provided to public schools.       Thus, the non-\n\nreceipt of equal funding and programmatic benefits cannot be said\n\nto impose any cognizable \"burden\" upon the religion of those\n\nchoosing to attend such schools.2   Persons opting to attend private\n\nschools, religious or otherwise, must accept the disadvantages as\n\nwell as any benefits offered by those schools. They cannot insist,\n\nas a matter of constitutional right, that the disadvantages be\n\n\n     2\n      We recognize the disability program provided to Andrew is not\none furnished directly by the Catholic school, but is instead run\nby public authorities for children who attend private school. But\nwe see no distinction in principle. It is, of course, also true\nthat the federal government and state are here actually funding\nprograms for disabled children such as Andrew, the complaint being\nnot the total absence of a program but that Andrew's program and\nrights are less comprehensive than those accorded to public school\nstudents. Again, we see no difference in principle. The federal\nand state governments are entitled to fund programs associated with\nprivate schools if they so desire, provided they do not run afoul\nof the Establishment Clause. Our point is not that such funding is\nnever allowed, but that it is not commonly expected in our society\nnor required.\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fcured by the provision of public funding.      It follows that denying\n\nthe   benefits   here,   to   which   appellants   have   no    cognizable\n\nentitlement, do not burden their free exercise rights.\n\n           Indeed, if we were to find a burden here on appellants'\n\nright of free exercise, it would follow logically that we should\n\nfind free exercise violations whenever a state, city or town\n\nrefuses to fund programs of other types at religious schools, at\n\nleast insofar as the absence of funding adversely affects students\n\nwith parents who believe their faith requires attendance at a\n\nreligious school.3   Yet, as noted supra, it is clear there is no\n\nfederal   constitutional      requirement   that   private     schools   be\n\npermitted to share with public schools in state largesse on an\n\nequal basis.     See, e.g., Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. at 462;\n\nHarris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 317-18 (1980); Maher v. Roe, 432\n\n\n\n      3\n      A further anomaly of such a holding would be that only\npersons such as appellants, with a declared religious belief in the\nnecessity of sending their children to private schools, would be\nentitled under the First Amendment to the funding sought. Other\nstudents, including those in secular private schools, would lack a\nright to such funding. Cf. Locke v. Davey, 124 S. Ct. 1307, 1315\n(2004) (stating, \"Given the historic and substantial state interest\nat issue, we therefore cannot conclude that the denial of funding\nfor vocational     religious   instruction   alone   is  inherently\nconstitutionally    suspect.        Without   a    presumption   of\nunconstitutionality, [respondent's] claim must fail. The State's\ninterest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is\nsubstantial and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively\nminor burden on [those involved in the funding program]. If any\nroom exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here. We\nneed not venture further into this difficult area in order to\nuphold the [funding program] as currently operated by the State of\nWashington.\").\n\n                                   -10-\n\fU.S. 464, 477 (1977); see also Locke, 124 S. Ct. at 1315; Strout v.\n\nAlbanese, 178 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating, \"fundamental\n\nright [to direct child's upbringing and education] does not require\n\nthe state to directly pay for a sectarian education\").\n\n          Accordingly, we see no basis for holding that the federal\n\ngovernment violates appellants' free exercise rights under the\n\nFirst Amendment by favoring disabled public school attendees in\n\nrespect to IDEA's programs and benefits.           In so doing, the federal\n\ngovernment    does   no   more   than    state   and   local   governments   do\n\neveryday by funding public school programs while providing lesser\n\nor, more likely, no funding to private schools, religious and\n\notherwise.      This methodology leaves all parents with ultimate\n\nrecourse to the public schools whenever the balance of services\n\nassociated with attendance at a private school appears to them to\n\nbe unsatisfactory; but the option thus available can necessitate\n\ntheir having to choose, as here, between alternatives each of which\n\nmay seem imperfect.       In any event, we cannot say that the federal\n\ngovernment's structuring of benefits here violates appellants' free\n\nexercise rights.\n\n                                        II.\n\n             Our above-stated conclusion that no cognizable burden on\n\nreligion has been caused by the federal government's failure to\n\nprovide to disabled children attending Catholic schools the same\n\nbenefits as it provides to disabled public school children applies\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwith equal force to appellants' RFRA claim.         42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-\n\n1(a) (stating in part, \"[g]overnment shall not substantially burden\n\na person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a\n\nrule of general applicability, . . . .\").\n\n          The   district   court    rejected   appellants'   RFRA   claim,\n\nfinding no burden upon religion given this court's Strout decision\n\nthat \"the Catholic faith does not require parents to educate their\n\nchildren in Catholic schools.\"        Gary S., 241 F. Supp. 2d at 122\n\n(citing Strout, 178 F.3d at 65). Appellants contend on appeal that\n\nit is irrelevant whether the Catholic religion as a whole requires\n\nCatholic parents to educate their children at religious schools.\n\nThey assert that they personally believe, on religious grounds,\n\nthat such a requirement exists.       Their sincere personal belief is\n\nenough, they argue, to demonstrate the centrality to their faith of\n\nCatholic school attendance.        See Hernandez v. Comm'r of Internal\n\nRevenue, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989) (stating, \"It is not within the\n\njudicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or\n\npractices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants'\n\ninterpretations of those creeds.\") (citation omitted).\n\n          Assuming, without deciding, that appellants' personal\n\nreligious belief suffices for RFRA purposes, they still face the\n\ninsurmountable hurdle we have discussed in the previous section,\n\nnamely that the mere non-funding of private secular and religious\n\nschool programs does not \"burden\" a person's religion or the free\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fexercise thereof.          42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a).                There is no need to\n\nrepeat what we have already said on this point.                        It suffices to say\n\nwe find no cognizable \"burden\" being imposed here upon appellants'\n\nexercise of their religion, hence no occasion to apply RFRA.\n\n                                             III.\n\n               Likewise, appellants' equal protection claim fails, as\n\nthe    district      court      ruled.       Appellants          assert    that     IDEA   has\n\ninfringed       upon      their    fundamental           right    to      direct    Andrew's\n\nupbringing and education4 because it deprives him of FAPE and a due\n\nprocess hearing while offering these benefits to students who\n\nreceive special education services at public school and, therefore,\n\nshould be subjected to strict scrutiny.                      See Pierce, 268 U.S. at\n\n534-35.\n\n               To    be   sure,    if    a   requirement          imposed      by   a   state\n\nsignificantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right,\n\nit    cannot    be     upheld     unless     it     is   supported        by   sufficiently\n\nimportant state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate\n\nonly those interests.              See, e.g., Cruzan v. Director, Missouri\n\n\n       4\n      Appellants also argue that the distinctions made here deny\ntheir child the right to access an adequate education and a \"basic\nfloor of educational opportunity\" and therefore should be analyzed\nunder heightened scrutiny. They concede that the Supreme Court\nfound there is no fundamental right to education, but argue that\nthe Court left open the issue of whether the denial of a \"minimally\nadequate education\" would be subjected to heightened scrutiny. See\nSan Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35 (1973).\nAs appellants have failed to provide any precedential example of a\ncourt's actually having applied this particular mode of heightened\nscrutiny analysis, we decline to embark upon this path.\n\n                                             -13-\n\fDep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 303 (1990).            Here, however, just as\n\nnon-funding of private secular and religious school programs does\n\nnot \"burden\" a free exercise of religion, it does not significantly\n\ninterfere with the appellants' fundamental right to direct the\n\nupbringing and education of children under their control.                       See\n\nPierce, 268 U.S. at 534-35.          The Supreme Court has held \"in several\n\ncontexts    that   a    legislature's     decision    not    to   subsidize     the\n\nexercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right, and\n\nthus is not subject to strict scrutiny.\"              Regan v. Taxation with\n\nRepresentation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 549 (1983); see also\n\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 143-44 (1976) (declining to apply\n\nstrict    scrutiny      to   statute   that    provides     federal     funds   for\n\ncandidates who enter primary campaigns but does not provide funds\n\nfor candidates who do not run in party primaries); Harris, 448 U.S.\n\nat 316-18 (stating, \"although government may not place obstacles in\n\nthe path of a [person's] exercise . . . of freedom of [speech], it\n\nneed not remove those not of its own creation.\"); Maher, 432 U.S.\n\nat 476-77.\n\n            Accordingly, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the IDEA\n\nand conclude,      as    did   the   district   court,     that   the   statutory\n\nclassification at issue here between public and private school\n\nstudents bears a rational relationship to the furtherance of a\n\nlegitimate governmental purpose.              Regan, 461 U.S. at 547.           The\n\nEqual    Protection     clause   requires     that   all    persons     \"similarly\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fsituated should be treated alike.\"           Cleburne v. Cleburne Living\n\nCtr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).           A legislature has \"substantial\n\nlatitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the\n\nnature   of    the    problem   perceived,   that   accommodate     competing\n\nconcerns both public and private, and that account for limitations\n\non the practical ability of the State to remedy every ill.\"            Plyler\n\nv. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982).         The primary purpose of the IDEA\n\nis to guarantee a free and appropriate public education.                   See\n\nNieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 125 (7th Cir. 2003)\n\n(\"We agree with the reasoning of these courts that IDEA's primary\n\npurpose is to ensure FAPE . . . .\"); Polera v.

Accordingly, the distinctions made here between\n\nstudents      in   public   school   as   opposed   to   children    who   are\n\nunilaterally placed in private schools are rational.              The burden\n\nplaced on local educational authorities to make FAPE available is\n\nheavy.     Congress acted rationally when it chose not to subject\n\nlocal educational authorities to the even greater and perhaps\n\noverwhelming responsibility of providing the same services to\n\ndisabled students enrolled unilaterally in private schools.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f                                     IV.\n\n              Lastly, we agree with the district court that appellants'\n\nsubstantive due process claim fails.             Appellants argue that the\n\nfederal law requires them to forego their religious beliefs and\n\ntheir right to control their child's education in order to obtain\n\nthe same right to FAPE and due process that other students who\n\nreceive special education services at Manchester receive.                     As\n\nappellants allege that the government has attempted to condition\n\naccess   to    a   government   benefit     on   the   relinquishment    of    a\n\nconstitutional right, the district court correctly analyzed this\n\nclaim under the framework of the \"unconstitutional conditions\"\n\ndoctrine.      The court noted that both the Supreme Court and the\n\nFirst Circuit have \"consistently refused to invalidate laws which\n\ncondition a parent's ability to obtain educational benefits on the\n\nparent's relinquishment of her right to send her child to private\n\nschool.\"    See Norwood, 413 U.S. at 462 (1973); Strout, 178 F.3d at\n\n66; Harris, 448 U.S. at 318; Maher, 432 U.S. at 477.            Moreover, for\n\nthe   reasons      stated   above,   appellants'       claim   fails   because\n\nappellants are not forced to forego their religious beliefs or\n\ntheir right to control their child's education in order to obtain\n\nthese government benefits.\n\n              We AFFIRM the decision of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

While he, like other disabled children who go to private schools, receives some educational services under federal and state law, he is not entitled by law to the panoply of services available to disabled public school students under the rubric of free and appropriate public education (FAPE), nor to the due process hearing provided to public school students alone. Appellants argue that the difference in treatment of their disabled son, who is attending a religious school, from other disabled students, who are attending public schools, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the federal constitution, the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the federal constitution, and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000bb-1 to -4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered these contentions upon cross motions for summary judgment.

After carefully considering them, we find ourselves in agreement with the district court. In disposing of this appeal, we are also in substantial accord with much of the reasoning contained in its published Memorandum and Order. <i>Id.</i> at 117-123. We see, therefore, no need to go over yet again all of the groundwork covered there. Nor need we restate the background facts already described in detail in the district court's opinion. <i>Id.</i> at 113-17. We add, however, at some length, our own analysis of several of the key issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' lead argument on appeal is that the district court erred in determining that the federal law did not violate Andrew's and his parents' free exercise rights under the First Amendment. They reject the district court's assertion that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Employment Div. Dep't of Human Res. of Oregon v. Smith,</i> 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), is controlling. <i>Smith,</i> according to the district court, exempted most \"neutral laws of general applicability\" from the compelling interest test. In the district court's view, [A] law ordinarily need not be justified by a compelling interest if it is \"neutral\" in that it is not targeted at religiously motivated conduct and \"generally applicable\" in that it does not selectively burden religious conduct. <i>See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 532-35, 542-43, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gary S.,</i> 241 F.Supp.2d at 120-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IDEA and its regulations, the district court says, do not target religiously motivated conduct and is \"generally applicable\" in that it does not selectively burden religious conduct. For these reasons, and because appellants' First Amendment claim is not \"hybrid,\" <i>i.e.</i> is not linked to a separate constitutional claim, the district court found no violation of free exercise rights. <i>Id.</i> We do not disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants reject the district court's analysis. They ask us to read <i>Smith</i> as limited to instances of socially harmful or criminal conduct. They point out that <i>Smith</i> did not purport to overrule the Supreme Court's holdings in the cases of <i>Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n,</i> 480 U.S. 136, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987), <i>Thomas v. Review Bd. of the Indiana Employment Sec. Div.,</i> 450 U.S. 707, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981), and <i>Sherbert v. Verner,</i> 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). In <i>Hobbie</i> and <i>Sherbert,</i> the complainants were denied unemployment benefits following discharge because of their religiously-based refusal to work on Saturday, complainant's religion's Sabbath. In <i>Thomas,</i> the complainant was denied unemployment benefits after discharge based on his religiously-based refusal to help produce armaments. Holding that the denial of a public benefit in these circumstances burdened plaintiff's religion, the Court ruled that, in order to justify an action having such an effect under the free-exercise clause, the government had to demonstrate that the withholding of the benefit served a compelling governmental interest and was the least restrictive means to that end. <i>Hobbie,</i> 480 U.S. at 141-45, 107 S.Ct. 1046; <i>Thomas,</i> at 718-20, 101 S.Ct. 1425; <i>Sherbert,</i> 374 U.S. at 403, 83 S.Ct. 1790. Appellants have likened the denial of educational disability benefits here to those situations, asking us similarly to apply strict scrutiny. If we do, appellants contend, we will find that Andrew's attendance at a Catholic school is mandated by his parents' sincerely-held religious beliefs. No compelling governmental interest is served, they say, by withholding from him the identical benefits granted to his peers at public schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not always easy to predict what analytical framework the Supreme Court will apply to the various, factually dissimilar free exercise cases that arise. <i>Smith</i> rejected a free exercise claim involving the religiously-based use of peyote, an illegal substance. Writing for five of the Justices, Justice Scalia endorsed the constitutionality of neutral, generally applicable laws even when they impinged incidentally upon individual religious practices. <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 881, 885, 110 S.Ct. 1595. The <i>Smith</i> majority expressly limited <i>Hobbie, Thomas</i> and <i>Sherbert</i> to the unemployment compensation field. <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 883-84, 110 S.Ct. 1595. While, as appellants point out, Justice Scalia in <i>Smith</i> also distinguished <i>Hobbie, Thomas</i> and <i>Sherbert</i> on the narrower ground that the use of peyote was illegal, 494 U.S. at 876, 110 S.Ct. 1595, the majority's overall message is unmistakably contrary to appellants' present argument that <i>Hobbie, Thomas</i> and <i>Sherbert</i> &#8212; and, in particular, the \"compelling interest\" test &#8212; are broadly applicable here. <i>Smith,</i> insofar as can be told from reading the Court's more recent precedent, remains good law, albeit reflective when written of the thinking of a narrow majority of justices, some of whom no longer serve. <i>See, e.g., Watchtower Bible and Tract Soc'y of N.Y. v. Vill. of Stratton,</i> 536 U.S. 150, 159, 122 S.Ct. 2080, 153 L.Ed.2d 205 (2002) (discussing in dicta that lower court relied on <i>Smith</i> standard); <i>City of Boerne v. Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507, 536, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) (invalidating statute that sought to \"restore the compelling interest test as set forth in <i>Sherbert v. Verner,</i> ... and <i>Wisconsin v. Yoder,</i>\" that had been rejected in <i>Smith</i>); Richard C. Schragger, <i>The Role of the Local in the Doctrine and Discourse of Religious Liberty,</i> 117 Harv. L.Rev. 1810, 1853 (2004) (describing the \"current Smith-Boerne doctrine\"); Notes, \"<i>They Drew a Circle That Shut Me In</i>\"<i>: The Free Exercise Implications of Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,</i> 117 Harv. L.Rev. 919, 924 (2004) (\"Although the <i>Smith</i> rule has been criticized by several Justices &#8212; both at the time of the decision and subsequently &#8212; the Court has reiterated its commitment to the rule and rebuffed a congressional attempt to change it.\") (footnotes omitted); Ming Hsu Chen, Note, <i>Two Wrongs Make a Right: Hybrid Claims of Discrimination,</i> 79 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 685, 710 (2004) (\"Notwithstanding any of its flaws, [<i>Smith</i>] remains good law.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree, for the reasons the district court stated, that this case is not a \"hybrid\" one. Hence, we conclude that the district court analyzed the case under the correct standard. <i>Gary S.,</i> 241 F.Supp.2d at 121.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we could perhaps leave the free exercise analysis there, an even more fundamental reason causes us to reject appellants' First Amendment arguments. We cannot accept appellants' contention that providing to all disabled attendees at private schools, both sectarian and secular, fewer benefits than those granted to public school attendees is truly analogous to denying unemployment benefits to persons fired because of their religiously-inspired insistence upon celebrating the Sabbath or not producing weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state unemployment benefits denied in <i>Hobbie, Thomas, Sherbert</i> were public benefits, available to all. Plaintiffs would have received them had their religiously-motivated refusal to work on a certain day or at a certain job not been erroneously viewed by local authorities as misconduct. While appellants say their son's attendance at a Catholic school is likewise a religiously-motivated act, there is a basic difference. He and they are not being deprived of a <i>generally available</i> public benefit. Rather, the benefits to which appellants lay claim under the First Amendment are benefits the federal government has earmarked solely for students enrolled in the nation's public schools &#8212; benefits still available for Andrew were he sent to a public school, though not otherwise. Since the early days of public education in this country, public financial aid has commonly been limited to public rather than independent schools. While the parents of private school attendees pay the same taxes as public school parents, the former's tax money normally supports their own children's education only if they transfer them to a public school. To be sure, parents have a protected right to send their children to private schools if they so desire. <i>Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters,</i> 268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (state law compelling public school attendance \"unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control\"). But as the very term \"private\" denotes, it is not ordinarily expected that such schools will be publicly funded, and there is no precedent requiring such funding. <i>Norwood v. Harrison,</i> 413 U.S. 455, 462, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973) (in affirming \"right of private schools to exist and operate ... [<i>Pierce</i>] said nothing of any supposed right of private or parochial schools to share with public schools in state largesse, on an equal basis or otherwise.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the traditional pattern that has so far prevailed of financing public education via the public schools, it would be unreasonable and inconsistent to premise a free exercise violation upon Congress's mere failure to provide to disabled children attending private religious schools the identical financial and other benefits it confers upon those attending public schools. Unlike unemployment benefits that are equally available to all, private school parents can have no legitimate expectancy that they or their children's schools will receive the same federal or state financial benefits provided to public schools. Thus, the non-receipt of equal funding and programmatic benefits cannot be said to impose any cognizable \"burden\" upon the religion of those choosing to attend such schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Persons opting to attend private schools, religious or otherwise, must accept the disadvantages as well as any benefits offered by those schools. They cannot insist, as a matter of constitutional right, that the disadvantages be cured by the provision of public funding. It follows that denying the benefits here, to which appellants have no cognizable entitlement, do not burden their free exercise rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, if we were to find a burden here on appellants' right of free exercise, it would follow logically that we should find free exercise violations whenever a state, city or town refuses to fund programs of other types at religious schools, at least insofar as the absence of funding adversely affects students with parents who believe their faith requires attendance at a religious school.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Yet, as noted <i>supra,</i> it is clear there is no federal constitutional requirement that private schools be permitted to share with public schools in state largesse on an equal basis. <i>See, e.g., Norwood v. Harrison,</i> 413 U.S. at 462, 93 S.Ct. 2804; <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297, 317-18, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980); <i>Maher v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464, 477, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977); <i>see also Locke,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1315; <i>Strout v. Albanese,</i> 178 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir.1999) (stating, \"fundamental right [to direct child's upbringing and education] does not require the state to directly pay for a sectarian education\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we see no basis for holding that the federal government violates appellants' free exercise rights under the First Amendment by favoring disabled public school attendees in respect to IDEA's programs and benefits. In so doing, the federal government does no more than state and local governments do everyday by funding public school programs while providing lesser or, more likely, no funding to private schools, religious and otherwise. This methodology leaves all parents with ultimate recourse to the public schools whenever the balance of services associated with attendance at a private school appears to them to be unsatisfactory; but the option thus available can necessitate their having to choose, as here, between alternatives each of which may seem imperfect. In any event, we cannot say that the federal government's structuring of benefits here violates appellants' free exercise rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our above-stated conclusion that no cognizable burden on religion has been caused by the federal government's failure to provide to disabled children attending Catholic schools the same benefits as it provides to disabled public school children applies with equal force to appellants' RFRA claim. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb-1(a) (stating in part, \"[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected appellants' RFRA claim, finding no burden upon religion given this court's <i>Strout</i> decision that \"the Catholic faith does not require parents to educate their children in Catholic schools.\" <i>Gary S.,</i> 241 F.Supp.2d at 122 (citing <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 65). Appellants contend on appeal that it is irrelevant whether the Catholic religion as a whole requires Catholic parents to educate their children at religious schools. They assert that they personally believe, on religious grounds, that such a requirement exists. Their sincere personal belief is enough, they argue, to demonstrate the centrality to their faith of Catholic school attendance. <i>See Hernandez v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue,</i> 490 U.S. 680, 699, 109 S.Ct. 2136, 104 L.Ed.2d 766 (1989) (stating, \"It is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of those creeds.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, without deciding, that appellants' personal religious belief suffices for RFRA purposes, they still face the insurmountable hurdle we have discussed in the previous section, namely that the mere non-funding of private secular and religious school programs does not \"burden\" a person's religion or the free exercise thereof. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb-1(a). There is no need to repeat what we have already said on this point. It suffices to say we find no cognizable \"burden\" being imposed here upon appellants' exercise of their religion, hence no occasion to apply RFRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, appellants' equal protection claim fails, as the district court ruled. Appellants assert that IDEA has infringed upon their fundamental right to direct Andrew's upbringing and education<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> because it deprives him of FAPE and a due process hearing while offering these benefits to students who receive special education services at public school and, therefore, should be subjected to strict scrutiny. <i>See Pierce,</i> 268 U.S. at 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, if a requirement imposed by a state significantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, it cannot be upheld unless it is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests. <i>See, e.g., Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't of Health,</i> 497 U.S. 261, 303, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990). Here, however, just as non-funding of private secular and religious school programs does not \"burden\" a free exercise of religion, it does not significantly interfere with the appellants' fundamental right to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control. <i>See Pierce,</i> 268 U.S. at 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571. The Supreme Court has held \"in several contexts that a legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny.\" <i>Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington,</i> 461 U.S. 540, 549, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983); <i>see also Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 143-44, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (declining to apply strict scrutiny to statute that provides federal funds for candidates who enter primary campaigns but does not provide funds for candidates who do not run in party primaries); <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 316-18, 100 S.Ct. 2671 (stating, \"although government may not place obstacles in the path of a [person's] exercise ... of freedom of [speech], it need not remove those not of its own creation.\"); <i>Maher,</i> 432 U.S. at 476-77, 97 S.Ct. 2376.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the IDEA and conclude, as did the district court, that the statutory classification at issue here between public and private school students bears a rational relationship to the furtherance of a legitimate governmental purpose. <i>Regan,</i> 461 U.S. at 547, 103 S.Ct. 1997. The Equal Protection clause requires that all persons \"similarly situated should be treated alike.\" <i>Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). A legislature has \"substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived, that accommodate competing concerns both public and private, and that account for limitations on the practical ability of the State to remedy every ill.\" <i>Plyler v. Doe,</i> 457 U.S. 202, 216, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). The primary purpose of the IDEA is to guarantee a free and appropriate <i>public</i> education. <i>See Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 353 F.3d 108, 125 (7th Cir.2003) (\"We agree with the reasoning of these courts that IDEA's primary purpose is to ensure FAPE....\"); <i>Polera v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d Cir.2002) (stating, \"the [IDEA's] administrative system ... is designed to ensure that disabled students receive the free appropriate public education to which they are entitled....\"). Accordingly, the distinctions made here between students in public school as opposed to children who are unilaterally placed in private schools are rational. The burden placed on local educational authorities to make FAPE available is heavy. Congress acted rationally when it chose not to subject local educational authorities to the even greater and perhaps overwhelming responsibility of providing the same services to disabled students enrolled unilaterally in private schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, we agree with the district court that appellants' substantive due process claim fails. Appellants argue that the federal law requires them to forego their religious beliefs and their right to control their child's education in order to obtain the same right to FAPE and due process that other students who receive special education services at Manchester receive. As appellants allege that the government has attempted to condition access to a government benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutional right, the district court correctly analyzed this claim under the framework of the \"unconstitutional conditions\" doctrine. The court noted that both the Supreme Court and the First Circuit have \"consistently refused to invalidate laws which condition a parent's ability to obtain educational benefits on the parent's relinquishment of her right to send her child to private school.\" <i>See Norwood,</i> 413 U.S. at 462, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973); <i>Strout,</i> 178 F.3d at 66; <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 318, 100 S.Ct. 2671; <i>Maher,</i> 432 U.S. at 477, 97 S.Ct. 2376. Moreover, for the reasons stated above, appellants' claim fails because appellants are not forced to forego their religious beliefs or their right to control their child's education in order to obtain these government benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the Court has recently permitted a state legislature to provide for attendance at private schools at public expense if it so desires<i>Cf.

But we see no distinction in principle. It is, of course, also true that the federal government and state are here actually funding programs for disabled children such as Andrew, the complaint being not the total absence of a program but that Andrew's program and rights are less comprehensive than those accorded to public school students. Again, we see no difference in principle. The federal and state governments are entitled to fund programs associated with private schools if they so desire, provided they do not run afoul of the Establishment Clause. Our point is not that such funding is never allowed, but that it is not commonly expected in our society nor required</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A further anomaly of such a holding would be that only persons such as appellants, with a declared religious belief in the necessity of sending their children to private schools, would be entitled under the First Amendment to the funding sought. Other students, including those in secular private schools, would lack a right to such funding<i>Cf. Locke v. Davey,</i> 540 U.S. 712, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 1315, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004) (stating, \"Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, we therefore cannot conclude that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect. Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, [respondent's] claim must fail. The State's interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on [those involved in the funding program]. If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here. We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the [funding program] as currently operated by the State of Washington.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellants also argue that the distinctions made here deny their child the right to access an adequate education and a \"basic floor of educational opportunity\" and therefore should be analyzed under heightened scrutiny. They concede that the Supreme Court found there is no fundamental right to education, but argue that the Court left open the issue of whether the denial of a \"minimally adequate education\" would be subjected to heightened scrutiny<i>See San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 1, 35, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). As appellants have failed to provide any precedential example of a court's actually having applied this particular mode of heightened scrutiny analysis, we decline to embark upon this path.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

While he, like other disabled children who go to private schools, receives some educational services under federal and state law, he is not entitled by law to the panoply of services available to disabled public school students under the rubric of free and appropriate public education (FAPE), nor to the due process hearing provided to public school students alone. Appellants argue that the difference in treatment of their disabled son, who is attending a religious school, from other disabled students, who are attending public schools, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the federal constitution, the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the federal constitution, and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000bb-1 to -4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court considered these contentions upon cross motions for summary judgment.

In <i>Hobbie</i> and <i>Sherbert,</i> the complainants were denied unemployment benefits following discharge because of their religiously-based refusal to work on Saturday, complainant's religion's Sabbath. In <i>Thomas,</i> the complainant was denied unemployment benefits after discharge based on his religiously-based refusal to help produce armaments. Holding that the denial of a public benefit in these circumstances burdened plaintiff's religion, the Court ruled that, in order to justify an action having such an effect under the free-exercise clause, the government had to demonstrate that the withholding of the benefit served a compelling governmental interest and was the least restrictive means to that end. <i>Hobbie,</i> 480 U.S. at 141-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111826\"><a href=\"/opinion/111826/hobbie-v-unemployment-appeals-commn-of-fla/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If we do, appellants contend, we will find that Andrew's attendance at a Catholic school is mandated by his parents' sincerely-held religious beliefs.

Writing for five of the Justices, Justice Scalia endorsed the constitutionality of neutral, generally applicable laws even when they impinged incidentally upon individual religious practices. <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 881, 885, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1595</span></a></span>. The <i>Smith</i> majority expressly limited <i>Hobbie, Thomas</i> and <i>Sherbert</i> to the unemployment compensation field. <i>Smith,</i> 494 U.S. at 883-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1595</span></a></span>. While, as appellants point out, Justice Scalia in <i>Smith</i> also distinguished <i>Hobbie, Thomas</i> and <i>Sherbert</i> on the narrower ground that the use of peyote was illegal, 494 U.S. at 876, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We cannot accept appellants' contention that providing to all disabled attendees at private schools, both sectarian and secular, fewer benefits than those granted to public school attendees is truly analogous to denying unemployment benefits to persons fired because of their religiously-inspired insistence upon celebrating the Sabbath or not producing weapons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state unemployment benefits denied in <i>Hobbie, Thomas, Sherbert</i> were public benefits, available to all. Plaintiffs would have received them had their religiously-motivated refusal to work on a certain day or at a certain job not been erroneously viewed by local authorities as misconduct. While appellants say their son's attendance at a Catholic school is likewise a religiously-motivated act, there is a basic difference. He and they are not being deprived of a <i>generally available</i> public benefit. Rather, the benefits to which appellants lay claim under the First Amendment are benefits the federal government has earmarked solely for students enrolled in the nation's public schools &#8212; benefits still available for Andrew were he sent to a public school, though not otherwise. Since the early days of public education in this country, public financial aid has commonly been limited to public rather than independent schools. While the parents of private school attendees pay the same taxes as public school parents, the former's tax money normally supports their own children's education only if they transfer them to a public school. To be sure, parents have a protected right to send their children to private schools if they so desire. <i>Pierce v.

Unlike unemployment benefits that are equally available to all, private school parents can have no legitimate expectancy that they or their children's schools will receive the same federal or state financial benefits provided to public schools. Thus, the non-receipt of equal funding and programmatic benefits cannot be said to impose any cognizable \"burden\" upon the religion of those choosing to attend such schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Persons opting to attend private schools, religious or otherwise, must accept the disadvantages as well as any benefits offered by those schools. They cannot insist, as a matter of constitutional right, that the disadvantages be cured by the provision of public funding.

In so doing, the federal government does no more than state and local governments do everyday by funding public school programs while providing lesser or, more likely, no funding to private schools, religious and otherwise. This methodology leaves all parents with ultimate recourse to the public schools whenever the balance of services associated with attendance at a private school appears to them to be unsatisfactory; but the option thus available can necessitate their having to choose, as here, between alternatives each of which may seem imperfect.

Appellants contend on appeal that it is irrelevant whether the Catholic religion as a whole requires Catholic parents to educate their children at religious schools.

Other students, including those in secular private schools, would lack a right to such funding<i>Cf. Locke v. Davey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131166\"><a href=\"/opinion/131166/locke-v-davey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131166\"><a href=\"/opinion/131166/locke-v-davey/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (2004) (stating, \"Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, we therefore cannot conclude that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect. Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, [respondent's] claim must fail. The State's interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on [those involved in the funding program]. If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here. We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the [funding program] as currently operated by the State of Washington.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Appellants also argue that the distinctions made here deny their child the right to access an adequate education and a \"basic floor of educational opportunity\" and therefore should be analyzed under heightened scrutiny. They concede that the Supreme Court found there is no fundamental right to education, but argue that the Court left open the issue of whether the denial of a \"minimally adequate education\" would be subjected to heightened scrutiny<i>See San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 35, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span> (1973). As appellants have failed to provide any precedential example of a court's actually having applied this particular mode of heightened scrutiny analysis, we decline to embark upon this path.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
