Antonetti Stutts, Solicitor General, Mariana D.\nNegrón Vargas and Maite D. Oronoz Rodríguez, Deputy Solicitors\nGeneral, and Rosa E. Pérez Agosto, Assistant Solicitor General, on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n                        December 19, 2005\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.       On February 12, 2003, plaintiff-\n\nappellant José Torres-Vargas sued his employer, the Puerto Rico\n\nPolice Department, and several ranking police officers in federal\n\ndistrict court.1     He sought compensatory and punitive damages, as\n\nwell as equitable relief, for persecution and a hostile work\n\nenvironment, allegedly motivated by political discrimination.              The\n\ncomplaint   raised   a   salmagundi    of   claims   under   the   First   and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988, and Puerto Rico law.          The defendants\n\nvigorously denied the plaintiff's allegations.\n\n            The case traveled along a bumpy road from the beginning.\n\nThe plaintiff (who claimed that he never received the initial\n\nsummons) requested and received numerous extensions of time for\n\nservice of process; he did not actually serve the defendants until\n\nSeptember 16, 2003 (more than seven months after the commencement\n\nof the action). One defendant, Rivera (the police superintendent),\n\nmoved to dismiss the complaint based on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n\nAfter obtaining another extension of time, the plaintiff opposed the\n\nmotion.\n\n            On March 12, 2004, the police department also moved to\n\ndismiss on Eleventh Amendment grounds. The plaintiff again obtained\n\n\n     1\n      Torres-Vargas's wife and their conjugal partnership were\nnamed as co-plaintiffs.      Because their claims are wholly\nderivative, we refer for simplicity's sake to Torres-Vargas as if\nhe were the sole plaintiff. Our decision is, of course, binding\non all parties.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fan extension of time and eventually opposed that motion.                    The\n\ndistrict court ultimately granted the police superintendent's and\n\npolice    department's   motions   to    dismiss   in    part    (as   to   the\n\nplaintiff's claims for pecuniary damages) and denied them in part\n\n(as to the plaintiff's claim for prospective injunctive relief).\n\nAll claims remained intact as to the remaining defendants.2\n\n            On August 4, 2004, the district court held a scheduling\n\nconference (the second in the case).           At that session, it set a\n\nDecember 13, 2004 trial date.      That date was later pushed back to\n\nJune 6, 2005 at the plaintiff's request.\n\n            On August 4 — the day of the aforementioned scheduling\n\nconference — the defendants served their first discovery requests.\n\nOver the following eighty-one days, the plaintiff neither answered\n\nthe   defendants'   interrogatories      nor   produced    the    designated\n\ndocuments.    The defendants faxed a reminder to the plaintiff's\n\nattorney, noting that the Civil Rules allowed only thirty days for\n\nresponding to such discovery requests.             See    Fed.   R. Civ. P.\n\n33(b)(3), 34(b).\n\n            At that juncture, the plaintiff asked for, and received,\n\nan extension of the due date until October 27, 2004.                   When no\n\ndiscovery was forthcoming from the plaintiff's camp, the defendants,\n\n\n      2\n      On August 6, 2004, two more defendants moved to dismiss the\nsuit, this time for failure to state an actionable claim. See Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). After the court granted myriad extensions,\nthe plaintiff filed an opposition, to which the defendants replied.\nThe court never ruled on this motion.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fat the plaintiff's beseechment, granted yet another extension to\n\nNovember 8, 2004.         That deadline also passed without service of\n\neither the answers to interrogatories or the designated documents.\n\n           On December 9, 2004, the defendants moved to dismiss the\n\naction for both want of prosecution, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), and\n\nfailure to comply with discovery deadlines, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n37(b)(2)(C). Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff transmitted answers\n\nto interrogatories by facsimile.            He simultaneously informed the\n\ncourt   that   he   had    fully   satisfied   his   outstanding   discovery\n\nobligations.\n\n           The defendants disputed this claim of compliance, pointing\n\nout that the plaintiff, inter alia, had yet to provide them with\n\ncertified copies of his income tax returns as previously requested.\n\nIn light of this apparent omission, the district court, on December\n\n28, 2004, ordered the plaintiff to satisfy all outstanding discovery\n\nrequests by January 10, 2005.        The court warned the plaintiff that\n\nfailure to comply with its order would result in the dismissal with\n\nprejudice of his action.\n\n           Despite this explicit admonition, the plaintiff failed\n\neither to produce the designated documents by the appointed date or\n\nto seek an extension of the deadline.          The district court, true to\n\nits word, entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice\n\npursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C) \"because of [the plaintiff's] ongoing\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\ffailure to prosecute this case and [his] failure to obey this\n\nCourt's Order.\"\n\n              The following day, the plaintiff again asserted that he\n\nhad   fully    complied   with     the    defendants'   demand   for    document\n\nproduction.      He made this assertion despite the fact that certain\n\nof the documents (most notably, the tax returns) were still missing.\n\nBased on the same assertion, he filed successive motions for\n\nreconsideration of the dismissal order.           The district court denied\n\nboth motions.     This timely appeal followed.\n\n              Our analysis begins with bedrock: a federal district\n\ncourt's venerable power to sanction a party who repeatedly fails to\n\ncomply with court-imposed deadlines cannot be doubted.             See, e.g.,\n\nNat'l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, 643 (1976);\n\nLink v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962).             Because the\n\nappropriateness of sanctions depends on the facts of the particular\n\ncase, we review the use of dismissal as a sanction for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       See Nat'l Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 642; Tower\n\nVentures, Inc. v. City of Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).    This     standard   is    not    appellant-friendly.         See   Tower\n\nVentures, 296 F.3d at 46.          In applying it, a reviewing court must\n\nconsider the chronology of the case and the totality of the\n\nattendant circumstances. Young v. Gordon, 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). In that process, the court must construct a balance of the\n\nrelevant factors, including (but not limited to) the trial court's\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fneed to manage its docket, the potential prejudice to the parties,\n\nand the policy of the law favoring disposition on the merits. Id.\n\n               In this appeal, the plaintiff makes three basic points.\n\nFirst,    he    argues      that    his       failure    to    comply     with      discovery\n\nobligations was excusable because the defendants themselves caused\n\nhis inability to comply.              Second, he asseverates that he responded\n\nto the defendants' initiatives in \"due time,\" thereby evincing an\n\nactive interest in the prosecution of the case. Third, he maintains\n\nthat     dismissal       was       ill-advised          because      he     answered       the\n\ninterrogatories        and     made      a    good-faith      effort      to   produce     the\n\ndesignated documents.             We consider each of these points in turn.\n\n               The premise behind the plaintiff's first contention is\n\nsound: noncompliance caused by an opposing party's actions sometimes\n\ncan excuse delay in discovery responses.                      See, e.g., Ortiz-Anglada\n\nv.   Ortiz-Perez,      183     F.3d      65,     67   n.4     (1st   Cir.      1999).      The\n\nplaintiff's attempt to slide his case within this integument is,\n\nhowever, unavailing.\n\n               The   gist    of    the       plaintiff's      contention       is   that   the\n\ndefendants themselves created a stressful work environment that\n\ncaused him great anxiety and made it difficult for him to meet\n\ncourt-imposed discovery.              The main problem with this contention is\n\nthat it is unsupported; the record is devoid of anything                                   of\n\nevidentiary quality that might give substance to the claim.                                 To\n\ncinch matters, the plaintiff never voiced this plaint in the\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fdistrict court.    Consequently, he cannot rewardingly surface it for\n\nthe first time on appeal. Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &\n\nHelpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (explaining that \"legal theories not raised squarely in the\n\nlower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal\").\n\n           Relatedly, the plaintiff tells us that his unwarranted\n\ntransfer caused him to lose contact with his counsel.          From aught\n\nthat appears in the record, however, there is nothing about that\n\npersonnel move that cut the plaintiff off from normal channels of\n\ncommunication.    In the absence of extraordinary circumstances — not\n\npresent here —    it is certainly not a defendant's responsibility to\n\nprovide   the    plaintiff's   lawyer    with   the   plaintiff's   contact\n\ninformation when the plaintiff moves.       See Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs.,\n\nInc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           This brings us to the plaintiff's second contention: that\n\nhe took an active interest in the case.         In this regard, he posits\n\nthat \"the docket of the case speaks for itself.\" We agree with this\n\nemphasis on the docket, but we read the docket differently.\n\n           The docket reflects that, from the very commencement of\n\nthe action, the plaintiff dragged his heels and the district court\n\ngenerously granted him extensions of divers kinds.         The docket also\n\nshows that when the case entered discovery, the plaintiff, for no\n\napparent reason, failed to comply with deadlines mandated by the\n\nCivil Rules, even after those deadlines were voluntarily extended\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fby the defendants.         To make matters worse, the plaintiff, on\n\nDecember 15, 2004, actively misrepresented to the court that he had\n\nfully   complied   with    all   outstanding   discovery   requests.   The\n\ndistrict court's response was crystal clear:            comply in full by\n\nJanuary 10, 2005, or face dismissal.            The plaintiff's previous\n\ndisplay of interest in the case, erratic at best, cannot excuse his\n\nnoncompliance with this clear and aposematic mandate.\n\n           This leaves the plaintiff's third contention: that the\n\nlower court should not have issued its most draconian sanction\n\nbecause he complied with the court's order, if not by the stated\n\ndeadline, then by the next day.        This    brief   delay, he says, was\n\nneither willful nor in bad faith.\n\n           The plaintiff's claim of compliance is little more than\n\nan attempt to rewrite the facts of the case.           While the plaintiff\n\neventually answered the interrogatories (albeit belatedly), he never\n\nfully complied with his responsibilities for document production.\n\n           To be sure, dismissal orders typically are measures of\n\nlast resort, reserved for extreme cases.          But we have held that a\n\nparty's disregard of a court order is a paradigmatic example of\n\nextreme misconduct.       See Young, 330 F.3d at 81; Tower Ventures, 296\n\nF.3d at 46. Using dismissal as a sanction in such a case recognizes\n\nthe court's strong interest in maintaining discipline and husbanding\n\nscarce judicial resources; after all, such a sanction not only\n\nserves to punish the noncompliant litigant but also acts as a\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fdeterrent to those who might be tempted to emulate a bad example.\n\nSee Nat'l Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643.\n\n            It is settled law that a party flouts a court order at his\n\nperil. Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nWhere, as here, the court appropriately forewarns a plaintiff of the\n\nconsequences of future noncompliance with an unambiguous order, the\n\ncourt need not exhaust less toxic sanctions before dismissing a case\n\nwith prejudice.3     See, e.g., Young, 330 F.3d at 82; HMG Prop.\n\nInvestors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 918\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            We need go no further.      Given the plaintiff's record of\n\ndilatory responses, his noncompliance with an unambiguous court\n\norder, and his blatant misrepresentation of the status of his\n\ndiscovery responses, there is no principled way that we can find an\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court's forewarned decision to\n\ndismiss the action with prejudice.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The plaintiff's profession of good faith does not alter this\nresult.   \"[A] finding of bad faith is not a condition precedent to\nimposing a sanction of dismissal.\" Young, 330 F.3d at 82.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

First, he argues that his failure to comply with discovery obligations was excusable because the defendants themselves caused his inability to comply. Second, he asseverates that he responded to the defendants' initiatives in \"due time,\" thereby evincing an active interest in the prosecution of the case. Third, he maintains that dismissal was ill-advised because he answered the interrogatories and made a good-faith effort to produce the designated documents. We consider each of these points in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premise behind the plaintiff's first contention is sound: noncompliance caused by an opposing party's actions sometimes can excuse delay in discovery responses. <i>See, e.g., Ortiz-Anglada v. Ortiz-Perez,</i> 183 F.3d 65, 67 n. 4 (1st Cir.1999). The plaintiff's attempt to slide his case within this integument is, however, unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of the plaintiff's contention is that the defendants themselves created a stressful work environment that caused him great anxiety and made it difficult for him to meet court-imposed discovery. The main problem with this contention is that it is unsupported; the record is devoid of anything of evidentiary quality that might give substance to the claim. To cinch matters, the plaintiff never voiced this plaint in the district court. Consequently, he cannot rewardingly surface it for the first time on appeal. <i>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that \"legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, the plaintiff tells us that his unwarranted transfer caused him to lose contact with his counsel. From aught that appears in the record, however, there is nothing about that personnel move that cut the plaintiff off from normal channels of communication. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances &#8212; not present here &#8212; it is certainly not a defendant's responsibility to provide the plaintiff's lawyer with the plaintiff's contact information when the plaintiff moves. <i>See Spiller v. U.S.V.

In this regard, he posits that \"the docket of the case speaks for itself.\" We agree with this emphasis on the docket, but we read the docket differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The docket reflects that, from the very commencement of the action, the plaintiff dragged his heels and the district court generously granted him extensions of divers kinds. The docket also shows that when the case entered discovery, the plaintiff, for no apparent reason, failed to comply with deadlines mandated by the Civil Rules, even after those deadlines were voluntarily extended by the defendants. To make matters worse, the plaintiff, on December 15, 2004, actively misrepresented to the court that he had fully complied with all outstanding discovery requests. The district court's response was crystal clear: comply in full by January 10, 2005, or face dismissal. The plaintiff's previous display of interest in the case, erratic at best, cannot excuse his noncompliance with this clear and aposematic mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the plaintiff's third contention: that the lower court should not have issued its most draconian sanction because he complied with the court's order, if not by the stated deadline, then by the next day. This brief delay, he says, was neither willful nor in bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's claim of compliance is little more than an attempt to rewrite the facts of the case.

But we have held that a party's disregard of a court order is a paradigmatic example of extreme misconduct. <i>See Young,</i> 330 F.3d at 81; <i>Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 46. Using dismissal as a sanction in such a case recognizes the court's strong interest in maintaining discipline and husbanding scarce judicial resources; after all, such a sanction not only serves to punish the noncompliant litigant but also acts as a deterrent to those who might be tempted to emulate a bad example. <i>See Nat'l Hockey League,</i> 427 U.S. at 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled law that a party flouts a court order at his peril. <i>Rosario-Diaz v.

The complaint raised a salmagundi of claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988, and Puerto Rico law. The defendants vigorously denied the plaintiff's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case traveled along a bumpy road from the beginning. The plaintiff (who claimed that he never received the initial summons) requested and received numerous extensions of time for service of process; he did not actually serve the defendants until September 16, 2003 (more than seven months after the commencement of the action). One defendant, Rivera (the police superintendent), moved to dismiss the complaint based on Eleventh Amendment grounds. After obtaining another extension of time, the plaintiff opposed the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 12, 2004, the police department also moved to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment grounds. The plaintiff again obtained an extension of time and eventually opposed that motion. The district court ultimately granted the police superintendent's and police department's motions to dismiss in part (as to the plaintiff's claims for pecuniary damages) and denied them in part (as to the plaintiff's claim for prospective injunctive relief). All claims remained intact as to the remaining defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 4, 2004, the district court held a scheduling conference (the second in the case). At that session, it set a December 13, 2004 trial date. That date was later pushed back to June 6, 2005 at the plaintiff's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 4&#8212;the day of the aforementioned scheduling conference &#8212; the defendants served their first discovery requests. Over the following eighty-one days, the plaintiff neither answered the defendants' interrogatories nor produced the designated documents. The defendants faxed a reminder to the plaintiff's attorney, noting that the Civil Rules allowed only thirty days for responding to such discovery requests. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 33(b)(3), 34(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, the plaintiff asked for, and received, an extension of the due date until October 27, 2004. When no discovery was forthcoming from the plaintiff's camp, the defendants, at the plaintiff's beseechment, granted yet another extension to November 8, 2004. That deadline also passed without service of either the answers to interrogatories or the designated documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, 2004, the defendants moved to dismiss the action for both want of prosecution, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), and failure to comply with discovery deadlines, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C). Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff transmitted answers to interrogatories by facsimile. He simultaneously informed the court that he had fully satisfied his outstanding discovery obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants disputed this claim of compliance, pointing out that the plaintiff, inter alia, had yet to provide them with certified copies of his income tax returns as previously requested. In light of this apparent omission, the district court, on December 28, 2004, ordered the plaintiff to satisfy <i>all</i> outstanding discovery requests by January 10, 2005. The court warned the plaintiff that failure to comply with its order would result in the dismissal with prejudice of his action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this explicit admonition, the plaintiff failed either to produce the designated documents by the appointed date or to seek an extension of the deadline. The district court, true to its word, entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C) \"because of [the plaintiff's] ongoing failure to prosecute this case and [his] failure to obey this Court's Order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, the plaintiff again asserted that he had fully complied with the defendants' demand for document production. He made this assertion despite the fact that certain of the documents (most notably, the tax returns) were still missing. Based on the same assertion, he filed successive motions for reconsideration of the dismissal order. The district court denied both motions. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis begins with bedrock: a federal district court's venerable power to sanction a party who repeatedly fails to comply with court-imposed deadlines cannot be doubted. <i>See, e.g., Nat'l Hockey League v.

Given the plaintiff's record of dilatory responses, his noncompliance with an unambiguous court order, and his blatant misrepresentation of the status of his discovery responses, there is no principled way that we can find an abuse of discretion in the district court's forewarned decision to dismiss the action with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Torres-Vargas's wife and their conjugal partnership were named as co-plaintiffs.
