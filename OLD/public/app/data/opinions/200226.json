PLUMEY-CRUZ, et al.,\n                       Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                 v.\n\n         WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRONIC CORPORATION, et al., etc.,\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n            APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n          [Hon. Hector M. Laffitte, Chief District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                       Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 and Shadur,* Senior District Judge\n\n\n\n\n     Robert E. Schneider, Jr. for appellants.\n     Edwin J. Seda-Fernandez, with whom Marshal D. Morgan and\nCarlos R. Paula were on brief, for the appellees.\n\n\n\n                         November 27, 2002\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f     SHADUR, Senior District Judge.       Jose Plumey-Cruz (“Plumey”),\n\nhis wife Nohra Soto Vahos and their conjugal partnership (for\n\nconvenience, all referred to here simply as “Plumey”) appeal the\n\ndismissal of Plumey's ERISA claim against Westinghouse Electric\n\nCorporation/CBS Corporation and Thermo King de Puerto Rico, Inc.\n\n(collectively “Westinghouse”).         For the reasons stated in this\n\nmemorandum opinion, we affirm the district court's decision in all\n\nrespects.\n\n                               Background\n\n     Because this is an unpublished and non-precedential ruling,\n\nand because the litigants are of course familiar with the facts, we\n\nstate them only in the skeletal form required for this opinion.\n\nPlumey initially instituted this lawsuit pro se, and he continued\n\nto act without counsel until the case was well along.        On March 31,\n\n2000 the district court dismissed Plumey's ADEA and Title VII\n\nclaims as time-barred, simultaneously dismissing the corresponding\n\nCommonwealth-law claims without prejudice (see, e.g., Figueroa Ruiz\n\nv. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 650 (1st Cir. 1990)).                That left\n\nsurviving only a potential ERISA claim.\n\n     After   discovery   had   taken    place   on   the   latter   claim,\n\nWestinghouse moved for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n(“Rule”) 56, accompanying its motion with an appropriate submission\n\nunder the district court's Local Rule 311.12.        Plumey answered the\n\nmotion, including what he labeled as a responsive submission under\n\n\n                                   2\n\fRule 311.12.    After receiving that response, Westinghouse tendered\n\na November 27, 2001 reply that pointed to what it urged (and what\n\nwe agree) was a fatal admission made in Plumey's response:         that he\n\nwas not a participant in any Westinghouse “top hat” plan.\n\n     In that respect, Westinghouse's sound position was that such\n\nnon-participation foreclosed Plumey's attempted ERISA claim.            For\n\none thing, Plumey had made no assertion that he was entitled to\n\nparticipate in a “top hat” plan but was wrongfully barred from\n\ndoing so,   for   Westinghouse's   only   such   plan   extended   to   its\n\nmainland executives and not to those based in Puerto Rico.         Nor is\n\nsuch noncoverage itself actionable under ERISA:          That aspect of\n\nWestinghouse's plan “was, of course, a feature that the employer as\n\nplan sponsor was free to adopt without breach of any fiduciary duty\n\nunder ERISA, since an employer's decisions about the content of a\n\nplan are not themselves fiduciary acts” (Pegram v. Herdrich, 530\n\nU.S. 211, 226 (2000)).\n\n     Early in 2001 the same counsel who represents Plumey on the\n\ncurrent appeal had appeared on his behalf in the district court,\n\nand counsel had filed Plumey's summary judgment response in mid-\n\nNovember.      Then on November 30, 2001, just three days after\n\nWestinghouse had submitted its reply, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment.    Its decision did not rely at all on that reply,\n\nreferring instead to the district court's own review of the record.\n\nBecause Plumey's notice of appeal refers only to that order and\n\n\n\n                                   3\n\fdoes not assert any error in the earlier dismissal of his ADEA and\n\nTitle VII claims (nor has he done so in his briefs or oral argument\n\nbefore us), we deal here only with his rejected ERISA claim.\n\n                  Insubstantiality of Plumey's Contentions\n\n     On this appeal Plumey complains of:\n\n           1.      the district court's asserted abuse of discretion in\n\n     failing to require Westinghouse to provide more discovery\n\n     before the court issued its final decision on November 30,\n\n     2001;\n\n             2.    the district court's asserted abuse of discretion in\n\n     failing to give Plumey the opportunity to file a surreply to\n\n     Westinghouse's November 27, 2001 reply; and\n\n             3.      the asserted invalidity of Rule 311.12.\n\nNone of those contentions requires more than brief discussion.\n\n     As for Plumey's first argument, his counsel (who, as stated\n\nearlier, had by then entered the case) never invoked Rule 56(f) at\n\nthe district court level to explain what further discovery was\n\nneeded and to ask for more time to obtain it (in that respect, see\n\nFiliatrault v. Comverse Tech., Inc., 275 F.3d 131, 138 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)).   That failure to present the issue to the district court\n\n(even via a post-November 30, 2001 motion for reconsideration)\n\ncould well preclude Plumey from raising the question before this\n\nCourt.    But even were that not so, the already-described fatal\n\nflaws in Plumey's ERISA-based claim would have called for any such\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\fRule 56(f) motion to be denied on relevancy grounds in any event.\n\n       Parallel reasoning defeats Plumey's second contention as well.\n\nWestinghouse's reply had advanced nothing new--it simply pointed to\n\nthe same deficiency that the district judge had picked up on his\n\nown.    Once again, with Plumey's counsel not having requested such\n\nrelief from the district court even after having received its\n\nruling, it is doubtful that the issue has been properly preserved\n\nfor appeal (cf. Beaird v. Seagate Tech., Inc., 145 F.3d 1159, 1164-\n\n65 (10th Cir. 1998)).     And as with the first contention, Plumey\n\nsays nothing that could have led to a different outcome even if a\n\nsurreply had been requested and allowed.\n\n       Finally, Rule 311.12 has repeatedly been upheld as valid by\n\nthis Court (see, e.g., Morales v. A.C. Orssleff's EFTF, 246 F.3d\n\n32, 33 (1st Cir. 2001), discussing that “anti-ferreting” rule); and\n\nsee also the specific reference to permitting such rules in the\n\nlast sentence of the Advisory Committee Note on the 1995 amendment\n\nto Rule 83(a)(2)).    There is no reason to reexamine that position\n\nhere.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's\n\nrulings in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\f",
