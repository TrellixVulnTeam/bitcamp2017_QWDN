Marcos Coelho,1 who pled guilty to illegal\n\nreentry after being deported following his conviction for statutory\n\nrape, appeals from his 37-month, within-guidelines sentence on the\n\ngrounds that it was inadequately explained and unreasonably high\n\nunder the standards we articulated in United States v. Jiménez-\n\nBeltre, 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).                   For the reasons\n\ndetailed below, we reject those arguments and affirm the sentence.\n\n            We pause at the threshold to consider and resolve a\n\njurisdictional issue not addressed by the parties.                       See Credit\n\nFrancais Int'l, S.A. v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d 698, 706 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).     In the district court, Coelho's arguments for a lower\n\nsentence were framed both as a request for a downward departure\n\nunder the guidelines and as a request for a below-guidelines\n\nsentence under the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                    On\n\nappeal, however, he challenges the reasonableness of his within-\n\nguidelines sentence based solely on the statutory factors.                      If,\n\ninstead, he were appealing solely from the denial of a downward\n\ndeparture, we would have no jurisdiction to consider the appeal.\n\nUnited States v. Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nHowever,    where,    as     here,   a     defendant      is   challenging      the\n\nreasonableness   of    his    ultimate         sentence   under    the    statutory\n\n\n     1\n      Although the district court referred to the defendant as\nMarcos Santos, the record indicates that his real name is Marcos\nCoelho. We will therefore refer to him as \"Coelho.\"\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffactors--albeit on much the same grounds urged in favor of a\n\ndownward departure--no jurisdictional impediment exists to our\n\nreview for reasonableness under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220   (2005).     See   Jiménez-Beltre,   440   F.3d    at   517    (finding\n\njurisdiction to review a sentence for reasonableness regardless of\n\nwhether it falls inside or outside the guidelines).          Accordingly,\n\nwe turn to the merits.\n\n           First, Coelho faults the district court for failing to\n\nstate its reasons for declining to impose a below-guidelines\n\nsentence under the statutory factors. However, as indicated above,\n\nCoelho's arguments for a below-guidelines sentence were essentially\n\nthe same as those for a downward departure under the guidelines.\n\nAnd the judge's reasons for rejecting those arguments can be\n\nreadily discerned from the face of the sentencing transcript or\n\n\"inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained\n\nin the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\"          Id. at 519.\n\n           Nor was there anything unreasonable about the district\n\ncourt's explicit or implicit reasons for imposing a sentence at the\n\nbottom of the applicable guidelines range.             In particular, the\n\ncourt was apparently unimpressed by Coelho's argument that his\n\nadvisory guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his prior\n\nconviction for he received a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. a\n\ncrime    of     violence,   i.e.,     statutory    rape,      for     which\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f§ 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).2          See id. comment. (n.1(B)(ii)) (defining\n\n\"crime of violence\" to include statutory rape).                 When the court\n\nreminded defense counsel of Coelho's burden of demonstrating his\n\nentitlement to a downward departure on that basis,3 defense counsel\n\nproffered--but did not introduce--Coelho's statement to police that\n\nthe victim consented to have sex with him, which contrasted sharply\n\nwith       the   graphic   description   of    the   violent   offense   conduct\n\ncontained in the presentence report.4                We see nothing improper\n\nabout the court's implicit finding that the offense conduct was as\n\ndescribed in the presentence report rather than in Coelho's self-\n\nserving statement.          If so, Coelho's proffer that the victim was\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Neither in the district court nor on appeal does Coelho\ncontest the applicability of that enhancement under the guidelines.\n       3\n      That same burden applies, post-Booker, to the proponent of a\nstatutory factor that would work in the proponent's favor.\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.\n       4\n      Coelho suggests that the court's reliance on the state\nprosecutor's description of the offense conduct contained in the\npresentence report was impermissible under Shepard v. United\nStates, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), which limits the kinds of evidence that\na court may rely upon in determining whether a prior conviction was\nfor a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of increasing a defendant's\nstatutory minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act.\nHowever, Shepard and its underlying Sixth Amendment rationale are\ninapplicable where, as here, the evidence relates to a request for\na reduced rather than an enhanced sentence, United States v.\nBermúdez, 407 F.3d 536, 544-45 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 U.S.\n304 (2005), and does not affect the statutory minimum but only the\nadvisory guidelines range, United States v. Gonsalves, 435 F.3d 64,\n73 (1st Cir. 2006). Moreover, if Shepard were applicable, it would\nbar consideration of Coelho's proffered version of events as well.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\falmost sixteen at the time of the offense did nothing to mitigate\n\nthe serious nature of the offense conduct.\n\n            The    district           court     also       expressed      skepticism         about\n\nCoelho's     argument          that       the    37-month          sentence        imposed     was\n\nunnecessary to serve the purpose of deterrence, given a state-court\n\njudge's threat (or prediction) that, if Coelho illegally reentered\n\nthe United States once again, he would likely be sentenced to life\n\nimprisonment.            The    district        court       reasonably        rejected        that\n\nargument,    particularly            in    light      of    the    fact     that    Coelho     had\n\npreviously      entered        or     attempted        to    enter    the     United     States\n\nillegally three times.\n\n            Nor do we see anything unreasonable about the district\n\ncourt's rejection of Coelho's argument that his sentence should be\n\nreduced to account for the two months he had already spent in state\n\ncustody    or     that     of       federal     immigration          authorities        pending\n\ndisposition of the present case.                   See Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at\n\n520.\n\n            Coelho's argument that it would have been reasonable to\n\nreduce    his   sentence         on       the   grounds          argued   here      reflects    a\n\nmisunderstanding          of    our        standard         of     review     under     Booker.\n\n\"Reasonableness entails a range of potential sentences, as opposed\n\nto a single precise result.\"                United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194,\n\n204 (1st Cir. 2006).            Accordingly, an appellant must explain not\n\nwhy a desired sentence would be reasonable but why the imposed\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fsentence was unreasonable.   United States v. Nichols, 464 F.3d\n\n1117, 1124, 1126 (9th Cir. 2006).    Where, as here, the imposed\n\nsentence is within the advisory guidelines range, that burden is\n\nheavy, United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n2006), and Coelho has failed to meet it.\n\n          Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed. See 1st Cir.
