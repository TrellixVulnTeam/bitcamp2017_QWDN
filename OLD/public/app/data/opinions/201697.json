This appeal concerns primarily\n\nthe sufficiency of a complaint alleging securities fraud under the\n\nstandards    of    the      Private       Securities       Litigation         Reform   Act\n\n(“PSLRA”), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4.              With respect to most of the claims,\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\ngranted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, based principally on the\n\ncourt’s    conclusion       that    the    allegations      were       insufficient     to\n\nsatisfy the PSLRA’s required pleading standards.                       On the remaining\n\nclaims, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants\n\nand then entered a final judgment.                  We affirm the judgment as to\n\nsome of the claims and vacate as to others.\n\nI.   Background\n\n     The    lead    plaintiffs,          Ram   Trust    Services,       Inc.    and    Lens\n\nInvestment Management, LLC, are stockholders of Stone & Webster\n\nInc. (“S&W” or the “Company”), and purport to represent a class of\n\nall purchasers of securities of S&W between January 22, 1998, and\n\nMay 8, 2000. They brought this consolidated securities-fraud class\n\naction against S&W; its chairman, president, and chief executive\n\nofficer, H. Kerner Smith; its executive vice president and chief\n\nfinancial     officer,        Thomas           Langford;       and      its      auditor,\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers,            LLP    (“PwC”).       The     claims    against     the\n\nCompany    were    stayed    at     the    outset      because    it    had    filed   for\n\nprotection under the bankruptcy laws.                   See 11 U.S.C. § 362.            The\n\naction proceeded against Smith, Langford, and PwC.\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f       The very lengthy Amended Complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges\n\nessentially that S&W, with the complicity of the other defendants,\n\nissued fraudulent financial statements and press releases, designed\n\nto conceal S&W’s rapidly worsening financial condition. It asserts\n\nthat    S&W,   a    111-year-old      “global   leader”       in   construction,\n\nengineering,       and   consulting   services,   with    consolidated      gross\n\nrevenues in 1999 exceeding $1.2 billion, ¶ 14, began in 1998 to\n\nexperience rapid deterioration of its financial condition, which\n\nSmith and Langford aimed to conceal while they sought a purchaser\n\nfor the Company.         It alleges that PwC also concealed the Company’s\n\nmisleading accounting by making false statements to the effect that\n\nS&W’s   financial        statements   were   prepared    in    accordance    with\n\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and that in\n\nauditing and certifying S&W’s statements, PwC followed Generally\n\nAccepted Accounting Standards (“GAAS”).\n\n       The Complaint’s strongest factual allegations fall into three\n\nmain categories, which will be explored in greater detail below.\n\nThey are, first, that S&W deliberately underbid on more than a\n\nbillion dollars of contracts, which at the contract price could be\n\nperformed only at a loss, and fraudulently reported anticipatory\n\nprofits on these loss contracts, so as to overstate earnings;\n\nsecond, that S&W fraudulently concealed its loss on a huge contract\n\nin Indonesia with Trans Pacific Petrochemical Indotama (“TPPI”) by\n\nconcealing the cancellation of the contract and thus reported\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\funreceived revenues, inflating the Company’s profits or diminishing\n\nits losses; and finally, that S&W made public statements, which\n\nconcealed and misrepresented its shortage of liquid reserves and\n\nits impending bankruptcy, as its finances slid into shambles.\n\n      Based chiefly on these allegations, the defendants are alleged\n\nto have violated § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\n(“Exchange Act” or “1934 Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5\n\npromulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, as well as § 18 of\n\nthe Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78r.    In addition, Smith and Langford\n\nare alleged to have violated § 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 78t(a), as persons in control of S&W.\n\nII.   Procedural History\n\n      In a memorandum and order dated March 28, 2003, the district\n\ncourt dismissed all claims against PwC and nearly all claims\n\nagainst Smith and Langford, finding that the Complaint failed to\n\nsatisfy the pleading requirements imposed by the PSLRA and Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 9(b) for securities fraud claims.     See In\n\nre Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 253 F. Supp. 2d 102, 136 (D.\n\nMass. 2003).      On August 25, 2003, the district court denied\n\nplaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend its complaint, on the grounds\n\nof undue delay.    See In re Stone & Webster Inc., Sec. Litig., 217\n\nF.R.D. 96 (D. Mass. 2003).      On September 23, 2003, the court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Smith and Langford as to the\n\nremaining claims against them, and on September 24, 2003, entered\n\n\n                                -5-\n\ffinal judgment.\n\nIII. Pertinent Elements of Plaintiffs’ Claims\n\n       The three different statutory bases of the claims under the\n\nExchange Act – § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder\n\n(“Rule 10b-5”), § 20(a), and § 18 – rest on slightly different\n\ntheories and thus have different elements, especially with respect\n\nto a plaintiff’s need to plead and prove that the defendant acted\n\nwith    a   specified        state   of   mind.      These    differences    have   a\n\nsignificant effect on this appeal.                 A summary of the elements of\n\nthese three claims, to the extent pertinent to this dispute, is as\n\nfollows.\n\n       The Supreme Court has described the “basic elements” of a\n\nclaim       under     Rule     10b-5      as     including:    (1)   “a     material\n\nmisrepresentation (or omission)”; (2) “scienter, i.e., a wrongful\n\nstate of mind”; (3) “a connection with the purchase or sale of a\n\nsecurity”; (4) “reliance”; (5) “economic loss”; and (6) “loss\n\ncausation.”         See Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 1631\n\n(2005) (emphasis removed); see also Wortley v. Camplin, 333 F.3d\n\n284, 294 (1st Cir. 2003); Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 34\n\n(1st Cir. 2001). To prove scienter, a plaintiff “must show either\n\nthat the defendant[] consciously intended to defraud, or that they\n\nacted with a high degree of recklessness.”                Aldridge v. A.T. Cross\n\nCorp., 284 F.3d 72, 82 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f     To succeed on a claim under § 18,1 that statute appears to\n\nrequire a plaintiff to plead and prove that (i) the defendant made\n\na false or misleading statement, (ii) the statement was contained\n\nin a document “filed” pursuant to the Exchange Act or any rule or\n\nregulation thereunder, (iii) reliance on the false statement, and\n\n(iv) resulting loss to the plaintiff.2   Under this statute, unlike\n\n\n     1\n         Section 18 provides, in relevant part:\n\n     Any person who shall make or cause to be made any\n     statement in any application, report, or document filed\n     pursuant to this chapter or any rule or regulation\n     thereunder . . . which statement was at the time and in\n     the light of the circumstances under which it was made\n     false or misleading with respect to any material fact,\n     shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such\n     statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon\n     such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security\n     at a price which was affected by such statement, for\n     damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued\n     shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no\n     knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. .\n     . .\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78r(a).\n     2\n      With respect to the instant case, the district court ruled\nthat under § 18 plaintiffs must show specific reliance on an\nallegedly misleading statement, and cannot rely on a presumption of\nfraud on the market as in Rule 10b-5 cases. See In re Stone &\nWebster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 253 F. Supp. 2d at 135 (citing Linder\nDividend Fund, Inc. v. Ernst & Young, 880 F. Supp. 49, 56-57 (D.\nMass. 1995)); see also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 247\n(1988). No party directly challenges that ruling in this appeal,\nand so we have no reason to review it here. The district court\nalso read the Complaint as alleging reliance only by the named\nplaintiffs and failing to allege reliance by the class plaintiffs,\nthus permitting only the named plaintiffs to pursue § 18 claims.\nSee In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 253 F. Supp. 2d at\n135. We are skeptical of this reading of the Complaint, especially\ngiven the obligation to construe the Complaint in the light most\nfavorable to plaintiffs.    However, we refrain from expressing\n\n                                -7-\n\fRule 10b-5, a plaintiff bears no burden of proving that the\n\ndefendant acted with any particular state of mind.        See Magna\n\nInvest. Corp. v. John Does One Through Two Hundred, 931 F.2d 38,\n\n39-40 (11th Cir. 1991).   The state of mind with which the defendant\n\nacted enters the case instead as a defense.     The statute provides\n\nthat the defendant can rebut liability by proving “that he acted in\n\ngood faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or\n\nmisleading. . . .”    See 15 U.S.C. § 78r(a).\n\n     Section 20(a) asserts the liability of persons exercising\n\ncontrol for violations of law by a controlled entity.3    Smith and\n\nLangford are alleged to have exercised control over S&W, and\n\n\nfurther views, as this finding by the district court was not\ndirectly raised as part of the appeal, and we anticipate that it\nwill be subject to litigation on remand.\n     In addition, as among the array of documents alleged by\nplaintiffs in their Complaint to contain false statements, only the\nstatements made in S&W’s annual (“10-K”) filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are deemed “filed” for\nthe purposes of § 18. Again, the district court so ruled, id., and\nno party challenges that determination in this appeal.\n\n     3\n         Section 20(a) provides:\n\n     Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any\n     person liable under any provision of this chapter or of\n     any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable\n     jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such\n     controlled person to any person to whom such controlled\n     person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in\n     good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the\n     act or acts constituting the violation or cause of\n     action.\n\n15 U.S.C. 78t(a).\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\ftherefore to share liability for S&W’s violations of Rule 10b-5.\n\nThe   elements   of   §   20(a)    are    generally   stated   to   be   (i)   an\n\nunderlying violation of the same chapter of the securities laws by\n\nthe controlled entity, here S&W; and (ii) control of the primary\n\nviolator by the defendant.           See 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a); see also\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 84-85.\n\n      As with § 18, and once again unlike Rule 10b-5, § 20(a) does\n\nnot on its face obligate the plaintiff to plead or prove scienter\n\n(or any other state of mind) on the part of the controlling persons\n\nnamed as a defendant.4            Instead, the burden is shifted.              The\n\ndefendant can rebut liability by proving that he or she “acted in\n\ngood faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or\n\nacts constituting the violation or cause of action.” See 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 78t(a).\n\nIV.   Standards Imposed by the PSLRA and Rule 9(b)\n\n      Three provisions of the PSLRA are of significance for this\n\nappeal.   The first is a pleading requirement, which specifies that\n\n\n\n      4\n        Some courts have indicated that the plaintiff must prove\n“culpable participation” on the part of the controlling person.\nSee S.E.C. v. First Jersey Sec., Inc., 101 F.3d 1450, 1472 (2d Cir.\n1996) (citing Gordon v. Burr, 506 F.2d 1080, 1085 (2d Cir. 1974));\nRochez Bros., Inc. v. Rhoades, 527 F.2d 880, 890 (3d Cir. 1975).\nThis Circuit has taken no position on the question. See Aldridge,\n284 F.3d at 85. The district court in the instant case did not\nrule on the question, see In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,\n253 F. Supp. 2d at 135, and the parties did not brief it.        We\ntherefore again take no position in this decision on whether\n“culpable participation” is required, or on what it means.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fa complaint alleging securities fraud must “specify each statement\n\nalleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the\n\nstatement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the\n\nstatement or omission is made on information and belief, the\n\ncomplaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that\n\nbelief is formed.”     15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1).5       In the body of this\n\nopinion, we will refer to this provision of § 78u-4(b)(1) as the\n\nPSLRA’s “clarity-and-basis” requirement.        There is no dispute that\n\nit applies to every claim alleged in the Complaint.\n\n     We have explained previously that to satisfy this provision,\n\na complaint “must provide factual support for the claim that the\n\nstatements or omissions were fraudulent, that is, facts that show\n\nexactly    why   the   statements    or    omissions   were   misleading.”\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 78; see also Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,\n\n194 F.3d 185, 193-94 (1st Cir. 1999).           The plaintiff need not,\n\n\n     5\n          The full text of this provision reads:\n\n     In any private action arising under this chapter in which\n     the plaintiff alleges that the defendant--\n     (A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or\n     (B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order\n     to make the statements made, in the light of the\n     circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;\n\n     the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to\n     have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the\n     statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding\n     the statement or omission is made on information and\n     belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all\n     facts on which that belief is formed.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fhowever, go so far as to “plead evidence.”        See In re Cabletron\n\nSys., Inc., 311 F.3d 11, 33 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     The PSLRA’s clarity-and-basis requirement is closely related\n\nto the requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) that in\n\n“all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting\n\nfraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.”            We have\n\nobserved that the PSLRA’s pleading standard is “congruent and\n\nconsistent” with pre-existing Rule 9(b) pleading standards in this\n\nCircuit.   See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 193.\n\n     The   second   relevant    PSLRA    provision,   also   a   pleading\n\nrequirement, provides,\n\n     in any private action arising under this chapter in which\n     the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof\n     that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,\n     the complaint shall, with respect to each act or omission\n     alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity\n     facts giving rise to a strong inference that the\n     defendant acted with the required state of mind.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2).       We have interpreted this provision as\n\ndemanding a recitation of facts supporting a “highly likely”\n\ninference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 82.       We have explained, that “[u]nder the\n\nPSLRA, the complaint must state with particularity facts that give\n\nrise to a ‘strong inference’ of [the required state of mind],\n\nrather than merely a reasonable inference. . . .        The inference .\n\n. . must be reasonable and strong, but need not be irrefutable.”\n\nIn re Cabletron Systems, Inc., 311 F.3d at 38 (quoting 15 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f78u-4(b)(2)); see also Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 82.           In this opinion,\n\nwe will refer to this provision of §78u-4(b)(2) as the “strong-\n\ninference” requirement of the PSLRA.\n\n     In addition to these two pleading requirements, the PSLRA also\n\ncarves out a statutory safe-harbor for many “forward-looking”\n\nstatements.   See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5.       “Forward-looking” statements\n\nare, generally speaking, statements that speak predictively of the\n\nfuture.   See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(i)(1) (defining “forward-looking\n\nstatement”). Under the safe harbor provisions, fraudulent forward-\n\nlooking   statements   cannot   give    rise   to   liability     in   certain\n\ncircumstances,   including      where    the   statement     at    issue   is\n\n“identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by\n\nmeaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that\n\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those in the\n\nforward-looking statement.”      See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1).\n\n     The clarity-and-basis requirement of the PSLRA and its limited\n\nsafe harbor for forward-looking statements seem to apply equally to\n\nclaims under Rule 10b-5, § 18, and § 20(a).         However, because Rule\n\n10b-5, § 18, and § 20(a) differ as to whether the plaintiff must\n\nprove that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the\n\nPSLRA’s strong-inference requirement applies differently as among\n\nthe three theories.\n\n     By the terms of the PSLRA, the strong-inference requirement\n\napplies only to private actions “in which the plaintiff may recover\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fmoney damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a\n\nparticular state of mind.”   A claim under Rule 10b-5 falls within\n\nthose parameters.   Under 10b-5 the plaintiff must prove that the\n\ndefendant acted with scienter.    Thus, the PSLRA requires that the\n\nComplaint allege with particularity facts giving rise to a strong\n\ninference of scienter.   In contrast, §§ 18 and 20(a) do not, at\n\nleast on their face, require that the plaintiff prove that the\n\ndefendant acted with any particular state of mind.     The strong-\n\ninference requirement of the PSLRA therefore has no application to\n\nclaims under these statutes.6\n\nV.   Applicable Accounting Standards\n\n     Before turning to the precise allegations of the Complaint, we\n\n\n     6\n        As noted above in footnote four, this Circuit has taken no\nposition on the question whether a plaintiff must prove “culpable\nparticipation” on the part of the defendant in order to prevail\nunder § 20(a).      See Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 85.        “Culpable\nparticipation” would seem to imply a culpable state of mind. If\nthat is an element of a claim under § 20(a), the PSLRA’s strong-\ninference requirement would appear to apply, as well.\n     Because defendants have not argued on appeal that “culpable\nparticipation” in an element of plaintiffs’ case under § 20(a), we\nwill assume throughout this opinion that it is not an element and\nthat the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA accordingly has\nno application to a claim under § 20(a). It is not our intention,\nhowever, to foreclose that question. As we are remanding several\nclaims under § 20(a), we leave it to the district court to\ndetermine, in the first instance, if the issue is raised, whether\n“culpable participation” applies.      Should the district court\ndetermine that “culpable participation” is an element of a claim\nunder § 20(a) and that the strong-inference requirement of the\nPSLRA therefore applies, this may require the dismissal of claims\nwe have remanded. Because of the commonality of elements of claims\nunder §§ 20(a) and 18, rulings one way or another in the district\ncourt as to § 18 may well moot the question whether § 20(a)\nrequires “culpable participation.”\n\n                                 -13-\n\fpause to discuss briefly certain accounting standards for long-term\n\nconstruction contracts, which are integral to an understanding of\n\nthe Complaint.\n\n      Long-term     construction   contracts    can   characteristically\n\ninvolve early periods during which the contractor’s expenditures\n\nfar exceed its revenues and later periods during which its revenues\n\nfar   exceed   expenditures.       Depending    how   the    revenues   and\n\nexpenditures are accounted for, the profit and loss statements of\n\ncontractors engaged in such long-term construction projects might\n\npresent the appearance of drastic gyrations, beginning with large\n\nlosses and later shifting to large profits, even though on a\n\nsophisticated analysis, the company’s experience would reflect a\n\npredictable, orderly progress toward a predictable result.\n\n      To counteract such misleading appearances of unpredictable\n\ngyrations, and present a more realistic picture of the stability of\n\noperating results, the accounting profession has developed, as part\n\nof GAAP, two accounting methods designed in proper circumstances to\n\nsmooth out the reported operating results of such businesses.           The\n\nComplaint points to, and quotes extensively from, three accounting\n\ndocuments, which provide guidance: American Institute of Certified\n\nPublic Accountants Statement of Position 81-1: Accounting for\n\nPerformance    of   Construction-Type     and   Certain     Production-Type\n\nContracts (1981) (“SOP 81-1”), see ¶ 40, Accounting Research\n\nBulletin 45: Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts (1955) (“ARB\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f45”), see id., and Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement\n\nof Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (“FAS 5\"), see, e.g., ¶¶\n\n44, 76.\n\n     According to SOP 81-1 and ARB 45, as we understand them, the\n\nmost favored method for a contractor to account for long-term\n\nconstruction       contracts,      in     appropriate       circumstances,        is\n\n“percentage-of-completion” accounting.              Under this approach, the\n\ncontractor recognizes revenues expected to be received in the\n\nfuture, as well as net profits expected to be realized, as work on\n\na contract progresses, notwithstanding that the contractor may not\n\nyet have received payment.              In appropriate circumstances, this\n\naccounting method is thought to best reflect the actual “economic\n\nsubstance” of a contractor’s transactions and therefore to be\n\npreferable.      SOP 81-1 ¶¶ .22, .25.         Under percentage-of-completion\n\naccounting, generally speaking, regardless of whether revenues have\n\nbeen received, a company recognizes as current revenue on its\n\nprofit    and   loss   statement    that       percentage   of   total    expected\n\nrevenue, which reflects the percentage that the costs incurred in\n\nthe period bear to total estimated costs on the project.                  ARB 45 ¶\n\n4.   Various conditions must be present to justify the use of this\n\nmethod, such as the expectation that the buyer will satisfy its\n\nobligations under the contract, and “the ability to make reasonably\n\ndependable      estimates,”   including        “estimates   of   the     extent   of\n\nprogress toward completion, contract revenues, and contract costs.”\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fSOP 81-1 ¶ .23. The current recognition of expected future profit,\n\nfurthermore, presupposes that the contract be expected to yield a\n\nprofit.    See id. ¶¶ .25, .85.\n\n       The second generally accepted method of accounting for such\n\ncontracts is called the completed-contract method.               See generally\n\nid. ¶¶ .04, .30-.33. Under this method, “income is recognized only\n\nwhen a contract is completed or substantially completed.“                Id. ¶\n\n.30.   Until that point, for the duration of contract performance,\n\n“billings and costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, but no\n\nprofit or income is recorded.”      Id.   The completed-contract method\n\nis viewed as preferable when reasonably dependable estimates cannot\n\nbe made or “inherent hazards” relating to contract conditions make\n\nprofit predictions unreliable.          See id. ¶ .32.           A recognized\n\nweakness of the completed-contract method is that it “does not\n\nreflect current performance when the period of a contract extends\n\nbeyond    one   accounting   period,”   and   “may    result     in   irregular\n\nrecognition of income.”      See id. ¶ .30.\n\n       Third, in circumstances where “estimating the final outcome\n\nmay be impractical except to assure that no loss will be incurred,”\n\npercentage-of-completion      accounting,     with    a   zero    estimate   of\n\nprofit, may be utilized.       See id. ¶ .25.        In doing so, a company\n\nrecognizes revenues (even though not yet received) equal to its\n\ncosts incurred in the period “until results can be estimated more\n\nprecisely.”     Id.\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f     This zero-profit-margin approach resembles the completed-\n\ncontract method in some respects and resembles percentage-of-\n\ncompletion in others. The similarity to completed-contract lies in\n\nthe fact that, under both methods, no estimated future profit is\n\nrecognized on a current basis as the job progresses.         Profit is\n\nrecognized   only   upon    substantial   completion.     Its   greater\n\nresemblance to percentage-of-completion lies in the fact that\n\ncurrent costs, matched by equal amounts of anticipated revenue, are\n\nrecognized in the current profit and loss statement, while under\n\nthe completed-contract method, neither costs nor revenues from the\n\nproject are reflected in the current profit and loss statement\n\nuntil substantial completion of the project.7           See id. ¶ .33.\n\nThus, the zero-profit-margin approach       provides an indication in\n\nthe income statement of the “volume of a company’s business”\n\nactivity while the completed-contract approach does not.        Id.\n\n     Regardless of the method employed, however, anticipated losses\n\nare accounted for differently from anticipated profits.         “[W]hen\n\n\n     7\n         SOP 81-1 states:\n\n     Under the zero profit margin approach to applying the\n     percentage-of-completion method, equal amounts of revenue\n     and cost, measured on the basis of performance during the\n     period, are presented in the income statement; whereas,\n     under the completed-contract method, performance for a\n     period is not reflected in the income statement, and no\n     amount is presented in the income statement until the\n     contract is completed.\n\nSOP 81-1 ¶ .33.\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fthe current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost\n\nindicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract\n\nshould be made.”          Id. ¶ .85; see also ARB 45 ¶¶ 6, 11.                  Such\n\nprovision for losses should be made “in the period in which they\n\nbecome evident.”       SOP 81-1 ¶ .85.\n\n      The full amount of a “probable” loss should be taken as a\n\ncharge against income if the amount of the loss “can be reasonably\n\nestimated,” according to FAS 5.              See FAS 5 ¶ 8.    If the amount of\n\nthe   loss    cannot    be    reasonably      estimated,    “disclosure    of    the\n\ncontingency shall [instead] be made . . . indicat[ing] the nature\n\nof the contingency and . . . giv[ing] an estimate of the possible\n\nloss or range of loss” where possible.                  Id. ¶ 10.     Likewise, if\n\nthere is only a “reasonable possibility” of a loss instead of a\n\n“probable” loss, disclosure instead of accrual is appropriate. Id.\n\n“Probable” is defined by FAS 5 to mean “likely to occur.”                 Id. ¶ 3.\n\nVI.   Discussion\n\nA.    Allegations of the Complaint as to Smith and Langford\n\n      Against    this        background     of    pertinent   legal     rules    and\n\naccounting principles, we turn to the central allegations in the\n\nComplaint, which as noted earlier, can be grouped into three\n\ngeneral categories.\n\n1.    Underbid Projects\n\n      The first category of plaintiffs’ claims principally relates\n\nto    the    allegation       that   S&W     underbid    various    projects     and\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\ffraudulently reported expected profits from these projects when, in\n\nfact, the projects were expected to produce losses.      The district\n\ncourt dismissed all of these claims on the ground that the pleading\n\nfailed to satisfy the PSLRA’s requirement of clarity and basis. We\n\nconclude that at least with respect to some of the claims, the\n\nclarity-and-basis requirement was satisfied.\n\n     (a)    PSLRA’s requirement of clarity and basis.    In our view,\n\nthis pleading is not the kind of vague prelude to a fishing\n\nexpedition that Congress sought to bar by imposing the clarity-and-\n\nbasis requirement of the PSLRA. Citing sources within the company,\n\nthe Complaint alleges that S&W developed a strategy of bidding a\n\nnumber of projects at a loss.     ¶¶ 52-53.   The Complaint expressly\n\nnames ten contracts, aggregating over $1.4 billion, which allegedly\n\nwere underbid by margins between 10% and 40% and were expected to\n\nproduce losses.    ¶¶ 58-61.   The Complaint alleges that the Company\n\naccounted    for   these   projects   using   percentage-of-completion\n\naccounting, recognizing a proration of anticipated future profits\n\nin the current profit and loss statements, notwithstanding that\n\nlosses, rather than profits, were expected to result from these\n\ncontracts.    ¶¶ 43, 47, 168.     The Complaint refers to SOP 81-1,\n\nwhich forbids the use of the percentage-of-completion method to\n\nprorate anticipated future profits into current operating results\n\nunless future profits are in fact anticipated, see SOP 81-1 ¶¶ .24-\n\n.25, as well as FAS 5, which requires immediate recognition of\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fexpected losses, as soon as they are anticipated, see FAS 5 ¶ 8;\n\nSOP 81-1, ¶¶ .24, .85.          The Complaint identifies with precision\n\nstatements alleged to be false, including S&W’s periodic current\n\nearnings figures in its sequential profit and loss statements\n\nduring the period of the alleged fraud.\n\n     With respect to clarity, the Complaint sets forth a clear and\n\nprecise statement of what the alleged fraud consisted of.              With\n\nrespect to basis, while the sources of information on which the\n\nComplaint relies for these allegations are not overwhelmingly\n\nimpressive, they include sources within the Company who might well\n\nhave access to the kind of information for which they are cited.\n\nFurthermore, the allegations are not merely conclusory, but are\n\nrather supported by details that provide factual support for\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations of fraud.\n\n     We   find   that   these    pleadings   complied   sufficiently   with\n\nPSLRA’s requirement of clarity and basis, as well as with the\n\npreexisting requirements of Rule 9(b).         See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\n\nWe have previously stated that PSLRA does not require the plaintiff\n\nto “plead evidence.”     See In re Cabletron Systems, Inc., 311 F.3d\n\nat 33.    As we understand, it was not Congress’s intention to bar\n\nall suits as to which the plaintiff could not yet prove a prima\n\nfacie case at the time of the complaint, but rather to prevent\n\nsuits based on a guess that fraud may be found, without reasonable\n\nbasis or a clear understanding as to what the fraud consisted of,\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fbut in the hope of finding something in the course of discovery.\n\nCf. In re Cabletron Systems, Inc., 311 F.3d at 30 (observing that\n\nthe “statute was designed to erect barriers to frivolous strike\n\nsuits, but not to make meritorious claims impossible to bring”).\n\n     To the extent that the district court dismissed these claims\n\non the grounds that they failed to satisfy the clarity-and-basis\n\nrequirement of PSLRA, we respectfully disagree.                 It does not\n\nnecessarily follow, however, that the dismissal of all of those\n\nclaims should be vacated.     We believe some of the claims relating\n\nto the underbidding of contracts were fatally flawed for other\n\nreasons and thus affirm the dismissal as to some of them.\n\n     (b)    Strong inference of scienter.           As noted, the PSLRA\n\nimposes an additional hurdle:          The Complaint must allege facts\n\nsupporting a strong inference of whatever state of mind on the part\n\nof the defendant must be proved as an element of the claim.\n\n            (i)   Claims under 10b-5.       To the extent these claims are\n\nasserted under Rule 10b-5, the plaintiffs must prove that the\n\ndefendants acted with scienter in order to establish their right of\n\nrecovery.    Accordingly, under the PSLRA, the Complaint must state\n\nwith particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the\n\ndefendants   acted   with   either    knowing,    intentional    falsity   or\n\nreckless disregard for the truthfulness of the statements.\n\n     We find the Complaint deficient in this respect.            First, the\n\nComplaint provides nothing supporting the inference that either\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fSmith or Langford was directly involved in the detailed accounting\n\nfor these ten particular contracts, or had knowledge of the alleged\n\nfalsity.    One could draw the inference that Langford, as the Chief\n\nFinancial    Officer,   had   some   supervisory   involvement    with   the\n\naccounting.    But no strong inference necessarily follows that the\n\nChief Financial Officer, much less the Chief Executive Officer, was\n\naware of the improper proration of future profits on any particular\n\nunderbid contract.\n\n      This weakness is accentuated by another.            The larger the\n\ndistortion of the company’s accounting figures, the more likely it\n\nmight be that such distortion could not be accomplished without\n\neither complicity, or reckless irresponsibility, of top officers.\n\nThe Complaint, however, gives no indication whatsoever what the\n\nsize of the alleged overstatement of current profits was.          Such an\n\noverstatement, in the circumstances alleged, would result primarily\n\nfrom two variables – the size of the expected future loss which\n\nshould have been taken as a charge against current earnings, see\n\nFAS 5 ¶ 8, and the size of the improperly anticipated future\n\nprofits prorated into the current profit and loss statement.             The\n\nComplaint says nothing of the size of either component.\n\n      Indeed, the Complaint at times does not even assert that a\n\nloss was expected from these underbid contracts.          Its description\n\nof   the   “underbidding   policy”    asserts   that   Smith   planned   the\n\n“selling [of] fixed-price jobs either at a loss or with such small\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fmargin for error that the slightest adverse change in a project’s\n\neconomics would cause S&W to lose money on the job.”                            ¶ 53\n\n(emphasis added).         According to this description, the contracts\n\nwere       bid   near   the   expected    break-even    point,      or   with    the\n\nexpectation of a small and unreliable profit, rather than with\n\nexpectation of a loss.\n\n       We    recognize    that   in   assessing   a   motion   to    dismiss     for\n\ninsufficient pleading, we must read the Complaint in the manner\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff, drawing reasonable inferences in\n\nthe plaintiff’s favor, see Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 79, and that\n\ninconsistent pleading does not deprive the pleader of the right to\n\nhave the complaint read, as between the inconsistencies, in the\n\nmanner that supports the adequacy of the pleading.                   The PSLRA’s\n\nstrong-inference requirement does not change this rule.8                   Because\n\n\n       8\n      One difficulty we find with the district court’s decision is\nthat in several instances, in ruling on defendants’ motion to\ndismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court\nfailed to read the Complaint in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiff and failed to give the plaintiff the benefit of\ninferences that could reasonably be drawn. For example, where the\ncourt found “internal inconsisten[cies]” in the allegations, it\nconcluded that the conflicting allegations “undermine[d] the\nsufficiency of [the] claim.” See In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec.\nLitig., 253 F. Supp. 2d at 120-21.\n     A plaintiff has the right to plead in the alternative, and the\nplaintiff’s doing so does not undermine the validity of the\ncomplaint. The stronger of the conflicting allegations must be\naccepted as if the conflicting alternative allegation had not been\nincluded.   Nor is this changed by the PSLRA’s strong-inference\nrequirement.    In assessing whether the pleading satisfies the\nstrong-inference requirement, a court must draw all reasonable\ninferences in the plaintiff’s favor, and then weigh whether they\nsatisfy the statutorily mandated “strong inference.” See Aldridge,\n\n                                         -23-\n\fthe Complaint elsewhere asserts that the ten projects were bid “at\n\na loss,” ¶ 58, we credit the Complaint as asserting that the\n\nprojects were indeed bid at a loss, rather than at the break-even\n\npoint or at a slight profit.       Nonetheless, the Complaint in no way\n\nsuggests that the losses anticipated from these contracts were\n\nlarge.\n\n       At one point, the Complaint asserts that “[a]ccording to . .\n\n. former S&W insiders, S&W’s underbidding [of those contracts]\n\nranged from 10% to 40%.”       ¶ 61.    But it says nothing about how much\n\nloss would be expected to result from underbidding by 10% to 40%.\n\nThat would depend on the anticipated profit margins of a normal\n\nbid, not affected by the underbidding strategy, and the Complaint\n\nincludes no allegation about that.            Nor does the Complaint allege\n\nwhat   percentage   of   the   Company’s      net   operating   figures   were\n\nattributable to the ten contracts.\n\n       In short, the Complaint tells no more than that, in the\n\naccounting for ten contracts, a profit of unspecified size was\n\nrecognized in current earnings when, according to GAAP principles,\n\nthose contracts should have been booked either as a loss of\n\nunspecified size or using a zero-profit-margin assumption coupled\n\nwith a note describing a loss contingency.            As anything above the\n\nbreak-even point represents profit, and anything below the break-\n\neven point represents loss, the difference between profit and loss\n\n\n284 F.3d at 78; Greebel, 194 F.3d at 201.\n\n                                       -24-\n\fcan on a particular contract be tiny.                Nothing in the Complaint\n\nsuggests that       correct accounting for these contracts would have\n\ninvolved       significantly     different     overall      numbers    from      those\n\nproduced     by    the   allegedly     incorrect    accounting.       And     if   the\n\naccounting for those contracts had no significant effect on the\n\nCompany’s overall results, there is little reason to assume that\n\nthe Company’s CEO and CFO must have known about the failure to\n\nfollow      accepted      accounting    practices.         Irregular      financial\n\nstatements which overstate estimated results to only a small degree\n\ndo not support a strong inference that the Chief Executive Office\n\nor the Chief Financial Officer of the company acted with intent to\n\ndefraud,     or    with    reckless     disregard    for    the   truth     of     the\n\nstatements.\n\n      A third significant weakness in the alleged basis of scienter\n\nis that in such accounting, the question whether to recognize\n\nprofit or loss depends not on concrete facts but an estimation or\n\nprediction of whether in the end the project will net a profit or\n\na   loss.    The    Complaint    fails    to   allege      particularized      facts\n\nsupporting the inference that a reasonable assessment of the facts\n\nrelating to those underbid contracts could support a prediction\n\nonly of loss.9\n\n\n\n      9\n      In addition, we agree with the district court that Smith and\nLangford’s change-in-control agreements did not provide a strong\nmotive to engage in fraud. See In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec.\nLitig., 253 F. Supp. 2d at 127-28.\n\n                                        -25-\n\f     Accordingly,    we   determine     that   the    claims   of    fraud   for\n\nimproper    proration   of   future    profits   on   these    ten    allegedly\n\nunderbid contracts, to the extent asserted under Rule 10b-5, as to\n\nwhich “the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that\n\nthe defendant acted with [scienter],” fail the requirement of the\n\nPSLRA that “the complaint . . . state with particularity facts\n\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with\n\n[scienter].”    15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2).         As to those 10b-5 claims,\n\nwe affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing them.\n\n     We reach a different result, however, where those claims are\n\nasserted under §§ 20(a) and 18.\n\n            (ii) Claims under §§ 20(a) and 18.          As explained above,\n\nthe PSLRA’s strong-inference requirement does not apply to claims\n\nunder § 20(a), because this statute does not require proof of the\n\ndefendant’s state of mind.10\n\n     We recognize that a plaintiff must show under § 20(a) that the\n\ncontrolled entity committed a violation of the securities laws. If\n\nthat violation was, for example, a violation of Rule 10b-5, which\n\nrequires a proof of scienter, then the plaintiff under § 20(a) must\n\nprove that the controlled entity acted with “a particular state of\n\nmind.”    Nonetheless, if the statute is read literally, the strong-\n\ninference requirement of the PSLRA does not apply.                  The statute\n\nstates that the strong-inference requirement applies only where the\n\n\n     10\n           See, though, supra note 6.\n\n                                      -26-\n\fplaintiff’s recovery depends on proof that “the defendant acted\n\nwith a particular state of mind” (emphasis added).                See 15 U.S.C.\n\n§   78u-4(b)(2).     The    obligation    to    prove     that   the   controlled\n\ncorporation acted with scienter does not involve an obligation to\n\nprove “that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind.”11\n\n      Section 18 similarly imposes no burden on plaintiff to prove\n\nthe defendant’s state of mind, shifting the burden to the defendant\n\nto show “that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such\n\nstatement was false or misleading.”                 See 15 U.S.C. § 78r(a).\n\nAccordingly, the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA has no\n\napplication to § 18.\n\n      With respect to the claims under §§ 20(a) and 18 based on\n\nimproper recognition of anticipated profits on underbid contracts,\n\n(1)   we   reject   the    reasons    given    by   the   district     court   for\n\ndismissing these claims, and (2) we conclude that the reasons which\n\nsupport our order of dismissal of the similar claim under Rule 10b-\n\n5 have no application to these claims.              Accordingly we vacate the\n\njudgment dismissing them.            As to whether one or both of those\n\nclaims is subject to possible dismissal for other reasons, we\n\n\n      11\n        We recognize that this plain language reading of the PSLRA\nallows the secondary liability claims to go forward where claims of\nprimary liability have been dismissed.       There may be policy\narguments counseling for a broader reading of the PSLRA. As to\nthis case, however, such arguments have not been made and we\ntherefore do not consider them. For purposes of this case, we read\nthe PSLRA as written, leaving the question whether the statute\nshould be interpreted more broadly to be addressed if and when such\nargument is advanced.\n\n                                      -27-\n\fexpress no view.     We remand the claims under §§ 20(a) and 18 to the\n\ndistrict court for whatever further proceedings are appropriate.\n\n     (c) Backlog.       In addition to alleging that the policy of\n\nunderbidding      resulted   in    materially     overstated      earnings,   the\n\nComplaint also alleges that it was misleading of defendants to\n\ninclude the underbid contracts in S&W’s “backlog.”                See, e.g., ¶¶\n\n228, 248-49, 251, 254, 284, 313-15.             As to these claims, brought\n\nunder Rule 10b-5, § 20(a), and § 18, we sustain the district\n\ncourt’s dismissal.     Plaintiffs have simply failed to plead a false\n\nstatement with respect to the “backlog” allegations, and so their\n\nclaims must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n12(b)(6).    As defined by the Complaint, S&W’s backlog consisted of\n\n“the accumulated amount of the Company’s committed, but unexpended,\n\ncontractual work.”     ¶ 38.      These contracts represented “committed,\n\nbut unexpended, contractual work.”             The statements resulting from\n\nthe inclusion of the contracts in the backlog were neither false\n\nnor misleading.\n\n2.   The TPPI Project and “Phantom Revenue”\n\n     The second group of claims of fraud relates to the TPPI\n\ncontract    for   construction     in    Indonesia,   which    was   ultimately\n\ncancelled for lack of funding.            The Complaint alleges that S&W,\n\nwith the knowledge of Smith and Langford, reported expected future\n\npayments    as    current    revenues,     even    though   the    project    was\n\nindefinitely suspended and defendants knew it was unlikely to ever\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fbe resumed.   The Complaint alleges that S&W overstated its current\n\nrevenues and concealed an expected loss, which according to GAAP\n\nprinciples should have been recognized.\n\n      The allegations are essentially as follows:            In 1996, TPPI\n\nawarded to S&W a $710-million contract in connection with the\n\nconstruction of a $2.3-billion chemical complex in Indonesia.              ¶\n\n63.   S&W procured and transported to Indonesia approximately $332\n\nmillion worth of materials and equipment to perform the project.\n\n¶   64.    Under   its    agreements,   S&W   assumed   responsibility   for\n\ncancellation costs with respect to equipment purchase orders and\n\nsubcontract work.        ¶¶ 64-65.\n\n      In 1997, TPPI suspended work on the project because its\n\nfunding arrangements were exhausted.          ¶ 65.   The Complaint alleges\n\nthat “TPPI suggested to S&W [in 1997] that it try to get out of its\n\ncontracts with its vendors due to the suspension.”           Id.   By August\n\n1998, S&W obtained permission from TPPI to resell project materials\n\nand equipment, and it began selling equipment, according to Daniel\n\nMartino, a former senior accountant at S&W, “for pennies on the\n\ndollar.”    ¶¶ 58, 73.\n\n      By January 1999, “it was clear that the project would not\n\nrestart,” and “TPPI had told S&W that the slight prospect that had\n\nexisted during 1998 that they would find an investor to fund the\n\nproject had fallen through.”         ¶ 74.    In January 1999, a special\n\nmeeting of the Company’s Board of Directors was held to discuss\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\fTPPI, and by the end of the meeting “it was evident to the Board\n\nthat the TPPI project had already caused S&W serious financial\n\nproblems and that it was unlikely the project would ever restart.”\n\n¶ 77.\n\n      The Complaint asserts that because the Company had incurred\n\nsubstantial costs without corresponding revenue, the suspension of\n\nthe project\n\n      should have had a significant negative effect on S&W’s\n      financial statements. According to CS-1 [an informant\n      who had been an assistant comptroller at S&W], to avoid\n      that negative effect, beginning with the first quarter of\n      1998, S&W created phantom revenue and receivables from\n      the TPPI project to cover S&W’s project related costs by\n      recording revenue equal to the amount of those costs.\n\n¶ 67.    S&W booked $86.9 million of such “phantom revenue” in\n\nconnection with TPPI in 1998 and $53 million in 1999.             ¶ 68.       The\n\nuse of this allegedly fraudulent accounting changed the Company’s\n\nresults in 1998 from a loss of $108.7 million to a reported loss of\n\n$49.3 million, and in 1999 from a loss of $11.3 million to reported\n\nnet income of $20.5 million.       Id.    Furthermore, because S&W knew\n\nthe   project   was   cancelled,   it   was   obligated   under   FAS     5   to\n\nimmediately recognize the entire expected loss either as a charge\n\nor as a loss contingency.     See ¶ 76.\n\n      While the notes to the financial statements did refer to a\n\nloss contingency based on TPPI, the Complaint alleges that the\n\nreferences were false in two respects.           First, the notes stated\n\nthat the Company “believes it unlikely that the project will be\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fcancelled,” or otherwise gave the impression of a likely restart,\n\nsee ¶¶ 209, 224, 296, while the apparent circumstances showed it\n\nwas highly likely the contract would be cancelled.          Second, the\n\namount of the loss estimated to result from the cancellation was\n\nsubstantially understated given the immense investment the Company\n\nhad made in the TPPI project and the high probability the entire\n\ninvestment would be lost if TPPI failed to reinstate the project.\n\n     In substance, the Complaint describes two separate, though\n\nrelated, accounting abuses in violation of GAAP principles: First,\n\nit alleges the overstatement of revenues (“phantom revenues”) and\n\nconcealment   of   loss   by   inappropriate   use   of   percentage-of-\n\ncompletion accounting (assuming a zero-profit margin) to report\n\ncurrent revenues not yet received, when the buyer could not “be\n\nexpected to satisfy [its] obligations under the contract.” See SOP\n\n81-1 ¶ .23.    The offsetting of the actual current losses with\n\nprojected revenues that were not expected ever to be received\n\nallegedly concealed large current losses on the project.        Second,\n\nthe Complaint alleges concealment of an expected loss by failure to\n\nacknowledge it appropriately, either as a charge to income, or as\n\nan accurately described loss contingency.      See FAS 5 ¶¶ 8, 10.   The\n\nComplaint alleges that as a result of these accounting decisions,\n\nS&W’s financial results published in the Company’s 10-K and 10-Q\n\nfilings, as well as in other public announcements, were materially\n\noverstated.\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\f       In addition, the Complaint alleges that S&W misled investors\n\nby carrying the TPPI project in its backlog, see, e.g., ¶ 221,\n\nfailing to acknowledge that the project was terminated or at least\n\nunlikely to restart, see, e.g., ¶¶ 166, 193, 209, 217, 224, 296,\n\nand reporting a materially understated estimate of the Company’s\n\nlosses when disclosing the “charge” S&W would take in the event the\n\nproject were to be cancelled, see, e.g., ¶¶ 209, 224, 296.\n\n       (a)    The PSLRA’s requirement of clarity and basis.          In our\n\nview, the allegations of exaggerated revenues and failure to report\n\nan expected loss are sufficiently detailed and supported to satisfy\n\nthe PSLRA’s clarity-and-basis requirement.\n\n       These allegations are quite detailed and clear in setting\n\nforth what are the allegedly false and misleading statements and in\n\nexplaining why they are false and misleading.          The GAAP documents\n\ncited by the Complaint specify that the propriety of reporting\n\nunreceived payments as current revenue, matched with currently\n\nincurred costs, depends on a reasonable expectation that the buyer\n\nwill satisfy the obligation to make the payments.          See SOP 81-1 ¶\n\n.23.         The   Complaint   adequately   explains     that   in    these\n\ncircumstances, TPPI, which had lost its source of funding and had\n\nindefinitely suspended all work on the project, could not be\n\nexpected to satisfy its contractual obligation to make payment.\n\n       It also seems clear from the GAAP documents that as soon as\n\n“current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\findicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract\n\nshould be made.”       See SOP 81-1 ¶ .85; see also ARB 45 ¶¶ 6, 11.        A\n\nprobable loss should be “accrued by a charge to income” when “the\n\namount of loss can be reasonably estimated.”                FAS 5 ¶ 8.      A\n\n“reasonable possibility” of loss should be properly described and\n\ndeclared as a loss contingency.         Id. ¶ 10.    The Complaint clearly\n\nstates its theory that TPPI’s expected failure to pay would result\n\nin very substantial losses to S&W, which it did not take as a\n\ncharge against earnings.         To the extent the probable loss is\n\ndescribed   in   the    contingency    notes   of   S&W’s   statements,   the\n\nComplaint alleges with clarity that the notes are misleading in\n\ndescribing the possibility that TPPI might cancel as “unlikely,” ¶\n\n209, and in understating the size of the loss that would result in\n\nthe event of that contingency. Furthermore, drawing all reasonable\n\ninferences in plaintiffs’ favor, the Complaint adequately asserts\n\nthat the amount of loss could have been reasonably estimated.\n\n     We find that, as in Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 82, and In re\n\nCabletron Systems, Inc., 311 F.3d at 39, these allegations are\n\nsufficiently detailed and clear to satisfy the clarity-and-basis\n\nrequirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b).\n\n     On the other hand, claims of fraud based on the mere inclusion\n\nof the TPPI contract in S&W’s “backlog” must be dismissed.                 We\n\naffirm the district court’s dismissal of these aspects of the\n\nComplaint for substantially the same reasons in our discussion of\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\fthe inclusion of the allegedly underbid contracts in the backlog.\n\nAs defined by the Complaint, S&W’s backlog consisted of “the\n\naccumulated amount of the Company’s committed, but unexpended,\n\ncontractual work.”        ¶ 38.    Even if the TPPI project was unlikely to\n\nrestart, it still constituted, under the terms of the Complaint,\n\n“committed, but unexpended, contractual work.” S&W’s statements as\n\nto backlog cannot be considered false or misleading just because\n\nthey included the TPPI contract.              Thus, these statements cannot\n\ngive rise to liability under Rule 10b-5, § 20(a), or § 18.\n\n       (b)   Strong inference of scienter.         As noted above, where the\n\nplaintiff’s recovery depends on proof that the defendant acted with\n\na particular state of mind, the Complaint must set forth facts\n\ngiving rise to a “strong inference” that the defendants acted with\n\nthe required state of mind.           See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2).\n\n             (i)    Claims under 10b-5. The claims relating to TPPI, to\n\nthe extent pleaded under 10b-5, must be supported by facts giving\n\nrise   to    a   strong   inference    of    scienter.       We   find    that   the\n\nallegations as to Smith and Langford’s involvement with TPPI fail\n\nthat test.\n\n       The principal theory of the Complaint as to TPPI is that\n\ndefendants       reported     “phantom      revenue”   and    failed      to     make\n\nappropriate disclosure of an expected loss.                   Even drawing all\n\nreasonable       inferences   in    plaintiffs’    favor,    as   we     must,   the\n\nComplaint fails to support a “strong inference” of scienter as to\n\n\n                                       -34-\n\fSmith and Langford.        The factual allegations, which satisfy the\n\nclarity-and-basis        requirements      as    to   the    use   of    misleading\n\naccounting,       lack   sufficiently      compelling       and    clear     factual\n\nallegations       concerning   the   culpable     involvement       of    Smith   and\n\nLangford to support a “strong inference” of scienter on their part.\n\n     Despite       the   Complaint’s       rhetorical       flourish,       accusing\n\ndefendants of reporting “phantom revenue,” the booking of revenues\n\nbefore their receipt does not necessarily involve any impropriety\n\nwhatsoever.       As described earlier, such anticipatory booking of\n\nrevenues     is    integral    to    percentage-of-completion            accounting\n\n(including with a zero-profit margin), according to the GAAP\n\ndocuments    plaintiffs       cite   in    the   Complaint.        In    fact,     for\n\nconstruction      businesses    engaged     in    S&W’s     type   of    work,    such\n\npercentage-of-completion accounting with anticipatory recognition\n\nof revenue is described as “preferable in most circumstances.” See\n\nSOP 81-1 ¶ .25.       The question raised by the Complaint is the more\n\nsubtle one of whether in the particular circumstances presented it\n\nwas appropriate to use percentage-of-completion accounting, which\n\ndepended primarily on whether the purchaser of S&W’s services\n\n(TPPI) was expected to fulfill its obligations.\n\n     Thus,     the    allegations     of    scienter      concerning       both   the\n\nreporting of “phantom revenue” from the TPPI project and the\n\nfailure to reflect the expected loss depend largely on whether the\n\nComplaint alleges facts supporting a strong inference that Smith\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\fand Langford did not expect TPPI to fulfill its commitments.                    The\n\nComplaint    speaks    vaguely     of   communications   from      TPPI    to   S&W\n\nexpressing    doubt    as    to   TPPI’s   resumption   of   the   project      and\n\nsuggesting that S&W get out of its contracts with vendors.                   These\n\nallegations are simply too vague to support a strong inference that\n\nSmith and Langford were aware of them or, if so, were reckless in\n\nfailing to take them seriously.\n\n     Again, without attribution, the Complaint alleges that S&W\n\nobtained TPPI’s permission to sell project materials.                     A former\n\nsenior accountant is quoted for the proposition that the materials\n\nwere sold “for pennies on the dollar.”             This allegation is too\n\nsketchy and vague.          There is no indication how broadly materials\n\nwere sold or that senior management was aware of the circumstances.\n\n     We recognize the Complaint alleges that Smith and Langford\n\nknew the equipment sent to Indonesia for the project was being sold\n\nfor pennies on the dollar and that the project would not be\n\nrestarted.     ¶ 75.    It also alleges that “it was evident to the\n\nBoard [of Directors] . . . that it was unlikely the project would\n\never restart.”        ¶ 77.       Such conclusory allegations as to the\n\nexistence of knowledge are insufficient to provide the factual\n\nbasis, supporting a strong inference of scienter, required by the\n\nPSLRA.     They are simply conclusory assertions of the facts for\n\nwhich a showing supporting a strong inference of scienter must be\n\npleaded.     Where the state of mind in question is the defendant’s\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fknowledge of the fraudulent nature of the Company’s financial\n\nreports,    and   the   PSLRA    requires   that   facts   be   stated   with\n\nparticularity giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant\n\nacted with that state of mind, the requirement is not satisfied by\n\na pleading which simply asserts that the defendant knew of the\n\nfalsity.\n\n      We therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of the\n\nclaims regarding TPPI brought under Rule 10b-5 against Smith and\n\nLangford.\n\n            (ii) Claims under §§ 20(a) and 18.          Our rulings on the\n\nclaims brought under §§ 20(a) and 18 with respect to TPPI mirror\n\nour treatment of the claims brought under §§ 20(a) and 18 with\n\nrespect to the alleged policy of underbidding. Because the PSLRA’s\n\nstrong-inference requirement does not apply to the claims brought\n\nunder §§ 20(a)12 and 18, (1) we reject the reasons given by the\n\ndistrict court for dismissing the claims, and (2) note that the\n\nreasons which support our order of dismissal of the similar claim\n\nunder Rule 10b-5 have no application to these claims. Accordingly,\n\nwe vacate the judgment dismissing them.        We remand these claims to\n\nthe   district     court   for     whatever   further      proceedings   are\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n\n\n      12\n           See, though, supra note 6.\n\n                                    -37-\n\f3.   Concealment    of   Illiquidity,    Inability   to   Pay   Debts,   and\n\n     Impending Bankruptcy\n\n     The Complaint’s final major area of focus is on statements\n\nallegedly concealing S&W’s financial deterioration.         The Complaint\n\ncontends that S&W issued false and misleading statements reassuring\n\ninvestors of S&W’s financial viability and its access to sufficient\n\ncash to meet its needs, even as its finances fell into shambles,\n\nand eventually into bankruptcy.\n\n     The allegations of financial deterioration are set forth in\n\nthe Complaint at length and with specificity.             According to a\n\nformer controller for S&W’s industrial division, by the middle of\n\n1998, “S&W knew that the Company was ‘starting to get strapped for\n\ncash.’”     ¶ 70.   The Company began having problems paying its\n\nvendors on the Tiverton project in the summer of 1998, leading some\n\nunpaid vendors to stop delivering materials to the project site.\n\n¶ 71.   Meanwhile, throughout 1998,\n\n     comprehensive internal financial reports, distributed to\n     approximately twenty S&W division heads and top\n     executives, that included financials broken out for all\n     divisions, with details of personnel costs, sales, income\n     and working capital and which also measured S&W’s\n     performance against its plan for the year, showed a\n     materially worse financial situation and outlook [than\n     the disclosed financial results].\n\n¶ 72.     A confidential source, identified as the “head of S&W’s\n\nDevelopment Corporation” said:\n\n     Anyone who had access to the monthly financials could see\n     that it was not what was being said publicly. You could\n     read them and compare them with the quarterlies he\n\n                                  -38-\n\f      [Smith] was reporting and ask what he was smoking.\n      Knowing what we knew inside and seeing the quarterlies —\n      they just did not jibe.\n\nId.\n\n      The    financial      problems    continued   to   mount   through   1999.\n\nUnpaid vendors threatened to place liens on the Tiverton project,\n\n¶ 78; the Company began using credit cards to purchase materials\n\nfor the project, ¶ 79; the Company faced calls seeking payment on\n\nvarious projects, ¶ 83; the Company’s “treasurer regularly sent e-\n\nmails to internal staff advising that the Company had no money to\n\npay the vendors’ bills and to not bother submitting requests for\n\npayment,” id.; and the Company found that it was increasingly\n\ndifficult to get vendors to bid on S&W projects, ¶ 84.                      Some\n\nvendors and subcontractors called Smith directly to complain about\n\nnot being paid, and “those who called Smith regularly to collect\n\nmoney and threaten to walk off a project were usually the first to\n\nget paid.”       ¶ 85.\n\n      By summer of 1999, a list of overdue accounts payable was\n\ncreated and regularly delivered to Smith, Langford, and S&W’s\n\ncomptroller.        ¶ 87.      Some accounts payable were 600-700 days\n\noverdue, and consequently vendors and subcontractors were stopping\n\nwork, engaging in slow-downs, or filing liens.                 Id.   The Company\n\nsucceeded in obtaining a credit agreement in July 1999, but was\n\nalready in material default by the time the agreement was made\n\nbecause     of   the     failure   to   pay   vendors   and   subcontractors   as\n\n\n                                         -39-\n\frequired.    ¶ 92.\n\n     In October, needing cash to placate lenders, S&W announced it\n\nwas selling its headquarters building and cold storage business,\n\nbut knew in December that the sale of its building would not\n\nalleviate its problems, and even had to “obtain an emergency\n\nadjustment in its lending arrangements so it could survive long\n\nenough to complete the sale.”      ¶¶ 117, 119.       In November, S&W was\n\ntold that it was in material breach of a $250-million contract\n\nbecause it had failed to pay subcontractors and suppliers, leading\n\nsenior executives to embark on a “desperate effort” to stop the\n\nproject from being terminated.         ¶¶ 108, 110.   In December, in a bid\n\nto generate cash, Smith and Langford caused the S&W Employee\n\nRetirement Plan Trust to purchase 1 million shares of S&W common\n\nstock, raising over $15 million.         ¶ 121.    By the end of the year,\n\n“Smith’s    gasoline   credit   card    was   discontinued   and   newspaper\n\ndelivery to S&W’s building was halted,” ¶ 126, while at the\n\nTiverton project site, “trash was building up . . . and spilling\n\nout of the dumpsters because S&W had not paid the bills of the\n\ntrash hauler,”    ¶ 131.\n\n     In 2000, the Complaint alleges, the owner of the Tiverton\n\nproject notified S&W of defaults on its contract because of liens\n\nplaced on the Tiverton site, and S&W was unable to cure the\n\ndefaults.    ¶¶ 98, 138.   Cost overruns on the project at that time\n\nsoared to over $27 million.        ¶ 140.         S&W eventually filed for\n\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fbankruptcy in June 2000.   ¶ 155.\n\n     In the face of these events, the Complaint alleges, S&W issued\n\nfalse and misleading statements principally in press releases and\n\nfilings with the SEC, falsely asserting or implying that the\n\nCompany had sufficient cash, see, e.g., ¶¶ 172, 192, 199, and\n\ninadequately disclosing the extent of the Company’s financial\n\nproblems, see, e.g., ¶¶ 283-84, 286-88, 293-94, 298-304, 305-06,\n\n307-10.   For example, in the context of these events, the Company\n\nrepeatedly announced in its SEC filings that it “believes that the\n\ntypes of businesses in which it is engaged require that it maintain\n\na strong financial condition,” and that it “has on hand and has\n\naccess to sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated\n\noperating, dividend and capital expenditure needs.”    The Company\n\nincluded words to that effect in at least its March 1998 10-Q\n\n(filed in May 1998), ¶ 192, September 1998 10-Q (filed in November\n\n1998), ¶ 223, 1998 10-K (filed in March 1999), ¶ 242, March 1999\n\n10-Q (filed in May 1999), ¶ 264, and June 1999 10-Q (filed in\n\nAugust 1999), ¶ 278.   As discussed below, the Company made notable\n\ndisclosures about its financial difficulties in later filings, most\n\nespecially in the fall of 1999. Plaintiffs acknowledge these\n\ndisclosures, but argue that they did not go far enough in revealing\n\nthe “financial collapse” that was upon S&W.   ¶ 283.\n\n     This group of allegations raises four primary questions: (1)\n\nDid disclosures made by S&W in the fall of 1999, prior to the first\n\n\n                                -41-\n\fpurchase of S&W stock by the named plaintiffs, adequately apprise\n\ninvestors of the financial problems facing the Company, rendering\n\nprevious misleading statements immaterial as a matter of law, for\n\npurposes of this suit?     (2) If not, do the Complaint’s allegations\n\nmeet the clarity-and-basis requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b)?\n\n(3)   Does   the   Complaint   satisfy    the   PSLRA’s   required   “strong\n\ninference” of scienter with respect to Smith and Langford to\n\nsupport claims under Rule 10b-5?         (4) As to some of the allegedly\n\nmisleading statements made in quarterly and annual filings with the\n\nSEC, were they “forward-looking” statements, protected from suit by\n\nthe PSLRA’s safe harbor?\n\n      (a) Falsity and materiality.       The district court first ruled,\n\nupon the defendants’ motion to dismiss, that while some of the\n\nCompany’s statements made prior to the autumn of 1999 might be\n\nactionable, none of S&W’s statements made after that time were\n\nactionable because by then S&W had made full disclosure of its\n\nfinancial woes.     See In re Stone & Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig., 253\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 126.       On that basis, the court granted summary\n\njudgment on all outstanding claims.        Although the judgment was not\n\nexplained, it was apparently based on the following reasoning: (1)\n\nNone of the named plaintiffs purchased securities in S&W prior to\n\nthat time; (2) Any materially false statements made prior to that\n\ntime had been cured, as a matter of law, by the Company’s more\n\nrevelatory statements made during autumn of 1999; and (3) Because\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\fthe named plaintiffs could not assert claims on their own behalf\n\nbased on statements made prior to autumn of 1999, they could not do\n\nso on behalf of class plaintiffs.13\n\n     The first question we must consider is whether disclosures\n\nmade by S&W in the fall of 1999 so completely disclosed the alleged\n\nfinancial problems of the Company that they either corrected, or\n\nrendered immaterial as a matter of law, any misleading statements\n\nmade before that point. We must determine whether S&W sufficiently\n\ndisclosed the state of affairs at S&W, such that the totality of\n\ninformation offered to investors purchasing after that time could\n\nnot be considered false or materially misleading.\n\n     We find that they did not.    Assuming, as we must, the truth of\n\nthe Complaint’s allegations as to the Company’s financial condition\n\nin the fall of 1999, we find that the Company’s statements made at\n\nthat time, although more revealing than some earlier statements,\n\nwere not so informative as to correct earlier false statements, or\n\nrender them immaterial as a matter of law.   A jury could reasonably\n\nfind that the cumulative sum of information provided to investors\n\nby that point was still materially misleading.\n\n     In their argument that any prior falsity of statements had\n\nbeen cured by the autumn 1999 statements, defendants rely primarily\n\n\n\n     13\n       Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court’s assumption\nthat summary judgment would be proper if the autumn 1999 statements\nadequately apprised investors of the state of S&W’s finances.\nThus, we do not consider that question.\n\n                                  -43-\n\fon a Company press release dated October 27, 1999, and on the\n\nquarterly 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 15, 1999.14                 The\n\nOctober 27, 1999, press release announced that the Company intended\n\nto sell its corporate headquarters and its cold storage business in\n\norder to “enhance liquidity and focus on its core competencies.”\n\nThe document stated that the Company was “not in compliance” with\n\nits “principal credit agreement” and stated that it had “requested\n\nwaivers from its bank group regarding certain covenants” in that\n\nagreement.     It acknowledged also that S&W could not “continue\n\nnormal    operations”   unless   it    obtained   “additional    short-term\n\nfunding.”    Finally, it stated that “[i]n light of the Company’s\n\ncurrent liquidity needs,” the Board of Directors decided to omit\n\nthe Company’s normal quarterly dividend, and that S&W had retained\n\nfinancial    advisors   “to   assist     the   Company   in   arranging   and\n\nrestructuring interim and long-term financing and with asset sales\n\nauthorized by the board of directors.”\n\n     In its November 15, 1999, 10-Q filing with the SEC, the\n\nCompany noted that “losses incurred in the past 24 months have\n\nnegatively impacted the Company’s cash position,” and explained:\n\n     As of the end of the third quarter of 1999, the Company\n     had fully drawn the cash available to it under its\n     current credit facility and the amount of the Company’s\n     past due trade payables had increased, as reflected in\n     accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with\n     certain of the Company’s vendors and subcontractors\n     having delayed work to be performed by them.\n\n     14\n          The Company made prior disclosures, but not to the same\nextent.\n\n                                      -44-\n\f     The falsity of a statement and the materiality of a false\n\nstatement are questions for the jury.           See TSC Industries, Inc. v.\n\nNorthway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 450 (1976); see also In re Cabletron\n\nSystems, Inc, 311 F.3d at 34.          Cf. United States v. Gaudin, 515\n\nU.S. 506 (1995).   A court is thus free to find, as a matter of law,\n\nthat a statement was not false, or not materially false, only if a\n\njury could not reasonably find falsity or materiality on the\n\nevidence presented.       See TSC Industries, Inc., 426 U.S. at 450.        We\n\ncannot agree that as a matter of law these disclosures sufficiently\n\napprised   investors   of    all   material     information   regarding    the\n\nCompany’s alleged financial condition and corrected or rendered\n\nimmaterial the falsity of previous statements.\n\n     A potential investor after the autumn 1999 statements would\n\nlikely examine not only the Company’s very most recent statements,\n\nbut also the statements made by the Company in the recent preceding\n\nperiods.   If prior to autumn 1999 the Company had issued false\n\nstatements, describing its financial condition in misleadingly\n\nbenign terms, those statements might continue to influence an\n\ninvestor’s decision unless they had been retracted, had ceased to\n\nbe relevant, or their misleading message had been adequately\n\ncorrected by subsequent revelations or statements.             In our view,\n\nalthough   the   autumn    1999    statements    revealed   more   about   the\n\ndeterioration of the Company’s financial conditions than prior\n\nstatements, we cannot agree that, as a matter of law, a jury could\n\n                                     -45-\n\fnot reasonably find that after their issuance the totality of the\n\nCompany’s statements continued to be materially misleading as to\n\nthe Company’s financial situation.        For one thing, a company which\n\nhas long maintained a strong financial position but recently fallen\n\ninto a liquidity crunch may be considered a safer investment than\n\na company with an identical present balance sheet which has been\n\nstruggling with underfunding for some time. The former may be seen\n\nas coping with a sudden temporary reversal, likely to be cured by\n\nthe good management practices which have long dominated, while in\n\nthe latter case the current difficulty may appear the inevitable\n\nconsequence of a continuous history of bad management, which is\n\ndestined to result in eventual failure.       The Company’s autumn 1999\n\nstatements certainly made significant disclosures, but they did not\n\nsufficiently dispel the allegedly misleading picture of a Company\n\nwhich, up to that point, had maintained a strong position.\n\n      For example, as we noted above, S&W filings with the SEC made\n\nat   least   through   August   1999   contained   reassuring   assertions\n\ninforming investors that the Company “has on hand and access to\n\nsufficient sources of funds,” and even arguably implying that it\n\n“maintain[ed] a strong financial condition.” See, e.g., ¶ 278. If\n\nthe Company’s financial situation was in fact as dire as alleged by\n\nthe Complaint, such statements could reasonably be found to be\n\nmaterially misleading.     The Complaint portrays S&W as a company in\n\nfinancial distress, spiraling toward bankruptcy — out of cash,\n\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\funable      to   keep    up     with       payments,        and    with       vendors     and\n\nsubcontractors halting work and deliveries and threatening liens.\n\n      In our view, the information released by the Company in autumn\n\n1999 did not so clearly correct the alleged falsity of the earlier\n\nstatements.      Rather, a jury could reasonably find that the “‘total\n\nmix’” of information available to an investor in the fall of 1999\n\n– that is, the totality of new disclosures, read in the context of\n\nprevious     statements        by    the    Company     –    still       was    materially\n\nmisleading,      by    virtue       of   both   false   statements            and   material\n\nomissions.       See TSC Industries, Inc., 426 U.S. at 449.\n\n      (b) The PSLRA’s requirement of clarity and basis.                             Finding\n\nthat the dismissal of these claims cannot be supported on the basis\n\nof the autumn 1999 disclosures, we must next consider whether the\n\nallegations meet the requirements of the PSLRA.                        We have no doubt\n\nthat these allegations pass the clarity-and-basis requirements.\n\nThe   Complaint       paints    a    detailed     account         of   the     deteriorated\n\nfinancial conditions at S&W, replete with factual support and\n\ncitations to sources likely to have knowledge of the matter.                             The\n\nComplaint also identifies with specificity the statements alleged\n\nto be false and misleading and explains in what respect they were\n\nmisleading.\n\n      (c)    Strong inference of required state of mind.                        In addition\n\nto    passing    the    clarity-and-basis          test,      we       find    that     these\n\nallegations also survive the PSLRA’s strong-inference requirement.\n\n\n\n                                           -47-\n\f     (i)    Claims under 10b-5.    Claims under Rule 10b-5 require\n\nproof of scienter.     The Company statements alleged to be false\n\nconcealments of its liquidity crunch were made at various times\n\nfrom 1997 to 2000.    In order to plead a valid claim against Smith\n\nand Langford as to any of these statements, the Complaint must\n\nassert facts supporting a strong inference that they acted with\n\nscienter at the time the statement was made.       We find that the\n\nComplaint alleges facts sufficient to support a strong inference of\n\nscienter on the parts of both Smith and Langford starting as early\n\nas January 1999.\n\n     The Complaint alleges that during the summer of 1999 an\n\naccounts payable list showing accounts overdue by 600-700 days was\n\nbeing prepared on a regular basis for review by Smith and Langford\n\nand that the Company was so strapped for cash that no subcontractor\n\nwas allowed to be paid without the personal approval of Smith or\n\nLangford.   ¶ 87.   The Complaint further alleges that in the spring\n\nof 1999 Smith received calls from vendors and subcontractors\n\ndemanding payment and threatening to walk off their projects.   Id.\n\nThese allegations are clearly sufficient to support a strong\n\ninference of scienter for the periods to which they pertain.\n\n     The allegations relating to the early part of 1999, which rely\n\nmore heavily on circumstantial evidence, are nonetheless sufficient\n\nin our view, when taken together with the entire mix of alleged\n\nfacts, to support a strong inference of at least recklessness with\n\n\n\n                                  -48-\n\frespect to the falsity, if not actual knowledge of the falsity.\n\nThe financial strength of the Company was undoubtedly a matter of\n\nprincipal   concern     to   its   Chief    Executive   Officer     and    Chief\n\nFinancial Officer.        The Company’s public statements repeatedly\n\nstressed the importance of financial strength for a company engaged\n\nin S&W’s business, before going on to give assurance of S&W’s\n\naccess to ample funds.\n\n     The    Complaint    alleges    furthermore    that       throughout    1998\n\ncomprehensive internal financial reports of the Company’s current\n\ncondition     were    regularly    distributed    to    the    Company’s     top\n\nexecutives.     Id.     Although the contents of the reports are not\n\ndescribed, we can fairly infer that they described what they\n\npurported to describe – the Company’s current financial condition.\n\nAccording to the allegations of the Complaint, the condition that\n\nwould have been reflected in those internal reports was becoming\n\ndesperate, so that already the Company had slowed payments to\n\nvendors and subcontractors. If by the summer of 1999 such accounts\n\nwere 600-700 days overdue, it follows that by January 1999, those\n\naccounts were 400-500 days overdue, and this was regularly revealed\n\nin internal reports distributed to Smith and Langford.              An unnamed\n\nconfidential source, the executive described as the head of S&W’s\n\nDevelopment Corporation, is quoted in the Complaint as saying that\n\na comparison of the Company’s periodic internal reports distributed\n\nto the Company’s executives with the statements signed by Smith in\n\n\n\n                                     -49-\n\fthe Company’s quarterly public reports would lead one to ask “what\n\n[Smith] was smoking.”     ¶ 72.\n\n     Those allegations of particularized facts support a strong\n\ninference that by January 1999, both Smith and Langford were either\n\naware of the misleading nature of the Company’s reassuring reports,\n\nor were at least reckless with respect to their truthfulness on\n\nmatters of enormous importance.        We therefore vacate the district\n\ncourt’s judgment relating to claims under Rule 10b-5 against Smith\n\nand Langford for false statements as early as January 1999 and\n\nthereafter    relating   to   the   Company’s   liquidity   and   financial\n\ncondition.\n\n     (ii) Claims under §§ 20(a) and 18.          With respect to claims\n\nasserted against Smith and Langford under §§ 20(a) and 18 for\n\nstatements concealing illiquidity and the deterioration of S&W’s\n\nfinancial condition, we vacate the judgment and remand for further\n\nproceedings for the same reasons as given above relating to claims\n\nunder §§ 20(a) and 18.15\n\n     (d)    Safe harbor for forward-looking statements.       As for some\n\nof the statements which we ruled could serve as the basis for\n\nclaims of misleading statements relating to the Company’s liquidity\n\nand financial condition, the district court ruled in considering\n\nthe defendant’s motion to dismiss that these were within the\n\nPSLRA’s safe harbor for “forward-looking” statements.             See In re\n\n\n     15\n           See, though, supra note 6.\n\n                                    -50-\n\fStone & Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig., 253 F. Supp. 2d at 125, 130.\n\nWhile the exact wording of these statements varied slightly, they\n\neffectively asserted that the Company “has on hand and has access\n\nto sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating,\n\ndividend and capital expenditure needs.”     See ¶ 192; see also ¶¶\n\n172, 208, 223, 242.   We do not agree with the district court that\n\nthis statement is necessarily protected by the PSLRA’s safe harbor\n\nrule.\n\n     The statute generally provides, with specified limitations,\n\nthat issuers and underwriters of securities shall not be liable in\n\nany private action based on an untrue or misleading statement of a\n\nmaterial fact “with respect to any forward-looking statement” if\n\nthe forward-looking statement is\n\n     identified as a forward-looking statement, and is\n     accompanied    by   meaningful   cautionary    statements\n     identifying important factors that could cause actual\n     results to differ materially from those in the forward-\n     looking statement, . . . or . . . the plaintiff fails to\n     prove that the forward-looking statement . . . [if made\n     on behalf of a business entity by or with the approval of\n     an executive officer was] made . . . with actual\n     knowledge by that officer that the statement was false or\n     misleading.\n\nSee 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1).   The statute thus seems to provide a\n\nsurprising rule that the maker of knowingly false and wilfully\n\nfraudulent   forward-looking   statements,   designed   to   deceive\n\ninvestors, escapes liability for the fraud if the statement is\n\n“identified as a forward-looking statement and [was] accompanied by\n\nmeaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that\n\n                               -51-\n\fcould cause actual results to differ materially from those in the\n\nforward-looking statement.”         See id. § 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i).\n\n     The statute goes on to define “forward-looking” statements as\n\nincluding: “(A) a statement containing a projection of revenues,\n\nincome . . . earnings (including earnings loss) per share, . . .\n\ncapital expenditures, dividends, . . . or other financial items;\n\n(B) a statement of the plans and objectives of management for\n\nfuture operations . . . ; (C) a statement of future economic\n\nperformance . . . ; (D) any statement of the assumptions underlying\n\nor relating to [any of the above].”           Id. § 78u-5(i)(1).\n\n     The    statement    in    question    asserted    essentially        that    the\n\nCompany “has on hand . . . sufficient sources of funds to meet its\n\nanticipated [needs].”         Because the statement includes a reference\n\nto anticipated future needs for funds, the district court found it\n\nto be “forward-looking,” apparently concluding that the statement\n\ncame within the protection granted for “a projection of . . .\n\ncapital expenditures, dividends, . . . or other financial items.”\n\nWe think that the meaning of this curious statute, which grants\n\n(within limits) a license to defraud, must be somewhat more complex\n\nand restricted.\n\n     By reason of the emphasis on “projection[s],” “plans,” and\n\n“statement[s] of future economic performance,” we understand the\n\nstatute    to   intend   to    protect    issuers     and    underwriters        from\n\nliability    for   projections     and    predictions       of   future   economic\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\fperformance, which are later shown to have been inaccurate.      See\n\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 1814, def. 12b (1976)\n\n(defining “projection” as “an estimate of future possibilities\n\nbased on a current trend”).   The legislative history confirms this\n\nunderstanding.   The House Conference Report explains that the bill\n\nwas intended “to enhance market efficiency by encouraging companies\n\nto disclose forward looking information” that otherwise might be\n\n“muzzled” out of fear that making predictions could later spawn\n\nburdensome securities fraud actions.     See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-\n\n369 (1995), 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 742.\n\n     The problem in applying this statute to the statement in\n\nquestion is that the statement is composed of elements that refer\n\nto estimates of future possibilities and elements that refer to\n\npresent facts.   Essentially the statement asserts that the Company\n\nhas present access to funds sufficient to meet anticipated future\n\nneeds.   The part of the statement that speaks of the quantity of\n\ncash on hand speaks of a present fact.    The part that speaks of the\n\namount of “anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure\n\nneeds” speaks of a projection of future economic performance.    The\n\nclaim of fraud, however, does not involve a contention that the\n\ndefendants were underestimating the amount of their future cash\n\nneeds.   The claim is rather that the defendants were lying about\n\nthe Company’s present access to funds.    The Company was, according\n\nto the allegations of the Complaint, in an extreme liquidity\n\n\n                                -53-\n\fcrunch.\n\n     We believe that in order to determine whether a statement\n\nfalls within the safe harbor, a court must examine which aspects of\n\nthe statement are alleged to be false.       The mere fact that a\n\nstatement contains some reference to a projection of future events\n\ncannot sensibly bring the statement within the safe harbor if the\n\nallegation of falsehood relates to non-forward-looking aspects of\n\nthe statement.   The safe harbor, we believe, is intended to apply\n\nonly to allegations of falsehood as to the forward-looking aspects\n\nof the statement.   Cf. Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194,\n\n1213 (1st Cir. 1996) (examining, in the context of the bespeaks\n\ncaution doctrine, a statement that “has both a forward-looking\n\naspect and an aspect that encompasses a representation of present\n\nfact” and concluding that the doctrine was inapplicable to the\n\nextent the statement “encompasses the latter representation of\n\npresent fact”), superceded by statute on other grounds, as noted in\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 197.\n\n     To illustrate the distinction we draw, assume as hypothetical\n\nfacts that an issuer of securities relating to a business venture\n\ncarrying an obvious risk of liability (say, the operation of an\n\namusement park) issues a public statement that it has procured\n\nliability insurance in amounts sufficient to cover the maximum\n\nliability that can be anticipated based on comparable experience.\n\nAssume that in the suit, the aspect of the statement alleged to be\n\n\n                                -54-\n\ffraudulent lies not in the estimate of likely liabilities, but in\n\nthe fact that the issuer was lying in stating that it had obtained\n\ninsurance.    It in fact had no insurance policy.   The accusation of\n\nfalsity, in other words, lay not in the accuracy of the projection\n\nof future financial events, but rather in the representation of a\n\npresent fact.    Notwithstanding that the allegedly false statement\n\n“contain[s] a projection of [future] financial items,” we do not\n\nthink Congress intended to grant safe harbor protection for such a\n\nstatement whose falsity consists of a lie about a present fact.\n\n     While our case is not precisely like the hypothetical example,\n\nwe think the example illustrates that where the falsehood relates\n\nto a representation of present fact in the statement, it will not\n\nnecessarily come within the statute’s safe harbor, even though the\n\nstatement might also contain a projection of future financial\n\nexperience.\n\n     In this case, the alleged falsehood was in the fact that the\n\nstatement claimed that the Company had access to ample cash at a\n\ntime when the Company was suffering a dire cash shortage.         The\n\nclaim was not that the Company was understating its future cash\n\nneeds.   In our view, the safe harbor of the PSLRA does not confer\n\na carte blanche to lie in such representations of current fact.   We\n\nreject the district court’s conclusion that the statements assuring\n\nthat the Company had access to sufficient cash to cover anticipated\n\nneeds were within the safe harbor.\n\n\n                                -55-\n\fB.   Claims Against PwC\n\n     Against PwC, the auditor of S&W’s accounts, the Complaint\n\nasserts   claims   under   Rule   10b-5    and   §    18   relating    to    PwC’s\n\nunqualified audit opinions on the Company’s 1997, 1998, and 1999\n\nfinancial statements contained in its annual 10-K filings.                  See ¶¶\n\n343-45.    These   opinions   are   alleged      to   have   been     false    and\n\nmisleading in two principal respects:            They stated, first, that\n\nS&W’s financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP,\n\nand second, that PWC’s audits were performed in accordance with\n\nGenerally Accepted Auditing Standards (“GAAS”).\n\n1.   The PSLRA’s Requirement of Clarity and Basis\n\n     We first consider whether these claims against PwC meet the\n\nPSLRA’s requirements for clarity and basis.\n\n     The claims that PwC falsely asserted compliance with GAAP\n\nfocuses on the accounting for the allegedly underbid contracts and\n\nfor the TPPI project. We have already considered substantially the\n\nsame allegations made against Smith and Langford and found that\n\nthey pass the PSLRA test for clarity and basis.                  Because the\n\nallegations against PwC are substantially the same for purposes of\n\nthe clarity-and-basis test, we reach the same conclusion – that the\n\nclaims against PwC also pass the clarity-and-basis test.\n\n     The second set of claims against PwC concerns its statements\n\nthat its audits were performed in accordance with GAAS.                     To the\n\nextent that these claims relate to its failure to discover the\n\n\n                                    -56-\n\falleged deviations from GAAP in the accounting for the underbid\n\ncontracts and TPPI, we find that they pass the clarity-and-basis\n\ntest.   The other GAAS claims, however, rest on nothing more than a\n\nlitany of conclusory allegations of failure to conform to various\n\nGAAS standards. The Complaint asserts also that PwC missed various\n\n“red flag” warning signs but lacks concreteness as to how the\n\nconduct of the audit related to the missed warning signs.            See ¶¶\n\n341, 351.    With the exception of the GAAS claims relating to the\n\nalleged GAAP violations for TPPI and the underbid contracts, we\n\nfind the GAAS claims insufficient to pass the clarity-and-basis\n\ntest of PSLRA.\n\n2.   Strong Inference of State of Mind\n\n     Even while some allegations survive the clarity-and-basis\n\ntest, they still must meet the strong-inference requirement with\n\nrespect to any claim demanding proof of scienter.\n\n     (a)    Claims under Rule 10b-5.        As for the claims under Rule\n\n10b-5, which requires proof of scienter, the claims based on both\n\nGAAP and GAAS fail completely to allege particularized facts\n\nsupporting    a   strong   inference   of    scienter   on   PwC’s   part.\n\nPlaintiffs point to four types of allegations which they contend\n\nare sufficient to pass the test.       We disagree.\n\n     First, the Complaint makes the conclusory assertion that PwC\n\nauditors were “aware of the true facts,” which were inaccurately\n\npresented in S&W’s financials.    ¶ 341.     As noted above, a plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                  -57-\n\fdoes not satisfy the PSLRA’s requirement of particularized facts\n\nsupporting a strong inference of scienter by a conclusory assertion\n\nthat the defendant knew the true facts, or knew that the challenged\n\nstatement    was   false.      What    is     needed    is   the   allegation   of\n\nparticularized facts which give strong support to that conclusion.\n\n     Second, the Complaint alleges that PwC missed “red flags.” ¶¶\n\n341, 351.     However, the mere fact that an auditor missed what a\n\nplaintiff labels warning signs gives little support on its own to\n\nthe conclusion that an auditor was reckless, much less wilfully\n\nblind, with respect to the falsity of information in a financial\n\nstatement.     Here the so-called “red flags” were so described\n\nwithout particularized allegations supporting the recklessness of\n\nPwC in missing them when conducting its audits.\n\n     Third,    plaintiffs     point     to    allegations     relating   to     the\n\nimproper use of percentage-of-completion accounting on the TPPI\n\nproject.     See, e.g., ¶ 67.          But, as noted above, the alleged\n\nimpropriety    under   GAAP    of     using    the     percentage-of-completion\n\nmethod, with a zero profit assumption, depends on the perception\n\nthat the project was terminated, as opposed to delayed, and that it\n\nwould result in a loss.       We noted above that these allegations were\n\ninsufficient to support a strong inference of scienter on the part\n\nof Smith and Langford.      The case with respect to PwC is a fortiori,\n\nas PwC had less reason than Smith and Langford to know that TPPI\n\nwould fail to obtain financing to continue the project.\n\n\n                                       -58-\n\f     The final allegations on which plaintiffs rely is PwC’s\n\nmotivation to overlook S&W’s concealment of losses in order to\n\nprotect its own source of lucrative accounting and consulting fees.\n\nWe do not doubt that such a profit motive could contribute to an\n\nauditor’s decision to “turn[] a bind eye,” see ¶ 347, to a\n\ncorporation’s misleading accounting.      See generally Sarbanes-Oxley\n\nAct of 2002, tit. II, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (codified\n\nin various sections of 15 U.S.C.) (addressing concerns raised about\n\nauditor independence).     Such allegations can thus strengthen an\n\ninference of scienter predicated on other facts, possibly adding\n\nsufficient strength to satisfy the strong-inference requirement of\n\nPSLRA.      On   the   other    hand,    absent   truly   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, an auditor’s motivation to continue a profitable\n\nbusiness relationship is not sufficient by itself to support a\n\nstrong inference of scienter. And here there was virtually nothing\n\nelse.\n\n     We affirm the district court’s dismissal of the Rule 10b-5\n\nclaims against PwC.      The allegations of the Complaint, whether\n\nviewed separately or cumulatively, do not rest on particularized\n\nfacts supporting a strong inference of scienter.\n\n     (b)   Claims under § 18.   Because the PSLRA’s strong-inference\n\nrequirement does not apply to claims under § 18, we vacate the\n\ndistrict court’s judgment dismissing the claims under § 18 alleging\n\nthat PwC falsely asserted conformity with GAAP in the accounting\n\n\n                                  -59-\n\ffor TPPI and the allegedly underbid projects and with GAAS in PwC’s\n\naudits relating to that accounting. Once again, we express no view\n\nas to whether these claims may be subject to dismissal on other\n\ngrounds on which the district court did not rule.\n\nC.   Motion for Leave to Amend\n\n     Plaintiffs also appeal from the district court’s denial of\n\ntheir motion for leave to amend the Complaint.      Such a ruling is\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. See Larocca v. Borden, Inc., 276\n\nF.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir. 2002).    The district court denied the motion\n\non the basis of undue delay in making the motion.   We find no abuse\n\nof discretion in that ruling.\n\n     However, given that we hereby vacate the judgment terminating\n\nthe action and remand for further proceedings, plaintiffs may well\n\nreassert a motion for leave to amend the Complaint, and the\n\ndistrict court may conclude that in the context of a continuing\n\naction, the equities affecting such a motion have changed.        We\n\nexpress no view on the question of the appropriate disposition of\n\na renewed motion for leave to amend in the continuing action, but\n\nleave that to the district court’s good judgment.\n\nConclusion\n\n     The judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part.       The\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings in the district court.16\n\n\n     16\n       We do not purport to have ruled on each of the numerous\nfraudulent statements alleged in the Complaint. To the extent an\nallegation of fraud is not discussed in this opinion, the district\n\n                                 -60-\n\fCosts are awarded to the appellants.\n\n\n\n\ncourt should rule again on defendants’ motion to dismiss, in a\nmanner consistent with the discussions herein. We deny appellees’\nmotion for leave to file a supplemental memorandum. Particularly\nin light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Dura\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 125 S. Ct. at 1631-35, we believe appellees’\narguments as to loss causation should in the first instance be\naddressed by the district court. All other pending motions are\ndenied as moot.\n\n                               -61-\n\f",

With respect to most of the claims, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, based principally on the court's conclusion that the allegations were insufficient to satisfy the PSLRA's required pleading standards. On the remaining claims, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants and then entered a final judgment. We affirm the judgment as to some of the claims and vacate as to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lead plaintiffs, Ram Trust Services, Inc. and Lens Investment Management, LLC, are stockholders of Stone &amp; Webster Inc. (\"S &amp; W\" or the \"Company\"), and purport to represent a class of all purchasers of securities of S &amp; W between January 22, 1998, and May 8, 2000. They brought this consolidated securities-fraud class action against S &amp; W; its chairman, president, and chief executive officer, H. Kerner Smith; its executive vice president and chief financial officer, Thomas Langford; and its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (\"PwC\"). The claims against the Company were stayed at the outset because it had filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362. The action proceeded against Smith, Langford, and PwC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The very lengthy Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") alleges essentially that S &amp; W, with the complicity of the other defendants, issued fraudulent financial statements and press releases, designed to conceal S &amp; W's rapidly worsening financial condition. It asserts that S &amp; W, a 111-year-old \"global leader\" in construction, engineering, and consulting services, with consolidated gross revenues in 1999 exceeding $1.2 billion, &#182; 14, began in 1998 to experience rapid deterioration of its financial condition, which Smith and Langford aimed to conceal while they sought a purchaser for the Company. It alleges that PwC also concealed the Company's misleading accounting by making false statements to the effect that S &amp; W's financial statements were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), and that in auditing and certifying S &amp; W's statements, PwC followed Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (\"GAAS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint's strongest factual allegations fall into three main categories, which will be explored in greater detail below. They are, first, that S &amp; W deliberately underbid on more than a billion dollars of contracts, which at the contract price could be performed only at a loss, and fraudulently reported anticipatory profits on these loss contracts, so as to overstate earnings; second, that S &amp; W fraudulently concealed its loss on a huge contract in Indonesia with Trans Pacific Petrochemical Indotama (\"TPPI\") by concealing the cancellation of the contract and thus reported unreceived revenues, inflating the Company's profits or diminishing its losses; and finally, that S &amp; W made public statements, which concealed and misrepresented its shortage of liquid reserves and its impending bankruptcy, as its finances slid into shambles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based chiefly on these allegations, the defendants are alleged to have violated &#167; 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\" or \"1934 Act\"), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5, as well as &#167; 18 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78r. In addition, Smith and Langford are alleged to have violated &#167; 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a), as persons in control of S &amp; W.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum and order dated March 28, 2003, the district court dismissed all claims against PwC and nearly all claims against Smith and Langford, finding that the Complaint failed to satisfy the pleading requirements imposed by the PSLRA and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) for securities fraud claims. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d 102, 136 (D.Mass.2003). On August 25, 2003, the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend its complaint, on the grounds of undue delay. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 217 F.R.D. 96 (D.Mass.2003). On September 23, 2003, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Smith and Langford as to the remaining claims against them, and on September 24, 2003, entered final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Pertinent Elements of Plaintiffs' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three different statutory bases of the claims under the Exchange Act &#8212; &#167; 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (\"Rule 10b-5\"), &#167; 20(a), and &#167; 18 &#8212; rest on slightly different theories and thus have different elements, especially with respect to a plaintiff's need to plead and prove that the defendant acted with a specified state of mind. These differences have a significant effect on this appeal. A summary of the elements of these three claims, to the extent pertinent to this dispute, is as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has described the \"basic elements\" of a claim under Rule 10b-5 as including: (1) \"a material misrepresentation (or omission)\"; (2) \"scienter, i.e., a wrongful state of mind\"; (3) \"a connection with the purchase or sale of a security\"; (4) \"reliance\"; (5) \"economic loss\"; and (6) \"loss causation.\" <i>See Dura Pharm., Inc. v.

Corp. v. John Does One Through Two Hundred,</i> 931 F.2d 38, 39-40 (11th Cir.1991). The state of mind with which the defendant acted enters the case instead as a defense. The statute provides that the defendant can rebut liability by proving \"that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading....\" <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78r(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 20(a) asserts the liability of persons exercising control for violations of law by a controlled entity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Smith and Langford are alleged to have exercised control over S &amp; W, and therefore to share liability for S &amp; W's violations of Rule 10b-5.

The defendant can rebut liability by proving that he or she \"acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.\" <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

We have interpreted this provision as demanding a recitation of facts supporting a \"highly likely\" inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind. <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82. We have explained, that \"[u]nder the PSLRA, the complaint must state with particularity facts that give rise to a `strong inference' of [the required state of mind], rather than merely a reasonable inference.... The inference ... must be reasonable and strong, but need not be irrefutable.\" <i>In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 38 (quoting 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2)); <i>see also Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82. In this opinion, we will refer to this provision of &#167; 78u-4(b)(2) as the \"strong-inference\" requirement of the PSLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these two pleading requirements, the PSLRA also carves out a statutory safe-harbor for many \"forward-looking\" statements. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5. \"Forward-looking\" statements are, generally speaking, statements that speak predictively of the future. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5(i)(1) (defining \"forward-looking statement\"). Under the safe harbor provisions, fraudulent forward-looking statements cannot give rise to liability in certain circumstances, including where the statement at issue is \"identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\" <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clarity-and-basis requirement of the PSLRA and its limited safe harbor for forward-looking statements seem to apply equally to claims under Rule 10b-5, &#167; 18, and &#167; 20(a). However, because Rule 10b-5, &#167; 18, and &#167; 20(a) differ as to whether the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement applies differently as among the three theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the terms of the PSLRA, the strong-inference requirement applies only to private actions \"in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind.\" A claim under Rule 10b-5 falls within those parameters. Under 10b-5 the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with scienter. Thus, the PSLRA requires that the Complaint allege with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. In contrast, &#167;&#167; 18 and 20(a) do not, at least on their face, require that the plaintiff prove that the defendant acted with any particular state of mind. The strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA therefore has no application to claims under these statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Applicable Accounting Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to the precise allegations of the Complaint, we pause to discuss briefly certain accounting standards for long-term construction contracts, which are integral to an understanding of the Complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Long-term construction contracts can characteristically involve early periods during which the contractor's expenditures far exceed its revenues and later periods during which its revenues far exceed expenditures. Depending how the revenues and expenditures are accounted for, the profit and loss statements of contractors engaged in such long-term construction projects might present the appearance of drastic gyrations, beginning with large losses and later shifting to large profits, even though on a sophisticated analysis, the company's experience would reflect a predictable, orderly progress toward a predictable result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To counteract such misleading appearances of unpredictable gyrations, and present a more realistic picture of the stability of operating results, the accounting profession has developed, as part of GAAP, two accounting methods designed in proper circumstances to smooth out the reported operating results of such businesses. The Complaint points to, and quotes extensively from, three accounting documents, which provide guidance: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1: Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts (1981) (\"SOP 81-1\"), <i>see</i> &#182; 40, Accounting Research Bulletin 45: Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts (1955) (\"ARB 45\"), <i>see id.,</i> and Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (\"FAS 5\"), <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 44, 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to SOP 81-1 and ARB 45, as we understand them, the most favored method for a contractor to account for long-term construction contracts, <i>in appropriate circumstances,</i> is \"percentage-of-completion\" accounting. Under this approach, the contractor recognizes revenues expected to be received in the future, as well as net profits expected to be realized, as work on a contract progresses, notwithstanding that the contractor may not yet have received payment. In appropriate circumstances, this accounting method is thought to best reflect the actual \"economic substance\" of a contractor's transactions and therefore to be preferable. SOP 81-1 &#182;&#182; .22, .25. Under percentage-of-completion accounting, generally speaking, regardless of whether revenues have been received, a company recognizes as current revenue on its profit and loss statement that percentage of total expected revenue, which reflects the percentage that the costs incurred in the period bear to total estimated costs on the project. ARB 45 &#182; 4. Various conditions must be present to justify the use of this method, such as the expectation that the buyer will satisfy its obligations under the contract, and \"the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates,\" including \"estimates of the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues, and contract costs.\" SOP 81-1 &#182; .23. The current recognition of expected future profit, furthermore, presupposes that the contract be expected to yield a profit. <i>See id.</i> &#182;&#182; .25, .85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second generally accepted method of accounting for such contracts is called the completed-contract method. <i>See generally id.</i> &#182;&#182; .04, .30-.33. Under this method, \"income is recognized only when a contract is completed or substantially completed.\" <i>Id.</i> &#182; .30. Until that point, for the duration of contract performance, \"billings and costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, but no profit or income is recorded.\" <i>Id.</i> The completed-contract method is viewed as preferable when reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made or \"inherent hazards\" relating to contract conditions make profit predictions unreliable. <i>See id.</i> &#182; .32. A recognized weakness of the completed-contract method is that it \"does not reflect current performance when the period of a contract extends beyond one accounting period,\" and \"may result in irregular recognition of income.\" <i>See id.</i> &#182; .30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, in circumstances where \"estimating the final outcome may be impractical except to assure that no loss will be incurred,\" percentage-of-completion accounting, with a zero estimate of profit, may be utilized. <i>See id.</i> &#182; .25. In doing so, a company recognizes revenues (even though not yet received) equal to its costs incurred in the period \"until results can be estimated more precisely.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This zero-profit-margin approach resembles the completed-contract method in some respects and resembles percentage-of-completion in others. The similarity to completed-contract lies in the fact that, under both methods, no estimated future profit is recognized on a current basis as the job progresses. Profit is recognized only upon substantial completion. Its greater resemblance to percentage-of-completion lies in the fact that current costs, matched by equal amounts of anticipated revenue, are recognized in the current profit and loss statement, while under the completed-contract method, neither costs nor revenues from the project are reflected in the current profit and loss statement until substantial completion of the project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See id.</i> &#182; .33. Thus, the zero-profit-margin approach provides an indication in the income statement of the \"volume of a company's business\" activity while the completed-contract approach does not. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of the method employed, however, anticipated losses are accounted for differently from anticipated profits. \"[W]hen the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract should be made.\" <i>Id.</i> &#182; .85; <i>see also</i> ARB 45 &#182;&#182; 6, 11. Such provision for losses should be made \"in the period in which they become evident.\" SOP 81-1 &#182; .85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The full amount of a \"probable\" loss should be taken as a charge against income if the amount of the loss \"can be reasonably estimated,\" according to FAS 5. <i>See</i> FAS 5 &#182; 8. If the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, \"disclosure of the contingency shall [instead] be made ... indicat[ing] the nature of the contingency and ... giv[ing] an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss\" where possible. <i>Id.</i> &#182; 10. Likewise, if there is only a \"reasonable possibility\" of a loss instead of a \"probable\" loss, disclosure instead of accrual is appropriate. <i>Id.</i> \"Probable\" is defined by FAS 5 to mean \"likely to occur.\" <i>Id.</i> &#182; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Allegations of the Complaint as to Smith and Langford</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background of pertinent legal rules and accounting principles, we turn to the central allegations in the Complaint, which as noted earlier, can be grouped into three general categories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Underbid Projects</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first category of plaintiffs' claims principally relates to the allegation that S &amp; W underbid various projects and fraudulently reported expected profits from these projects when, in fact, the projects were expected to produce losses. The district court dismissed all of these claims on the ground that the pleading failed to satisfy the PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis. We conclude that at least with respect to some of the claims, the clarity-and-basis requirement was satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis.</i> In our view, this pleading is not the kind of vague prelude to a fishing expedition that Congress sought to bar by imposing the clarity-and-basis requirement of the PSLRA. Citing sources within the company, the Complaint alleges that S &amp; W developed a strategy of bidding a number of projects at a loss. &#182;&#182; 52-53. The Complaint expressly names ten contracts, aggregating over $1.4 billion, which allegedly were underbid by margins between 10% and 40% and were expected to produce losses. &#182;&#182; 58-61. The Complaint alleges that the Company accounted for these projects using percentage-of-completion accounting, recognizing a proration of anticipated future profits in the current profit and loss statements, notwithstanding that losses, rather than profits, were expected to result from these contracts. &#182;&#182; 43, 47, 168. The Complaint refers to SOP 81-1, which forbids the use of the percentage-of-completion method to prorate anticipated future profits into current operating results unless future profits are in fact anticipated, <i>see</i> SOP 81-1 &#182;&#182; .24-.25, as well as FAS 5, which requires immediate recognition of expected losses, as soon as they are anticipated, <i>see</i> FAS 5 &#182; 8; SOP 81-1, &#182;&#182;.24, .85. The Complaint identifies with precision statements alleged to be false, including S &amp; W's periodic current earnings figures in its sequential profit and loss statements during the period of the alleged fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to clarity, the Complaint sets forth a clear and precise statement of what the alleged fraud consisted of. With respect to basis, while the sources of information on which the Complaint relies for these allegations are not overwhelmingly impressive, they include sources within the Company who might well have access to the kind of information for which they are cited. Furthermore, the allegations are not merely conclusory, but are rather supported by details that provide factual support for plaintiffs' allegations of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that these pleadings complied sufficiently with PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis, as well as with the preexisting requirements of Rule 9(b). <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). We have previously stated that PSLRA does not require the plaintiff to \"plead evidence.\" <i>See In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 33. As we understand, it was not Congress's intention to bar all suits as to which the plaintiff could not yet prove a <i>prima facie</i> case at the time of the complaint, but rather to prevent suits based on a guess that fraud may be found, without reasonable basis or a clear understanding as to what the fraud consisted of, but in the hope of finding something in the course of discovery. <i>Cf. In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 30 (observing that the \"statute was designed to erect barriers to frivolous strike suits, but not to make meritorious claims impossible to bring\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the district court dismissed these claims on the grounds that they failed to satisfy the clarity-and-basis requirement of PSLRA, we respectfully disagree. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the dismissal of all of those claims should be vacated. We believe some of the claims relating to the underbidding of contracts were fatally flawed for other reasons and thus affirm the dismissal as to some of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Strong inference of scienter.</i> As noted, the PSLRA imposes an additional hurdle: The Complaint must allege facts supporting a strong inference of whatever state of mind on the part of the defendant must be proved as an element of the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Claims under 10b-5.</i> To the extent these claims are asserted under Rule 10b-5, the plaintiffs must prove that the defendants acted with scienter in order to establish their right of recovery. Accordingly, under the PSLRA, the Complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendants acted with either knowing, intentional falsity or reckless disregard for the truthfulness of the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the Complaint deficient in this respect. First, the Complaint provides nothing supporting the inference that either Smith or Langford was directly involved in the detailed accounting for these ten particular contracts, or had knowledge of the alleged falsity. One could draw the inference that Langford, as the Chief Financial Officer, had some supervisory involvement with the accounting. But no strong inference necessarily follows that the Chief Financial Officer, much less the Chief Executive Officer, was aware of the improper proration of future profits on any particular underbid contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This weakness is accentuated by another. The larger the distortion of the company's accounting figures, the more likely it might be that such distortion could not be accomplished without either complicity, or reckless irresponsibility, of top officers. The Complaint, however, gives no indication whatsoever what the size of the alleged overstatement of current profits was. Such an overstatement, in the circumstances alleged, would result primarily from two variables &#8212; the size of the expected future loss which should have been taken as a charge against current earnings, <i>see</i> FAS 5 &#182; 8, and the size of the improperly anticipated future profits prorated into the current profit and loss statement. The Complaint says nothing of the size of either component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Complaint at times does not even assert that a loss was expected from these underbid contracts. Its description of the \"underbidding policy\" asserts that Smith planned the \"selling [of] fixed-price jobs <i>either at a loss or with such small margin for error</i> that the slightest adverse change in a project's economics would cause S &amp; W to lose money on the job.\" &#182; 53 (emphasis added). According to this description, the contracts were bid near the expected break-even point, or with the expectation of a small and unreliable profit, rather than with expectation of a loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that in assessing a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleading, we must read the Complaint in the manner most favorable to the plaintiff, drawing reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, <i>see Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79, and that inconsistent pleading does not deprive the pleader of the right to have the complaint read, as between the inconsistencies, in the manner that supports the adequacy of the pleading. The PSLRA's strong-inference requirement does not change this rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because the Complaint elsewhere asserts that the ten projects were bid \"at a loss,\" &#182; 58, we credit the Complaint as asserting that the projects were indeed bid at a loss, rather than at the break-even point or at a slight profit. Nonetheless, the Complaint in no way suggests that the losses anticipated from these contracts were large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point, the Complaint asserts that \"[a]ccording to ... former S &amp; W insiders, S &amp; W's underbidding [of those contracts] ranged from 10% to 40%.\" &#182; 61. But it says nothing about how much loss would be expected to result from underbidding by 10% to 40%. That would depend on the anticipated profit margins of a normal bid, not affected by the underbidding strategy, and the Complaint includes no allegation about that. Nor does the Complaint allege what percentage of the Company's net operating figures were attributable to the ten contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Complaint tells no more than that, in the accounting for ten contracts, a profit of unspecified size was recognized in current earnings when, according to GAAP principles, those contracts should have been booked either as a loss of unspecified size or using a zero-profit-margin assumption coupled with a note describing a loss contingency. As anything above the break-even point represents profit, and anything below the break-even point represents loss, the difference between profit and loss can on a particular contract be tiny. Nothing in the Complaint suggests that correct accounting for these contracts would have involved significantly different overall numbers from those produced by the allegedly incorrect accounting. And if the accounting for those contracts had no significant effect on the Company's overall results, there is little reason to assume that the Company's CEO and CFO must have known about the failure to follow accepted accounting practices. Irregular financial statements which overstate estimated results to only a small degree do not support a strong inference that the Chief Executive Office or the Chief Financial Officer of the company acted with intent to defraud, or with reckless disregard for the truth of the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third significant weakness in the alleged basis of scienter is that in such accounting, the question whether to recognize profit or loss depends not on concrete facts but an <i>estimation or prediction</i> of whether in the end the project will net a profit or a loss. The Complaint fails to allege particularized facts supporting the inference that a reasonable assessment of the facts relating to those underbid contracts could support a prediction only of loss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we determine that the claims of fraud for improper proration of future profits on these ten allegedly underbid contracts, to the extent asserted under Rule 10b-5, as to which \"the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with [scienter],\" fail the requirement of the PSLRA that \"the complaint ... state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with [scienter].\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). As to those 10b-5 claims, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach a different result, however, where those claims are asserted under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</i> As explained above, the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement does not apply to claims under &#167; 20(a), because this statute does not require proof of the defendant's state of mind.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that a plaintiff must show under &#167; 20(a) that the controlled entity committed a violation of the securities laws. If that violation was, for example, a violation of Rule 10b-5, which requires a proof of scienter, then the plaintiff under &#167; 20(a) must prove that the controlled entity acted with \"a particular state of mind.\" Nonetheless, if the statute is read literally, the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA does not apply. The statute states that the strong-inference requirement applies only where the plaintiff's recovery depends on proof that \"<i>the defendant</i> acted with a particular state of mind\" (emphasis added). <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). The obligation to prove that the controlled corporation acted with scienter does not involve an obligation to prove \"that <i>the defendant</i> acted with a particular state of mind.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 18 similarly imposes no burden on plaintiff to prove the defendant's state of mind, shifting the burden to the defendant to show \"that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading.\" <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78r(a). Accordingly, the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA has no application to &#167; 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 based on improper recognition of anticipated profits on underbid contracts, (1) we reject the reasons given by the district court for dismissing these claims, and (2) we conclude that the reasons which support our order of dismissal of the similar claim under Rule 10b-5 have no application to these claims. Accordingly we vacate the judgment dismissing them. As to whether one or both of those claims is subject to possible dismissal for other reasons, we express no view. We remand the claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 to the district court for whatever further proceedings are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Backlog.</i> In addition to alleging that the policy of underbidding resulted in materially overstated earnings, the Complaint also alleges that it was misleading of defendants to include the underbid contracts in S &amp; W's \"backlog.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 228, 248-49, 251, 254, 284, 313-15. As to these claims, brought under Rule 10b-5, &#167; 20(a), and &#167; 18, we sustain the district court's dismissal. Plaintiffs have simply failed to plead a false statement with respect to the \"backlog\" allegations, and so their claims must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). As defined by the Complaint, S &amp; W's backlog consisted of \"the accumulated amount of the Company's committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" &#182; 38. These contracts represented \"committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" The statements resulting from the inclusion of the contracts in the backlog were neither false nor misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The TPPI Project and \"Phantom Revenue\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second group of claims of fraud relates to the TPPI contract for construction in Indonesia, which was ultimately cancelled for lack of funding. The Complaint alleges that S &amp; W, with the knowledge of Smith and Langford, reported expected future payments as current revenues, even though the project was indefinitely suspended and defendants knew it was unlikely to ever be resumed. The Complaint alleges that S &amp; W overstated its current revenues and concealed an expected loss, which according to GAAP principles should have been recognized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations are essentially as follows: In 1996, TPPI awarded to S &amp; W a $710-million contract in connection with the construction of a $2.3-billion chemical complex in Indonesia. &#182; 63. S &amp; W procured and transported to Indonesia approximately $332 million worth of materials and equipment to perform the project. &#182; 64. Under its agreements, S &amp; W assumed responsibility for cancellation costs with respect to equipment purchase orders and subcontract work. &#182;&#182; 64-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, TPPI suspended work on the project because its funding arrangements were exhausted. &#182; 65. The Complaint alleges that \"TPPI suggested to S &amp; W [in 1997] that it try to get out of its contracts with its vendors due to the suspension.\" <i>Id.</i> By August 1998, S &amp; W obtained permission from TPPI to resell project materials and equipment, and it began selling equipment, according to Daniel Martino, a former senior accountant at S &amp; W, \"for pennies on the dollar.\" &#182;&#182; 58, 73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By January 1999, \"it was clear that the project would not restart,\" and \"TPPI had told S &amp; W that the slight prospect that had existed during 1998 that they would find an investor to fund the project had fallen through.\" &#182; 74. In January 1999, a special meeting of the Company's Board of Directors was held to discuss TPPI, and by the end of the meeting \"it was evident to the Board that the TPPI project had already caused S &amp; W serious financial problems and that it was unlikely the project would ever restart.\" &#182; 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint asserts that because the Company had incurred substantial costs without corresponding revenue, the suspension of the project</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">should have had a significant negative effect on S &amp; W's financial statements. According to CS-1 [an informant who had been an assistant comptroller at S &amp; W], to avoid that negative effect, beginning with the first quarter of 1998, S &amp; W created phantom revenue and receivables from the TPPI project to cover S &amp; W's project related costs by recording revenue equal to the amount of those costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#182; 67. S &amp; W booked $86.9 million of such \"phantom revenue\" in connection with TPPI in 1998 and $53 million in 1999. &#182; 68. The use of this allegedly fraudulent accounting changed the Company's results in 1998 from a loss of $108.7 million to a reported loss of $49.3 million, and in 1999 from a loss of $11.3 million to reported net income of $20.5 million. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, because S &amp; W knew the project was cancelled, it was obligated under FAS 5 to immediately recognize the entire expected loss either as a charge or as a loss contingency. <i>See</i> &#182; 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the notes to the financial statements did refer to a loss contingency based on TPPI, the Complaint alleges that the references were false in two respects. First, the notes stated that the Company \"believes it unlikely that the project will be cancelled,\" or otherwise gave the impression of a likely restart, <i>see</i> &#182;&#182; 209, 224, 296, while the apparent circumstances showed it was highly likely the contract would be cancelled. Second, the amount of the loss estimated to result from the cancellation was substantially understated given the immense investment the Company had made in the TPPI project and the high probability the entire investment would be lost if TPPI failed to reinstate the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, the Complaint describes two separate, though related, accounting abuses in violation of GAAP principles: First, it alleges the overstatement of revenues (\"phantom revenues\") and concealment of loss by inappropriate use of percentage-of-completion accounting (assuming a zero-profit margin) to report current revenues not yet received, when the buyer could not \"be expected to satisfy [its] obligations under the contract.\" <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .23. The offsetting of the actual current losses with projected revenues that were not expected ever to be received allegedly concealed large current losses on the project. Second, the Complaint alleges concealment of an expected loss by failure to acknowledge it appropriately, either as a charge to income, or as an accurately described loss contingency. <i>See</i> FAS 5 &#182;&#182; 8, 10. The Complaint alleges that as a result of these accounting decisions, S &amp; W's financial results published in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings, as well as in other public announcements, were materially overstated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Complaint alleges that S &amp; W misled investors by carrying the TPPI project in its backlog, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182; 221, failing to acknowledge that the project was terminated or at least unlikely to restart, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 166, 193, 209, 217, 224, 296, and reporting a materially understated estimate of the Company's losses when disclosing the \"charge\" S &amp; W would take in the event the project were to be cancelled, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 209, 224, 296.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>The PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis.</i> In our view, the allegations of exaggerated revenues and failure to report an expected loss are sufficiently detailed and supported to satisfy the PSLRA's clarity-and-basis requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These allegations are quite detailed and clear in setting forth what are the allegedly false and misleading statements and in explaining why they are false and misleading. The GAAP documents cited by the Complaint specify that the propriety of reporting unreceived payments as current revenue, matched with currently incurred costs, depends on a reasonable expectation that the buyer will satisfy the obligation to make the payments. <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .23. The Complaint adequately explains that in these circumstances, TPPI, which had lost its source of funding and had indefinitely suspended all work on the project, could not be expected to satisfy its contractual obligation to make payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also seems clear from the GAAP documents that as soon as \"current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract should be made.\" <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .85; <i>see also</i> ARB 45 &#182;&#182; 6, 11. A probable loss should be \"accrued by a charge to income\" when \"the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.\" FAS 5 &#182; 8. A \"reasonable possibility\" of loss should be properly described and declared as a loss contingency. <i>Id.</i> &#182; 10. The Complaint clearly states its theory that TPPI's expected failure to pay would result in very substantial losses to S &amp; W, which it did not take as a charge against earnings. To the extent the probable loss is described in the contingency notes of S &amp; W's statements, the Complaint alleges with clarity that the notes are misleading in describing the possibility that TPPI might cancel as \"unlikely,\" &#182; 209, and in understating the size of the loss that would result in the event of that contingency. Furthermore, drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, the Complaint adequately asserts that the amount of loss could have been reasonably estimated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that, as in <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82, and <i>In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 39, these allegations are sufficiently detailed and clear to satisfy the clarity-and-basis requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, claims of fraud based on the mere inclusion of the TPPI contract in S &amp; W's \"backlog\" must be dismissed. We affirm the district court's dismissal of these aspects of the Complaint for substantially the same reasons in our discussion of the inclusion of the allegedly underbid contracts in the backlog. As defined by the Complaint, S &amp; W's backlog consisted of \"the accumulated amount of the Company's committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" &#182; 38. Even if the TPPI project was unlikely to restart, it still constituted, under the terms of the Complaint, \"committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" S &amp; W's statements as to backlog cannot be considered false or misleading just because they included the TPPI contract. Thus, these statements cannot give rise to liability under Rule 10b-5, &#167; 20(a), or &#167; 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Strong inference of scienter.</i> As noted above, where the plaintiff's recovery depends on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the Complaint must set forth facts giving rise to a \"strong inference\" that the defendants acted with the required state of mind. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Claims under 10b-5.</i> The claims relating to TPPI, to the extent pleaded under 10b-5, must be supported by facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. We find that the allegations as to Smith and Langford's involvement with TPPI fail that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal theory of the Complaint as to TPPI is that defendants reported \"phantom revenue\" and failed to make appropriate disclosure of an expected loss. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, as we must, the Complaint fails to support a \"strong inference\" of scienter as to Smith and Langford. The factual allegations, which satisfy the clarity-and-basis requirements as to the use of misleading accounting, lack sufficiently compelling and clear factual allegations concerning the culpable involvement of Smith and Langford to support a \"strong inference\" of scienter on their part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Complaint's rhetorical flourish, accusing defendants of reporting \"phantom revenue,\" the booking of revenues before their receipt does not necessarily involve any impropriety whatsoever. As described earlier, such anticipatory booking of revenues is integral to percentage-of-completion accounting (including with a zero-profit margin), according to the GAAP documents plaintiffs cite in the Complaint. In fact, for construction businesses engaged in S &amp; W's type of work, such percentage-of-completion accounting with anticipatory recognition of revenue is described as \"preferable in most circumstances.\" <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .25. The question raised by the Complaint is the more subtle one of whether <i>in the particular circumstances presented</i> it was appropriate to use percentage-of-completion accounting, which depended primarily on whether the purchaser of S &amp; W's services (TPPI) was expected to fulfill its obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the allegations of scienter concerning both the reporting of \"phantom revenue\" from the TPPI project and the failure to reflect the expected loss depend largely on whether the Complaint alleges facts supporting a strong inference that Smith and Langford did not expect TPPI to fulfill its commitments. The Complaint speaks vaguely of communications from TPPI to S &amp; W expressing doubt as to TPPI's resumption of the project and suggesting that S &amp; W get out of its contracts with vendors. These allegations are simply too vague to support a strong inference that Smith and Langford were aware of them or, if so, were reckless in failing to take them seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, without attribution, the Complaint alleges that S &amp; W obtained TPPI's permission to sell project materials. A former senior accountant is quoted for the proposition that the materials were sold \"for pennies on the dollar.\" This allegation is too sketchy and vague. There is no indication how broadly materials were sold or that senior management was aware of the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize the Complaint alleges that Smith and Langford knew the equipment sent to Indonesia for the project was being sold for pennies on the dollar and that the project would not be restarted. &#182; 75. It also alleges that \"it was evident to the Board [of Directors] ... that it was unlikely the project would ever restart.\" &#182; 77. Such conclusory allegations as to the existence of knowledge are insufficient to provide the factual basis, supporting a strong inference of scienter, required by the PSLRA. They are simply conclusory assertions of the facts for which a showing supporting a strong inference of scienter must be pleaded. Where the state of mind in question is the defendant's knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the Company's financial reports, and the PSLRA requires that facts be stated with particularity giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with that state of mind, the requirement is not satisfied by a pleading which simply asserts that the defendant knew of the falsity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of the claims regarding TPPI brought under Rule 10b-5 against Smith and Langford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</i> Our rulings on the claims brought under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 with respect to TPPI mirror our treatment of the claims brought under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 with respect to the alleged policy of underbidding. Because the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement does not apply to the claims brought under &#167;&#167; 20(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and 18, (1) we reject the reasons given by the district court for dismissing the claims, and (2) note that the reasons which support our order of dismissal of the similar claim under Rule 10b-5 have no application to these claims. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment dismissing them. We remand these claims to the district court for whatever further proceedings are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Concealment of Illiquidity, Inability to Pay Debts, and Impending Bankruptcy</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint's final major area of focus is on statements allegedly concealing S &amp; W's financial deterioration. The Complaint contends that S &amp; W issued false and misleading statements reassuring investors of S &amp; W's financial viability and its access to sufficient cash to meet its needs, even as its finances fell into shambles, and eventually into bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations of financial deterioration are set forth in the Complaint at length and with specificity. According to a former controller for S &amp; W's industrial division, by the middle of 1998, \"S &amp; W knew that the Company was `starting to get strapped for cash.'\" &#182; 70. The Company began having problems paying its vendors on the Tiverton project in the summer of 1998, leading some unpaid vendors to stop delivering materials to the project site. &#182; 71. Meanwhile, throughout 1998,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">comprehensive internal financial reports, distributed to approximately twenty S &amp; W division heads and top executives, that included financials broken out for all divisions, with details of personnel costs, sales, income and working capital and which also measured S &amp; W's performance against its plan for the year, showed a materially worse financial situation and outlook [than the disclosed financial results].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#182; 72. A confidential source, identified as the \"head of S &amp; W's Development Corporation\" said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anyone who had access to the monthly financials could see that it was not what was being said publicly. You could read them and compare them with the quarterlies he [Smith] was reporting and ask what he was smoking. Knowing what we knew inside and seeing the quarterlies-they just did not jibe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The financial problems continued to mount through 1999. Unpaid vendors threatened to place liens on the Tiverton project, &#182; 78; the Company began using credit cards to purchase materials for the project, &#182; 79; the Company faced calls seeking payment on various projects, &#182; 83; the Company's \"treasurer regularly sent e-mails to internal staff advising that the Company had no money to pay the vendors' bills and to not bother submitting requests for payment,\" <i>id.</i>; and the Company found that it was increasingly difficult to get vendors to bid on S &amp; W projects, &#182; 84. Some vendors and subcontractors called Smith directly to complain about not being paid, and \"those who called Smith regularly to collect money and threaten to walk off a project were usually the first to get paid.\" &#182; 85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By summer of 1999, a list of overdue accounts payable was created and regularly delivered to Smith, Langford, and S &amp; W's comptroller. &#182; 87. Some accounts payable were 600-700 days overdue, and consequently vendors and subcontractors were stopping work, engaging in slow-downs, or filing liens. <i>Id.</i> The Company succeeded in obtaining a credit agreement in July 1999, but was already in material default by the time the agreement was made because of the failure to pay vendors and subcontractors as required. &#182; 92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, needing cash to placate lenders, S &amp; W announced it was selling its headquarters building and cold storage business, but knew in December that the sale of its building would not alleviate its problems, and even had to \"obtain an emergency adjustment in its lending arrangements so it could survive long enough to complete the sale.\" &#182;&#182; 117, 119. In November, S &amp; W was told that it was in material breach of a $250-million contract because it had failed to pay subcontractors and suppliers, leading senior executives to embark on a \"desperate effort\" to stop the project from being terminated. &#182;&#182; 108, 110. In December, in a bid to generate cash, Smith and Langford caused the S &amp; W Employee Retirement Plan Trust to purchase 1 million shares of S &amp; W common stock, raising over $15 million. &#182; 121. By the end of the year, \"Smith's gasoline credit card was discontinued and newspaper delivery to S &amp; W's building was halted,\" &#182; 126, while at the Tiverton project site, \"trash was building up ... and spilling out of the dumpsters because S &amp; W had not paid the bills of the trash hauler,\" &#182; 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, the Complaint alleges, the owner of the Tiverton project notified S &amp; W of defaults on its contract because of liens placed on the Tiverton site, and S &amp; W was unable to cure the defaults. &#182;&#182; 98, 138. Cost overruns on the project at that time soared to over $27 million. &#182; 140. S &amp; W eventually filed for bankruptcy in June 2000. &#182; 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these events, the Complaint alleges, S &amp; W issued false and misleading statements principally in press releases and filings with the SEC, falsely asserting or implying that the Company had sufficient cash, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 172, 192, 199, and inadequately disclosing the extent of the Company's financial problems, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 283-84, 286-88, 293-94, 298-304, 305-06, 307-10. For example, in the context of these events, the Company repeatedly announced in its SEC filings that it \"believes that the types of businesses in which it is engaged require that it maintain a strong financial condition,\" and that it \"has on hand and has access to sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure needs.\" The Company included words to that effect in at least its March 1998 10-Q (filed in May 1998), &#182; 192, September 1998 10-Q (filed in November 1998), &#182; 223, 1998 10-K (filed in March 1999), &#182; 242, March 1999 10-Q (filed in May 1999), &#182; 264, and June 1999 10-Q (filed in August 1999), &#182; 278. As discussed below, the Company made notable disclosures about its financial difficulties in later filings, most especially in the fall of 1999. Plaintiffs acknowledge these disclosures, but argue that they did not go far enough in revealing the \"financial collapse\" that was upon S &amp; W. &#182; 283.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This group of allegations raises four primary questions: (1) Did disclosures made by S &amp; W in the fall of 1999, prior to the first purchase of S &amp; W stock by the named plaintiffs, adequately apprise investors of the financial problems facing the Company, rendering previous misleading statements immaterial as a matter of law, for purposes of this suit? (2) If not, do the Complaint's allegations meet the clarity-and-basis requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b)? (3) Does the Complaint satisfy the PSLRA's required \"strong inference\" of scienter with respect to Smith and Langford to support claims under Rule 10b-5? (4) As to some of the allegedly misleading statements made in quarterly and annual filings with the SEC, were they \"forward-looking\" statements, protected from suit by the PSLRA's safe harbor?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Falsity and materiality.</i> The district court first ruled, upon the defendants' motion to dismiss, that while some of the Company's statements made prior to the autumn of 1999 might be actionable, none of S &amp; W's statements made after that time were actionable because by then S &amp; W had made full disclosure of its financial woes. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 126. On that basis, the court granted summary judgment on all outstanding claims. Although the judgment was not explained, it was apparently based on the following reasoning: (1) None of the named plaintiffs purchased securities in S &amp; W prior to that time; (2) Any materially false statements made prior to that time had been cured, as a matter of law, by the Company's more revelatory statements made during autumn of 1999; and (3) Because the named plaintiffs could not assert claims on their own behalf based on statements made prior to autumn of 1999, they could not do so on behalf of class plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question we must consider is whether disclosures made by S &amp; W in the fall of 1999 so completely disclosed the alleged financial problems of the Company that they either corrected, or rendered immaterial as a matter of law, any misleading statements made before that point. We must determine whether S &amp; W sufficiently disclosed the state of affairs at S &amp; W, such that the totality of information offered to investors purchasing after that time could not be considered false or materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that they did not. Assuming, as we must, the truth of the Complaint's allegations as to the Company's financial condition in the fall of 1999, we find that the Company's statements made at that time, although more revealing than some earlier statements, were not so informative as to correct earlier false statements, or render them immaterial as a matter of law. A jury could reasonably find that the cumulative sum of information provided to investors by that point was still materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their argument that any prior falsity of statements had been cured by the autumn 1999 statements, defendants rely primarily on a Company press release dated October 27, 1999, and on the quarterly 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 15, 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The October 27, 1999, press release announced that the Company intended to sell its corporate headquarters and its cold storage business in order to \"enhance liquidity and focus on its core competencies.\" The document stated that the Company was \"not in compliance\" with its \"principal credit agreement\" and stated that it had \"requested waivers from its bank group regarding certain covenants\" in that agreement. It acknowledged also that S &amp; W could not \"continue normal operations\" unless it obtained \"additional short-term funding.\" Finally, it stated that \"[i]n light of the Company's current liquidity needs,\" the Board of Directors decided to omit the Company's normal quarterly dividend, and that S &amp; W had retained financial advisors \"to assist the Company in arranging and restructuring interim and long-term financing and with asset sales authorized by the board of directors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its November 15, 1999, 10-Q filing with the SEC, the Company noted that \"losses incurred in the past 24 months have negatively impacted the Company's cash position,\" and explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of the end of the third quarter of 1999, the Company had fully drawn the cash available to it under its current credit facility and the amount of the Company's past due trade payables had increased, as reflected in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with certain of the Company's vendors and subcontractors having delayed work to be performed by them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The falsity of a statement and the materiality of a false statement are questions for the jury. <i>See TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,</i> 426 U.S. 438, 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976); <i>see also In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 34. <i>Cf. United States v. Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. 506, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). A court is thus free to find, as a matter of law, that a statement was not false, or not materially false, only if a jury could not reasonably find falsity or materiality on the evidence presented. <i>See TSC Industries, Inc.,</i> 426 U.S. at 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126. We cannot agree that <i>as a matter of law</i> these disclosures sufficiently apprised investors of all material information regarding the Company's alleged financial condition and corrected or rendered immaterial the falsity of previous statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A potential investor after the autumn 1999 statements would likely examine not only the Company's very most recent statements, but also the statements made by the Company in the recent preceding periods. If prior to autumn 1999 the Company had issued false statements, describing its financial condition in misleadingly benign terms, those statements might continue to influence an investor's decision unless they had been retracted, had ceased to be relevant, or their misleading message had been adequately corrected by subsequent revelations or statements. In our view, although the autumn 1999 statements revealed more about the deterioration of the Company's financial conditions than prior statements, we cannot agree that, as a matter of law, a jury could not reasonably find that after their issuance the totality of the Company's statements continued to be materially misleading as to the Company's financial situation. For one thing, a company which has long maintained a strong financial position but recently fallen into a liquidity crunch may be considered a safer investment than a company with an identical present balance sheet which has been struggling with underfunding for some time. The former may be seen as coping with a sudden temporary reversal, likely to be cured by the good management practices which have long dominated, while in the latter case the current difficulty may appear the inevitable consequence of a continuous history of bad management, which is destined to result in eventual failure. The Company's autumn 1999 statements certainly made significant disclosures, but they did not sufficiently dispel the allegedly misleading picture of a Company which, up to that point, had maintained a strong position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, as we noted above, S &amp; W filings with the SEC made at least through August 1999 contained reassuring assertions informing investors that the Company \"has on hand and access to sufficient sources of funds,\" and even arguably implying that it \"maintain[ed] a strong financial condition.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#182; 278. If the Company's financial situation was in fact as dire as alleged by the Complaint, such statements could reasonably be found to be materially misleading. The Complaint portrays S &amp; W as a company in financial distress, spiraling toward bankruptcy &#8212; out of cash, unable to keep up with payments, and with vendors and subcontractors halting work and deliveries and threatening liens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the information released by the Company in autumn 1999 did not so clearly correct the alleged falsity of the earlier statements. Rather, a jury could reasonably find that the \"`total mix'\" of information available to an investor in the fall of 1999-that is, the totality of new disclosures, read in the context of previous statements by the Company &#8212; still was materially misleading, by virtue of both false statements and material omissions. <i>See TSC Industries, Inc.,</i> 426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>The PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis.</i> Finding that the dismissal of these claims cannot be supported on the basis of the autumn 1999 disclosures, we must next consider whether the allegations meet the requirements of the PSLRA. We have no doubt that these allegations pass the clarity-and-basis requirements. The Complaint paints a detailed account of the deteriorated financial conditions at S &amp; W, replete with factual support and citations to sources likely to have knowledge of the matter. The Complaint also identifies with specificity the statements alleged to be false and misleading and explains in what respect they were misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Strong inference of required state of mind.</i> In addition to passing the clarity-and-basis test, we find that these allegations also survive the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Claims under 10b-5.</i> Claims under Rule 10b-5 require proof of scienter. The Company statements alleged to be false concealments of its liquidity crunch were made at various times from 1997 to 2000. In order to plead a valid claim against Smith and Langford as to any of these statements, the Complaint must assert facts supporting a strong inference that they acted with scienter at the time the statement was made. We find that the Complaint alleges facts sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter on the parts of both Smith and Langford starting as early as January 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint alleges that during the summer of 1999 an accounts payable list showing accounts overdue by 600-700 days was being prepared on a regular basis for review by Smith and Langford and that the Company was so strapped for cash that no subcontractor was allowed to be paid without the personal approval of Smith or Langford. &#182; 87. The Complaint further alleges that in the spring of 1999 Smith received calls from vendors and subcontractors demanding payment and threatening to walk off their projects. <i>Id.</i> These allegations are clearly sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter for the periods to which they pertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations relating to the early part of 1999, which rely more heavily on circumstantial evidence, are nonetheless sufficient in our view, when taken together with the entire mix of alleged facts, to support a strong inference of at least recklessness with respect to the falsity, if not actual knowledge of the falsity. The financial strength of the Company was undoubtedly a matter of principal concern to its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company's public statements repeatedly stressed the importance of financial strength for a company engaged in S &amp; W's business, before going on to give assurance of S &amp; W's access to ample funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint alleges furthermore that throughout 1998 comprehensive internal financial reports of the Company's current condition were regularly distributed to the Company's top executives. <i>Id.</i> Although the contents of the reports are not described, we can fairly infer that they described what they purported to describe &#8212; the Company's current financial condition. According to the allegations of the Complaint, the condition that would have been reflected in those internal reports was becoming desperate, so that already the Company had slowed payments to vendors and subcontractors. If by the summer of 1999 such accounts were 600-700 days overdue, it follows that by January 1999, those accounts were 400-500 days overdue, and this was regularly revealed in internal reports distributed to Smith and Langford. An unnamed confidential source, the executive described as the head of S &amp; W's Development Corporation, is quoted in the Complaint as saying that a comparison of the Company's periodic internal reports distributed to the Company's executives with the statements signed by Smith in the Company's quarterly public reports would lead one to ask \"what [Smith] was smoking.\" &#182; 72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those allegations of particularized facts support a strong inference that by January 1999, both Smith and Langford were either aware of the misleading nature of the Company's reassuring reports, or were at least reckless with respect to their truthfulness on matters of enormous importance. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment relating to claims under Rule 10b-5 against Smith and Langford for false statements as early as January 1999 and thereafter relating to the Company's liquidity and financial condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</i> With respect to claims asserted against Smith and Langford under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 for statements concealing illiquidity and the deterioration of S &amp; W's financial condition, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings for the same reasons as given above relating to claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) <i>Safe harbor for forward-looking statements.</i> As for some of the statements which we ruled could serve as the basis for claims of misleading statements relating to the Company's liquidity and financial condition, the district court ruled in considering the defendant's motion to dismiss that these were within the PSLRA's safe harbor for \"forward-looking\" statements. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 125, 130. While the exact wording of these statements varied slightly, they effectively asserted that the Company \"has on hand and has access to sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure needs.\" <i>See</i> &#182; 192; <i>see also</i> &#182;&#182; 172, 208, 223, 242. We do not agree with the district court that this statement is necessarily protected by the PSLRA's safe harbor rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute generally provides, with specified limitations, that issuers and underwriters of securities shall not be liable in any private action based on an untrue or misleading statement of a material fact \"with respect to any forward-looking statement\" if the forward-looking statement is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement, ... or ... the plaintiff fails to prove that the forward-looking statement ...

The statute thus seems to provide a surprising rule that the maker of knowingly false and wilfully fraudulent forward-looking statements, designed to deceive investors, escapes liability for the fraud if the statement is \"identified as a forward-looking statement and [was] accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute goes on to define \"forward-looking\" statements as including: \"(A) a statement containing a projection of revenues, income ... earnings (including earnings loss) per share, ... capital expenditures, dividends, ... or other financial items; (B) a statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations ...; (C) a statement of future economic performance ...; (D) any statement of the assumptions underlying or relating to [any of the above].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 78u-5(i)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement in question asserted essentially that the Company \"has on hand ... sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated [needs].\" Because the statement includes a reference to anticipated future needs for funds, the district court found it to be \"forward-looking,\" apparently concluding that the statement came within the protection granted for \"a projection of ... capital expenditures, dividends, ... or other financial items.\" We think that the meaning of this curious statute, which grants (within limits) a license to defraud, must be somewhat more complex and restricted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By reason of the emphasis on \"projection[s],\" \"plans,\" and \"statement[s] of future economic performance,\" we understand the statute to intend to protect issuers and underwriters from liability for projections and predictions of future economic performance, which are later shown to have been inaccurate. <i>See Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i> 1814, def. 12b (1976) (defining \"projection\" as \"an estimate of future possibilities based on a current trend\"). The legislative history confirms this understanding. The House Conference Report explains that the bill was intended \"to enhance market efficiency by encouraging companies to disclose forward looking information\" that otherwise might be \"muzzled\" out of fear that making predictions could later spawn burdensome securities fraud actions. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369 (1995), 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 742.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem in applying this statute to the statement in question is that the statement is composed of elements that refer to estimates of future possibilities and elements that refer to present facts. Essentially the statement asserts that the Company has <i>present</i> access to funds sufficient to meet anticipated <i>future</i> needs. The part of the statement that speaks of the quantity of cash on hand speaks of a present fact. The part that speaks of the amount of \"anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure needs\" speaks of a projection of future economic performance. The claim of fraud, however, does not involve a contention that the defendants were underestimating the amount of their future cash needs. The claim is rather that the defendants were lying about the Company's present access to funds. The Company was, according to the allegations of the Complaint, in an extreme liquidity crunch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that in order to determine whether a statement falls within the safe harbor, a court must examine which aspects of the statement are alleged to be false. The mere fact that a statement contains some reference to a projection of future events cannot sensibly bring the statement within the safe harbor if the allegation of falsehood relates to non-forward-looking aspects of the statement. The safe harbor, we believe, is intended to apply only to allegations of falsehood as to the forward-looking aspects of the statement. <i>Cf. Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 82 F.3d 1194, 1213 (1st Cir.1996) (examining, in the context of the bespeaks caution doctrine, a statement that \"has both a forward-looking aspect and an aspect that encompasses a representation of present fact\" and concluding that the doctrine was inapplicable to the extent the statement \"encompasses the latter representation of <i>present fact</i>\"), <i>superceded by statute on other grounds, as noted in Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To illustrate the distinction we draw, assume as hypothetical facts that an issuer of securities relating to a business venture carrying an obvious risk of liability (say, the operation of an amusement park) issues a public statement that it has procured liability insurance in amounts sufficient to cover the maximum liability that can be anticipated based on comparable experience. Assume that in the suit, the aspect of the statement alleged to be fraudulent lies not in the estimate of likely liabilities, but in the fact that the issuer was lying in stating that it had obtained insurance. It in fact had no insurance policy. The accusation of falsity, in other words, lay not in the accuracy of the projection of future financial events, but rather in the representation of a present fact. Notwithstanding that the allegedly false statement \"contain[s] a projection of [future] financial items,\" we do not think Congress intended to grant safe harbor protection for such a statement whose falsity consists of a lie about a present fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our case is not precisely like the hypothetical example, we think the example illustrates that where the falsehood relates to a representation of present fact in the statement, it will not necessarily come within the statute's safe harbor, even though the statement might also contain a projection of future financial experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the alleged falsehood was in the fact that the statement claimed that the Company had access to ample cash at a time when the Company was suffering a dire cash shortage. The claim was not that the Company was understating its future cash needs. In our view, the safe harbor of the PSLRA does not confer a <i>carte blanche</i> to lie in such representations of current fact. We reject the district court's conclusion that the statements assuring that the Company had access to sufficient cash to cover anticipated needs were within the safe harbor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Claims Against PwC</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against PwC, the auditor of S &amp; W's accounts, the Complaint asserts claims under Rule 10b-5 and &#167; 18 relating to PwC's unqualified audit opinions on the Company's 1997, 1998, and 1999 financial statements contained in its annual 10-K filings. <i>See</i> &#182;&#182; 343-45. These opinions are alleged to have been false and misleading in two principal respects: They stated, first, that S &amp; W's financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP, and second, that PwC's audits were performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (\"GAAS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The PSLRA's Requirement of Clarity and Basis</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether these claims against PwC meet the PSLRA's requirements for clarity and basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claims that PwC falsely asserted compliance with GAAP focuses on the accounting for the allegedly underbid contracts and for the TPPI project. We have already considered substantially the same allegations made against Smith and Langford and found that they pass the PSLRA test for clarity and basis. Because the allegations against PwC are substantially the same for purposes of the clarity-and-basis test, we reach the same conclusion-that the claims against PwC also pass the clarity-and-basis test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of claims against PwC concerns its statements that its audits were performed in accordance with GAAS. To the extent that these claims relate to its failure to discover the alleged deviations from GAAP in the accounting for the underbid contracts and TPPI, we find that they pass the clarity-and-basis test. The other GAAS claims, however, rest on nothing more than a litany of conclusory allegations of failure to conform to various GAAS standards. The Complaint asserts also that PwC missed various \"red flag\" warning signs but lacks concreteness as to how the conduct of the audit related to the missed warning signs. <i>See</i> &#182;&#182; 341, 351. With the exception of the GAAS claims relating to the alleged GAAP violations for TPPI and the underbid contracts, we find the GAAS claims insufficient to pass the clarity-and-basis test of PSLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Strong Inference of State of Mind</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even while some allegations survive the clarity-and-basis test, they still must meet the strong-inference requirement with respect to any claim demanding proof of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Claims under Rule 10b-5.</i> As for the claims under Rule 10b-5, which requires proof of scienter, the claims based on both GAAP and GAAS fail completely to allege particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter on PwC's part. Plaintiffs point to four types of allegations which they contend are sufficient to pass the test. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Complaint makes the conclusory assertion that PwC auditors were \"aware of the true facts,\" which were inaccurately presented in S &amp; W's financials. &#182; 341. As noted above, a plaintiff does not satisfy the PSLRA's requirement of particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter by a conclusory assertion that the defendant knew the true facts, or knew that the challenged statement was false. What is needed is the allegation of particularized facts which give strong support to that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Complaint alleges that PwC missed \"red flags.\" &#182;&#182; 341, 351. However, the mere fact that an auditor missed what a plaintiff labels warning signs gives little support on its own to the conclusion that an auditor was reckless, much less wilfully blind, with respect to the falsity of information in a financial statement. Here the so-called \"red flags\" were so described without particularized allegations supporting the recklessness of PwC in missing them when conducting its audits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, plaintiffs point to allegations relating to the improper use of percentage-of-completion accounting on the TPPI project. <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#182; 67. But, as noted above, the alleged impropriety under GAAP of using the percentage-of-completion method, with a zero profit assumption, depends on the perception that the project was terminated, as opposed to delayed, and that it would result in a loss. We noted above that these allegations were insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter on the part of Smith and Langford. The case with respect to PwC is <i>a fortiori,</i> as PwC had less reason than Smith and Langford to know that TPPI would fail to obtain financing to continue the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final allegations on which plaintiffs rely is PwC's motivation to overlook S &amp; W's concealment of losses in order to protect its own source of lucrative accounting and consulting fees. We do not doubt that such a profit motive could contribute to an auditor's decision to \"turn[] a bind eye,\" <i>see</i> &#182; 347, to a corporation's misleading accounting. <i>See generally</i> Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, tit. II, Pub.L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (codified in various sections of 15 U.S.C.) (addressing concerns raised about auditor independence). Such allegations can thus strengthen an inference of scienter predicated on other facts, possibly adding sufficient strength to satisfy the strong-inference requirement of PSLRA. On the other hand, absent truly extraordinary circumstances, an auditor's motivation to continue a profitable business relationship is not sufficient by itself to support a strong inference of scienter.

Once again, we express no view as to whether these claims may be subject to dismissal on other grounds on which the district court did not rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Motion for Leave to Amend</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also appeal from the district court's denial of their motion for leave to amend the Complaint. Such a ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See Larocca v. Borden, Inc.,</i> 276 F.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir.2002). The district court denied the motion on the basis of undue delay in making the motion.

Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 135 (citing <i>Lindner Dividend Fund, Inc. v. Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 880 F.Supp. 49, 56-57 (D.Mass.1995)); <i>see also Basic Inc. v.

The district court also read the Complaint as alleging reliance only by the named plaintiffs and failing to allege reliance by the class plaintiffs, thus permitting only the named plaintiffs to pursue &#167; 18 claims. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 135. We are skeptical of this reading of the Complaint, especially given the obligation to construe the Complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. However, we refrain from expressing further views, as this finding by the district court was not directly raised as part of the appeal, and we anticipate that it will be subject to litigation on remand.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as among the array of documents alleged by plaintiffs in their Complaint to contain false statements, only the statements made in S &amp; W's annual (\"10-K\") filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") are deemed \"filed\" for the purposes of &#167; 18.

If that is an element of a claim under &#167; 20(a), the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement would appear to apply, as well.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants have not argued on appeal that \"culpable participation\" in an element of plaintiffs' case under &#167; 20(a), we will assume throughout this opinion that it is not an element and that the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA accordingly has no application to a claim under &#167; 20(a). It is not our intention, however, to foreclose that question. As we are remanding several claims under &#167; 20(a), we leave it to the district court to determine, in the first instance, if the issue is raised, whether \"culpable participation\" applies. Should the district court determine that \"culpable participation\" is an element of a claim under &#167; 20(a) and that the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA therefore applies, this may require the dismissal of claims we have remanded. Because of the commonality of elements of claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18, rulings one way or another in the district court as to &#167; 18 may well moot the question whether &#167; 20(a) requires \"culpable participation.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> SOP 81-1 states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Under the zero profit margin approach to applying the percentage-of-completion method, equal amounts of revenue and cost, measured on the basis of performance during the period, are presented in the income statement; whereas, under the completed-contract method, performance for a period is not reflected in the income statement, and no amount is presented in the income statement until the contract is completed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">SOP 81-1 &#182; .33.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> One difficulty we find with the district court's decision is that in several instances, in ruling on defendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court failed to read the Complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and failed to give the plaintiff the benefit of inferences that could reasonably be drawn. For example, where the court found \"internal inconsisten[cies]\" in the allegations, it concluded that the conflicting allegations \"undermine[d] the sufficiency of [the] claim.\"<i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 120-21.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff has the right to plead in the alternative, and the plaintiff's doing so does not undermine the validity of the complaint. The stronger of the conflicting allegations must be accepted as if the conflicting alternative allegation had not been included. Nor is this changed by the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement. In assessing whether the pleading satisfies the strong-inference requirement, a court must draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, and then weigh whether they satisfy the statutorily mandated \"strong inference.\" <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 78; <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 201.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In addition, we agree with the district court that Smith and Langford's change-in-control agreements did not provide a strong motive to engage in fraud<i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec.

With respect to most of the claims, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, based principally on the court's conclusion that the allegations were insufficient to satisfy the PSLRA's required pleading standards. On the remaining claims, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants and then entered a final judgment. We affirm the judgment as to some of the claims and vacate as to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lead plaintiffs, Ram Trust Services, Inc. and Lens Investment Management, LLC, are stockholders of Stone &amp; Webster Inc. (\"S &amp; W\" or the \"Company\"), and purport to represent a class of all purchasers of securities of S &amp; W between January 22, 1998, and May 8, 2000. They brought this consolidated securities-fraud class action against S &amp; W; its chairman, president, and chief executive officer, H. Kerner Smith; its executive vice president and chief financial officer, Thomas Langford; and its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (\"PwC\"). The claims against the Company were stayed at the outset because it had filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362. The action proceeded against Smith, Langford, and PwC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The very lengthy Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") alleges essentially that S &amp; W, with the complicity of the other defendants, issued fraudulent financial statements and press releases, designed to conceal S &amp; W's rapidly worsening financial condition. It asserts that S &amp; W, a 111-year-old \"global leader\" in construction, engineering, and consulting services, with consolidated gross revenues in 1999 exceeding $1.2 billion, &#182; 14, began in 1998 to experience rapid deterioration of its financial condition, which Smith and Langford aimed to conceal while they sought a purchaser for the Company. It alleges that PwC also concealed the Company's misleading accounting by making false statements to the effect that S &amp; W's financial statements were prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), and that in auditing and certifying S &amp; W's statements, PwC followed Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (\"GAAS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint's strongest factual allegations fall into three main categories, which will be explored in greater detail below. They are, first, that S &amp; W deliberately underbid on more than a billion dollars of contracts, which at the contract price could be performed only at a loss, and fraudulently reported anticipatory profits on these loss contracts, so as to overstate earnings; second, that S &amp; W fraudulently concealed its loss on a huge contract in Indonesia with Trans Pacific Petrochemical Indotama (\"TPPI\") by concealing the cancellation of the contract and thus reported unreceived revenues, inflating the Company's profits or diminishing its losses; and finally, that S &amp; W made public statements, which concealed and misrepresented its shortage of liquid reserves and its impending bankruptcy, as its finances slid into shambles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based chiefly on these allegations, the defendants are alleged to have violated &#167; 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\" or \"1934 Act\"), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5, as well as &#167; 18 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78r. In addition, Smith and Langford are alleged to have violated &#167; 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a), as persons in control of S &amp; W.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a memorandum and order dated March 28, 2003, the district court dismissed all claims against PwC and nearly all claims against Smith and Langford, finding that the Complaint failed to satisfy the pleading requirements imposed by the PSLRA and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) for securities fraud claims. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec.

Pertinent Elements of Plaintiffs' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three different statutory bases of the claims under the Exchange Act &#8212; &#167; 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (\"Rule 10b-5\"), &#167; 20(a), and &#167; 18 &#8212; rest on slightly different theories and thus have different elements, especially with respect to a plaintiff's need to plead and prove that the defendant acted with a specified state of mind.

The first is a pleading requirement, which specifies that a complaint alleging securities fraud must \"specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the body of this opinion, we will refer to this provision of &#167; 78u-4(b)(1) as the PSLRA's \"clarity-and-basis\" requirement.

We have interpreted this provision as demanding a recitation of facts supporting a \"highly likely\" inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind. <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82. We have explained, that \"[u]nder the PSLRA, the complaint must state with particularity facts that give rise to a `strong inference' of [the required state of mind], rather than merely a reasonable inference.... The inference ... must be reasonable and strong, but need not be irrefutable.\" <i>In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 38 (quoting 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2)); <i>see also Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82. In this opinion, we will refer to this provision of &#167; 78u-4(b)(2) as the \"strong-inference\" requirement of the PSLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these two pleading requirements, the PSLRA also carves out a statutory safe-harbor for many \"forward-looking\" statements. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5. \"Forward-looking\" statements are, generally speaking, statements that speak predictively of the future. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5(i)(1) (defining \"forward-looking statement\"). Under the safe harbor provisions, fraudulent forward-looking statements cannot give rise to liability in certain circumstances, including where the statement at issue is \"identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\" <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-5(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clarity-and-basis requirement of the PSLRA and its limited safe harbor for forward-looking statements seem to apply equally to claims under Rule 10b-5, &#167; 18, and &#167; 20(a). However, because Rule 10b-5, &#167; 18, and &#167; 20(a) differ as to whether the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement applies differently as among the three theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the terms of the PSLRA, the strong-inference requirement applies only to private actions \"in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind.\" A claim under Rule 10b-5 falls within those parameters. Under 10b-5 the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with scienter. Thus, the PSLRA requires that the Complaint allege with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. In contrast, &#167;&#167; 18 and 20(a) do not, at least on their face, require that the plaintiff prove that the defendant acted with any particular state of mind. The strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA therefore has no application to claims under these statutes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Applicable Accounting Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before turning to the precise allegations of the Complaint, we pause to discuss briefly certain accounting standards for long-term construction contracts, which are integral to an understanding of the Complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Long-term construction contracts can characteristically involve early periods during which the contractor's expenditures far exceed its revenues and later periods during which its revenues far exceed expenditures. Depending how the revenues and expenditures are accounted for, the profit and loss statements of contractors engaged in such long-term construction projects might present the appearance of drastic gyrations, beginning with large losses and later shifting to large profits, even though on a sophisticated analysis, the company's experience would reflect a predictable, orderly progress toward a predictable result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To counteract such misleading appearances of unpredictable gyrations, and present a more realistic picture of the stability of operating results, the accounting profession has developed, as part of GAAP, two accounting methods designed in proper circumstances to smooth out the reported operating results of such businesses. The Complaint points to, and quotes extensively from, three accounting documents, which provide guidance: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81-1: Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts (1981) (\"SOP 81-1\"), <i>see</i> &#182; 40, Accounting Research Bulletin 45: Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts (1955) (\"ARB 45\"), <i>see id.,</i> and Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (\"FAS 5\"), <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 44, 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to SOP 81-1 and ARB 45, as we understand them, the most favored method for a contractor to account for long-term construction contracts, <i>in appropriate circumstances,</i> is \"percentage-of-completion\" accounting. Under this approach, the contractor recognizes revenues expected to be received in the future, as well as net profits expected to be realized, as work on a contract progresses, notwithstanding that the contractor may not yet have received payment. In appropriate circumstances, this accounting method is thought to best reflect the actual \"economic substance\" of a contractor's transactions and therefore to be preferable. SOP 81-1 &#182;&#182; .22, .25. Under percentage-of-completion accounting, generally speaking, regardless of whether revenues have been received, a company recognizes as current revenue on its profit and loss statement that percentage of total expected revenue, which reflects the percentage that the costs incurred in the period bear to total estimated costs on the project. ARB 45 &#182; 4. Various conditions must be present to justify the use of this method, such as the expectation that the buyer will satisfy its obligations under the contract, and \"the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates,\" including \"estimates of the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues, and contract costs.\" SOP 81-1 &#182; .23. The current recognition of expected future profit, furthermore, presupposes that the contract be expected to yield a profit. <i>See id.</i> &#182;&#182; .25, .85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second generally accepted method of accounting for such contracts is called the completed-contract method. <i>See generally id.</i> &#182;&#182; .04, .30-.33. Under this method, \"income is recognized only when a contract is completed or substantially completed.\" <i>Id.</i> &#182; .30. Until that point, for the duration of contract performance, \"billings and costs are accumulated on the balance sheet, but no profit or income is recorded.\" <i>Id.</i> The completed-contract method is viewed as preferable when reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made or \"inherent hazards\" relating to contract conditions make profit predictions unreliable. <i>See id.</i> &#182; .32. A recognized weakness of the completed-contract method is that it \"does not reflect current performance when the period of a contract extends beyond one accounting period,\" and \"may result in irregular recognition of income.\" <i>See id.</i> &#182; .30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, in circumstances where \"estimating the final outcome may be impractical except to assure that no loss will be incurred,\" percentage-of-completion accounting, with a zero estimate of profit, may be utilized. <i>See id.</i> &#182; .25. In doing so, a company recognizes revenues (even though not yet received) equal to its costs incurred in the period \"until results can be estimated more precisely.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This zero-profit-margin approach resembles the completed-contract method in some respects and resembles percentage-of-completion in others. The similarity to completed-contract lies in the fact that, under both methods, no estimated future profit is recognized on a current basis as the job progresses. Profit is recognized only upon substantial completion. Its greater resemblance to percentage-of-completion lies in the fact that current costs, matched by equal amounts of anticipated revenue, are recognized in the current profit and loss statement, while under the completed-contract method, neither costs nor revenues from the project are reflected in the current profit and loss statement until substantial completion of the project.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See id.</i> &#182; .33. Thus, the zero-profit-margin approach provides an indication in the income statement of the \"volume of a company's business\" activity while the completed-contract approach does not. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of the method employed, however, anticipated losses are accounted for differently from anticipated profits. \"[W]hen the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract should be made.\" <i>Id.</i> &#182; .85; <i>see also</i> ARB 45 &#182;&#182; 6, 11. Such provision for losses should be made \"in the period in which they become evident.\" SOP 81-1 &#182; .85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The full amount of a \"probable\" loss should be taken as a charge against income if the amount of the loss \"can be reasonably estimated,\" according to FAS 5. <i>See</i> FAS 5 &#182; 8. If the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, \"disclosure of the contingency shall [instead] be made ... indicat[ing] the nature of the contingency and ... giv[ing] an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss\" where possible. <i>Id.</i> &#182; 10. Likewise, if there is only a \"reasonable possibility\" of a loss instead of a \"probable\" loss, disclosure instead of accrual is appropriate. <i>Id.</i> \"Probable\" is defined by FAS 5 to mean \"likely to occur.\" <i>Id.</i> &#182; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Allegations of the Complaint as to Smith and Langford</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background of pertinent legal rules and accounting principles, we turn to the central allegations in the Complaint, which as noted earlier, can be grouped into three general categories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Underbid Projects</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first category of plaintiffs' claims principally relates to the allegation that S &amp; W underbid various projects and fraudulently reported expected profits from these projects when, in fact, the projects were expected to produce losses. The district court dismissed all of these claims on the ground that the pleading failed to satisfy the PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis. We conclude that at least with respect to some of the claims, the clarity-and-basis requirement was satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis.</i> In our view, this pleading is not the kind of vague prelude to a fishing expedition that Congress sought to bar by imposing the clarity-and-basis requirement of the PSLRA. Citing sources within the company, the Complaint alleges that S &amp; W developed a strategy of bidding a number of projects at a loss. &#182;&#182; 52-53. The Complaint expressly names ten contracts, aggregating over $1.4 billion, which allegedly were underbid by margins between 10% and 40% and were expected to produce losses. &#182;&#182; 58-61. The Complaint alleges that the Company accounted for these projects using percentage-of-completion accounting, recognizing a proration of anticipated future profits in the current profit and loss statements, notwithstanding that losses, rather than profits, were expected to result from these contracts. &#182;&#182; 43, 47, 168. The Complaint refers to SOP 81-1, which forbids the use of the percentage-of-completion method to prorate anticipated future profits into current operating results unless future profits are in fact anticipated, <i>see</i> SOP 81-1 &#182;&#182; .24-.25, as well as FAS 5, which requires immediate recognition of expected losses, as soon as they are anticipated, <i>see</i> FAS 5 &#182; 8; SOP 81-1, &#182;&#182;.24, .85. The Complaint identifies with precision statements alleged to be false, including S &amp; W's periodic current earnings figures in its sequential profit and loss statements during the period of the alleged fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to clarity, the Complaint sets forth a clear and precise statement of what the alleged fraud consisted of. With respect to basis, while the sources of information on which the Complaint relies for these allegations are not overwhelmingly impressive, they include sources within the Company who might well have access to the kind of information for which they are cited. Furthermore, the allegations are not merely conclusory, but are rather supported by details that provide factual support for plaintiffs' allegations of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that these pleadings complied sufficiently with PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis, as well as with the preexisting requirements of Rule 9(b). <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). We have previously stated that PSLRA does not require the plaintiff to \"plead evidence.\" <i>See In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 33. As we understand, it was not Congress's intention to bar all suits as to which the plaintiff could not yet prove a <i>prima facie</i> case at the time of the complaint, but rather to prevent suits based on a guess that fraud may be found, without reasonable basis or a clear understanding as to what the fraud consisted of, but in the hope of finding something in the course of discovery. <i>Cf. In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 30 (observing that the \"statute was designed to erect barriers to frivolous strike suits, but not to make meritorious claims impossible to bring\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the district court dismissed these claims on the grounds that they failed to satisfy the clarity-and-basis requirement of PSLRA, we respectfully disagree. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the dismissal of all of those claims should be vacated. We believe some of the claims relating to the underbidding of contracts were fatally flawed for other reasons and thus affirm the dismissal as to some of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Strong inference of scienter.</i> As noted, the PSLRA imposes an additional hurdle: The Complaint must allege facts supporting a strong inference of whatever state of mind on the part of the defendant must be proved as an element of the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Claims under 10b-5.</i> To the extent these claims are asserted under Rule 10b-5, the plaintiffs must prove that the defendants acted with scienter in order to establish their right of recovery. Accordingly, under the PSLRA, the Complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendants acted with either knowing, intentional falsity or reckless disregard for the truthfulness of the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the Complaint deficient in this respect. First, the Complaint provides nothing supporting the inference that either Smith or Langford was directly involved in the detailed accounting for these ten particular contracts, or had knowledge of the alleged falsity. One could draw the inference that Langford, as the Chief Financial Officer, had some supervisory involvement with the accounting. But no strong inference necessarily follows that the Chief Financial Officer, much less the Chief Executive Officer, was aware of the improper proration of future profits on any particular underbid contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This weakness is accentuated by another. The larger the distortion of the company's accounting figures, the more likely it might be that such distortion could not be accomplished without either complicity, or reckless irresponsibility, of top officers. The Complaint, however, gives no indication whatsoever what the size of the alleged overstatement of current profits was. Such an overstatement, in the circumstances alleged, would result primarily from two variables &#8212; the size of the expected future loss which should have been taken as a charge against current earnings, <i>see</i> FAS 5 &#182; 8, and the size of the improperly anticipated future profits prorated into the current profit and loss statement. The Complaint says nothing of the size of either component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Complaint at times does not even assert that a loss was expected from these underbid contracts. Its description of the \"underbidding policy\" asserts that Smith planned the \"selling [of] fixed-price jobs <i>either at a loss or with such small margin for error</i> that the slightest adverse change in a project's economics would cause S &amp; W to lose money on the job.\" &#182; 53 (emphasis added). According to this description, the contracts were bid near the expected break-even point, or with the expectation of a small and unreliable profit, rather than with expectation of a loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that in assessing a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleading, we must read the Complaint in the manner most favorable to the plaintiff, drawing reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, <i>see Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 79, and that inconsistent pleading does not deprive the pleader of the right to have the complaint read, as between the inconsistencies, in the manner that supports the adequacy of the pleading. The PSLRA's strong-inference requirement does not change this rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because the Complaint elsewhere asserts that the ten projects were bid \"at a loss,\" &#182; 58, we credit the Complaint as asserting that the projects were indeed bid at a loss, rather than at the break-even point or at a slight profit. Nonetheless, the Complaint in no way suggests that the losses anticipated from these contracts were large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point, the Complaint asserts that \"[a]ccording to ... former S &amp; W insiders, S &amp; W's underbidding [of those contracts] ranged from 10% to 40%.\" &#182; 61. But it says nothing about how much loss would be expected to result from underbidding by 10% to 40%. That would depend on the anticipated profit margins of a normal bid, not affected by the underbidding strategy, and the Complaint includes no allegation about that. Nor does the Complaint allege what percentage of the Company's net operating figures were attributable to the ten contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the Complaint tells no more than that, in the accounting for ten contracts, a profit of unspecified size was recognized in current earnings when, according to GAAP principles, those contracts should have been booked either as a loss of unspecified size or using a zero-profit-margin assumption coupled with a note describing a loss contingency. As anything above the break-even point represents profit, and anything below the break-even point represents loss, the difference between profit and loss can on a particular contract be tiny. Nothing in the Complaint suggests that correct accounting for these contracts would have involved significantly different overall numbers from those produced by the allegedly incorrect accounting. And if the accounting for those contracts had no significant effect on the Company's overall results, there is little reason to assume that the Company's CEO and CFO must have known about the failure to follow accepted accounting practices. Irregular financial statements which overstate estimated results to only a small degree do not support a strong inference that the Chief Executive Office or the Chief Financial Officer of the company acted with intent to defraud, or with reckless disregard for the truth of the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third significant weakness in the alleged basis of scienter is that in such accounting, the question whether to recognize profit or loss depends not on concrete facts but an <i>estimation or prediction</i> of whether in the end the project will net a profit or a loss. The Complaint fails to allege particularized facts supporting the inference that a reasonable assessment of the facts relating to those underbid contracts could support a prediction only of loss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we determine that the claims of fraud for improper proration of future profits on these ten allegedly underbid contracts, to the extent asserted under Rule 10b-5, as to which \"the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with [scienter],\" fail the requirement of the PSLRA that \"the complaint ... state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with [scienter].\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). As to those 10b-5 claims, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach a different result, however, where those claims are asserted under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</i> As explained above, the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement does not apply to claims under &#167; 20(a), because this statute does not require proof of the defendant's state of mind.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that a plaintiff must show under &#167; 20(a) that the controlled entity committed a violation of the securities laws. If that violation was, for example, a violation of Rule 10b-5, which requires a proof of scienter, then the plaintiff under &#167; 20(a) must prove that the controlled entity acted with \"a particular state of mind.\" Nonetheless, if the statute is read literally, the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA does not apply. The statute states that the strong-inference requirement applies only where the plaintiff's recovery depends on proof that \"<i>the defendant</i> acted with a particular state of mind\" (emphasis added). <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2). The obligation to prove that the controlled corporation acted with scienter does not involve an obligation to prove \"that <i>the defendant</i> acted with a particular state of mind.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 18 similarly imposes no burden on plaintiff to prove the defendant's state of mind, shifting the burden to the defendant to show \"that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading.\" <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78r(a). Accordingly, the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA has no application to &#167; 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 based on improper recognition of anticipated profits on underbid contracts, (1) we reject the reasons given by the district court for dismissing these claims, and (2) we conclude that the reasons which support our order of dismissal of the similar claim under Rule 10b-5 have no application to these claims. Accordingly we vacate the judgment dismissing them. As to whether one or both of those claims is subject to possible dismissal for other reasons, we express no view. We remand the claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 to the district court for whatever further proceedings are appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Backlog.</i> In addition to alleging that the policy of underbidding resulted in materially overstated earnings, the Complaint also alleges that it was misleading of defendants to include the underbid contracts in S &amp; W's \"backlog.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 228, 248-49, 251, 254, 284, 313-15. As to these claims, brought under Rule 10b-5, &#167; 20(a), and &#167; 18, we sustain the district court's dismissal. Plaintiffs have simply failed to plead a false statement with respect to the \"backlog\" allegations, and so their claims must be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). As defined by the Complaint, S &amp; W's backlog consisted of \"the accumulated amount of the Company's committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" &#182; 38. These contracts represented \"committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" The statements resulting from the inclusion of the contracts in the backlog were neither false nor misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The TPPI Project and \"Phantom Revenue\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second group of claims of fraud relates to the TPPI contract for construction in Indonesia, which was ultimately cancelled for lack of funding. The Complaint alleges that S &amp; W, with the knowledge of Smith and Langford, reported expected future payments as current revenues, even though the project was indefinitely suspended and defendants knew it was unlikely to ever be resumed. The Complaint alleges that S &amp; W overstated its current revenues and concealed an expected loss, which according to GAAP principles should have been recognized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations are essentially as follows: In 1996, TPPI awarded to S &amp; W a $710-million contract in connection with the construction of a $2.3-billion chemical complex in Indonesia. &#182; 63. S &amp; W procured and transported to Indonesia approximately $332 million worth of materials and equipment to perform the project. &#182; 64. Under its agreements, S &amp; W assumed responsibility for cancellation costs with respect to equipment purchase orders and subcontract work. &#182;&#182; 64-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, TPPI suspended work on the project because its funding arrangements were exhausted. &#182; 65. The Complaint alleges that \"TPPI suggested to S &amp; W [in 1997] that it try to get out of its contracts with its vendors due to the suspension.\" <i>Id.</i> By August 1998, S &amp; W obtained permission from TPPI to resell project materials and equipment, and it began selling equipment, according to Daniel Martino, a former senior accountant at S &amp; W, \"for pennies on the dollar.\" &#182;&#182; 58, 73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By January 1999, \"it was clear that the project would not restart,\" and \"TPPI had told S &amp; W that the slight prospect that had existed during 1998 that they would find an investor to fund the project had fallen through.\" &#182; 74. In January 1999, a special meeting of the Company's Board of Directors was held to discuss TPPI, and by the end of the meeting \"it was evident to the Board that the TPPI project had already caused S &amp; W serious financial problems and that it was unlikely the project would ever restart.\" &#182; 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint asserts that because the Company had incurred substantial costs without corresponding revenue, the suspension of the project</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">should have had a significant negative effect on S &amp; W's financial statements. According to CS-1 [an informant who had been an assistant comptroller at S &amp; W], to avoid that negative effect, beginning with the first quarter of 1998, S &amp; W created phantom revenue and receivables from the TPPI project to cover S &amp; W's project related costs by recording revenue equal to the amount of those costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#182; 67. S &amp; W booked $86.9 million of such \"phantom revenue\" in connection with TPPI in 1998 and $53 million in 1999. &#182; 68. The use of this allegedly fraudulent accounting changed the Company's results in 1998 from a loss of $108.7 million to a reported loss of $49.3 million, and in 1999 from a loss of $11.3 million to reported net income of $20.5 million. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, because S &amp; W knew the project was cancelled, it was obligated under FAS 5 to immediately recognize the entire expected loss either as a charge or as a loss contingency. <i>See</i> &#182; 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the notes to the financial statements did refer to a loss contingency based on TPPI, the Complaint alleges that the references were false in two respects. First, the notes stated that the Company \"believes it unlikely that the project will be cancelled,\" or otherwise gave the impression of a likely restart, <i>see</i> &#182;&#182; 209, 224, 296, while the apparent circumstances showed it was highly likely the contract would be cancelled. Second, the amount of the loss estimated to result from the cancellation was substantially understated given the immense investment the Company had made in the TPPI project and the high probability the entire investment would be lost if TPPI failed to reinstate the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, the Complaint describes two separate, though related, accounting abuses in violation of GAAP principles: First, it alleges the overstatement of revenues (\"phantom revenues\") and concealment of loss by inappropriate use of percentage-of-completion accounting (assuming a zero-profit margin) to report current revenues not yet received, when the buyer could not \"be expected to satisfy [its] obligations under the contract.\" <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .23. The offsetting of the actual current losses with projected revenues that were not expected ever to be received allegedly concealed large current losses on the project. Second, the Complaint alleges concealment of an expected loss by failure to acknowledge it appropriately, either as a charge to income, or as an accurately described loss contingency. <i>See</i> FAS 5 &#182;&#182; 8, 10. The Complaint alleges that as a result of these accounting decisions, S &amp; W's financial results published in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings, as well as in other public announcements, were materially overstated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Complaint alleges that S &amp; W misled investors by carrying the TPPI project in its backlog, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182; 221, failing to acknowledge that the project was terminated or at least unlikely to restart, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 166, 193, 209, 217, 224, 296, and reporting a materially understated estimate of the Company's losses when disclosing the \"charge\" S &amp; W would take in the event the project were to be cancelled, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 209, 224, 296.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>The PSLRA's requirement of clarity and basis.</i> In our view, the allegations of exaggerated revenues and failure to report an expected loss are sufficiently detailed and supported to satisfy the PSLRA's clarity-and-basis requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These allegations are quite detailed and clear in setting forth what are the allegedly false and misleading statements and in explaining why they are false and misleading. The GAAP documents cited by the Complaint specify that the propriety of reporting unreceived payments as current revenue, matched with currently incurred costs, depends on a reasonable expectation that the buyer will satisfy the obligation to make the payments. <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .23. The Complaint adequately explains that in these circumstances, TPPI, which had lost its source of funding and had indefinitely suspended all work on the project, could not be expected to satisfy its contractual obligation to make payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It also seems clear from the GAAP documents that as soon as \"current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract should be made.\" <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .85; <i>see also</i> ARB 45 &#182;&#182; 6, 11. A probable loss should be \"accrued by a charge to income\" when \"the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.\" FAS 5 &#182; 8. A \"reasonable possibility\" of loss should be properly described and declared as a loss contingency. <i>Id.</i> &#182; 10. The Complaint clearly states its theory that TPPI's expected failure to pay would result in very substantial losses to S &amp; W, which it did not take as a charge against earnings. To the extent the probable loss is described in the contingency notes of S &amp; W's statements, the Complaint alleges with clarity that the notes are misleading in describing the possibility that TPPI might cancel as \"unlikely,\" &#182; 209, and in understating the size of the loss that would result in the event of that contingency. Furthermore, drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, the Complaint adequately asserts that the amount of loss could have been reasonably estimated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that, as in <i>Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 82, and <i>In re Cabletron Systems, Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d at 39, these allegations are sufficiently detailed and clear to satisfy the clarity-and-basis requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, claims of fraud based on the mere inclusion of the TPPI contract in S &amp; W's \"backlog\" must be dismissed. We affirm the district court's dismissal of these aspects of the Complaint for substantially the same reasons in our discussion of the inclusion of the allegedly underbid contracts in the backlog. As defined by the Complaint, S &amp; W's backlog consisted of \"the accumulated amount of the Company's committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" &#182; 38. Even if the TPPI project was unlikely to restart, it still constituted, under the terms of the Complaint, \"committed, but unexpended, contractual work.\" S &amp; W's statements as to backlog cannot be considered false or misleading just because they included the TPPI contract. Thus, these statements cannot give rise to liability under Rule 10b-5, &#167; 20(a), or &#167; 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Strong inference of scienter.</i> As noted above, where the plaintiff's recovery depends on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, the Complaint must set forth facts giving rise to a \"strong inference\" that the defendants acted with the required state of mind. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Claims under 10b-5.</i> The claims relating to TPPI, to the extent pleaded under 10b-5, must be supported by facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. We find that the allegations as to Smith and Langford's involvement with TPPI fail that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal theory of the Complaint as to TPPI is that defendants reported \"phantom revenue\" and failed to make appropriate disclosure of an expected loss. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, as we must, the Complaint fails to support a \"strong inference\" of scienter as to Smith and Langford. The factual allegations, which satisfy the clarity-and-basis requirements as to the use of misleading accounting, lack sufficiently compelling and clear factual allegations concerning the culpable involvement of Smith and Langford to support a \"strong inference\" of scienter on their part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Complaint's rhetorical flourish, accusing defendants of reporting \"phantom revenue,\" the booking of revenues before their receipt does not necessarily involve any impropriety whatsoever. As described earlier, such anticipatory booking of revenues is integral to percentage-of-completion accounting (including with a zero-profit margin), according to the GAAP documents plaintiffs cite in the Complaint. In fact, for construction businesses engaged in S &amp; W's type of work, such percentage-of-completion accounting with anticipatory recognition of revenue is described as \"preferable in most circumstances.\" <i>See</i> SOP 81-1 &#182; .25. The question raised by the Complaint is the more subtle one of whether <i>in the particular circumstances presented</i> it was appropriate to use percentage-of-completion accounting, which depended primarily on whether the purchaser of S &amp; W's services (TPPI) was expected to fulfill its obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the allegations of scienter concerning both the reporting of \"phantom revenue\" from the TPPI project and the failure to reflect the expected loss depend largely on whether the Complaint alleges facts supporting a strong inference that Smith and Langford did not expect TPPI to fulfill its commitments. The Complaint speaks vaguely of communications from TPPI to S &amp; W expressing doubt as to TPPI's resumption of the project and suggesting that S &amp; W get out of its contracts with vendors. These allegations are simply too vague to support a strong inference that Smith and Langford were aware of them or, if so, were reckless in failing to take them seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, without attribution, the Complaint alleges that S &amp; W obtained TPPI's permission to sell project materials. A former senior accountant is quoted for the proposition that the materials were sold \"for pennies on the dollar.\" This allegation is too sketchy and vague. There is no indication how broadly materials were sold or that senior management was aware of the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize the Complaint alleges that Smith and Langford knew the equipment sent to Indonesia for the project was being sold for pennies on the dollar and that the project would not be restarted. &#182; 75. It also alleges that \"it was evident to the Board [of Directors] ... that it was unlikely the project would ever restart.\" &#182; 77. Such conclusory allegations as to the existence of knowledge are insufficient to provide the factual basis, supporting a strong inference of scienter, required by the PSLRA. They are simply conclusory assertions of the facts for which a showing supporting a strong inference of scienter must be pleaded. Where the state of mind in question is the defendant's knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the Company's financial reports, and the PSLRA requires that facts be stated with particularity giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with that state of mind, the requirement is not satisfied by a pleading which simply asserts that the defendant knew of the falsity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of the claims regarding TPPI brought under Rule 10b-5 against Smith and Langford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</i> Our rulings on the claims brought under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 with respect to TPPI mirror our treatment of the claims brought under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 with respect to the alleged policy of underbidding.

The Complaint contends that S &amp; W issued false and misleading statements reassuring investors of S &amp; W's financial viability and its access to sufficient cash to meet its needs, even as its finances fell into shambles, and eventually into bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations of financial deterioration are set forth in the Complaint at length and with specificity. According to a former controller for S &amp; W's industrial division, by the middle of 1998, \"S &amp; W knew that the Company was `starting to get strapped for cash.'\" &#182; 70. The Company began having problems paying its vendors on the Tiverton project in the summer of 1998, leading some unpaid vendors to stop delivering materials to the project site. &#182; 71. Meanwhile, throughout 1998,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">comprehensive internal financial reports, distributed to approximately twenty S &amp; W division heads and top executives, that included financials broken out for all divisions, with details of personnel costs, sales, income and working capital and which also measured S &amp; W's performance against its plan for the year, showed a materially worse financial situation and outlook [than the disclosed financial results].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#182; 72. A confidential source, identified as the \"head of S &amp; W's Development Corporation\" said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anyone who had access to the monthly financials could see that it was not what was being said publicly. You could read them and compare them with the quarterlies he [Smith] was reporting and ask what he was smoking.

Unpaid vendors threatened to place liens on the Tiverton project, &#182; 78; the Company began using credit cards to purchase materials for the project, &#182; 79; the Company faced calls seeking payment on various projects, &#182; 83; the Company's \"treasurer regularly sent e-mails to internal staff advising that the Company had no money to pay the vendors' bills and to not bother submitting requests for payment,\" <i>id.</i>; and the Company found that it was increasingly difficult to get vendors to bid on S &amp; W projects, &#182; 84. Some vendors and subcontractors called Smith directly to complain about not being paid, and \"those who called Smith regularly to collect money and threaten to walk off a project were usually the first to get paid.\" &#182; 85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By summer of 1999, a list of overdue accounts payable was created and regularly delivered to Smith, Langford, and S &amp; W's comptroller. &#182; 87. Some accounts payable were 600-700 days overdue, and consequently vendors and subcontractors were stopping work, engaging in slow-downs, or filing liens. <i>Id.</i> The Company succeeded in obtaining a credit agreement in July 1999, but was already in material default by the time the agreement was made because of the failure to pay vendors and subcontractors as required. &#182; 92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, needing cash to placate lenders, S &amp; W announced it was selling its headquarters building and cold storage business, but knew in December that the sale of its building would not alleviate its problems, and even had to \"obtain an emergency adjustment in its lending arrangements so it could survive long enough to complete the sale.\" &#182;&#182; 117, 119. In November, S &amp; W was told that it was in material breach of a $250-million contract because it had failed to pay subcontractors and suppliers, leading senior executives to embark on a \"desperate effort\" to stop the project from being terminated. &#182;&#182; 108, 110. In December, in a bid to generate cash, Smith and Langford caused the S &amp; W Employee Retirement Plan Trust to purchase 1 million shares of S &amp; W common stock, raising over $15 million. &#182; 121. By the end of the year, \"Smith's gasoline credit card was discontinued and newspaper delivery to S &amp; W's building was halted,\" &#182; 126, while at the Tiverton project site, \"trash was building up ... and spilling out of the dumpsters because S &amp; W had not paid the bills of the trash hauler,\" &#182; 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, the Complaint alleges, the owner of the Tiverton project notified S &amp; W of defaults on its contract because of liens placed on the Tiverton site, and S &amp; W was unable to cure the defaults. &#182;&#182; 98, 138. Cost overruns on the project at that time soared to over $27 million. &#182; 140. S &amp; W eventually filed for bankruptcy in June 2000. &#182; 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these events, the Complaint alleges, S &amp; W issued false and misleading statements principally in press releases and filings with the SEC, falsely asserting or implying that the Company had sufficient cash, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 172, 192, 199, and inadequately disclosing the extent of the Company's financial problems, <i>see, e.g.,</i> &#182;&#182; 283-84, 286-88, 293-94, 298-304, 305-06, 307-10. For example, in the context of these events, the Company repeatedly announced in its SEC filings that it \"believes that the types of businesses in which it is engaged require that it maintain a strong financial condition,\" and that it \"has on hand and has access to sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure needs.\" The Company included words to that effect in at least its March 1998 10-Q (filed in May 1998), &#182; 192, September 1998 10-Q (filed in November 1998), &#182; 223, 1998 10-K (filed in March 1999), &#182; 242, March 1999 10-Q (filed in May 1999), &#182; 264, and June 1999 10-Q (filed in August 1999), &#182; 278. As discussed below, the Company made notable disclosures about its financial difficulties in later filings, most especially in the fall of 1999. Plaintiffs acknowledge these disclosures, but argue that they did not go far enough in revealing the \"financial collapse\" that was upon S &amp; W. &#182; 283.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This group of allegations raises four primary questions: (1) Did disclosures made by S &amp; W in the fall of 1999, prior to the first purchase of S &amp; W stock by the named plaintiffs, adequately apprise investors of the financial problems facing the Company, rendering previous misleading statements immaterial as a matter of law, for purposes of this suit? (2) If not, do the Complaint's allegations meet the clarity-and-basis requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b)? (3) Does the Complaint satisfy the PSLRA's required \"strong inference\" of scienter with respect to Smith and Langford to support claims under Rule 10b-5? (4) As to some of the allegedly misleading statements made in quarterly and annual filings with the SEC, were they \"forward-looking\" statements, protected from suit by the PSLRA's safe harbor?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Falsity and materiality.</i> The district court first ruled, upon the defendants' motion to dismiss, that while some of the Company's statements made prior to the autumn of 1999 might be actionable, none of S &amp; W's statements made after that time were actionable because by then S &amp; W had made full disclosure of its financial woes. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 126. On that basis, the court granted summary judgment on all outstanding claims. Although the judgment was not explained, it was apparently based on the following reasoning: (1) None of the named plaintiffs purchased securities in S &amp; W prior to that time; (2) Any materially false statements made prior to that time had been cured, as a matter of law, by the Company's more revelatory statements made during autumn of 1999; and (3) Because the named plaintiffs could not assert claims on their own behalf based on statements made prior to autumn of 1999, they could not do so on behalf of class plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question we must consider is whether disclosures made by S &amp; W in the fall of 1999 so completely disclosed the alleged financial problems of the Company that they either corrected, or rendered immaterial as a matter of law, any misleading statements made before that point. We must determine whether S &amp; W sufficiently disclosed the state of affairs at S &amp; W, such that the totality of information offered to investors purchasing after that time could not be considered false or materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that they did not. Assuming, as we must, the truth of the Complaint's allegations as to the Company's financial condition in the fall of 1999, we find that the Company's statements made at that time, although more revealing than some earlier statements, were not so informative as to correct earlier false statements, or render them immaterial as a matter of law. A jury could reasonably find that the cumulative sum of information provided to investors by that point was still materially misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their argument that any prior falsity of statements had been cured by the autumn 1999 statements, defendants rely primarily on a Company press release dated October 27, 1999, and on the quarterly 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 15, 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The October 27, 1999, press release announced that the Company intended to sell its corporate headquarters and its cold storage business in order to \"enhance liquidity and focus on its core competencies.\" The document stated that the Company was \"not in compliance\" with its \"principal credit agreement\" and stated that it had \"requested waivers from its bank group regarding certain covenants\" in that agreement. It acknowledged also that S &amp; W could not \"continue normal operations\" unless it obtained \"additional short-term funding.\" Finally, it stated that \"[i]n light of the Company's current liquidity needs,\" the Board of Directors decided to omit the Company's normal quarterly dividend, and that S &amp; W had retained financial advisors \"to assist the Company in arranging and restructuring interim and long-term financing and with asset sales authorized by the board of directors.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its November 15, 1999, 10-Q filing with the SEC, the Company noted that \"losses incurred in the past 24 months have negatively impacted the Company's cash position,\" and explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of the end of the third quarter of 1999, the Company had fully drawn the cash available to it under its current credit facility and the amount of the Company's past due trade payables had increased, as reflected in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with certain of the Company's vendors and subcontractors having delayed work to be performed by them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The falsity of a statement and the materiality of a false statement are questions for the jury. <i>See TSC Industries, Inc. v.

A court is thus free to find, as a matter of law, that a statement was not false, or not materially false, only if a jury could not reasonably find falsity or materiality on the evidence presented. <i>See TSC Industries, Inc.,</i> 426 U.S. at 450, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109481\"><a href=\"/opinion/109481/tsc-industries-inc-v-northway-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We cannot agree that <i>as a matter of law</i> these disclosures sufficiently apprised investors of all material information regarding the Company's alleged financial condition and corrected or rendered immaterial the falsity of previous statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A potential investor after the autumn 1999 statements would likely examine not only the Company's very most recent statements, but also the statements made by the Company in the recent preceding periods. If prior to autumn 1999 the Company had issued false statements, describing its financial condition in misleadingly benign terms, those statements might continue to influence an investor's decision unless they had been retracted, had ceased to be relevant, or their misleading message had been adequately corrected by subsequent revelations or statements. In our view, although the autumn 1999 statements revealed more about the deterioration of the Company's financial conditions than prior statements, we cannot agree that, as a matter of law, a jury could not reasonably find that after their issuance the totality of the Company's statements continued to be materially misleading as to the Company's financial situation. For one thing, a company which has long maintained a strong financial position but recently fallen into a liquidity crunch may be considered a safer investment than a company with an identical present balance sheet which has been struggling with underfunding for some time. The former may be seen as coping with a sudden temporary reversal, likely to be cured by the good management practices which have long dominated, while in the latter case the current difficulty may appear the inevitable consequence of a continuous history of bad management, which is destined to result in eventual failure. The Company's autumn 1999 statements certainly made significant disclosures, but they did not sufficiently dispel the allegedly misleading picture of a Company which, up to that point, had maintained a strong position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, as we noted above, S &amp; W filings with the SEC made at least through August 1999 contained reassuring assertions informing investors that the Company \"has on hand and access to sufficient sources of funds,\" and even arguably implying that it \"maintain[ed] a strong financial condition.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#182; 278. If the Company's financial situation was in fact as dire as alleged by the Complaint, such statements could reasonably be found to be materially misleading. The Complaint portrays S &amp; W as a company in financial distress, spiraling toward bankruptcy &#8212; out of cash, unable to keep up with payments, and with vendors and subcontractors halting work and deliveries and threatening liens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the information released by the Company in autumn 1999 did not so clearly correct the alleged falsity of the earlier statements. Rather, a jury could reasonably find that the \"`total mix'\" of information available to an investor in the fall of 1999-that is, the totality of new disclosures, read in the context of previous statements by the Company &#8212; still was materially misleading, by virtue of both false statements and material omissions. <i>See TSC Industries, Inc.,</i> 426 U.S. at 449, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109481\"><a href=\"/opinion/109481/tsc-industries-inc-v-northway-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have no doubt that these allegations pass the clarity-and-basis requirements. The Complaint paints a detailed account of the deteriorated financial conditions at S &amp; W, replete with factual support and citations to sources likely to have knowledge of the matter. The Complaint also identifies with specificity the statements alleged to be false and misleading and explains in what respect they were misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) <i>Strong inference of required state of mind.</i> In addition to passing the clarity-and-basis test, we find that these allegations also survive the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) <i>Claims under 10b-5.</i> Claims under Rule 10b-5 require proof of scienter. The Company statements alleged to be false concealments of its liquidity crunch were made at various times from 1997 to 2000. In order to plead a valid claim against Smith and Langford as to any of these statements, the Complaint must assert facts supporting a strong inference that they acted with scienter at the time the statement was made. We find that the Complaint alleges facts sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter on the parts of both Smith and Langford starting as early as January 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint alleges that during the summer of 1999 an accounts payable list showing accounts overdue by 600-700 days was being prepared on a regular basis for review by Smith and Langford and that the Company was so strapped for cash that no subcontractor was allowed to be paid without the personal approval of Smith or Langford. &#182; 87. The Complaint further alleges that in the spring of 1999 Smith received calls from vendors and subcontractors demanding payment and threatening to walk off their projects. <i>Id.</i> These allegations are clearly sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter for the periods to which they pertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations relating to the early part of 1999, which rely more heavily on circumstantial evidence, are nonetheless sufficient in our view, when taken together with the entire mix of alleged facts, to support a strong inference of at least recklessness with respect to the falsity, if not actual knowledge of the falsity. The financial strength of the Company was undoubtedly a matter of principal concern to its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company's public statements repeatedly stressed the importance of financial strength for a company engaged in S &amp; W's business, before going on to give assurance of S &amp; W's access to ample funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Complaint alleges furthermore that throughout 1998 comprehensive internal financial reports of the Company's current condition were regularly distributed to the Company's top executives. <i>Id.</i> Although the contents of the reports are not described, we can fairly infer that they described what they purported to describe &#8212; the Company's current financial condition. According to the allegations of the Complaint, the condition that would have been reflected in those internal reports was becoming desperate, so that already the Company had slowed payments to vendors and subcontractors. If by the summer of 1999 such accounts were 600-700 days overdue, it follows that by January 1999, those accounts were 400-500 days overdue, and this was regularly revealed in internal reports distributed to Smith and Langford. An unnamed confidential source, the executive described as the head of S &amp; W's Development Corporation, is quoted in the Complaint as saying that a comparison of the Company's periodic internal reports distributed to the Company's executives with the statements signed by Smith in the Company's quarterly public reports would lead one to ask \"what [Smith] was smoking.\" &#182; 72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those allegations of particularized facts support a strong inference that by January 1999, both Smith and Langford were either aware of the misleading nature of the Company's reassuring reports, or were at least reckless with respect to their truthfulness on matters of enormous importance. We therefore vacate the district court's judgment relating to claims under Rule 10b-5 against Smith and Langford for false statements as early as January 1999 and thereafter relating to the Company's liquidity and financial condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) <i>Claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.</i> With respect to claims asserted against Smith and Langford under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18 for statements concealing illiquidity and the deterioration of S &amp; W's financial condition, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings for the same reasons as given above relating to claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) <i>Safe harbor for forward-looking statements.</i> As for some of the statements which we ruled could serve as the basis for claims of misleading statements relating to the Company's liquidity and financial condition, the district court ruled in considering the defendant's motion to dismiss that these were within the PSLRA's safe harbor for \"forward-looking\" statements. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 125, 130. While the exact wording of these statements varied slightly, they effectively asserted that the Company \"has on hand and has access to sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure needs.\" <i>See</i> &#182; 192; <i>see also</i> &#182;&#182; 172, 208, 223, 242.

The statute thus seems to provide a surprising rule that the maker of knowingly false and wilfully fraudulent forward-looking statements, designed to deceive investors, escapes liability for the fraud if the statement is \"identified as a forward-looking statement and [was] accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute goes on to define \"forward-looking\" statements as including: \"(A) a statement containing a projection of revenues, income ... earnings (including earnings loss) per share, ... capital expenditures, dividends, ... or other financial items; (B) a statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations ...; (C) a statement of future economic performance ...; (D) any statement of the assumptions underlying or relating to [any of the above].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 78u-5(i)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement in question asserted essentially that the Company \"has on hand ... sufficient sources of funds to meet its anticipated [needs].\" Because the statement includes a reference to anticipated future needs for funds, the district court found it to be \"forward-looking,\" apparently concluding that the statement came within the protection granted for \"a projection of ... capital expenditures, dividends, ... or other financial items.\" We think that the meaning of this curious statute, which grants (within limits) a license to defraud, must be somewhat more complex and restricted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By reason of the emphasis on \"projection[s],\" \"plans,\" and \"statement[s] of future economic performance,\" we understand the statute to intend to protect issuers and underwriters from liability for projections and predictions of future economic performance, which are later shown to have been inaccurate. <i>See Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i> 1814, def. 12b (1976) (defining \"projection\" as \"an estimate of future possibilities based on a current trend\"). The legislative history confirms this understanding. The House Conference Report explains that the bill was intended \"to enhance market efficiency by encouraging companies to disclose forward looking information\" that otherwise might be \"muzzled\" out of fear that making predictions could later spawn burdensome securities fraud actions. <i>See</i> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369 (1995), 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 742.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem in applying this statute to the statement in question is that the statement is composed of elements that refer to estimates of future possibilities and elements that refer to present facts. Essentially the statement asserts that the Company has <i>present</i> access to funds sufficient to meet anticipated <i>future</i> needs. The part of the statement that speaks of the quantity of cash on hand speaks of a present fact. The part that speaks of the amount of \"anticipated operating, dividend and capital expenditure needs\" speaks of a projection of future economic performance. The claim of fraud, however, does not involve a contention that the defendants were underestimating the amount of their future cash needs. The claim is rather that the defendants were lying about the Company's present access to funds. The Company was, according to the allegations of the Complaint, in an extreme liquidity crunch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that in order to determine whether a statement falls within the safe harbor, a court must examine which aspects of the statement are alleged to be false. The mere fact that a statement contains some reference to a projection of future events cannot sensibly bring the statement within the safe harbor if the allegation of falsehood relates to non-forward-looking aspects of the statement. The safe harbor, we believe, is intended to apply only to allegations of falsehood as to the forward-looking aspects of the statement. <i>Cf. Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196753\"><a href=\"/opinion/196753/shaw-v-digital/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1213 (1st Cir.1996) (examining, in the context of the bespeaks caution doctrine, a statement that \"has both a forward-looking aspect and an aspect that encompasses a representation of present fact\" and concluding that the doctrine was inapplicable to the extent the statement \"encompasses the latter representation of <i>present fact</i>\"), <i>superceded by statute on other grounds, as noted in Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To illustrate the distinction we draw, assume as hypothetical facts that an issuer of securities relating to a business venture carrying an obvious risk of liability (say, the operation of an amusement park) issues a public statement that it has procured liability insurance in amounts sufficient to cover the maximum liability that can be anticipated based on comparable experience. Assume that in the suit, the aspect of the statement alleged to be fraudulent lies not in the estimate of likely liabilities, but in the fact that the issuer was lying in stating that it had obtained insurance. It in fact had no insurance policy. The accusation of falsity, in other words, lay not in the accuracy of the projection of future financial events, but rather in the representation of a present fact. Notwithstanding that the allegedly false statement \"contain[s] a projection of [future] financial items,\" we do not think Congress intended to grant safe harbor protection for such a statement whose falsity consists of a lie about a present fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While our case is not precisely like the hypothetical example, we think the example illustrates that where the falsehood relates to a representation of present fact in the statement, it will not necessarily come within the statute's safe harbor, even though the statement might also contain a projection of future financial experience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the alleged falsehood was in the fact that the statement claimed that the Company had access to ample cash at a time when the Company was suffering a dire cash shortage. The claim was not that the Company was understating its future cash needs. In our view, the safe harbor of the PSLRA does not confer a <i>carte blanche</i> to lie in such representations of current fact. We reject the district court's conclusion that the statements assuring that the Company had access to sufficient cash to cover anticipated needs were within the safe harbor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Claims Against PwC</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against PwC, the auditor of S &amp; W's accounts, the Complaint asserts claims under Rule 10b-5 and &#167; 18 relating to PwC's unqualified audit opinions on the Company's 1997, 1998, and 1999 financial statements contained in its annual 10-K filings. <i>See</i> &#182;&#182; 343-45. These opinions are alleged to have been false and misleading in two principal respects: They stated, first, that S &amp; W's financial statements were prepared in conformity with GAAP, and second, that PwC's audits were performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (\"GAAS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The PSLRA's Requirement of Clarity and Basis</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether these claims against PwC meet the PSLRA's requirements for clarity and basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claims that PwC falsely asserted compliance with GAAP focuses on the accounting for the allegedly underbid contracts and for the TPPI project. We have already considered substantially the same allegations made against Smith and Langford and found that they pass the PSLRA test for clarity and basis. Because the allegations against PwC are substantially the same for purposes of the clarity-and-basis test, we reach the same conclusion-that the claims against PwC also pass the clarity-and-basis test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of claims against PwC concerns its statements that its audits were performed in accordance with GAAS. To the extent that these claims relate to its failure to discover the alleged deviations from GAAP in the accounting for the underbid contracts and TPPI, we find that they pass the clarity-and-basis test. The other GAAS claims, however, rest on nothing more than a litany of conclusory allegations of failure to conform to various GAAS standards. The Complaint asserts also that PwC missed various \"red flag\" warning signs but lacks concreteness as to how the conduct of the audit related to the missed warning signs. <i>See</i> &#182;&#182; 341, 351. With the exception of the GAAS claims relating to the alleged GAAP violations for TPPI and the underbid contracts, we find the GAAS claims insufficient to pass the clarity-and-basis test of PSLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Strong Inference of State of Mind</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even while some allegations survive the clarity-and-basis test, they still must meet the strong-inference requirement with respect to any claim demanding proof of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) <i>Claims under Rule 10b-5.</i> As for the claims under Rule 10b-5, which requires proof of scienter, the claims based on both GAAP and GAAS fail completely to allege particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter on PwC's part. Plaintiffs point to four types of allegations which they contend are sufficient to pass the test. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Complaint makes the conclusory assertion that PwC auditors were \"aware of the true facts,\" which were inaccurately presented in S &amp; W's financials. &#182; 341. As noted above, a plaintiff does not satisfy the PSLRA's requirement of particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter by a conclusory assertion that the defendant knew the true facts, or knew that the challenged statement was false. What is needed is the allegation of particularized facts which give strong support to that conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Complaint alleges that PwC missed \"red flags.\" &#182;&#182; 341, 351. However, the mere fact that an auditor missed what a plaintiff labels warning signs gives little support on its own to the conclusion that an auditor was reckless, much less wilfully blind, with respect to the falsity of information in a financial statement. Here the so-called \"red flags\" were so described without particularized allegations supporting the recklessness of PwC in missing them when conducting its audits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, plaintiffs point to allegations relating to the improper use of percentage-of-completion accounting on the TPPI project. <i>See, e.g.,</i> &#182; 67. But, as noted above, the alleged impropriety under GAAP of using the percentage-of-completion method, with a zero profit assumption, depends on the perception that the project was terminated, as opposed to delayed, and that it would result in a loss. We noted above that these allegations were insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter on the part of Smith and Langford. The case with respect to PwC is <i>a fortiori,</i> as PwC had less reason than Smith and Langford to know that TPPI would fail to obtain financing to continue the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final allegations on which plaintiffs rely is PwC's motivation to overlook S &amp; W's concealment of losses in order to protect its own source of lucrative accounting and consulting fees. We do not doubt that such a profit motive could contribute to an auditor's decision to \"turn[] a bind eye,\" <i>see</i> &#182; 347, to a corporation's misleading accounting. <i>See generally</i> Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, tit. II, Pub.L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (codified in various sections of 15 U.S.C.) (addressing concerns raised about auditor independence). Such allegations can thus strengthen an inference of scienter predicated on other facts, possibly adding sufficient strength to satisfy the strong-inference requirement of PSLRA. On the other hand, absent truly extraordinary circumstances, an auditor's motivation to continue a profitable business relationship is not sufficient by itself to support a strong inference of scienter. And here there was virtually nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's dismissal of the Rule 10b-5 claims against PwC. The allegations of the Complaint, whether viewed separately or cumulatively, do not rest on particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) <i>Claims under &#167; 18.</i> Because the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement does not apply to claims under &#167; 18, we vacate the district court's judgment dismissing the claims under &#167; 18 alleging that PwC falsely asserted conformity with GAAP in the accounting for TPPI and the allegedly underbid projects and with GAAS in PwC's audits relating to that accounting. Once again, we express no view as to whether these claims may be subject to dismissal on other grounds on which the district court did not rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Motion for Leave to Amend</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also appeal from the district court's denial of their motion for leave to amend the Complaint. Such a ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See Larocca v. Borden, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199759\"><a href=\"/opinion/199759/larocca-v-borden-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2002). The district court denied the motion on the basis of undue delay in making the motion. We find no abuse of discretion in that ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, given that we hereby vacate the judgment terminating the action and remand for further proceedings, plaintiffs may well reassert a motion for leave to amend the Complaint, and the district court may conclude that in the context of a continuing action, the equities affecting such a motion have changed. We express no view on the question of the appropriate disposition of a renewed motion for leave to amend in the continuing action, but leave that to the district court's good judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part. The case is remanded for further proceedings in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Costs are awarded to the appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 18 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder ... which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 78r(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> With respect to the instant case, the district court ruled that under &#167; 18 plaintiffs must show specific reliance on an allegedly misleading statement, and cannot rely on a presumption of fraud on the market as in Rule 10b-5 cases<i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span> (1988). No party directly challenges that ruling in this appeal, and so we have no reason to review it here. The district court also read the Complaint as alleging reliance only by the named plaintiffs and failing to allege reliance by the class plaintiffs, thus permitting only the named plaintiffs to pursue &#167; 18 claims. <i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 135. We are skeptical of this reading of the Complaint, especially given the obligation to construe the Complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. However, we refrain from expressing further views, as this finding by the district court was not directly raised as part of the appeal, and we anticipate that it will be subject to litigation on remand.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as among the array of documents alleged by plaintiffs in their Complaint to contain false statements, only the statements made in S &amp; W's annual (\"10-K\") filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") are deemed \"filed\" for the purposes of &#167; 18.

This Circuit has taken no position on the question. <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 85. The district court in the instant case did not rule on the question, <i>see In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 135, and the parties did not brief it. We therefore again take no position in this decision on whether \"culpable participation\" is required, or on what it means.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The full text of this provision reads:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant&#8212;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(A) made an untrue statement of a material fact; or</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(B) omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(1).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> As noted above in footnote four, this Circuit has taken no position on the question whether a plaintiff must prove \"culpable participation\" on the part of the defendant in order to prevail under &#167; 20(a)<i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 85. \"Culpable participation\" would seem to imply a culpable state of mind. If that is an element of a claim under &#167; 20(a), the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement would appear to apply, as well.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants have not argued on appeal that \"culpable participation\" in an element of plaintiffs' case under &#167; 20(a), we will assume throughout this opinion that it is not an element and that the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA accordingly has no application to a claim under &#167; 20(a). It is not our intention, however, to foreclose that question. As we are remanding several claims under &#167; 20(a), we leave it to the district court to determine, in the first instance, if the issue is raised, whether \"culpable participation\" applies. Should the district court determine that \"culpable participation\" is an element of a claim under &#167; 20(a) and that the strong-inference requirement of the PSLRA therefore applies, this may require the dismissal of claims we have remanded. Because of the commonality of elements of claims under &#167;&#167; 20(a) and 18, rulings one way or another in the district court as to &#167; 18 may well moot the question whether &#167; 20(a) requires \"culpable participation.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> SOP 81-1 states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Under the zero profit margin approach to applying the percentage-of-completion method, equal amounts of revenue and cost, measured on the basis of performance during the period, are presented in the income statement; whereas, under the completed-contract method, performance for a period is not reflected in the income statement, and no amount is presented in the income statement until the contract is completed.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">SOP 81-1 &#182; .33.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> One difficulty we find with the district court's decision is that in several instances, in ruling on defendants' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court failed to read the Complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and failed to give the plaintiff the benefit of inferences that could reasonably be drawn. For example, where the court found \"internal inconsisten[cies]\" in the allegations, it concluded that the conflicting allegations \"undermine[d] the sufficiency of [the] claim.\"<i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig.,</i> 253 F.Supp.2d at 120-21.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff has the right to plead in the alternative, and the plaintiff's doing so does not undermine the validity of the complaint. The stronger of the conflicting allegations must be accepted as if the conflicting alternative allegation had not been included. Nor is this changed by the PSLRA's strong-inference requirement. In assessing whether the pleading satisfies the strong-inference requirement, a court must draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, and then weigh whether they satisfy the statutorily mandated \"strong inference.\" <i>See Aldridge,</i> 284 F.3d at 78; <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 201.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In addition, we agree with the district court that Smith and Langford's change-in-control agreements did not provide a strong motive to engage in fraud<i>See In re Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., Sec.
