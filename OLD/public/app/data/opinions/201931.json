Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                             Circuit Judges.\n\f     Kedra Segler on brief pro se.\n     Stephen J. Cullen, Jeffrey M. Geller and Miles & Stockbridge\nP.C., Modesto L. Rodriguez-Suarez and Marichal & Hernandez LLP on\nbrief for Jurgen Peter Aldinger.\n\n\n                        November 23, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.      After the petitioner-father Jurgen Peter\n\nAldinger prevailed in obtaining an order requiring the respondent-\n\nmother   Kedra   Adele   Segler   to     return   their    minor   children    to\n\nGermany, the district court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 11607(b)(3),\n\nordered Ms. Segler to pay Mr. Aldinger's attorneys' fees and travel\n\nexpenses in the amount of $17,775.            Mr. Aldinger argues that the\n\ncourt awarded too little. Ms. Segler did not cross-appeal from the\n\naward; she subsequently moved to vacate the award and has appealed\n\nthat denial.     We affirm the district court's orders.\n\n                         The Fee and Expense Award\n\n           Mr. Aldinger claims that the district court misapplied 42\n\nU.S.C. § 11607(b)(3). We review fee and expense awards for mistake\n\nof law or abuse of discretion.         See Coutin v. Young & Rubicam P.R.,\n\nInc., 124 F.3d 331, 336 (1st Cir. 1997).                There is no basis to\n\ndisturb the award here.\n\n           While Mr. Aldinger argues that a court may modify an\n\naward of the requested fees and costs only if the respondent\n\nestablishes that such an award would be \"clearly inappropriate,\"\n\nMr.   Aldinger   ignores    the   fact    that    the   court   also   has    the\n\nobligation to determine whether the requested fees and costs were\n\n\"necessary\" to secure the children's return.              See Whallon v. Lynn,\n\n356 F.3d 138, 140 (1st Cir. 2004).           Thus, the court did not err in\n\nconsidering the necessity of each expense.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            Mr. Aldinger also argues that the court erred by failing\n\nto engage in a lodestar analysis of the attorneys' fees.                  A court\n\nemploying the lodestar method multiplies the number of hours\n\nreasonably spent on a case by a reasonable hourly rate to arrive at\n\nthe lodestar figure.         Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337, citing Hensley v.\n\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).                 To determine a reasonable\n\nnumber   of    hours,    a     court    may    subtract    \"hours   which     were\n\nduplicative, unproductive, excessive, or otherwise unnecessary.\"\n\nUnited States v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 1988).    We do not reach the question of whether the lodestar\n\nmethod is required.            In fact, the district court essentially\n\napplied the lodestar method in this case, and the deductions it\n\nmade for excessive hours are supported by the record.                     See id.\n\n(noting that lodestar method is a \"flexible paradigm\" and that \"'we\n\nnormally prefer to defer to any thoughtful rationale and decision\n\ndeveloped     by   a   trial    court    and    to    avoid   extensive     second\n\nguessing'\") (quoting Grendel's Den, Inc. v. Larkin, 749 F.2d 945,\n\n950 (1st Cir. 1984)).1\n\n            Mr. Aldinger finally argues that the court erred by\n\nfailing to award the fees and costs he and his parents incurred in\n\n\n\n     1\n      Mr. Aldinger also complains that the court failed to apply\nthe lodestar method in determining a reasonable hourly rate. The\ncourt, however, did not reduce the attorney's claimed rate in\ncomputing the fee award.       Although the court noted in a\nparenthetical that the rate was high, it appears to have reduced\nthe requested fees based on excessive hours.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fvisiting the children while they were wrongfully retained in the\n\nUnited States and transporting the children back to Germany.            This\n\nargument lacks merit. The district court correctly held that those\n\nvisits were not necessary to enable the father to obtain the return\n\nof the children.    See 42 U.S.C. § 11607(b)(3) (providing for award\n\nof \"necessary expenses\" that are \"related to the return of the\n\nchild\"); see also Pub. Notice 957, 51 Fed. Reg. 10494, 10511 (1986)\n\n(noting that \"necessary expenses\" encompass expenditures required\n\n\"to secure the child's return\").          The court did not award return\n\ncosts because Mr. Aldinger agreed to pay those costs. Mr. Aldinger\n\ncannot now assert that he should be reimbursed for them.\n\n           Although Ms. Segler did not cross-appeal from the fee and\n\nexpense award, she argues that the award should be reversed and\n\nvacated because the district court neglected to consider Mr.\n\nAldinger's failure to pay adequate child support and how the award\n\nwill   adversely   affect   the   best    interests   of   the   children   by\n\nlimiting her ability to support them.        Ms. Segler's arguments fail\n\nfor two separate reasons. First, she did not cross-appeal from the\n\naward, and, thus, we lack jurisdiction to hear her claims.                  Cf.\n\nJohnson v. Teamsters Local 559, 102 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(dismissing late cross-appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction).\n\nWhile Ms. Segler argues that her subsequent appeal from the denial\n\nof her motion to vacate the award constitutes a valid cross-appeal\n\nof the underlying award, this contention lacks merit.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           Second, Ms. Segler did not raise either issue in her\n\nopposition to Mr. Aldinger's request for fees and costs. Thus, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in failing to consider these issues.\n\nMs. Segler does not explain why she failed to raise them.   Also, to\n\nthe extent she argues that Mr. Aldinger failed to pay child support\n\nafter the court's decision, the court could not have considered\n\nsomething that had not yet happened.\n\n                  The Motion to Vacate The Award\n\n           As noted above, Ms. Segler did not cross-appeal from the\n\naward. She subsequently moved to vacate the award, which the court\n\ndenied \"for lack of jurisdiction.\"    Ms. Segler's appeal, however,\n\ndoes not even address the propriety of that decision.   Rather, she\n\nfocuses her arguments on the merits of the underlying award.\n\nAccordingly, she has waived the issue.        Venegas-Hernandez v.\n\nSonolux Records, 370 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that\n\nissue not raised in brief is waived).\n\n           Ms. Segler also attempts to raise new claims.    Because\n\nthey were not raised in the district court, we do not consider\n\nthem.   See Amcel Corp. v. International Executive Sales, Inc., 170\n\nF.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           The district court's orders dated September 30, 2004,\n\nNovember 8, 2004, and April 19, 2005, are summarily affirmed.   See\n\n1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
