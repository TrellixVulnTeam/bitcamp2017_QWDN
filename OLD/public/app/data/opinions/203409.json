McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                             July 28, 2008\n\f            Per Curiam.       After pleading guilty to possessing child\n\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and being\n\nsentenced   to    the   ten-year    mandatory   minimum    under   18   U.S.C.\n\n§   2252A(b)(2),1   defendant      appeals   from   his   conviction    on   the\n\ngrounds that (1) his guilty plea was unknowing because, at the time\n\nof his plea, he was not informed of the mandatory minimum; (2) his\n\nprior conviction for indecent assault on a minor should not have\n\nserved as a predicate for the mandatory minimum because he did not\n\nknowingly waive his right to counsel before pleading guilty to that\n\noffense;    and   (3)   the   prior   conviction    should   not   have      been\n\nconsidered because it was not included in the indictment or proven\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.          For the reasons discussed below, we\n\nreject each of these arguments and summarily affirm the conviction.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Defendant was aware as early as June 2006 that, assuming\n\nthe validity of his prior conviction, the instant offense carried\n\na mandatory minimum sentence of ten years and that, if he filed a\n\nmotion to withdraw his plea on that ground,\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Section 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the possession of \"any\n. . . videotape . . . that contains an image of child pornography.\"\nIn general, persons who violate that provision are subject to a\nterm of imprisonment of \"not more than 10 years.\"         18 U.S.C.\n§ 2252A(b)(2).    However, if the person \"has a prior conviction\n. . . under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual\nabuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor\n. . ., such person shall be . . . imprisoned for not less than 10\nyears nor more than 20 years.\" Id.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthe court would be inclined to grant it.       Yet, from that time\n\nthrough his sentencing eight months later, in February 2007, he\n\nnever moved to withdraw his plea.       Under those circumstances,\n\ndefendant arguably waived any challenge to the validity of his plea\n\nby intentionally relinquishing a known right. See United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993) (distinguishing between waiver and\n\nforfeiture). But, even assuming that this challenge was not waived\n\nentirely but merely forfeited, this court's review is only for\n\nplain error.   United States v. Vonn,   535 U.S. 55, 63 (2002).\n\n          Under that standard, even where the district court\n\ncommitted an obvious legal error in the plea proceedings,2 the\n\nplea will not be vacated on appeal unless the defendant can also\n\nshow that the error affected his \"substantial rights.\"     Olano,\n\n507 U.S. at 734-35.    To make that showing in the guilty-plea\n\ncontext, a defendant \"must show a reasonable probability that,\n\nbut for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\"    United\n\nStates v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 83 (2004);3 see also\n\n\n     2\n      The error here--failing to inform defendant of the ten-year\nmandatory minimum--was not obvious when made but became so only\nwhen the probation officer later discovered that defendant had a\nprior conviction for indecent assault on a minor, which triggered\nthe mandatory minimum under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(b)(2).\n     3\n      Before Dominguez Benitez, this court applied a less demanding\nstandard as to whether an error in plea proceedings affected a\ndefendant's \"substantial rights.\"     See, e.g., United States v.\nCastro-Gomez, 233 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding such an\neffect where defendant's decision to plead guilty \"could reasonably\nhave [been] affected\"); United States v. Santo, 225 F.3d 92, 101\n(1st Cir. 2000) (finding such an effect where defendant's\n\n                               -3-\n\fUnited States v. Caraballo-Rodriguez, 480 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 489 (2007).         \"A defendant must thus\n\nsatisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the\n\nentire record, that the probability of a different result is\n\n'sufficient   to   undermine   confidence   in   the   outcome   of   the\n\nproceeding.'\"      Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at 83 (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Defendant does not attempt to make such a showing here,\n\nand the record strongly suggests the opposite, i.e., that even if\n\ndefendant had been told at his plea colloquy that a ten-year\n\nmandatory minimum applied, he still would have pled guilty. When\n\nthe potential applicability of the mandatory minimum first came\n\nto light, the court immediately offered to vacate the guilty plea\n\non that ground if defendant so desired.     In the ensuing colloquy,\n\nthe prosecutor suggested that defendant might still want to plead\n\nguilty in light of ongoing negotiations to get a concurrent\n\nsentence in a related, pending state-court matter; and defense\n\ncounsel agreed with that characterization of those negotiations\n\nin the state-court case.       At a second conference two months\n\nlater, defense counsel indicated, after speaking to his client,\n\nthat even if the prior conviction is deemed valid, triggering the\n\nten-year mandatory minimum, defendant probably would not want to\n\n\nwillingness to plead guilty \"might conceivably have been\nlessened\").   Defendant's reliance on such pre-Dominguez Benitez\ncases is therefore misplaced.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fwithdraw his plea.       Again the court indicated its willingness to\n\ngrant a motion to withdraw the plea, but no such motion was filed\n\neven after the court ruled that the mandatory minimum applied and\n\nproceeded to sentence him to that minimum.                 The fact that\n\ndefendant was offered several opportunities to withdraw his plea\n\nafter being informed of the mandatory minimum but never sought to\n\ndo so is a strong indication that, even if he had been informed\n\nof the mandatory minimum at the change-of-plea hearing, he still\n\nwould have pled guilty.           Thus, defendant has failed to meet his\n\nburden of demonstrating a \"reasonable probability that . . . he\n\nwould not have entered the plea,\" Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. at\n\n83, had he been informed of the mandatory minimum at the time.\n\nAccordingly, under the plain-error standard, no relief from his\n\nplea is warranted at this late stage.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            After carefully reviewing the underlying record, we\n\nagree   with    the    district     court's   conclusion   that    defendant\n\nknowingly waived his right to counsel before pleading guilty to\n\nindecent assault on a minor and therefore affirm the denial of\n\ndefendant's motion to exclude that conviction for purposes of\n\ncomputing      his    mandatory    minimum    sentence   under    18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252A(b)(2).        In so doing, we rely primarily on the analysis\n\ncontained in the district court's thorough and well-reasoned\n\ndecision, United States v. Bates, 2006 WL 3210434, at *1-*2 (D.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fMe. Nov. 6, 2006).            See generally Metro. Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nZaldivar, 413 F.3d 119, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).                We add only the\n\nfollowing comments from an appellate perspective.\n\n           The     district     court's    factual    findings   are   amply\n\nsupported by the record or reasonable inferences therefrom and\n\ntherefore readily survive scrutiny under the applicable clearly\n\nerroneous standard.      United States v. Frechette, 456 F.3d 1, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).      In making those findings, the district court\n\nproperly placed the burden on the defendant to establish that his\n\nprior conviction (whose existence he does not dispute) was\n\ninvalid, United States v. Sanchez, 354 F.3d 70, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), and properly applied the presumption of regularity that\n\nattaches      to   criminal    judgments     even    when    challenged   on\n\nconstitutional grounds, Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 37 (1992);\n\nSanchez, 354 F.3d at 81.          And, in concluding that defendant's\n\nwaiver   of    counsel   was    knowing,    the     court   considered    the\n\nappropriate factors, including defendant's education, experience,\n\nand prior exposure to the criminal justice system; the relative\n\nsimplicity of the charge; the stage of the proceedings at which\n\ncounsel was waived; the favorable sentencing outcome; and the\n\nabsence of an appeal from or collateral attack on his state\n\nconviction or sentence.         Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 81 (2004);\n\nParke, 506 U.S. at 37; United States v. Gray, 177 F.3d 86, 89\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).         Under the applicable de novo standard of\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\freview, Frechette, 456 F.3d at 11, we find no error in the\n\ndistrict court's application of those factors to the facts of\n\nthis case.\n\n                              III.\n\n          As defendant candidly recognizes, his challenge to\n\nconsideration of his prior conviction on the ground that it was\n\nneither admitted, charged in the indictment, nor proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt is currently \"hopeless.\"        United States v.\n\nRichards, 456 F.3d 260, 262 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Almendarez-\n\nTorres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998)), cert. denied, 127\n\nS. Ct. 2097 (2007).\n\n                               IV.\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nsummarily affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

We add only the\n\nfollowing comments from an appellate perspective.\n\n           The     district     court's    factual    findings   are   amply\n\nsupported by the record or reasonable inferences therefrom and\n\ntherefore readily survive scrutiny under the applicable clearly\n\nerroneous standard.

In making those findings, the district court\n\nproperly placed the burden on the defendant to establish that his\n\nprior conviction (whose existence he does not dispute) was\n\ninvalid, United States v.

And, in concluding that defendant's\n\nwaiver   of    counsel   was    knowing,    the     court   considered    the\n\nappropriate factors, including defendant's education, experience,\n\nand prior exposure to the criminal justice system; the relative\n\nsimplicity of the charge; the stage of the proceedings at which\n\ncounsel was waived; the favorable sentencing outcome; and the\n\nabsence of an appeal from or collateral attack on his state\n\nconviction or sentence.
