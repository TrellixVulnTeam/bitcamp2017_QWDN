José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Aníbal Lugo Miranda, with whom Lugo Miranda Law Offices was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n\n     Rafael A.

This appeal challenges a jury\n\nverdict against an auto dealer for violations of the Motor Vehicle\n\nInformation and Cost Savings Act, 49 U.S.C. §§ 32701-711 (1994 &\n\nSupp. 1 2001) (the \"Odometer Act\") and Puerto Rico's General Tort\n\nStatute, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5141 (\"Article 1802\"). The defendant,\n\nAutocentro Toyota (\"Autocentro\"), asks us to vacate the jury\n\nverdict in favor of the two plaintiffs (wife and husband when they\n\nbought the car in question) and enter a judgment in its favor.                     In\n\nthe   alternative,    Autocentro    seeks       either   a   new     trial    or   an\n\nadjustment of the damages awarded by the jury.\n\n           These     claims   for   relief      might    have   more    force      if\n\ndefendant had protected itself with the required motions and\n\nobjections at trial.          For the most part, though, it did not.\n\nHowever, we do find that the damages award to plaintiff Margarita\n\nRivera   Castillo    (\"Rivera\")     is    not    supported      by   the     record.\n\nTherefore, we must vacate Rivera's damages award and remand to the\n\ndistrict court for a determination of the appropriate award on\n\nremittitur (or for a new trial if Rivera declines to accept the\n\nremitted amount).      We leave the award to Carlos Ravelo Guerrero\n\n(\"Ravelo\") undisturbed on appeal.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           The plaintiffs purchased a Toyota Tercel from Autocentro\n\nin October 1999 for $13,000 (or, when the cost of financing was\n\nconsidered, $18,789).         Apparently, the defendant disclosed to\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fplaintiffs that the car had been previously titled, though not to\n\nwhom.    However, Autocentro also represented to plaintiffs that the\n\ncar had never been used.         Indeed, when plaintiffs purchased the\n\ncar, the odometer registered less than ten miles.\n\n            According     to   plaintiffs,     the    car    developed   various\n\nrattles and mechanical problems soon after they purchased it.\n\nSuspicious that their newly purchased car might not be so new,\n\nplaintiffs     investigated      the     car's    title      history.          That\n\ninvestigation    revealed      that    the   Tercel    was    imported    by   the\n\ndistributor Toyota de Puerto Rico, then \"consigned, delivered,\n\nand/or sold\" to Autocentro Toyota, the defendant, who then sold the\n\ncar to Cabrera Car Rental.1           Eventually, Cabrera Car Rental sold\n\nthe car back to Autocentro. Having determined that the prior owner\n\nwas a car rental agency, plaintiffs' suspicions were heightened,\n\nand they retained a master mechanic to inspect the car.                         The\n\nmechanic concluded that the car's odometer might have been altered.\n\n             Plaintiffs    filed      suit   in   federal     court,     alleging\n\nviolations of both Article 1802 of the law of Puerto Rico, which\n\nstates in pertinent part that \"[a] person who by an act or omission\n\ncauses damage to another through fault or negligence shall be\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Under Toyota's distributor and dealership agreements, a\ndealer such as Autocentro acts as an intermediary for and receives\na commission on distributor sales to fleet clients such as rental\ncar agencies.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fobliged to repair the damage so done,\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5141,2\n\nand the federal Odometer Act, which states inter alia that \"[a]\n\nperson   may   not   .   .   .   disconnect,   reset,   alter,   or   have\n\ndisconnected, reset, or altered, an odometer of a motor vehicle\n\nintending to change the mileage registered by the odometer.\" 49\n\nU.S.C. § 32703(2).       In considering the Odometer Act, originally\n\npassed in 1972, Congress found that although seventeen states at\n\nthe time had enacted legislation to prohibit altering odometers,\n\n           States without such legislation have found\n           this practice on the increase, especially when\n           a neighboring State has an odometer law.\n           Odometers are turned back in States without\n           odometer laws and then cars are marketed at\n           inflated values in States with such laws.\n           Thus,   State   odometer   laws   are   easily\n           circumvented and people in a State with such a\n           law suffer because of this practice.\n\nS. Rep. No. 92-413 (1971), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3960,\n\n3962.    On this background, Congress found that federal action on\n\n\n\n     2\n      Neither party devotes any argumentation to the Article 1802\nclaim on appeal.    Briefly, to state an Article 1802 claim for\ndamages based on negligence, \"a plaintiff must prove that (1)\ndefendant owed a duty to prevent the harm by conforming to a\nreasonable standard of conduct; (2) defendant breached that duty\nthrough a negligent act or omission; and (3) the negligent act or\nomission caused the plaintiff's harm.\" Tokio Marine & Fire Ins.\nCo. v. Grove Mfg. Co., 958 F.2d 1169, 1171 (1st Cir. 1992). We\nfocus on the Odometer Act, as do the parties, and the availability\nof damages under Article 1802 does not alter our analysis of the\nissues on appeal.     Furthermore, as the district court noted,\nAutocentro \"did not elicit evidence from Plaintiffs nor present\nindependent evidence that would have allowed for a better\nallocation of those damages that were properly attributable to the\nOdometer Act and those that were attributable to the state law\nfraud action.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fthe issue was desirable and passed the Odometer Act to \"establish\n\na national policy against odometer tampering and prevent consumers\n\nfrom being victimized by such abuses.\"       Id.\n\n            After plaintiffs filed their Odometer Act and Article\n\n1802 claims in federal court, and pre-trial motion practice and\n\ndiscovery were completed, the case was tried before a jury for\n\nthree days.       According to the testimony of plaintiffs' witness\n\nKenneth Cabrera, president and owner of the eponymous car rental\n\nconcern, the car sat on the lot unrented for approximately two and\n\na half months, and it was driven only once to be filled up with\n\ngasoline.    Because demand for rental cars was low, Cabrera resold\n\nthe car to Autocentro, returning physical custody of the car in\n\nmid-July. In an apparent surprise to all the parties, Cabrera also\n\ntestified that the publicly registered invoice from his company to\n\nAutocentro was forged in December 1999, two months after plaintiffs\n\nbought the car, though it was not clear whether Autocentro, Toyota\n\nCredit de Puerto Rico, or some other entity was responsible for the\n\nforgery.    In any event, Cabrera did not dispute that he resold the\n\ncar to Autocentro, returned possession of the car to Autocentro in\n\nmid-July, and was paid the agreed upon price.\n\n            For   approximately   three   months,   from   mid-July   until\n\nplaintiffs purchased the car in October, Autocentro had the Tercel\n\nin its possession.      While it was not uncommon for some cars to\n\nremain on the sale lot for that period of time or even longer, the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fevidence indicated that Toyota Tercels were among the most popular\n\nand quick-selling cars in Puerto Rico -- in fact, the best-selling\n\ncar on defendant's lot. Therefore, it was somewhat unusual, or, in\n\nthe eyes of plaintiffs, highly suspect, that an available Tercel\n\nwould remain unsold and unused for that length of time.\n\n             Plaintiffs    also   offered     the    testimony   of    a   master\n\nmechanic, José Maldonado, regarding the alleged odometer tampering.\n\nThe parties disagree as to the precise nature of Maldonado's\n\ntestimony and his antecedent knowledge of the car's repair history\n\nprior to his inspection.          Although he could not say that the\n\nodometer definitely had been altered, Maldonado did testify that it\n\nwas his opinion that the car had been sold with an altered\n\nodometer, based on (1) the condition of the nuts and bolts in the\n\ntransmission and odometer area, (2) the car having been purchased\n\nwith less than ten miles on the odometer, (3) the car appearing to\n\nhave \"a lot more mileage\" on it than was registered on the odometer\n\nat the time of the inspection, and (4) his understanding that the\n\narea of the car around the transmission and odometer had not\n\npreviously been repaired.\n\n             Finally, plaintiffs called an expert witness to testify\n\nregarding plaintiffs' economic losses caused by the problems with\n\nthe   car.     According    to    the    expert     witness,   who    based   his\n\nconclusions on information provided by Ravelo, the damages were as\n\nfollows: $145 for repairs that would not have been incurred if the\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fcar was new; $4,532 that plaintiffs paid in excess of the actual\n\nvalue of the car; $1,000 in job-related taxi fares Ravelo incurred\n\nbecause of the unavailability of the car; $14,400 in lost income\n\nbecause Ravelo, a freelance court interpreter who charged $60 per\n\nhour, lost 240 working hours due to this case and a related\n\nadministrative complaint; and $156 in simple interest at 6%.\n\n             Other than to elicit testimony that the expert based his\n\ncalculations on numbers provided by plaintiffs, Autocentro did not\n\ncounter the expert's testimony regarding damages.          Also, defendant\n\ndid not introduce a mechanic of its own to testify that the\n\nodometer had not been altered. Autocentro put on two witnesses who\n\nwere employed by Autocentro during the relevant time period:\n\nRichard Lee San, the finance manager who sold plaintiffs the car,\n\nand   José   Roberto   Ramirez   Suriel,   the   general   manager.   Lee\n\ntestified about the details surrounding plaintiffs' purchase of the\n\ncar, including detailed testimony about the documents that were\n\npart of the transaction.         Additionally, he testified that he\n\ninformed plaintiffs that the car previously had been registered to\n\na company, which he did not identify to plaintiffs, and that the\n\ncompany had not used the car and \"had been compelled to sell it\n\nagain.\"   Ramirez testified about the business relationship between\n\nCabrera Car Rental and Autocentro, the history of their dealings\n\nrelated to the plaintiffs' Tercel, and the inspection procedures\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fAutocentro uses upon receipt of a car into inventory. Ramirez also\n\ntestified that Autocentro did not alter the odometer of the car.\n\n             After    the    close   of    evidence,    the   jury   returned   a\n\nunanimous verdict for plaintiffs under the Odometer Act and Article\n\n1802.     The jury awarded Rivera and Ravelo $20,000 each in damages.3\n\nAccording to the jury verdict form, the jury found that Autocentro\n\n\"intentionally defrauded plaintiffs regarding the reading of the\n\nodometer in the Toyota Tercel.\"              As a result, the district court\n\ntrebled the award pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 32710(a), which provides\n\nthat \"[a] person that violates this [Act], with intent to defraud,\n\nis liable for 3 times the actual damages or $1,500, whichever is\n\ngreater.\"          After    the   district      court   entered   judgment    for\n\nplaintiffs, the defendant filed a post-trial motion for judgment as\n\na matter of law and a motion for new trial or remittitur, both of\n\nwhich were denied.          Defendant now appeals from the jury verdict,\n\nthe     award    of   damages,    and     the   district   court's   denial     of\n\ndefendant's post-trial motions for relief.\n\n                                          II.\n\n                Autocentro advances three claims of error on appeal.\n\nFirst, it argues that the district court erred in declining to\n\n\n\n      3\n      The trial transcript indicates that the jury awarded\nplaintiff Rivera $21,000 and plaintiff Ravelo $20,000. However,\nthe district court entered judgment in the amount of $20,000 each,\nwhich was trebled to total $120,000, plus costs.         No party\naddresses this apparent discrepancy on appeal; we treat the\ndistrict court's entry as the figure at issue.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fgrant defendant's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50.                Second,\n\nAutocentro claims that the district court's instructions to the\n\njury regarding damages were flawed.         Third, defendant urges that\n\nthe district court erred in failing to grant its motion for a new\n\ntrial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59.            As\n\nwe shall explain, only the latter claim is meritorious, and only\n\nthen with respect to the award to plaintiff Rivera.\n\n                    A.   Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n            Defendant argues that evidence submitted at trial was\n\ninsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Autocentro\n\nviolated the Odometer Act when it sold plaintiffs the car in\n\nquestion.      Even in the best of circumstances, the standards for\n\ngranting a motion for judgment as a matter of law are stringent.\n\nCourts   may     only    grant   a   judgment   contravening    a    jury's\n\ndetermination     when    \"the   evidence    points   so   strongly    and\n\noverwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury\n\ncould have returned a verdict adverse to that party.\"          Keisling v.\n\nSER-Jobs for Progress, Inc., 19 F.3d 755, 759-60 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nIn making that determination, courts must consider the evidence and\n\nits attendant inferences in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party.      Id. at 760.       However, we do not even reach the\n\napplication of this stringent standard here because defendant\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\ffailed to preserve the sufficiency of the evidence issue for\n\nappeal.\n\n             Federal   Rule   of     Civil   Procedure   50   provides    that\n\n\"[m]otions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time\n\nbefore submission of the case to the jury.\"               Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n50(a)(2).     This case was submitted to the jury on February 24,\n\n2003, judgment was entered on February 26, and Autocentro moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law for the first time on March 10.              Simply\n\nput, defendant's failure to move for judgment as a matter of law at\n\nthe close of evidence procedurally defaults this claim on appeal.\n\nSee, e.g., Keisling, 19 F.3d at 758 (holding that even when a\n\ndefendant moves under Rule 50 at the close of plaintiff's evidence\n\n-- and Autocentro did not even do that -- \"[i]f a defendant wishes\n\nto renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the post-trial\n\nstage, with a view to having denial of that motion considered by\n\nthe court of appeals, the defendant is required to have moved for\n\njudgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence\").             As\n\nwe observed in Keisling: \"[r]equiring the motion to be made at the\n\nclose of all the evidence gives the opposing party an opportunity\n\nto respond to any evidentiary deficiencies noted by the motion by\n\nseeking to reopen the evidence prior to submission of the case to\n\nthe jury.\"    Id. at 758-59.       A party's failure to move under Rule 50\n\nat the close of all evidence \"cannot be taken lightly . . . .\"\n\nJusino v. Zayas, 875 F.2d 986, 991 (1st Cir. 1989).                 We have\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fconsistently held that we \"will not consider claims of insufficient\n\nevidence unless the district court was presented with a motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.\"\n\nKeisling,    19 F.3d at 759; see also Jusino, 875 F.2d at 991\n\n(collecting cases dating from 1954).\n\n            Defendant suggests no reason that our well settled rule\n\nshould not apply in this case, and we see none in the record.\n\nAccordingly, we leave undisturbed the district court's denial of\n\nAutocentro's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n                    B.   Jury Instructions\n\n            Autocentro alleges that the district court's instructions\n\nto the jury regarding damages were erroneous.             Defendant again\n\nsuffers a self-inflicted wound on appeal because, in addition to\n\nfailing to submit proposed instructions at the district court's\n\ninvitation as provided for in Rule 51(a), it failed to object to\n\nthe jury instructions at trial. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51\n\nprovides that \"[a] party who objects to an instruction or the\n\nfailure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating\n\ndistinctly    the   matter   objected    to   and   the   grounds    of   the\n\nobjection.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c)(1).      The \"failure to object to\n\nthe [jury] instructions at the time, and in the manner, designated\n\nby Rule 51 is treated as a procedural default . . . .\"              Moore v.\n\nMurphy, 47 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1995). \"Silence after instructions\n\nordinarily constitutes a forfeiture of any objections . . . .\"\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fMuñiz v. Rovira, 373 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004).               Again, as with the\n\nneed to preserve an issue under Rule 50, we have \"consistently held\n\nthat the strictures of Rule 51 must be followed without deviation.\"\n\nSmith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 887 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n            When a party fails to object to the jury instructions\n\nbelow, as Autocentro failed to do here, we review the claim on\n\nappeal only for plain error.               Muñiz, 373 F.3d at 7.         The well\n\nestablished plain error standard requires Autocentro to show \"(1)\n\nan error was committed; (2) the error was 'plain' (i.e. obvious and\n\nclear under current law); (3) the error was prejudicial (i.e.\n\naffected substantial rights); and (4) review is needed to prevent\n\na miscarriage of justice.\"           Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).        We have also formulated the fourth prong as\n\nrequiring    a     showing    that   the    error    \"seriously      impaired     the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\nMuñiz, 373 F.3d at 6 (citing United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56,\n\n60   (1st   Cir.    2001));    see   also    Kmart   Corp.,    177    F.3d   at    26\n\n(explaining that to merit reversal under plain error review, \"the\n\nerror must have resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously\n\naffected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the\n\njudicial proceedings\") (internal quotations and citations omitted);\n\nScarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 940 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(noting that Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 \"has been rigorously enforced in\n\nthis circuit, and its clear language will be overlooked only in\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fexceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a\n\nclear miscarriage of justice, where the error seriously affected\n\nthe   fairness,     integrity   or    public   reputation   of   judicial\n\nproceedings\") (internal quotations and citations omitted). We have\n\ncommented before that \"[p]lain error is a rare species in civil\n\nlitigation, encompassing only those errors that reach the pinnacle\n\nof fault . . . .\"    Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d at 26 (internal quotations\n\nand citations omitted).\n\n          Here, the district court instructed the jury that\n\n          plaintiffs are suing for actual damages, on\n          account of certain alleged representations\n          made by [defendant] to plaintiffs . . . . Any\n          damages that you may award in this case, or\n          any other case, must be based upon evidence in\n          the case and on your dispassionate analysis of\n          the extent of any injuries sustained by\n          plaintiff as a result of the defendant's\n          wrong, if any. You are not permitted to award\n          damages on the basis of passion, prejudice, or\n          improper sympathy for or against any of the\n          parties in this case. . . .\n\n          In determining any damages recoverable by the\n          plaintiffs, you can consider the following\n          items: Any emotional pain and mental anguish,\n          if proven; any economic damages, if proven.\n          Damages may be reasonable, as I said before.\n          They have to be based solely upon the evidence\n          and cannot be rendered as punishment.     They\n          cannot be speculative.     They can only be\n          assessed to compensate for actually sustained\n          losses and nothing else.\n\nIn its brief, Autocentro claims that this instruction was in error\n\nbecause\n\n          [t]he jury was never given the definition of\n          \"actual damages\" or of the calculation of\n\n                                     -13-\n\f            damages as provided by the [Odometer Act].\n            Because of the fact that the jury was never\n            instructed on the definition of actual damages\n            and on the fact that only actual damages would\n            be trebled as required by Law, Autocentro\n            moves the Court to not treble the award, since\n            clearly the jury intended Ravelo and Rivera to\n            receive compensatory damages, and under the\n            Federal Odometer Act these are not trebled.\n\nDefendant apparently is unaware that the definitions of \"actual\n\ndamages,\"    which     are    trebled      under      the     Odometer    Act,     and\n\n\"compensatory damages,\" which it claims the jury intended to award,\n\nare   synonymous.      Black's      Law    Dictionary       394   (7th    ed.    1999)\n\n(defining \"actual damages\" and noting that they are \"[a]lso termed\n\n'compensatory damages'\").          To the extent that defendant relies on\n\nthis misapprehended distinction to support its claim of error, the\n\nclaim is baseless.\n\n            Autocentro further claims that we \"should consider that\n\nnot informing the jury that the award would be triplicated poses a\n\ndue   process   problem,      since      Autocentro     was    not     afforded    the\n\nConstitutional      guarantees      as    to    the     portion      of   the    award\n\ncorresponding to the triplication.\"             Leaving aside that defendant\n\noffers this broad assertion with no supporting legal citation, we\n\nfind this claim wholly unpersuasive for another reason: when\n\ndiscussing the district court's proposed verdict form, defense\n\ncounsel specifically stated that he did not think the issue of\n\ntreble   damages     should   be   addressed       to   the    jury.      Since    the\n\ndefendant requested that the availability of treble damages not be\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\faddressed to the jury, and the district court honored that request,\n\nthe defendant cannot argue on appeal that the district court's\n\napproach constitutes reversible error.\n\n           More    troubling     is    defendant's    claim   that   under   the\n\nOdometer Act, the measure of \"actual damages\" should be limited to\n\nthe difference in the amount paid by plaintiffs and the amount the\n\ncar was actually worth given its true condition, along with repair\n\ncosts that plaintiffs would not have incurred had the car's true\n\nmileage matched that shown on the odometer.                   Defendant cites\n\nscattered district court cases to support this theory of limited\n\ndamages,   and     this    approach          has   some    intuitive    appeal.\n\nUnfortunately, the term \"actual damages\" is not defined in the\n\nstatute,   nor    could   we    find   any    relevant    legislative   history\n\nclarifying the point.          However, as one district court observed:\n\n\"The method of calculating damages favored by the courts is to\n\nutilize the difference between the fair market value of the car\n\nwith the actual mileage thereon, and the amount paid for the\n\nautomobile by the purchaser, plus any other damages that the\n\npurchaser may have incurred.\"            Williams v. Toyota of Jefferson,\n\nInc., 655 F. Supp. 1081, 1085 (E.D. La. 1987) (collecting cases).\n\nWe found only one case that addressed the availability of lost\n\nwages, and there the district court \"excluded testimony which the\n\nplaintiff offered at trial to establish the value of lost wages, on\n\nthe grounds that such damages are too remote to be recoverable\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\funder the [Odometer] Act.\"     Jones v. Fenton Ford, Inc., 427 F.\n\nSupp. 1328, 1332 n.8 (D. Conn. 1977).   Another court has held that\n\nin the absence of a statutory definition of actual damages, \"it\n\nseems reasonable to give it the meaning commonly applied to fraud\n\ncases.\"   Duval v. Midwest Auto City, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 1381, 1388\n\n(D. Neb. 1977), aff'd, 578 F.2d 721 (8th Cir. 1978).   In turn, the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 549 (1977) explains that in fraud\n\ncases,\n\n           [t]he     recipient     of    a    fraudulent\n           misrepresentation is entitled to recover as\n           damages in an action of deceit against the\n           maker the pecuniary loss to him of which the\n           misrepresentation is a legal cause, including\n           (a) the difference between the value of what\n           he has received in the transaction and its\n           purchase price or other value given for it;\n           and (b) pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a\n           consequence of the recipient's reliance upon\n           the misrepresentation.\n\nId. § 549(1).\n\n           This last approach -- applying the definitions of damages\n\nderived from fraud cases -- would result in the availability of\n\npecuniary damages, presumably including lost wages if a proper\n\nshowing of causation could be made, but likely exclude recovery for\n\nsuch nonpecuniary damages as emotional pain and mental anguish.\n\nSee Steven J. Gaynor, Annotation, \"Fraud Actions: Right to Recover\n\nfor Mental or Emotional Distress,\" 11 A.L.R.5th 88 (2004) (\"Damages\n\nin an action for fraud are generally limited to actual pecuniary\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\floss; however, this rule is not without exceptions.\") (collecting\n\nand analyzing cases).\n\n           We acknowledge, then, that in a case where the issue was\n\nproperly   raised,   a   substantial    argument   could   be   made   that\n\nviolations of the Odometer Act should be treated as a species of\n\nfraud, and the actual damages recoverable should be limited to\n\npecuniary damages, which might include lost wages.         However, as we\n\nhave emphasized, defendant's procedural lapses with respect to the\n\njury instructions require us to apply plain error review.         Even if\n\nthe inclusion of \"emotional pain and mental anguish\" in the jury\n\ninstructions on damages constituted error (an issue we do not\n\ndecide), the error would not be plain because of the absence of a\n\nstatutory definition of actual damages, the lack of legislative\n\nhistory, and the inconclusive nature of the available precedents.\n\n           Morever, the district court's instructions did not result\n\nin a miscarriage of justice or affect the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of the proceedings below.          Defendant did not\n\npropose jury instructions.     It did not object to the instructions\n\ngiven by the district court.    It did not afford the district court\n\na timely opportunity to rule on the issues it now raises on appeal.\n\nIts one request – that the issue of treble damages not be addressed\n\nto the jury – was honored.     Under the circumstances, we think our\n\nwords from over a decade ago apply with force in the present case:\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          The plain error standard . . . is near its\n          zenith in the Rule 51 milieu. . . .         It\n          strains credulity well past the breaking point\n          to argue that the defendants' self-created\n          plight   can  fit   within   so  exclusive   a\n          classification.\n\n          Moreover, to employ the plain error exception\n          in this situation would sow the seeds for a\n          mischievous harvest and would be fundamentally\n          unfair to both the plaintiff and the district\n          court. Rules serve a valuable purpose.\n          Without them, the judicial system would be in\n          shambles.   It follows that, in the ordinary\n          case, parties flout well-established rules at\n          their peril.\n\nToscano v. Chandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 385 (1st Cir. 1991).     So\n\nit is here.    We find no plain error in the district court's\n\ninstructions that would entitle Autocentro to relief from the jury\n\nverdict on appeal.\n\n                 C.   Motion for a New Trial or Remittitur\n\n          Finally, Autocentro claims that the district court erred\n\nin declining to grant its motion for new trial or remittitur under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59.    Rule 59 provides in relevant\n\npart that \"[a] new trial may be granted . . . in an action in which\n\nthere has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which\n\nnew trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the\n\ncourts of the United States.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(a).      We have\n\nstated that a district court may exercise its discretion to grant\n\na Rule 59 motion if \"the verdict is against the weight of the\n\nevidence, that the damages are excessive, or that, for other\n\nreasons, the trial was not fair to the party moving; and may raise\n\n                                -18-\n\fquestions of law arising out of alleged substantial errors in\n\nadmission or rejection of evidence or instructions to the jury.\"\n\nCigna Fire Underwriters Co. v. MacDonald & Johnson, Inc., 86 F.3d\n\n1260, 1262-63 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Montgomery Ward & Co. v.\n\nDuncan, 311 U.S. 243, 251 (1940)).         District courts \"may set aside\n\na jury's verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is so\n\nclearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a\n\nmanifest miscarriage of justice.\"            Federico v. Order of Saint\n\nBenedict in Rhode Island, 64 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            We   review   denials   of     motions   for   a   new   trial   or\n\nremittitur for abuse of discretion by the district court.                See,\n\ne.g., Trull v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 320 F.3d 1, 8, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).      On appeal, we will find that a district court abused\n\nits discretion only if the jury verdict exceeds \"any rational\n\nappraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the\n\nevidence before the jury . . . .\"          Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc.,\n\n847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Segal v. Gilbert Color\n\nSys., Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 1984)).\n\n            1. The Damages Award to Ravelo\n\n            As to the $20,000 awarded to Ravelo, defendant's argument\n\nis unpersuasive.       Plaintiffs introduced an expert witness who\n\ntestified    that   Ravelo's   economic      damages   were    approximately\n\n$21,000.    Ravelo also testified regarding the extent of damages he\n\nincurred. Defendant introduced no rebuttal witnesses regarding the\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fextent of plaintiffs' damages.    To be sure, Ravelo's evidence was\n\nnot overwhelming.   In entering judgment for the plaintiffs, the\n\ndistrict court observed that while the jury verdict \"may contradict\n\nthe bench's assessment of the evidence, viewing the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to Plaintiffs allows for a liberal jury\n\ninterpretation of the matters at issue.\"       As the district court\n\nrightly observed, courts are not entitled to substitute their view\n\nof the evidence for the verdict reached by the jury.    Only when the\n\nverdict is a \"manifest miscarriage of justice,\" Federico, 64 F.3d\n\nat 5, or the damages awarded are \"grossly excessive, inordinate,\n\nshocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would\n\nbe a denial of justice to permit it to stand,\" will courts\n\nintervene to upset a jury verdict and award.      Segal, 746 F.2d at\n\n80-81 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n          Although we might characterize the award to Ravelo as\n\ngenerous, it is grounded in evidence adduced at trial and does not\n\nshock the conscience of the court.      Therefore, we cannot conclude\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion by refusing to\n\ndisturb the jury verdict to Ravelo either by ordering a new trial\n\nor granting a remittitur of the damages.\n\n          2.   The Damages Award to Rivera\n\n          The damages award to Rivera presents a different story.\n\nThe only damages evidence was her testimony that she \"felt very bad\n\nbecause I felt that I had been misled.      I felt let down with the\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fwhole situation.     I felt like any human being who discovers that he\n\nhas been misled by someone.\"     Rivera also testified that after she\n\ncame to believe that the car in fact had many more miles on it than\n\nrepresented by the odometer, she no longer felt safe driving the\n\ncar.       In addition to testifying that she was upset by the whole\n\nsituation, Rivera testified that \"this brought emotional conflicts\n\nbetween me and my husband [and] because of the stress that we had\n\nbecause of all of this, and he was angry and upset, and . . . he\n\nwould fight a lot and argue a lot with the children.\"        Finally,\n\nRivera testified that \"when things like this happen, you start\n\nmistrusting because of the fact that you see that they are trying\n\nto fool you, and many things go through your head. . . .         I am\n\nstill affected because mainly of having to go through this entire\n\nprocess.\"\n\n              Without diminishing the aggravation that the problems\n\nwith the car caused Rivera, we are constrained to say that the\n\nrecord evidence simply does not support the $20,000 award.4    Unlike\n\nthe $20,000 award to Ravelo, which comports with the amount of his\n\neconomic damages to which the expert witness testified, the $20,000\n\naward to Rivera has no \"rational basis in evidence.\"       O'Brien v.\n\n\n       4\n      We are not suggesting that emotional pain and mental anguish\nare necessarily damages appropriately recovered under the Odometer\nAct. However, since those items were in the unobjected-to jury\ninstructions, which we have held do not constitute plain error,\nthey are the law of the case. Muñiz, 373 F.3d at 7 (\"The defendant\ndid not object to th[e] instruction and it is, therefore, the law\nof the case.\").\n\n                                  -21-\n\fPapa Gino's of America, Inc., 780 F.2d 1067, 1076 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\nThe only evidence to support Rivera's award is testimony that she\n\nfelt \"bad,\" \"let down,\" \"mistrusting,\" and that domestic life had\n\nadded stresses. This level of bother, which in many ways describes\n\nthe everyday frustrations all members of society suffer from time\n\nto time, does not remotely warrant $20,000 in relief, trebled to\n\n$60,000.\n\n           Having concluded that the damages award to Rivera is\n\nexcessive as a matter of law, we have two options: remanding to the\n\ndistrict court to determine damages, or setting the amount of\n\nremittitur ourselves based on the evidence adduced at trial.\n\nKoster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 181 F.3d 24, 36 (1999).\n\nFixing a dollar amount on a plaintiff's emotional distress is\n\nalways an uncomfortable judicial undertaking: \"[t]ransmitting legal\n\ndamages into money damages is a matter 'peculiarly within a jury's\n\nken,'   especially   in   cases   involving   intangible,   non-economic\n\nlosses.\"   Torres v. Kmart Corp., 233 F. Supp. 2d 273, 282 (D.P.R.\n\n2002) (quoting Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)). Nevertheless, we have consistently held that when the jury\n\naward is not \"within the universe of possible awards which are\n\nsupported by the evidence,\" courts must provide relief, despite the\n\nlack of precision in determining nonpecuniary damages.         Clark v.\n\nTaylor, 710 F.2d 4, 13 (1st Cir. 1983); see also Marchant v. Dayton\n\nTire & Rubber Co., 836 F.2d 695, 704 (1st Cir. 1988) (vacating\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fjury-awarded damages as excessive on appeal); Laaperi v. Sears,\n\nRoebuck & Co., 787 F.2d 726, 734 (1st Cir. 1986) (same).\n\n           The task of remitting noneconomic damages is even more\n\ndelicate when attempted from the cold appellate record.          We think\n\nthat the district court's greater familiarity with the course of\n\nproceedings below, and particularly its ability to observe the\n\nwitnesses' testimonies, afford a better position to assess the\n\namount of damages appropriate on remittitur.            On remand, the\n\ndistrict court will remit the jury award \"to the maximum that would\n\nbe upheld by the trial court as not excessive.\"        Jones & Jones v.\n\nPineda & Pineda, 22 F.3d 391, 398 (1st Cir. 1994).            The damages\n\naward determined by the district court will be trebled under the\n\nOdometer   Act   because   of   the   jury   finding   that    Autocentro\n\nintentionally defrauded the plaintiffs.      Finally, as per the usual\n\nrule, Rivera will have the choice of accepting the remitted award\n\nor opting for new trial.        See, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nContinental Cas. Co., 771 F.2d 579, 589 (1st Cir. 1985).              The\n\ndistrict court has the option of ordering a full trial for Rivera\n\nor limiting the new trial to the issue of damages.      Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(a) (\"A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and\n\non all or part of the issues . . . .\"); see also Marchant, 836 F.2d\n\nat 704 (concluding \"that a new trial on damages is appropriate\").\n\n                                  III.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f          For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the judgment to\n\nRavelo.   We vacate the judgment to Rivera and direct the district\n\ncourt to enter a new judgment for Rivera in the amount that it\n\ndetermines is appropriate in light of the evidence, to then be\n\ntrebled, or, if Rivera refuses to accept entry of such judgment,\n\norder a new trial for Rivera, which may but need not be limited to\n\nthe issue of damages.    We REMAND for proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.   Each party shall bear its own costs.\n\n           SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

That investigation revealed that the Tercel was imported by the distributor Toyota de Puerto Rico, then \"consigned, delivered, and/or sold\" to Autocentro Toyota, the defendant, who then sold the car to Cabrera Car Rental.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Eventually, Cabrera Car Rental sold the car back to Autocentro. Having determined that the prior owner was a car rental agency, plaintiffs' suspicions were heightened, and they retained a master mechanic to inspect the car. The mechanic concluded that the car's odometer might have been altered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed suit in federal court, alleging violations of both Article 1802 of the law of Puerto Rico, which states in pertinent part that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done,\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the federal Odometer Act, which states <i>inter alia</i> that \"[a] person may not ... disconnect, reset, alter, or have disconnected, reset, or altered, an odometer of a motor vehicle intending to change the mileage registered by the odometer.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 32703(2). In considering the Odometer Act, originally passed in 1972, Congress found that although seventeen states at the time had enacted legislation to prohibit altering odometers,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">States without such legislation have found this practice on the increase, especially when a neighboring State has an odometer law. Odometers are turned back in States without odometer laws and then cars are marketed at inflated values in States with such laws. Thus, State odometer laws are easily circumvented and people in a State with such a law suffer because of this practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 92-413 (1971), <i>reprinted in</i> 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3960, 3962. On this background, Congress found that federal action on the issue was desirable and passed the Odometer Act to \"establish a national policy against odometer tampering and prevent consumers from being victimized by such abuses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After plaintiffs filed their Odometer Act and Article 1802 claims in federal court, and pre-trial motion practice and discovery were completed, the case was tried before a jury for three days. According to the testimony of plaintiffs' witness Kenneth Cabrera, president and owner of the eponymous car rental concern, the car sat on the lot unrented for approximately two and a half months, and it was driven only once to be filled up with gasoline. Because demand for rental cars was low, Cabrera resold the car to Autocentro, returning physical custody of the car in mid-July. In an apparent surprise to all the parties, Cabrera also testified that the publicly registered invoice from his company to Autocentro was forged in December 1999, two months after plaintiffs bought the car, though it was not clear whether Autocentro, Toyota Credit de Puerto Rico, or some other entity was responsible for the forgery. In any event, Cabrera did not dispute that he resold the car to Autocentro, returned possession of the car to Autocentro in mid-July, and was paid the agreed upon price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For approximately three months, from mid-July until plaintiffs purchased the car in October, Autocentro had the Tercel in its possession. While it was not uncommon for some cars to remain on the sale lot for that period of time or even longer, the evidence indicated that Toyota Tercels were among the most popular and quick-selling cars in Puerto Rico &#8212; in fact, the best-selling car on defendant's lot. Therefore, it was somewhat unusual, or, in the eyes of plaintiffs, highly suspect, that an available Tercel would remain unsold and unused for that length of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also offered the testimony of a master mechanic, Jose Maldonado, regarding the alleged odometer tampering. The parties disagree as to the precise nature of Maldonado's testimony and his antecedent knowledge of the car's repair history prior to his inspection. Although he could not say that the odometer definitely had been altered, Maldonado did testify that it was his opinion that the car had been sold with an altered odometer, based on (1) the condition of the nuts and bolts in the transmission and odometer area, (2) the car having been purchased with less than ten miles on the odometer, (3) the car appearing to have \"a lot more mileage\" on it than was registered on the odometer at the time of the inspection, and (4) his understanding that the area of the car around the transmission and odometer had not previously been repaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs called an expert witness to testify regarding plaintiffs' economic losses caused by the problems with the car. According to the expert witness, who based his conclusions on information provided by Ravelo, the damages were as follows: $145 for repairs that would not have been incurred if the car was new; $4,532 that plaintiffs paid in excess of the actual value of the car; $1,000 in job-related taxi fares Ravelo incurred because of the unavailability of the car; $14,400 in lost income because Ravelo, a freelance court interpreter who charged $60 per hour, lost 240 working hours due to this case and a related administrative complaint; and $156 in simple interest at 6%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other than to elicit testimony that the expert based his calculations on numbers provided by plaintiffs, Autocentro did not counter the expert's testimony regarding damages. Also, defendant did not introduce a mechanic of its own to testify that the odometer had not been altered. Autocentro put on two witnesses who were employed by Autocentro during the relevant time period: Richard Lee San, the finance manager who sold plaintiffs the car, and Jose Roberto Ramirez Suriel, the general manager. Lee testified about the details surrounding plaintiffs' purchase of the car, including detailed testimony about the documents that were part of the transaction. Additionally, he testified that he informed plaintiffs that the car previously had been registered to a company, which he did not identify to plaintiffs, and that the company had not used the car and \"had been compelled to sell it again.\" Ramirez testified about the business relationship between Cabrera Car Rental and Autocentro, the history of their dealings related to the plaintiffs' Tercel, and the inspection procedures Autocentro uses upon receipt of a car into inventory. Ramirez also testified that Autocentro did not alter the odometer of the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of evidence, the jury returned a unanimous verdict for plaintiffs under the Odometer Act and Article 1802. The jury awarded Rivera and Ravelo $20,000 each in damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> According to the jury verdict form, the jury found that Autocentro \"intentionally defrauded plaintiffs regarding the reading of the odometer in the Toyota Tercel.\" As a result, the district court trebled the award pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 32710(a), which provides that \"[a] person that violates this [Act], with intent to defraud, is liable for 3 times the actual damages or $1,500, whichever is greater.\" After the district court entered judgment for plaintiffs, the defendant filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial or remittitur, both of which were denied. Defendant now appeals from the jury verdict, the award of damages, and the district court's denial of defendant's post-trial motions for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Autocentro advances three claims of error on appeal. First, it argues that the district court erred in declining to grant defendant's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50. Second, Autocentro claims that the district court's instructions to the jury regarding damages were flawed. Third, defendant urges that the district court erred in failing to grant its motion for a new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. As we shall explain, only the latter claim is meritorious, and only then with respect to the award to plaintiff Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Autocentro violated the Odometer Act when it sold plaintiffs the car in question. Even in the best of circumstances, the standards for granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law are stringent. Courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury's determination when \"the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.\" <i>Keisling v. SER-Jobs for Progress, Inc.,</i> 19 F.3d 755, 759-60 (1st Cir.1994). In making that determination, courts must consider the evidence and its attendant inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>Id.</i> at 760. However, we do not even reach the application of this stringent standard here because defendant failed to preserve the sufficiency of the evidence issue for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 provides that \"[m]otions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(2). This case was submitted to the jury on February 24, 2003, judgment was entered on February 26, and Autocentro moved for judgment as a matter of law for the first time on March 10. Simply put, defendant's failure to move for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence procedurally defaults this claim on appeal. <i>See, e.g., Keisling,</i> 19 F.3d at 758 (holding that even when a defendant moves under Rule 50 at the close of plaintiff's evidence &#8212; and Autocentro did not even do that &#8212; \"[i]f a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the post-trial stage, with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals, the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence\"). As we observed in <i>Keisling:</i>\"[r]equiring the motion to be made at the close of all the evidence gives the opposing party an opportunity to respond to any evidentiary deficiencies noted by the motion by seeking to reopen the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 758-59. A party's failure to move under Rule 50 at the close of all evidence \"cannot be taken lightly....\" <i>Jusino v. Zayas,</i> 875 F.2d 986, 991 (1st Cir.1989). We have consistently held that we \"will not consider claims of insufficient evidence unless the district court was presented with a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.\" <i>Keisling,</i> 19 F.3d at 759; <i>see also Jusino,</i> 875 F.2d at 991 (collecting cases dating from 1954).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant suggests no reason that our well settled rule should not apply in this case, and we see none in the record. Accordingly, we leave undisturbed the district court's denial of Autocentro's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Autocentro alleges that the district court's instructions to the jury regarding damages were erroneous. Defendant again suffers a self-inflicted wound on appeal because, in addition to failing to submit proposed instructions at the district court's invitation as provided for in Rule 51(a), it failed to object to the jury instructions at trial. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 provides that \"[a] party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1). The \"failure to object to the [jury] instructions at the time, and in the manner, designated by Rule 51 is treated as a procedural default....\" <i>Moore v. Murphy,</i> 47 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1995). \"Silence after instructions ordinarily constitutes a forfeiture of any objections....\" <i>Mu&#241;iz v. Rovira,</i> 373 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004). Again, as with the need to preserve an issue under Rule 50, we have \"consistently held that the strictures of Rule 51 must be followed without deviation.\" <i>Smith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party fails to object to the jury instructions below, as Autocentro failed to do here, we review the claim on appeal only for plain error. <i>Mu&#241;iz,</i> 373 F.3d at 7. The well established plain error standard requires Autocentro to show \"(1) an error was committed; (2) the error was `plain' (i.e. obvious and clear under current law); (3) the error was prejudicial (i.e. affected substantial rights); and (4) review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.1999). We have also formulated the fourth prong as requiring a showing that the error \"seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Mu&#241;iz,</i> 373 F.3d at 6 (citing <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001)); <i>see also Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d at 26 (explaining that to merit reversal under plain error review, \"the error must have resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings\") (internal quotations and citations omitted); <i>Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> 54 F.3d 931, 940 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 \"has been rigorously enforced in this circuit, and its clear language will be overlooked only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice, where the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\") (internal quotations and citations omitted). We have commented before that \"[p]lain error is a rare species in civil litigation, encompassing only those errors that reach the pinnacle of fault....\" <i>Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d at 26 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court instructed the jury that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">plaintiffs are suing for actual damages, on account of certain alleged representations made by [defendant] to plaintiffs.... Any damages that you may award in this case, or any other case, must be based upon evidence in the case and on your dispassionate analysis of the extent of any injuries sustained by plaintiff as a result of the defendant's wrong, if any. You are not permitted to award damages on the basis of passion, prejudice, or improper sympathy for or against any of the parties in this case....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining any damages recoverable by the plaintiffs, you can consider the following items: Any emotional pain and mental anguish, if proven; any economic damages, if proven. Damages may be reasonable, as I said before. They have to be based solely upon the evidence and cannot be rendered as punishment. They cannot be speculative. They can only be assessed to compensate for actually sustained losses and nothing else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, Autocentro claims that this instruction was in error because</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he jury was never given the definition of \"actual damages\" or of the calculation of damages as provided by the [Odometer Act]. Because of the fact that the jury was never instructed on the definition of actual damages and on the fact that only actual damages would be trebled as required by Law, Autocentro moves the Court to not treble the award, since clearly the jury intended Ravelo and Rivera to receive compensatory damages, and under the Federal Odometer Act these are not trebled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant apparently is unaware that the definitions of \"actual damages,\" which are trebled under the Odometer Act, and \"compensatory damages,\" which it claims the jury intended to award, are synonymous. <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 394 (7th ed.1999) (defining \"actual damages\" and noting that they are \"[a]lso termed `compensatory damages'\"). To the extent that defendant relies on this misapprehended distinction to support its claim of error, the claim is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Autocentro further claims that we \"should consider that not informing the jury that the award would be triplicated poses a due process problem, since Autocentro was not afforded the Constitutional guarantees as to the portion of the award corresponding to the triplication.\" Leaving aside that defendant offers this broad assertion with no supporting legal citation, we find this claim wholly unpersuasive for another reason: when discussing the district court's proposed verdict form, defense counsel specifically stated that he did not think the issue of treble damages should be addressed to the jury. Since the defendant requested that the availability of treble damages not be addressed to the jury, and the district court honored that request, the defendant cannot argue on appeal that the district court's approach constitutes reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More troubling is defendant's claim that under the Odometer Act, the measure of \"actual damages\" should be limited to the difference in the amount paid by plaintiffs and the amount the car was actually worth given its true condition, along with repair costs that plaintiffs would not have incurred had the car's true mileage matched that shown on the odometer. Defendant cites scattered district court cases to support this theory of limited damages, and this approach has some intuitive appeal. Unfortunately, the term \"actual damages\" is not defined in the statute, nor could we find any relevant legislative history clarifying the point. However, as one district court observed: \"The method of calculating damages favored by the courts is to utilize the difference between the fair market value of the car with the actual mileage thereon, and the amount paid for the automobile by the purchaser, plus any other damages that the purchaser may have incurred.\" <i>Williams v. Toyota of Jefferson, Inc.,</i> 655 F.Supp. 1081, 1085 (E.D.La.1987) (collecting cases). We found only one case that addressed the availability of lost wages, and there the district court \"excluded testimony which the plaintiff offered at trial to establish the value of lost wages, on the grounds that such damages are too remote to be recoverable under the [Odometer] Act.\" <i>Jones v. Fenton Ford, Inc.,</i> 427 F.Supp. 1328, 1332 n. 8 (D.Conn.1977). Another court has held that in the absence of a statutory definition of actual damages, \"it seems reasonable to give it the meaning commonly applied to fraud cases.\" <i>Duval v. Midwest Auto City, Inc.,</i> 425 F.Supp. 1381, 1388 (D.Neb.1977), <i>aff'd,</i> 578 F.2d 721 (8th Cir.1978). In turn, the Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 549 (1977) explains that in fraud cases,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation is entitled to recover as damages in an action of deceit against the maker the pecuniary loss to him of which the misrepresentation is a legal cause, including (a) the difference between the value of what he has received in the transaction and its purchase price or other value given for it; and (b) pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a consequence of the recipient's reliance upon the misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 549(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This last approach &#8212; applying the definitions of damages derived from fraud cases &#8212; would result in the availability of pecuniary damages, presumably including lost wages if a proper showing of causation could be made, but likely exclude recovery for such nonpecuniary damages as emotional pain and mental anguish. <i>See</i> Steven J. Gaynor, Annotation, \"Fraud Actions: Right to Recover for Mental or Emotional Distress,\" 11 A.L.R.5th 88 (2004) (\"Damages in an action for fraud are generally limited to actual pecuniary loss; however, this rule is not without exceptions.\") (collecting and analyzing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge, then, that in a case where the issue was properly raised, a substantial argument could be made that violations of the Odometer Act should be treated as a species of fraud, and the actual damages recoverable should be limited to pecuniary damages, which might include lost wages. However, as we have emphasized, defendant's procedural lapses with respect to the jury instructions require us to apply plain error review. Even if the inclusion of \"emotional pain and mental anguish\" in the jury instructions on damages constituted error (an issue we do not decide), the error would not be plain because of the absence of a statutory definition of actual damages, the lack of legislative history, and the inconclusive nature of the available precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court's instructions did not result in a miscarriage of justice or affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings below. Defendant did not propose jury instructions. It did not object to the instructions given by the district court. It did not afford the district court a timely opportunity to rule on the issues it now raises on appeal. Its one request &#8212; that the issue of treble damages not be addressed to the jury &#8212; was honored. Under the circumstances, we think our words from over a decade ago apply with force in the present case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain error standard ... is near its zenith in the Rule 51 milieu.... It strains credulity well past the breaking point to argue that the defendants' self-created plight can fit within so exclusive a classification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, to employ the plain error exception in this situation would sow the seeds for a mischievous harvest and would be fundamentally unfair to both the plaintiff and the district court. Rules serve a valuable purpose. Without them, the judicial system would be in shambles. It follows that, in the ordinary case, parties flout well-established rules at their peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Toscano v. Chandris, S.A.,</i> 934 F.2d 383, 385 (1st Cir.1991). So it is here. We find no plain error in the district court's instructions that would entitle Autocentro to relief from the jury verdict on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion for a New Trial or Remittitur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Autocentro claims that the district court erred in declining to grant its motion for new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. Rule 59 provides in relevant part that \"[a] new trial may be granted ... in an action in which there has been a trial by jury, for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the United States.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a). We have stated that a district court may exercise its discretion to grant a Rule 59 motion if \"the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, that the damages are excessive, or that, for other reasons, the trial was not fair to the party moving; and may raise questions of law arising out of alleged substantial errors in admission or rejection of evidence or instructions to the jury.\" <i>Cigna Fire Underwriters Co. v. MacDonald &amp; Johnson, Inc.,</i> 86 F.3d 1260, 1262-63 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Duncan,</i> 311 U.S. 243, 251, 61 S.Ct. 189, 85 L.Ed. 147 (1940)). District courts \"may set aside a jury's verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Federico v.

Volkswagen of America, Inc.,</i> 320 F.3d 1, 8, 9 (1st Cir.2002). On appeal, we will find that a district court abused its discretion only if the jury verdict exceeds \"any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury....\" <i>Milone v. Moceri Family, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting <i>Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc.,</i> 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Damages Award to Ravelo</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the $20,000 awarded to Ravelo, defendant's argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs introduced an expert witness who testified that Ravelo's economic damages were approximately $21,000. Ravelo also testified regarding the extent of damages he incurred. Defendant introduced no rebuttal witnesses regarding the extent of plaintiffs' damages. To be sure, Ravelo's evidence was not overwhelming. In entering judgment for the plaintiffs, the district court observed that while the jury verdict \"may contradict the bench's assessment of the evidence, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs allows for a liberal jury interpretation of the matters at issue.\" As the district court rightly observed, courts are not entitled to substitute their view of the evidence for the verdict reached by the jury. Only when the verdict is a \"manifest miscarriage of justice,\" <i>Federico,</i> 64 F.3d at 5, or the damages awarded are \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand,\" will courts intervene to upset a jury verdict and award. <i>Segal,</i> 746 F.2d at 80-81 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we might characterize the award to Ravelo as generous, it is grounded in evidence adduced at trial and does not shock the conscience of the court. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to disturb the jury verdict to Ravelo either by ordering a new trial or granting a remittitur of the damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Damages Award to Rivera</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages award to Rivera presents a different story. The only damages evidence was her testimony that she \"felt very bad because I felt that I had been misled. I felt let down with the whole situation. I felt like any human being who discovers that he has been misled by someone.\" Rivera also testified that after she came to believe that the car in fact had many more miles on it than represented by the odometer, she no longer felt safe driving the car. In addition to testifying that she was upset by the whole situation, Rivera testified that \"this brought emotional conflicts between me and my husband [and] because of the stress that we had because of all of this, and he was angry and upset, and ... he would fight a lot and argue a lot with the children.\" Finally, Rivera testified that \"when things like this happen, you start mistrusting because of the fact that you see that they are trying to fool you, and many things go through your head.... I am still affected because mainly of having to go through this entire process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without diminishing the aggravation that the problems with the car caused Rivera, we are constrained to say that the record evidence simply does not support the $20,000 award.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Unlike the $20,000 award to Ravelo, which comports with the amount of his economic damages to which the expert witness testified, the $20,000 award to Rivera has no \"rational basis in evidence.\" <i>O'Brien v. Papa Gino's of America, Inc.,</i> 780 F.2d 1067, 1076 (1st Cir.1986). The only evidence to support Rivera's award is testimony that she felt \"bad,\" \"let down,\" \"mistrusting,\" and that domestic life had added stresses. This level of bother, which in many ways describes the everyday frustrations all members of society suffer from time to time, does not remotely warrant $20,000 in relief, trebled to $60,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the damages award to Rivera is excessive as a matter of law, we have two options: remanding to the district court to determine damages, or setting the amount of remittitur ourselves based on the evidence adduced at trial. <i>Koster v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 181 F.3d 24, 36 (1999). Fixing a dollar amount on a plaintiff's emotional distress is always an uncomfortable judicial undertaking: \"[t]ransmitting legal damages into money damages is a matter `peculiarly within a jury's ken,' especially in cases involving intangible, non-economic losses.\" <i>Torres v. KMart Corp.,</i> 233 F.Supp.2d 273, 282 (D.P.R.2002) (quoting <i>Smith v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 177 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.1999)). Nevertheless, we have consistently held that when the jury award is not \"within the universe of possible awards which are supported by the evidence,\" courts must provide relief, despite the lack of precision in determining nonpecuniary damages. <i>Clark v. Taylor,</i> 710 F.2d 4, 13 (1st Cir.1983); <i>see also Marchant v. Dayton Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 836 F.2d 695, 704 (1st Cir.1988) (vacating jury-awarded damages as excessive on appeal); <i>Laaperi v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 787 F.2d 726, 734 (1st Cir.1986) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The task of remitting noneconomic damages is even more delicate when attempted from the cold appellate record. We think that the district court's greater familiarity with the course of proceedings below, and particularly its ability to observe the witnesses' testimonies, afford a better position to assess the amount of damages appropriate on remittitur. On remand, the district court will remit the jury award \"to the maximum that would be upheld by the trial court as not excessive.\" <i>Jones &amp; Jones v. Pineda &amp; Pineda,</i> 22 F.3d 391, 398 (1st Cir.1994). The damages award determined by the district court will be trebled under the Odometer Act because of the jury finding that Autocentro intentionally defrauded the plaintiffs. Finally, as per the usual rule, Rivera will have the choice of accepting the remitted award or opting for new trial. <i>See, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co.,</i> 771 F.2d 579, 589 (1st Cir.1985). The district court has the option of ordering a full trial for Rivera or limiting the new trial to the issue of damages. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a) (\"A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues....\"); <i>see also Marchant,</i> 836 F.2d at 704 (concluding \"that a new trial on damages is appropriate\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the judgment to Ravelo. We vacate the judgment to Rivera and direct the district court to enter a new judgment for Rivera in the amount that it determines is appropriate in light of the evidence, to then be trebled, or, if Rivera refuses to accept entry of such judgment, order a new trial for Rivera, which may but need not be limited to the issue of damages. We REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 32710(b), we direct the district court to award attorney's fees and costs related to this appeal in an appropriate amount. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 32710(b) (in \"[c]ivil actions by private persons\" brought to enforce the Odometer Act, \"[t]he court shall award costs and a reasonable attorney's fee to the person when a judgment is entered for that person\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under Toyota's distributor and dealership agreements, a dealer such as Autocentro acts as an intermediary for and receives a commission on distributor sales to fleet clients such as rental car agencies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Neither party devotes any argumentation to the Article 1802 claim on appeal.

Co. v. Grove Mfg. Co.,</i> 958 F.2d 1169, 1171 (1st Cir.1992). We focus on the Odometer Act, as do the parties, and the availability of damages under Article 1802 does not alter our analysis of the issues on appeal. Furthermore, as the district court noted, Autocentro \"did not elicit evidence from Plaintiffs nor present independent evidence that would have allowed for a better allocation of those damages that were properly attributable to the Odometer Act and those that were attributable to the state law fraud action.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The trial transcript indicates that the jury awarded plaintiff Rivera $21,000 and plaintiff Ravelo $20,000.

Laws Ann. &#167; 5141 (\"Article 1802\"). The defendant, Autocentro Toyota (\"Autocentro\"), asks us to vacate the jury verdict in favor of the two plaintiffs (wife and husband when they bought the car in question) and enter a judgment in its favor. In the alternative, Autocentro seeks either a new trial or an adjustment of the damages awarded by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These claims for relief might have more force if defendant had protected itself with the required motions and objections at trial. For the most part, though, it did not. However, we do find that the damages award to plaintiff Margarita Rivera Castillo (\"Rivera\") is not supported by the record. Therefore, we must vacate Rivera's damages award and remand to the district court for a determination of the appropriate award on remittitur (or for a new trial if Rivera declines to accept the remitted amount). We leave the award to Carlos Ravelo Guerrero (\"Ravelo\") undisturbed on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs purchased a Toyota Tercel from Autocentro in October 1999 for $13,000 (or, when the cost of financing was considered, $18,789). Apparently, the defendant disclosed to plaintiffs that the car had been previously titled, though not to whom. However, Autocentro also represented to plaintiffs that the car had never been used. Indeed, when plaintiffs purchased the car, the odometer registered less than ten miles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to plaintiffs, the car developed various rattles and mechanical problems soon after they purchased it. Suspicious that their newly purchased car might not be so new, plaintiffs investigated the car's title history. That investigation revealed that the Tercel was imported by the distributor Toyota de Puerto Rico, then \"consigned, delivered, and/or sold\" to Autocentro Toyota, the defendant, who then sold the car to Cabrera Car Rental.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Eventually, Cabrera Car Rental sold the car back to Autocentro. Having determined that the prior owner was a car rental agency, plaintiffs' suspicions were heightened, and they retained a master mechanic to inspect the car. The mechanic concluded that the car's odometer might have been altered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs filed suit in federal court, alleging violations of both Article 1802 of the law of Puerto Rico, which states in pertinent part that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done,\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the federal Odometer Act, which states <i>inter alia</i> that \"[a] person may not ... disconnect, reset, alter, or have disconnected, reset, or altered, an odometer of a motor vehicle intending to change the mileage registered by the odometer.\" 49 U.S.C. &#167; 32703(2). In considering the Odometer Act, originally passed in 1972, Congress found that although seventeen states at the time had enacted legislation to prohibit altering odometers,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">States without such legislation have found this practice on the increase, especially when a neighboring State has an odometer law. Odometers are turned back in States without odometer laws and then cars are marketed at inflated values in States with such laws. Thus, State odometer laws are easily circumvented and people in a State with such a law suffer because of this practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.Rep. No. 92-413 (1971), <i>reprinted in</i> 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3960, 3962. On this background, Congress found that federal action on the issue was desirable and passed the Odometer Act to \"establish a national policy against odometer tampering and prevent consumers from being victimized by such abuses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After plaintiffs filed their Odometer Act and Article 1802 claims in federal court, and pre-trial motion practice and discovery were completed, the case was tried before a jury for three days. According to the testimony of plaintiffs' witness Kenneth Cabrera, president and owner of the eponymous car rental concern, the car sat on the lot unrented for approximately two and a half months, and it was driven only once to be filled up with gasoline. Because demand for rental cars was low, Cabrera resold the car to Autocentro, returning physical custody of the car in mid-July. In an apparent surprise to all the parties, Cabrera also testified that the publicly registered invoice from his company to Autocentro was forged in December 1999, two months after plaintiffs bought the car, though it was not clear whether Autocentro, Toyota Credit de Puerto Rico, or some other entity was responsible for the forgery. In any event, Cabrera did not dispute that he resold the car to Autocentro, returned possession of the car to Autocentro in mid-July, and was paid the agreed upon price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For approximately three months, from mid-July until plaintiffs purchased the car in October, Autocentro had the Tercel in its possession. While it was not uncommon for some cars to remain on the sale lot for that period of time or even longer, the evidence indicated that Toyota Tercels were among the most popular and quick-selling cars in Puerto Rico &#8212; in fact, the best-selling car on defendant's lot. Therefore, it was somewhat unusual, or, in the eyes of plaintiffs, highly suspect, that an available Tercel would remain unsold and unused for that length of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also offered the testimony of a master mechanic, Jose Maldonado, regarding the alleged odometer tampering. The parties disagree as to the precise nature of Maldonado's testimony and his antecedent knowledge of the car's repair history prior to his inspection. Although he could not say that the odometer definitely had been altered, Maldonado did testify that it was his opinion that the car had been sold with an altered odometer, based on (1) the condition of the nuts and bolts in the transmission and odometer area, (2) the car having been purchased with less than ten miles on the odometer, (3) the car appearing to have \"a lot more mileage\" on it than was registered on the odometer at the time of the inspection, and (4) his understanding that the area of the car around the transmission and odometer had not previously been repaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, plaintiffs called an expert witness to testify regarding plaintiffs' economic losses caused by the problems with the car. According to the expert witness, who based his conclusions on information provided by Ravelo, the damages were as follows: $145 for repairs that would not have been incurred if the car was new; $4,532 that plaintiffs paid in excess of the actual value of the car; $1,000 in job-related taxi fares Ravelo incurred because of the unavailability of the car; $14,400 in lost income because Ravelo, a freelance court interpreter who charged $60 per hour, lost 240 working hours due to this case and a related administrative complaint; and $156 in simple interest at 6%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other than to elicit testimony that the expert based his calculations on numbers provided by plaintiffs, Autocentro did not counter the expert's testimony regarding damages. Also, defendant did not introduce a mechanic of its own to testify that the odometer had not been altered. Autocentro put on two witnesses who were employed by Autocentro during the relevant time period: Richard Lee San, the finance manager who sold plaintiffs the car, and Jose Roberto Ramirez Suriel, the general manager. Lee testified about the details surrounding plaintiffs' purchase of the car, including detailed testimony about the documents that were part of the transaction. Additionally, he testified that he informed plaintiffs that the car previously had been registered to a company, which he did not identify to plaintiffs, and that the company had not used the car and \"had been compelled to sell it again.\" Ramirez testified about the business relationship between Cabrera Car Rental and Autocentro, the history of their dealings related to the plaintiffs' Tercel, and the inspection procedures Autocentro uses upon receipt of a car into inventory. Ramirez also testified that Autocentro did not alter the odometer of the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of evidence, the jury returned a unanimous verdict for plaintiffs under the Odometer Act and Article 1802. The jury awarded Rivera and Ravelo $20,000 each in damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> According to the jury verdict form, the jury found that Autocentro \"intentionally defrauded plaintiffs regarding the reading of the odometer in the Toyota Tercel.\" As a result, the district court trebled the award pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 32710(a), which provides that \"[a] person that violates this [Act], with intent to defraud, is liable for 3 times the actual damages or $1,500, whichever is greater.\" After the district court entered judgment for plaintiffs, the defendant filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial or remittitur, both of which were denied. Defendant now appeals from the jury verdict, the award of damages, and the district court's denial of defendant's post-trial motions for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Autocentro advances three claims of error on appeal. First, it argues that the district court erred in declining to grant defendant's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50. Second, Autocentro claims that the district court's instructions to the jury regarding damages were flawed. Third, defendant urges that the district court erred in failing to grant its motion for a new trial or remittitur under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. As we shall explain, only the latter claim is meritorious, and only then with respect to the award to plaintiff Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Autocentro violated the Odometer Act when it sold plaintiffs the car in question. Even in the best of circumstances, the standards for granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law are stringent. Courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury's determination when \"the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.\" <i>Keisling v. SER-Jobs for Progress, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665981\"><a href=\"/opinion/665981/64-fair-emplpraccas-bna-432-64-empl-prac-dec-p-42963-dania-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span>, 759-60 (1st Cir.1994). In making that determination, courts must consider the evidence and its attendant inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>Id.</i> at 760. However, we do not even reach the application of this stringent standard here because defendant failed to preserve the sufficiency of the evidence issue for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 provides that \"[m]otions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(2). This case was submitted to the jury on February 24, 2003, judgment was entered on February 26, and Autocentro moved for judgment as a matter of law for the first time on March 10. Simply put, defendant's failure to move for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence procedurally defaults this claim on appeal. <i>See, e.g., Keisling,</i> 19 F.3d at 758 (holding that even when a defendant moves under Rule 50 at the close of plaintiff's evidence &#8212; and Autocentro did not even do that &#8212; \"[i]f a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the post-trial stage, with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals, the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence\"). As we observed in <i>Keisling:</i>\"[r]equiring the motion to be made at the close of all the evidence gives the opposing party an opportunity to respond to any evidentiary deficiencies noted by the motion by seeking to reopen the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 758-59.

We have consistently held that we \"will not consider claims of insufficient evidence unless the district court was presented with a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.\" <i>Keisling,</i> 19 F.3d at 759; <i>see also Jusino,</i> 875 F.2d at 991 (collecting cases dating from 1954).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant suggests no reason that our well settled rule should not apply in this case, and we see none in the record. Accordingly, we leave undisturbed the district court's denial of Autocentro's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Autocentro alleges that the district court's instructions to the jury regarding damages were erroneous. Defendant again suffers a self-inflicted wound on appeal because, in addition to failing to submit proposed instructions at the district court's invitation as provided for in Rule 51(a), it failed to object to the jury instructions at trial. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 provides that \"[a] party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1). The \"failure to object to the [jury] instructions at the time, and in the manner, designated by Rule 51 is treated as a procedural default....\" <i>Moore v.

Because of the fact that the jury was never instructed on the definition of actual damages and on the fact that only actual damages would be trebled as required by Law, Autocentro moves the Court to not treble the award, since clearly the jury intended Ravelo and Rivera to receive compensatory damages, and under the Federal Odometer Act these are not trebled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant apparently is unaware that the definitions of \"actual damages,\" which are trebled under the Odometer Act, and \"compensatory damages,\" which it claims the jury intended to award, are synonymous. <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> 394 (7th ed.1999) (defining \"actual damages\" and noting that they are \"[a]lso termed `compensatory damages'\"). To the extent that defendant relies on this misapprehended distinction to support its claim of error, the claim is baseless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Autocentro further claims that we \"should consider that not informing the jury that the award would be triplicated poses a due process problem, since Autocentro was not afforded the Constitutional guarantees as to the portion of the award corresponding to the triplication.\" Leaving aside that defendant offers this broad assertion with no supporting legal citation, we find this claim wholly unpersuasive for another reason: when discussing the district court's proposed verdict form, defense counsel specifically stated that he did not think the issue of treble damages should be addressed to the jury. Since the defendant requested that the availability of treble damages not be addressed to the jury, and the district court honored that request, the defendant cannot argue on appeal that the district court's approach constitutes reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More troubling is defendant's claim that under the Odometer Act, the measure of \"actual damages\" should be limited to the difference in the amount paid by plaintiffs and the amount the car was actually worth given its true condition, along with repair costs that plaintiffs would not have incurred had the car's true mileage matched that shown on the odometer. Defendant cites scattered district court cases to support this theory of limited damages, and this approach has some intuitive appeal. Unfortunately, the term \"actual damages\" is not defined in the statute, nor could we find any relevant legislative history clarifying the point. However, as one district court observed: \"The method of calculating damages favored by the courts is to utilize the difference between the fair market value of the car with the actual mileage thereon, and the amount paid for the automobile by the purchaser, plus any other damages that the purchaser may have incurred.\" <i>Williams v.

In turn, the Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 549 (1977) explains that in fraud cases,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation is entitled to recover as damages in an action of deceit against the maker the pecuniary loss to him of which the misrepresentation is a legal cause, including (a) the difference between the value of what he has received in the transaction and its purchase price or other value given for it; and (b) pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a consequence of the recipient's reliance upon the misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 549(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This last approach &#8212; applying the definitions of damages derived from fraud cases &#8212; would result in the availability of pecuniary damages, presumably including lost wages if a proper showing of causation could be made, but likely exclude recovery for such nonpecuniary damages as emotional pain and mental anguish. <i>See</i> Steven J. Gaynor, Annotation, \"Fraud Actions: Right to Recover for Mental or Emotional Distress,\" 11 A.L.R.5th 88 (2004) (\"Damages in an action for fraud are generally limited to actual pecuniary loss; however, this rule is not without exceptions.\") (collecting and analyzing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge, then, that in a case where the issue was properly raised, a substantial argument could be made that violations of the Odometer Act should be treated as a species of fraud, and the actual damages recoverable should be limited to pecuniary damages, which might include lost wages. However, as we have emphasized, defendant's procedural lapses with respect to the jury instructions require us to apply plain error review. Even if the inclusion of \"emotional pain and mental anguish\" in the jury instructions on damages constituted error (an issue we do not decide), the error would not be plain because of the absence of a statutory definition of actual damages, the lack of legislative history, and the inconclusive nature of the available precedents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court's instructions did not result in a miscarriage of justice or affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings below. Defendant did not propose jury instructions. It did not object to the instructions given by the district court. It did not afford the district court a timely opportunity to rule on the issues it now raises on appeal. Its one request &#8212; that the issue of treble damages not be addressed to the jury &#8212; was honored. Under the circumstances, we think our words from over a decade ago apply with force in the present case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain error standard ... is near its zenith in the Rule 51 milieu....

Rules serve a valuable purpose. Without them, the judicial system would be in shambles. It follows that, in the ordinary case, parties flout well-established rules at their peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Toscano v.

Plaintiffs introduced an expert witness who testified that Ravelo's economic damages were approximately $21,000. Ravelo also testified regarding the extent of damages he incurred. Defendant introduced no rebuttal witnesses regarding the extent of plaintiffs' damages. To be sure, Ravelo's evidence was not overwhelming. In entering judgment for the plaintiffs, the district court observed that while the jury verdict \"may contradict the bench's assessment of the evidence, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs allows for a liberal jury interpretation of the matters at issue.\" As the district court rightly observed, courts are not entitled to substitute their view of the evidence for the verdict reached by the jury. Only when the verdict is a \"manifest miscarriage of justice,\" <i>Federico,</i> 64 F.3d at 5, or the damages awarded are \"grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking to the conscience of the court, or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand,\" will courts intervene to upset a jury verdict and award. <i>Segal,</i> 746 F.2d at 80-81 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we might characterize the award to Ravelo as generous, it is grounded in evidence adduced at trial and does not shock the conscience of the court. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to disturb the jury verdict to Ravelo either by ordering a new trial or granting a remittitur of the damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Damages Award to Rivera</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The damages award to Rivera presents a different story. The only damages evidence was her testimony that she \"felt very bad because I felt that I had been misled. I felt let down with the whole situation. I felt like any human being who discovers that he has been misled by someone.\" Rivera also testified that after she came to believe that the car in fact had many more miles on it than represented by the odometer, she no longer felt safe driving the car. In addition to testifying that she was upset by the whole situation, Rivera testified that \"this brought emotional conflicts between me and my husband [and] because of the stress that we had because of all of this, and he was angry and upset, and ... he would fight a lot and argue a lot with the children.\" Finally, Rivera testified that \"when things like this happen, you start mistrusting because of the fact that you see that they are trying to fool you, and many things go through your head.... I am still affected because mainly of having to go through this entire process.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without diminishing the aggravation that the problems with the car caused Rivera, we are constrained to say that the record evidence simply does not support the $20,000 award.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Unlike the $20,000 award to Ravelo, which comports with the amount of his economic damages to which the expert witness testified, the $20,000 award to Rivera has no \"rational basis in evidence.\" <i>O'Brien v.

The only evidence to support Rivera's award is testimony that she felt \"bad,\" \"let down,\" \"mistrusting,\" and that domestic life had added stresses. This level of bother, which in many ways describes the everyday frustrations all members of society suffer from time to time, does not remotely warrant $20,000 in relief, trebled to $60,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the damages award to Rivera is excessive as a matter of law, we have two options: remanding to the district court to determine damages, or setting the amount of remittitur ourselves based on the evidence adduced at trial. <i>Koster v.

We think that the district court's greater familiarity with the course of proceedings below, and particularly its ability to observe the witnesses' testimonies, afford a better position to assess the amount of damages appropriate on remittitur.

The damages award determined by the district court will be trebled under the Odometer Act because of the jury finding that Autocentro intentionally defrauded the plaintiffs. Finally, as per the usual rule, Rivera will have the choice of accepting the remitted award or opting for new trial. <i>See, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas.

The district court has the option of ordering a full trial for Rivera or limiting the new trial to the issue of damages. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a) (\"A new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues....\"); <i>see also Marchant,</i> 836 F.2d at 704 (concluding \"that a new trial on damages is appropriate\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the judgment to Ravelo. We vacate the judgment to Rivera and direct the district court to enter a new judgment for Rivera in the amount that it determines is appropriate in light of the evidence, to then be trebled, or, if Rivera refuses to accept entry of such judgment, order a new trial for Rivera, which may but need not be limited to the issue of damages. We REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 32710(b), we direct the district court to award attorney's fees and costs related to this appeal in an appropriate amount. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 32710(b) (in \"[c]ivil actions by private persons\" brought to enforce the Odometer Act, \"[t]he court shall award costs and a reasonable attorney's fee to the person when a judgment is entered for that person\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under Toyota's distributor and dealership agreements, a dealer such as Autocentro acts as an intermediary for and receives a commission on distributor sales to fleet clients such as rental car agencies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Neither party devotes any argumentation to the Article 1802 claim on appeal. Briefly, to state an Article 1802 claim for damages based on negligence, \"a plaintiff must prove that (1) defendant owed a duty to prevent the harm by conforming to a reasonable standard of conduct; (2) defendant breached that duty through a negligent act or omission; and (3) the negligent act or omission caused the plaintiff's harm.\"<i>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. Grove Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579443\"><a href=\"/opinion/579443/tokio-marine-fire-insurance-company-ltd-v-the-grove-manufacturing/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1171 (1st Cir.1992). We focus on the Odometer Act, as do the parties, and the availability of damages under Article 1802 does not alter our analysis of the issues on appeal. Furthermore, as the district court noted, Autocentro \"did not elicit evidence from Plaintiffs nor present independent evidence that would have allowed for a better allocation of those damages that were properly attributable to the Odometer Act and those that were attributable to the state law fraud action.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The trial transcript indicates that the jury awarded plaintiff Rivera $21,000 and plaintiff Ravelo $20,000. However, the district court entered judgment in the amount of $20,000 each, which was trebled to total $120,000, plus costs. No party addresses this apparent discrepancy on appeal; we treat the district court's entry as the figure at issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We are not suggesting that emotional pain and mental anguish are necessarily damages appropriately recovered under the Odometer Act. However, since those items were in the unobjected-to jury instructions, which we have held do not constitute plain error, they are the law of the case<i>Mu&#241;iz,</i> 373 F.3d at 7 (\"The defendant did not object to th[e] instruction and it is, therefore, the law of the case.\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
