William G. Young, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas E. Carlotto, with whom Shechtman Halperin Savage, LLP\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Paul Collier, III, with whom Law Offices of Paul Collier,\nKimberly Breger, and Legal Services Center of Harvard Law Center,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 7, 2006\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           This bankruptcy appeal arrives\n\nbefore us in a procedural tangle.            The case began when Jean Miles,\n\nthe debtor, filed a petition for relief under chapter 13 of the\n\nBankruptcy Code to forestall a scheduled foreclosure by creditor\n\n(and appellant) Beneficial Massachusetts, Inc., which holds a\n\nmortgage on her residence.         Despite the mortgage, Miles listed\n\nBeneficial   in   her   chapter   13    plan    as   an   unsecured   creditor,\n\napparently because, in Miles' view, Beneficial violated a number of\n\nfederal and Massachusetts consumer protection statutes when it\n\nclosed the loan which the mortgage secures.               The plan stated that\n\nMiles would bring an adversary action to vindicate the allegations\n\nabout Beneficial's unlawful behavior and, presumably, the decision\n\nto list Beneficial as an unsecured creditor.                But Miles did not\n\nfile the promised adversary proceeding prior to the confirmation of\n\nher plan.\n\n            Beneficial received notice of the proposed plan but\n\npermitted the plan to be confirmed by the bankruptcy court without\n\nobjection.     Beneficial also received and accepted payments from\n\nMiles under the confirmed plan.         A short time after confirmation,\n\nhowever, Beneficial filed with the bankruptcy court a proof of\n\nsecured claim.     Beneficial filed this proof of claim on its own,\n\nnot through counsel.     Strangely, the claim form incorrectly named\n\nthe debtor as \"Jean Murphy\" and misstated the date of the loan.\n\nPerhaps for these reasons, the form was never docketed in the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcourt's electronic docketing system.                 Stranger still, Beneficial\n\nfollowed up this filing with a (counseled) motion for relief from\n\nthe automatic stay (imposed when Miles filed her petition) which\n\nwas    supported     by   a   \"Loan     Repayment      and       Security   Agreement\"\n\ncontaining the same wrong information -- including a signature by\n\none Jean Murphy -- included on the claim form.\n\n             Subsequently,      Beneficial       filed       a    motion    for   post-\n\nconfirmation relief to determine the validity of its lien or,\n\nalternatively, for vacatur of the order confirming the plan.                       The\n\nbankruptcy court did not vacate its confirmation order but held\n\nthat   the   order    did     not   affect     the    validity       of   Beneficial's\n\nmortgage.     The court also granted Beneficial's motion for relief\n\nfrom the automatic stay to permit Beneficial to seek to foreclose\n\non the mortgage in state court.              Miles moved for reconsideration\n\nand contemporaneously filed an adversary action contesting the\n\nvalidity of Beneficial's mortgage ab initio under the same theories\n\nmentioned in her chapter 13 plan.                    The court summarily denied\n\nMiles' motion, and Miles appealed to the district court.\n\n             In her brief to the district court, Miles argued that\n\nconfirmation of the chapter 13 plan listing Beneficial as an\n\nunsecured     creditor,       coupled    with    Beneficial’s         acceptance    of\n\npayments pursuant to the plan, rendered Beneficial an unsecured\n\ncreditor.     As a remedy, Miles sought, inter alia, declaratory\n\nrelief to this effect.         Alternatively, in the concluding paragraph\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fof her brief, Miles asked that the district court vacate the\n\nbankruptcy court orders and reimpose the automatic stay for so long\n\nas her newly-filed adversary action remained pending.            In its\n\nresponsive brief, Beneficial countered Miles’ primary argument but\n\ndid not address Miles’ alternative request for relief.\n\n            The district court scheduled the matter for oral argument\n\nbut, when the hearing convened, proceeded directly to Miles’\n\nrequest for alternative relief.      The court opined that addressing\n\nthe merits of Miles’ primary argument would be premature because\n\nthe pending adversary action sought a declaration that Beneficial's\n\nmortgage had been unlawfully procured. Because the validity of the\n\nmortgage was an essential premise of the bankruptcy court’s ruling,\n\nthe court suggested, the primary issue would not ripen unless and\n\nuntil Beneficial was deemed to have been a secured creditor at the\n\ntime Miles filed for chapter 13 relief.           The court therefore\n\nreimposed    the   stay   to   preserve   the   status   quo   ante   and\n\nadministratively closed the case without entry of judgment and\n\nwithout prejudice to reopening it, if appropriate, upon termination\n\nof the bankruptcy court proceedings.\n\n            Beneficial appeals the district court's decision, arguing\n\nthat the district court's decision to reimpose the stay constituted\n\nlegal error because the bankruptcy court’s decision to lift the\n\nstay was premised on a sound view of the law and well within its\n\ndiscretion on the record then before it.            Miles responds to\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fBeneficial's merits argument, but also contends that (1) Beneficial\n\nhas waived its right to bring this appeal by affirmatively agreeing\n\nto the course of action taken by the district court, and (2) there\n\nis no appellate jurisdiction to review the court's order, which was\n\nnot final.   Beneficial did not file a reply brief responding to\n\nMiles' waiver and jurisdictional arguments.      At oral argument,\n\nBeneficial contested Miles' waiver argument at some length, but had\n\nlittle to say about the jurisdictional argument other than that the\n\ndistrict court's order was final because the issue before the court\n\nwas whether to reimpose the stay, and because the court decided\n\nthat issue without a formal remand to the bankruptcy court.   Cf. In\n\nre Gould & Eberhardt Gear Mach. Corp., 852 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (\"When a district court remands a matter to the bankruptcy\n\ncourt for significant further proceedings, there is no final order\n\n. . . and the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction.\") (emphasis\n\nsupplied).\n\n          Miles' waiver argument has some allure:     Beneficial's\n\ncounsel never objected to the district court's proposed course of\n\naction, told the court that \"it does make sense,\" and then never\n\nsought reconsideration before appealing to us.    Cf. Pomerleau v.\n\nWest Springfield Public Schools, 362 F.3d 143, 146-47 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (enforcing a forfeiture in somewhat similar circumstances for\n\nreasons of judicial efficiency).   But we shall resolve this appeal\n\nagainst Beneficial on straightforward grounds suggested (although\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fnot directly raised) by Miles’ appellate jurisdiction argument, an\n\nargument that itself we shall not engage because it implicates\n\ndifficult issues that have not been fully joined.             See Restoration\n\nPres. Masonry, Inc. v. Grove European, Ltd., 325 F.3d 54, 59 (1st\n\nCir.    2003)   (observing      that,       notwithstanding     the    ban   on\n\n“hypothetical jurisdiction” imposed by Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\n\nBetter Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998), courts may bypass difficult\n\nissues pertaining to statutory appellate jurisdiction where the\n\nmerits of an appeal are easily resolved against the party asserting\n\nappellate jurisdiction); see also, e.g., Okymansky v. Herbalife\n\nInt'l   of   America,   Inc.,   415     F.3d   154,   158   (1st   Cir.   2005)\n\n(appellate courts may affirm a district court ruling on any ground\n\nsupported by the record).\n\n             As set forth above, Beneficial argues to us that the\n\ndistrict court erred in reimposing the stay because the bankruptcy\n\ncourt’s order lifting the stay was within its discretion on the\n\nrecord then before it.     There is a logical flaw in this argument,\n\nand the flaw is fatal to Beneficial’s appeal.               The order lifting\n\nthe stay may well have been well within the bankruptcy court's\n\ndiscretion at the time it was made, but it does not follow a priori\n\nthat the district court erred in reimposing the stay. The district\n\ncourt’s decision to reimpose the stay was based on the fact that,\n\nin its estimation, the underlying circumstances had materially\n\nchanged after the bankruptcy court issued its order.                  Miles had\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ffiled an adversary action challenging as invalid ab initio the\n\nmortgage on Miles’ residence, and yet the bankruptcy court’s ruling\n\nwas premised on the assumption that Beneficial's mortgage was at\n\nleast initially valid.   Beneficial does not argue to us that the\n\ndistrict court erred in so reasoning.      And without directly or\n\nindirectly calling into question the correctness of the district\n\ncourt’s rationale, which certainly does not strike us as plainly\n\nwrong, Beneficial cannot prevail in this appeal.     See generally\n\nCarcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(appellant's failure to address lower court's apparently sufficient\n\nrational is fatal to the appeal).\n\n          Affirmed.

Miles responds to Beneficial's merits argument, but also contends that (1) Beneficial has waived its right to bring this appeal by affirmatively agreeing to the course of action taken by the district court, and (2) there is no appellate jurisdiction to review the court's order, which was not final. Beneficial did not file a reply brief responding to Miles' waiver and jurisdictional arguments. At oral argument, Beneficial contested Miles' waiver argument at some length, but had little to say about the jurisdictional argument other than that the district court's order was final because the issue before the court was whether to reimpose the stay, and because the court decided that issue without a formal remand to the bankruptcy court. <i>Cf.

Pomerleau v. West Springfield Public Schools,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200951\"><a href=\"/opinion/200951/p-v-west-springfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 146-47 (1st Cir.2004) (enforcing a forfeiture in somewhat similar circumstances for reasons of judicial efficiency). But we shall resolve this appeal against Beneficial on straightforward grounds suggested (although not directly raised) by Miles' appellate jurisdiction argument, an argument that itself we shall not engage because it implicates difficult issues that have not been fully joined. <i>See Restoration Pres.

There is a logical flaw in this argument, and the flaw is fatal to Beneficial's appeal. The order lifting the stay may well have been well within the bankruptcy court's discretion at the time it was made, but it does not follow <i>a priori</i> that the district court erred in reimposing the stay. The district court's decision to reimpose the stay was based on the fact that, in its estimation, the underlying circumstances had materially <i>changed</i> after the bankruptcy court issued its order. Miles had filed an adversary action challenging as invalid <i>ab initio</i> the mortgage on Miles' residence, and yet the bankruptcy court's ruling was premised on the assumption that Beneficial's mortgage was at least initially valid. Beneficial does not argue to us that the district court erred in so reasoning. And without directly or indirectly calling into question the correctness of the district court's rationale, which certainly does not strike us as plainly wrong, Beneficial cannot prevail in this appeal. <i>See generally Carcamo-Recinos v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201347\"><a href=\"/opinion/201347/carcamo-recinos-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 257 (1st Cir.2004) (appellant's failure to address lower court's apparently sufficient rational is fatal to the appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
