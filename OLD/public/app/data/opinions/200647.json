Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Santos De Aza-Paez on brief pro se.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                       September 15, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Santos de Aza-Paez (Santos)\n\nappeals from the denial of his petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n2255.     The district court denied the petition as untimely.               We\n\nvacate and remand for the following reasons.\n\n     The undisputed facts are that Santos directed the president of\n\na paralegal service to file his habeas petition, which arrived\n\nwithin the one-year deadline following the denial of his petition\n\nfor certiorari.      The petition was unsigned and accompanied by a\n\nmemo from the paralegal service stating that Santos had requested\n\nthat the agency forward his petition, the circumstances preventing\n\nSantos from sending the petition, and an averment that a signed\n\npetition would follow.         The district court returned the petition\n\nto the paralegal service with notification that it was unsigned.\n\nUpon completion of his transfer between prisons, Santos filed the\n\nsame petition and signed it.          However, the filing date for this\n\nsigned petition was one month after the one-year deadline.                 The\n\ndistrict court determined that this petition was untimely.\n\n        Title 28 U.S.C. ยง 1654 provides that, in all courts of the\n\nUnited States, \"the parties may plead and conduct their own cases\n\npersonally or by counsel. . . .\" In addition, Rule 11(a) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that all pleadings and\n\nmotions    be   signed   by   the   party   or   by   the   party's   attorney.\n\nHowever, Rule 11(a) provides that an unsigned paper will not be\n\nstricken for lack of signature if it is corrected promptly.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f        Admittedly, until quite recently this court like a number of\n\nothers took the view that an unsigned document such as a notice of\n\nappeal was a legal nullity, Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2000), and the district court's disposition accorded with that\n\nview.     However, recent case law has viewed lack of signature as a\n\ntechnical error. See e.g., Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757, 768\n\n(2001) (omission of signature on timely filed notice of appeal is\n\na curable error which does not constitute a jurisdictional bar to\n\npursuit of appeal); Casanova v. DuBois, 289 F.3d 142, 146 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (omission of co-plaintiffs' signatures on notice of appeal is\n\ncurable in light of Becker and the court's obligation to read pro\n\nse complaints generously).\n\n        In the instant case, the timely habeas petition was not signed\n\nby a pro se plaintiff or his attorney.    However, there was no doubt\n\nabout who was filing or what judgment was attacked.      Furthermore,\n\nthe initial filing, together with the signed petition, demonstrate\n\nthe assent of Santos to the petition.    As a result, the signed copy\n\nof the same petition, received a month after the deadline for a\n\nhabeas filing had passed, cured the timely, but unsigned petition.\n\n\n\n        For these reasons, we conclude that Santos's petition pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255 is timely.    We therefore remand to the district\n\ncourt for consideration of the underlying claims in Santos's ยง2255\n\npetition.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                         -4-\n\f",
