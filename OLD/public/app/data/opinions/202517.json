Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     H. Ernest Stone for appellant.\n     Mark T. Quinlivan, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 21, 2006\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        The Speedy Trial Act (STA), 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 3161-3174, is generally concerned with two periods of\n\ndelay: delay in bringing an information or indictment after arrest\n\nand delay in commencing trial after information, indictment, or the\n\ndefendant's   first    appearance.         This   case   involves     a    speedy\n\nindictment claim.\n\n          The Act proscribes delay of more than thirty days in\n\nbringing an information or indictment, measured from the date the\n\nindividual was arrested or served with a summons as to the charges.\n\nId. § 3161(b). Extensions of this thirty-day period may be granted\n\nfor reasons enumerated in § 3161(h).\n\n          The   Act     also   requires,     subject     to    exceptions    and\n\nextensions, that the trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty to\n\nan information or indictment commence within seventy days from the\n\nfiling date of the information or indictment, or from the date the\n\ndefendant first appeared before a judicial officer of the court in\n\nwhich the charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.                   Id. §\n\n3161(c)(1); see Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 322\n\n(1986).\n\n          The   \"[t]ime    limits    and    exclusions\"       for   both   speedy\n\nindictment and speedy trial claims are set forth in § 3161, which\n\nis so captioned.      In turn, § 3162 bears the caption \"[s]anctions\"\n\nand governs remedies for violation of the Act.                 The remedy for\n\nviolation of the time requirements is dismissal of an indictment\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\feither with or without prejudice, depending on the consideration of\n\nseveral statutory factors.        18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(1), (2); United\n\nStates v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st Cir. 1995); United\n\nStates v. Budzyna, 666 F.2d 666, 669 n.4 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n           The questions raised here are (1) whether a trial judge\n\nhas an obligation to address sua sponte speedy indictment claims in\n\nthe absence of a timely motion by defendant and, if not, (2)\n\nwhether defendant has waived any speedy indictment claim by not\n\nmaking such a motion before trial or entry of a guilty plea.           These\n\nquestions arise because the text of the sanction provision for\n\nspeedy indictment claims, § 3162(a)(1), does not explicitly require\n\nthe defendant to file a motion, whereas the sanction provision for\n\nspeedy trial claims, § 3162(a)(2), does require the defendant to\n\nfile a motion.      We hold that the STA, read as a whole, imposes no\n\nobligation on the district court to raise speedy indictment claims\n\nin the absence of a motion by the defendant.1         We also hold that a\n\ndefendant who fails to file a timely motion as required by the last\n\nsentence   of   §   3162(a)(2)   waives   such   claims   as   a   matter   of\n\nstatutory command.      Consequently, not even plain error review is\n\navailable to such a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          We do not suggest that the district court may not raise\nthe issue sua sponte and resolve it after notice and opportunity to\nbe heard.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                                      I.\n\n            After a four-day jury trial, defendant Gerard Spagnuolo\n\nwas found guilty of possessing controlled substances with the\n\nintent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).                  He\n\nwas sentenced to thirty-three months of imprisonment to be followed\n\nby seventy-two months of supervised release.                 He also was fined\n\n$5,000.\n\n            The charge was based on drugs found on Spagnuolo during\n\na search incident to his arrest on September 29, 2001 for selling\n\nan Oxycontin pill outside a restaurant in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\nDuring    the   search,   police   found     two   plastic    bags   of   cocaine\n\n(consistent with street level drug distribution), three Oxycontin\n\npills, and approximately $200 in cash.                In a later search of\n\nSpagnuolo's apartment conducted pursuant to a search warrant,\n\npolice    found   more    drugs,   cutting    agents,   drug    paraphernalia,\n\napproximately $20,000 in cash, and a Colt .45 caliber pistol with\n\nmagazines and bullets.\n\n            Spagnuolo was transferred from state to federal custody\n\non December 7, 2001, on which date he made his initial appearance\n\nbefore a magistrate judge. The government moved that the detention\n\nhearing be continued for ten days, and the court continued the\n\nhearing until December 20, 2001.           On December 20, 2001, Spagnuolo\n\nmoved to continue the detention hearing generally and did not\n\nrequest a rescheduling date; the court allowed the motion that same\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fday.    On January 9, 2002, the parties filed a joint motion to\n\ncontinue and to extend the indictment deadline.                   The magistrate\n\njudge ruled that she was unable to extend the indictment deadline\n\nand indicated that the motion should be placed on the emergency\n\nbusiness docket of the court.            For some reason, that was not done,\n\nand so the joint motion to extend the indictment deadline was not\n\nruled on.     On February 20, 2002, the government moved for a status\n\nconference on the issue of Spagnuolo's detention.\n\n              On February 27, 2002, Spagnuolo was indicted on four\n\ncounts -- possession with intent to distribute and distribution of\n\nOxycontin,     in    violation      of   21   U.S.C.   §   841(a)(1)    (Count    1);\n\npossession with intent to distribute Schedule I and Schedule II\n\ncontrolled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (Count\n\n2); being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (Count 3); and possession of a firearm in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 4).           He was arraigned on March 15, 2002.            On\n\nMarch   20,    2002,    Spagnuolo,       through   his     counsel,    assented    to\n\ndetention without a hearing, and the court entered an order that\n\nday detaining him pending trial.\n\n              On    October   28,    2002,    during   a   pretrial    conference,\n\nSpagnuolo notified the district court of his intention to file a\n\nmotion to dismiss based on violations of the STA.                The court set a\n\nfiling deadline of November 8, 2002 for defendant's motions to\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdismiss.   On November 7, 2002, Spagnuolo mailed to the clerk a\n\nmotion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment for violation of\n\nthe speedy indictment provisions of the STA; the motion was filed\n\non November 12, 2002.   The motion included no request to dismiss\n\neither Count 2 or Count 4.\n\n           During a pretrial conference and motions hearing on March\n\n12, 2003, the district court advised the parties that Spagnuolo's\n\nmotion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 for violation of the STA remained\n\nunder advisement.   Spagnuolo, who was acting pro se with standby\n\ncounsel (contrary to the advice of the court), requested, \"[I]f\n\nit's not too late, add the other drug charge on with that into that\n\nmotion, incorporate it into that.\"    The district court declined to\n\ndo so, saying it had given Spagnuolo more opportunity than other\n\ncriminal defendants to submit filings to the court.      The court,\n\nreferring to the STA motion on Counts 1 and 3 which had been filed,\n\nsaid, \"[T]he short of it is I have before me a particular motion.\n\nI'm going to act on the particular motion.\"      Spagnuolo concedes\n\nthat he never filed a written motion regarding Count 2, and he does\n\nnot argue that the oral attempt to add Count 2 to the earlier\n\nmotion complied with the scheduling deadlines and orders set by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n           Just before jury empanelment, the trial court dismissed\n\nCounts 1 and 3 on defendant's motion to dismiss for violation of\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fthe STA on lack-of-speedy-indictment grounds.2    The court reserved\n\njudgment as to whether the dismissal of those two counts would be\n\nwith or without prejudice.\n\n           Spagnuolo proceeded to trial on the remaining Count 2 and\n\nCount 4.   The jury found defendant guilty on both counts.     After\n\ntrial, the district court granted defendant's motion under Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) for judgment of acquittal as to\n\nCount 4 for insufficiency of the evidence, but denied the motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal as to Count 2.     Later, in light of the\n\nconviction and sentence on Count 2, the government agreed to an\n\norder dismissing Counts 1 and 3 with prejudice.           On appeal,\n\nSpagnuolo argues that the district court should have dismissed\n\nCount 2 on speedy indictment grounds.    We reject this argument.\n\n                                II.\n\n           The STA was amended in 1979 to provide for two, rather\n\nthan three, periods of time to be counted.     See Speedy Trial Act\n\nAmendments Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-43, § 2, 93 Stat. 327, 327\n\n(merging    ten-day   indictment-to-arraignment     and    sixty-day\n\narraignment-to-trial limits into a seventy-day indictment-to-trial\n\n\n\n     2\n          The court found that there were nineteen non-excludable\ndays between December 21 and January 8, and forty-one non-\nexcludable days between January 10 and February 19, for a total of\nsixty non-excludable days between December 7, the date Spagnuolo\nwas taken into federal custody, and February 27, the date of his\nindictment. The government argues on appeal that additional time\nwas excludable under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F), and that the STA\nwas not in fact violated. We do not reach this issue.\n\n                                -7-\n\fperiod); 3B Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure, § 833,\n\nat 398-401 (3d ed. 2004).   As amended, the Act imposes a thirty-day\n\nlimit on the time between arrest and the filing of an indictment or\n\ninformation, and a seventy-day limit on the time between the date\n\nthat the indictment or information is made public, or the date of\n\nfirst appearance (whichever is later), and the date of trial.     18\n\nU.S.C. § 3161(b), (c)(1).\n\n            The purpose of the STA's thirty-day arrest-to-indictment\n\nrequirement \"is to ensure that the defendant is not held under an\n\narrest warrant for an excessive period without receiving formal\n\nnotice of the charge against which he must prepare to defend\n\nhimself.\"    United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (quoting United States v. Berry, 90 F.3d 148, 151 (6th Cir.\n\n1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The defendant's arguments are resolved against him by the\n\ntext and purposes of the STA.      The Act, at § 3161, provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n            (b) Any information or indictment charging an\n            individual with the commission of an offense\n            shall be filed within thirty days from the\n            date on which such individual was arrested or\n            served with a summons in connection with such\n            charges. . . .\n\n            (c)(1) In any case in which a plea of not\n            guilty is entered, the trial of a defendant\n            charged in an information or indictment with\n            the commission of an offense shall commence\n            within seventy days from the filing date (and\n            making   public)   of   the   information   or\n            indictment, or from the date the defendant has\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          appeared before a judicial officer of the\n          court in which such charge is pending,\n          whichever date last occurs. . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3161(b), (c)(1).   This establishes the two periods:\n\nthirty days to indictment and an additional seventy days to trial.\n\n          The sanctions for non-compliance with § 3161 are set\n\nforth in § 3162, which provides:\n\n          (a)(1) If, in the case of any individual\n          against whom a complaint is filed charging\n          such individual with an offense, no indictment\n          or information is filed within the time limit\n          required by section 3161(b) as extended by\n          section 3161(h) of this chapter, such charge\n          against that individual contained in such\n          complaint shall be dismissed or otherwise\n          dropped. . . .\n\n          (2) If a defendant is not brought to trial\n          within the time limit required by section\n          3161(c) as extended by section 3161(h) the\n          information or indictment shall be dismissed\n          on motion of the defendant.     The defendant\n          shall have the burden of proof of supporting\n          such motion but the Government shall have the\n          burden of going forward with the evidence in\n          connection with any exclusion of time under\n          subparagraph 3161(h)(3).      In determining\n          whether to dismiss the case with or without\n          prejudice, the court shall consider, among\n          others, each of the following factors: the\n          seriousness of the offense; the facts and\n          circumstances of the case which led to the\n          dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution\n          on the administration of this chapter and on\n          the administration of justice. Failure of the\n          defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial\n          or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo\n          contendere shall constitute a waiver of the\n          right to dismissal under this section.\n\nId. § 3162(a)(1), (2) (emphasis added).     The last sentence of\n\n§ 1362(a)(2) is key to the government's arguments.\n\n                               -9-\n\f          Spagnuolo argues that under § 3162(a)(1), when there is\n\na failure to indict within thirty days of arrest \"such charge\n\nagainst that individual shall be dismissed or otherwise dropped,\"\n\nregardless of whether the defendant files a motion to dismiss on\n\nSTA grounds.   Literally read, he argues, the Act only requires a\n\nmotion from the defendant when the government fails to bring\n\ndefendant to trial within seventy days of indictment, in violation\n\nof § 3161(c)(1).    Spagnuolo argues that Congress placed no such\n\nburden on a defendant to file a motion if the government fails to\n\nindict within thirty days of arrest, in violation of § 3161(b), and\n\nthe language says that \"such charge . . . shall be dismissed.\"\n\n          The government responds that Spagnuolo has ignored the\n\nsignificance of the last sentence of § 3162(a)(2), which provides\n\nthat \"[f]ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to\n\ntrial or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall\n\nconstitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this section\"\n\n(emphasis added).   Pointing out that \"Congress ordinarily adheres\n\nto a hierarchical scheme in subdividing statutory sections,\" Koons\n\nBuick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U.S. 50, 60 (2004), the\n\nprosecution argues that the phrase \"under this section\" refers to\n\nall of § 3162, including § 3162(a)(1), and not just         to the\n\nsubdivision concerned with speedy trial rights, § 3162(a)(2), in\n\nwhich the sentence is located.    Accordingly, Congress must have\n\nbeen referring to all of § 3162 because it would have used the\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fphrase \"under this paragraph\" if it had intended to restrict the\n\nmotion and waiver provision to § 3162(a)(2).               See id. at 60-61\n\n(noting that the House and Senate manuals on legislative drafting\n\nboth endorse the use of \"subsection\" for subdivisions beginning\n\nwith \"(a),\" \"paragraph\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(1),\"\n\n\"subparagraph\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(A),\" and \"clause\"\n\nfor subdivisions beginning with \"(i)\").\n\n              Applying the normal rules of statutory construction leads\n\nus to conclude that the motion and waiver provision of § 3162(a)(2)\n\nalso applies to § 3162(a)(1) speedy indictment claims, because\n\n\"section\" must refer to all of § 3162, and not just to the\n\nparagraph in § 3162 where the motion and waiver provision was\n\n(improvidently) located.       Other references in the STA confirm that\n\nthe drafters of the Act followed the hierarchy prescribed by the\n\nHouse   and     Senate   drafting     manuals.      See,   e.g.,   18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 3161(d)(1), (d)(2), (e).\n\n              Other courts of appeals also have applied the waiver\n\nprovision     of   §   3162(a)(2)    to   speedy   indictment   claims    under\n\n§§ 3161(b) and 3162(a)(1).          See United States v. Gamboa, 439 F.3d\n\n796, 803-04 (8th Cir. 2006); United States v. Lewis, 980 F.2d 555,\n\n560 (9th Cir. 1992); accord United States v. Martinez, 683 F. Supp.\n\n10, 12 & n.2 (D. Mass. 1988); see also United States v. Bittle, 699\n\nF.2d 1201, 1207 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (identifying and reserving\n\nissue).\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f           Furthermore, to read the statute as defendant does would\n\nundercut the purposes of the STA.       In Zedner v. United States, 126\n\nS. Ct. 1976 (2006), the Supreme Court acknowledged legislative\n\nhistory explaining that the STA \"was designed not just to benefit\n\ndefendants but also to serve the public interest by, among other\n\nthings, reducing defendants' opportunity to commit crimes while on\n\npretrial   release   and   preventing    extended   pretrial   delay   from\n\nimpairing the deterrent effect of punishment.\"           Id. at 1985-86\n\n(citing S. Rep. No. 93-1012, at 6-8 (1974); H.R. Rep. No. 93-1508,\n\nat 8 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7401, 7402).          The Act\n\ncreated incentives both for compliance by the government and for\n\nenforcement by defendants.     It would be odd to use a different set\n\nof incentives for the two situations of speedy indictment and\n\nspeedy trial. Under both, a defendant must move promptly, or waive\n\nhis rights.\n\n           In Zedner, the Supreme Court interpreted § 3162(a)(2) and\n\nstated that it \"serves two unrelated purposes\":\n\n           First, § 3162(a)(2) assigns the role of\n           spotting violations of the Act to defendants -\n           - for the obvious reason that they have the\n           greatest incentive to perform this task.\n           Second, by requiring that a defendant move\n           before the trial starts or a guilty plea is\n           entered, § 3162(a)(2) both limits the effects\n           of a dismissal without prejudice (by ensuring\n           that an expensive and time-consuming trial\n           will not be mooted by a late-filed motion\n           under the Act) and prevents undue defense\n           gamesmanship.\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fId. at 1986-87 (footnote omitted). Each of these purposes would be\n\nundercut if the motion requirement of § 3162(a)(2) were read not to\n\napply to the speedy indictment provisions.\n\n          To    accept    defendant's      argument        would   lead   to   an\n\nunwarranted difference in the treatment of speedy indictment and\n\nspeedy trial claims.3     Such a result would be inconsistent with the\n\ntreatment of periods of excludable delay in § 3161(h), which\n\nexpressly applies to both speedy indictment and speedy trial\n\ncalculations. 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) (\"The following periods of delay\n\nshall be excluded in computing the time within which an information\n\nor an indictment must be filed, or in computing the time within\n\nwhich the trial of any such offense must commence . . . .\").\n\n          Defendant does not dispute that if his claim had been a\n\nseventy-day    speedy    trial   claim,    and   not   a    thirty-day    speedy\n\nindictment claim, his claim would have been waived if he had not\n\nmade a motion to dismiss before trial.                 See United States v.\n\nHuguenin, 950 F.2d 23, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v.\n\nMcKinnell, 888 F.2d 669, 676 (10th Cir. 1989), abrogated on other\n\n\n\n     3\n          Spagnuolo argues that it is not irrational for Congress\nto have created different requirements for speedy trial claims and\nspeedy indictment claims.     He asserts that speedy indictment\nviolations involve a greater risk of harm because persons held in\ncustody prior to indictment are outside the supervision and\nprotection of the courts, and have no avenue to assert\nconstitutional rights and protections.      We reject defendant's\nargument, noting that a writ of habeas corpus is available to\nprisoners \"in custody under or by color of the authority of the\nUnited States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(1).\n\n                                    -13-\n\fgrounds by United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nThe fact that this is a speedy indictment claim does not change the\n\nresult.\n\n            The language of the final sentence of § 3162(a)(2)\n\nrequires us to hold that Spagnuolo has waived any speedy indictment\n\nclaim.    That sentence imposes two conditions.       A defendant waives\n\nhis claim if (a) he has not moved for dismissal, and (b) he has not\n\ndone so before trial or before he enters a guilty plea.          Spagnuolo\n\ndid not meet these requirements.      His belated oral request to tack\n\non an additional speedy indictment claim was not a motion within\n\neither the meaning of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2), or the\n\nlocal rule, D. Mass. R. 7.1, nor was it filed within the time\n\nrequired by the pretrial order.           Pointing to the timely motion\n\nrequirements of the last sentence of § 3162(a)(2), this court has\n\nsaid, \"While . . . the appropriate response to a Speedy Trial Act\n\ninfraction is dismissal of the indictment, the remedy is not self-\n\nexecuting . . . .\"    United States v. Connor, 926 F.2d 81, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n            Of course, the statute itself limits the waiver rights\n\nunder § 3162(a)(2).       For example, § 3162(a)(2) does not permit\n\nprospective    waivers,    since   such    waivers   would   undercut   the\n\nstatute's purposes.       Zedner, 126 S. Ct. at 1987.        The situation\n\nhere, however, does not give rise to a Zedner issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f           Further, the statute imposes no requirement that the\n\nwaiver be knowing and voluntary, and we decline to read such a\n\nrequirement into the statutory language. As noted in United States\n\nv. Gomez, 67 F.3d 1515 (10th Cir. 1995):\n\n           [J]ust as the Act provides a remedy for\n           violation of its speedy trial mandate, so too\n           it unequivocally provides that the failure of\n           a defendant to move for dismissal prior to\n           trial constitutes a waiver of any right to\n           that remedy.\n\nId. at 1520.\n\n           Moreover, Spagnuolo does not have the benefit of \"plain\n\nerror\" review, since the STA states that the statutory right is\n\nwaived and there is no issue of constitutional dimension.   See id.\n\nat 1521.   Under these circumstances, a defendant who fails to make\n\na timely motion to dismiss based on a speedy indictment claim does\n\nnot obtain the benefit of plain error review.    \"Deviation from a\n\nlegal rule is 'error' unless the rule has been waived.\"     United\n\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33 (1993).       Where there is\n\nwaiver, there can be no error.    Gomez, 67 F.3d at 1520.\n\n           Spagnuolo's conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f",

This case involves a speedy indictment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act proscribes delay of more than thirty days in bringing an information or indictment, measured from the date the individual was arrested or served with a summons as to the charges. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3161(b). Extensions of this thirty-day period may be granted for reasons enumerated in &#167; 3161(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act also requires, subject to exceptions and extensions, that the trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty to an information or indictment commence within seventy days from the filing date of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant first appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which the charge is pending, whichever date last occurs. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3161(c)(1); <i>see Henderson v.

In turn, &#167; 3162 bears the caption \"[s]anctions\" and governs remedies for violation of the Act. The remedy for violation of the time requirements is dismissal of an indictment either with or without prejudice, depending on the consideration of several statutory factors. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(1), (2); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st Cir. 1995); <i>United States v.

These questions arise because the text of the sanction provision for speedy <i>indictment</i> claims, &#167; 3162(a)(1), does not explicitly require the defendant to file a motion, whereas the sanction provision for speedy <i>trial</i> claims, &#167; 3162(a)(2), does require the defendant to file a motion. We hold that the STA, read as a whole, imposes no obligation on the district court to raise speedy indictment claims in the absence of a motion by the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We also hold that a defendant who fails to file a timely motion as required by the last sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2) waives such claims as a matter of statutory command. Consequently, not even plain error review is available to such a defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a four-day jury trial, defendant Gerard Spagnuolo was found guilty of possessing controlled substances with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). He was sentenced to thirty-three months of imprisonment to be followed by seventy-two months of supervised release. He also was fined $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge was based on drugs found on Spagnuolo during a search incident to his arrest on September 29, 2001 for selling an Oxycontin pill outside a restaurant in Quincy, Massachusetts. During the search, police found two plastic bags of cocaine (consistent with street level drug distribution), three Oxycontin pills, and approximately $200 in cash. In a later search of Spagnuolo's apartment conducted pursuant to a search warrant, police found more drugs, cutting agents, drug paraphernalia, approximately $20,000 in cash, and a Colt .45 caliber pistol with magazines and bullets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spagnuolo was transferred from state to federal custody on December 7, 2001, on which date he made his initial appearance before a magistrate judge. The government moved that the detention hearing be continued for ten days, and the court continued the hearing until December 20, 2001. On December 20, 2001, Spagnuolo moved to continue the detention hearing generally and did not request a rescheduling date; the court allowed the motion that same day. On January 9, 2002, the parties filed a joint motion to continue and to extend the indictment deadline. The magistrate judge ruled that she was unable to extend the indictment deadline and indicated that the motion should be placed on the emergency business docket of the court. For some reason, that was not done, and so the joint motion to extend the indictment deadline was not ruled on. On February 20, 2002, the government moved for a status conference on the issue of Spagnuolo's detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 2002, Spagnuolo was indicted on four counts &#8212; possession with intent to distribute and distribution of Oxycontin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (Count 1); possession with intent to distribute Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (Count 2); being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (Count 3); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 4). He was arraigned on March 15, 2002. On March 20, 2002, Spagnuolo, through his counsel, assented to detention without a hearing, and the court entered an order that day detaining him pending trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 28, 2002, during a pretrial conference, Spagnuolo notified the district court of his intention to file a motion to dismiss based on violations of the STA. The court set a filing deadline of November 8, 2002 for defendant's motions to dismiss. On November 7, 2002, Spagnuolo mailed to the clerk a motion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment for violation of the speedy indictment provisions of the STA; the motion was filed on November 12, 2002. The motion included no request to dismiss either Count 2 or Count 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a pretrial conference and motions hearing on March 12, 2003, the district court advised the parties that Spagnuolo's motion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 for violation of the STA remained under advisement. Spagnuolo, who was acting pro se with standby counsel (contrary to the advice of the court), requested, \"[I]f it's not too late, add the other drug charge on with that into that motion, incorporate it into that.\" The district court declined to do so, saying it had given Spagnuolo more opportunity than other criminal defendants to submit filings to the court. The court, referring to the STA motion on Counts 1 and 3 which had been filed, said, \"[T]he short of it is I have before me a particular motion. I'm going to act on the particular motion.\" Spagnuolo concedes that he never filed a written motion regarding Count 2, and he does not argue that the oral attempt to add Count 2 to the earlier motion complied with the scheduling deadlines and orders set by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just before jury empanelment, the trial court dismissed Counts 1 and 3 on defendant's motion to dismiss for violation of the STA on lack-of-speedy-indictment grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The court reserved judgment as to whether the dismissal of those two counts would be with or without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spagnuolo proceeded to trial on the remaining Count 2 and Count 4. The jury found defendant guilty on both counts. After trial, the district court granted defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) for judgment of acquittal as to Count 4 for insufficiency of the evidence, but denied the motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count 2. Later, in light of the conviction and sentence on Count 2, the government agreed to an order dismissing Counts 1 and 3 with prejudice. On appeal, Spagnuolo argues that the district court should have dismissed Count 2 on speedy indictment grounds. We reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STA was amended in 1979 to provide for two, rather than three, periods of time to be counted. <i>See</i> Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-43, &#167; 2, 93 Stat. 327, 327 (merging ten-day indictment-to-arraignment and sixty-day arraignment-to-trial limits into a seventy-day indictment-to-trial period); 3B Wright et al., <i>Federal Practice and Procedure,</i> &#167; 833, at 398-401 (3d ed.2004). As amended, the Act imposes a thirty-day limit on the time between arrest and the filing of an indictment or information, and a seventy-day limit on the time between the date that the indictment or information is made public, or the date of first appearance (whichever is later), and the date of trial. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(b), (c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of the STA's thirty-day arrest-to-indictment requirement \"is to ensure that the defendant is not held under an arrest warrant for an excessive period without receiving formal notice of the charge against which he must prepare to defend himself.\" <i>United States v.

Literally read, he argues, the Act only requires a motion from the defendant when the government fails to bring defendant to trial within seventy days of indictment, in violation of &#167; 3161(c)(1). Spagnuolo argues that Congress placed no such burden on a defendant to file a motion if the government fails to indict within thirty days of arrest, in violation of &#167; 3161(b), and the language says that \"such charge . . . shall be dismissed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that Spagnuolo has ignored the significance of the last sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2), which provides that \"[f]ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this <i>section</i>\" (emphasis added). Pointing out that \"Congress ordinarily adheres to a hierarchical scheme in subdividing statutory sections,\" <i>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh,</i> 543 U.S. 50, 60, 125 S.Ct. 460, 160 L.Ed.2d 389 (2004), the prosecution argues that the phrase \"under this section\" refers to all of &#167; 3162, including &#167; 3162(a)(1), and not just to the subdivision concerned with speedy trial rights, &#167; 3162(a)(2), in which the sentence is located. Accordingly, Congress must have been referring to all of &#167; 3162 because it would have used the phrase \"under this paragraph\" if it had intended to restrict the motion and waiver provision to &#167; 3162(a)(2). <i>See id.</i> at 60-61 (noting that the House and Senate manuals on legislative drafting both endorse the use of \"subsection\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(a),\" \"paragraph\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(1),\" \"subparagraph\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(A),\" and \"clause\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(i)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the normal rules of statutory construction leads us to conclude that the motion and waiver provision of &#167; 3162(a)(2) also applies to &#167; 3162(a)(1) speedy indictment claims, because \"section\" must refer to all of &#167; 3162, and not just to the paragraph in &#167; 3162 where the motion and waiver provision was (improvidently) located. Other references in the STA confirm that the drafters of the Act followed the hierarchy prescribed by the House and Senate drafting manuals. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(d)(1), (d)(2), (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts of appeals also have applied the waiver provision of &#167; 3162(a)(2) to speedy indictment claims under &#167;&#167; 3161(b) and 3162(a)(1). <i>See United States v.

In <i>Zedner v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006), the Supreme Court acknowledged legislative history explaining that the STA \"was designed not just to benefit defendants but also to serve the public interest by, among other things, reducing defendants' opportunity to commit crimes while on pretrial release and preventing extended pretrial delay from impairing the deterrent effect of punishment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1985-86 (citing S.Rep. No. 93-1012, at 6-8 (1974); H.R.Rep. No. 93-1508, at 8 (1974), <i>reprinted in</i> 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7401, 7402). The Act created incentives both for compliance by the government and for enforcement by defendants. It would be odd to use a different set of incentives for the two situations of speedy indictment and speedy trial. Under both, a defendant must move promptly, or waive his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Zedner,</i> the Supreme Court interpreted &#167; 3162(a)(2) and stated that it \"serves two unrelated purposes\": First, &#167; 3162(a)(2) assigns the role of spotting violations of the Act to defendants &#8212; for the obvious reason that they have the greatest incentive to perform this task. Second, by requiring that a defendant move before the trial starts or a guilty plea is entered, &#167; 3162(a)(2) both limits the effects of a dismissal without prejudice (by ensuring that an expensive and time-consuming trial will not be mooted by a late-filed motion under the Act) and prevents undue defense gamesmanship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1986-87 (footnote omitted). Each of these purposes would be undercut if the motion requirement of &#167; 3162(a)(2) were read not to apply to the speedy indictment provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To accept defendant's argument would lead to an unwarranted difference in the treatment of speedy indictment and speedy trial claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Such a result would be inconsistent with the treatment of periods of excludable delay in &#167; 3161(h), which expressly applies to both speedy indictment and speedy trial calculations. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h) (\"The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which an information or an indictment must be filed, or in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant does not dispute that if his claim had been a seventy-day speedy trial claim, and not a thirty-day speedy indictment claim, his claim would have been waived if he had not made a motion to dismiss before trial. <i>See United States v. Huguenin,</i> 950 F.2d 23, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1991); <i>United States v. McKinnell,</i> 888 F.2d 669, 676 (10th Cir.1989), <i>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Wacker,</i> 72 F.3d 1453 (10th Cir.1995). The fact that this is a speedy indictment claim does not change the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the final sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2) requires us to hold that Spagnuolo has waived any speedy indictment claim. That sentence imposes two conditions. A defendant waives his claim if (a) he has not moved for dismissal, and (b) he has not done so before trial or before he enters a guilty plea. Spagnuolo did not meet these requirements. His belated oral request to tack on an additional speedy indictment claim was not a motion within either the meaning of the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2), or the local rule, D. Mass. R. 7.1, nor was it filed within the time required by the pretrial order. Pointing to the timely motion requirements of the last sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2), this court has said, \"While . . . the appropriate response to a Speedy Trial Act infraction is dismissal of the indictment, the remedy is not self-executing. . . .\" <i>United States v. Connor,</i> 926 F.2d 81, 83 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the statute itself limits the waiver rights under &#167; 3162(a)(2). For example, &#167; 3162(a)(2) does not permit prospective waivers, since such waivers would undercut the statute's purposes. <i>Zedner,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1987. The situation here, however, does not give rise to a <i>Zedner</i> issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the statute imposes no requirement that the waiver be knowing and voluntary, and we decline to read such a requirement into the statutory language. As noted in <i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 67 F.3d 1515 (10th Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[J]ust as the Act provides a remedy for violation of its speedy trial mandate, so too it unequivocally provides that the failure of a defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial constitutes a waiver of any right to that remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1520.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Spagnuolo does not have the benefit of \"plain error\" review, since the STA states that the statutory right is waived and there is no issue of constitutional dimension. <i>See id.</i> at 1521. Under these circumstances, a defendant who fails to make a timely motion to dismiss based on a speedy indictment claim does not obtain the benefit of plain error review. \"Deviation from a legal rule is `error' unless the rule has been waived.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Where there is waiver, there can be no error. <i>Gomez,</i> 67 F.3d at 1520.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spagnuolo's conviction is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We do not suggest that the district court may not raise the issue sua sponte and resolve it after notice and opportunity to be heard</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court found that there were nineteen non-excludable days between December 21 and January 8, and forty-one non-excludable days between January 10 and February 19, for a total of sixty non-excludable days between December 7, the date Spagnuolo was taken into federal custody, and February 27, the date of his indictment.

These questions arise because the text of the sanction provision for speedy <i>indictment</i> claims, &#167; 3162(a)(1), does not explicitly require the defendant to file a motion, whereas the sanction provision for speedy <i>trial</i> claims, &#167; 3162(a)(2), does require the defendant to file a motion. We hold that the STA, read as a whole, imposes no obligation on the district court to raise speedy indictment claims in the absence of a motion by the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We also hold that a defendant who fails to file a timely motion as required by the last sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2) waives such claims as a matter of statutory command.

He was sentenced to thirty-three months of imprisonment to be followed by seventy-two months of supervised release. He also was fined $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge was based on drugs found on Spagnuolo during a search incident to his arrest on September 29, 2001 for selling an Oxycontin pill outside a restaurant in Quincy, Massachusetts. During the search, police found two plastic bags of cocaine (consistent with street level drug distribution), three Oxycontin pills, and approximately $200 in cash. In a later search of Spagnuolo's apartment conducted pursuant to a search warrant, police found more drugs, cutting agents, drug paraphernalia, approximately $20,000 in cash, and a Colt .45 caliber pistol with magazines and bullets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spagnuolo was transferred from state to federal custody on December 7, 2001, on which date he made his initial appearance before a magistrate judge. The government moved that the detention hearing be continued for ten days, and the court continued the hearing until December 20, 2001. On December 20, 2001, Spagnuolo moved to continue the detention hearing generally and did not request a rescheduling date; the court allowed the motion that same day. On January 9, 2002, the parties filed a joint motion to continue and to extend the indictment deadline. The magistrate judge ruled that she was unable to extend the indictment deadline and indicated that the motion should be placed on the emergency business docket of the court. For some reason, that was not done, and so the joint motion to extend the indictment deadline was not ruled on. On February 20, 2002, the government moved for a status conference on the issue of Spagnuolo's detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 27, 2002, Spagnuolo was indicted on four counts &#8212; possession with intent to distribute and distribution of Oxycontin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (Count 1); possession with intent to distribute Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (Count 2); being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (Count 3); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 4). He was arraigned on March 15, 2002. On March 20, 2002, Spagnuolo, through his counsel, assented to detention without a hearing, and the court entered an order that day detaining him pending trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 28, 2002, during a pretrial conference, Spagnuolo notified the district court of his intention to file a motion to dismiss based on violations of the STA. The court set a filing deadline of November 8, 2002 for defendant's motions to dismiss. On November 7, 2002, Spagnuolo mailed to the clerk a motion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment for violation of the speedy indictment provisions of the STA; the motion was filed on November 12, 2002. The motion included no request to dismiss either Count 2 or Count 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a pretrial conference and motions hearing on March 12, 2003, the district court advised the parties that Spagnuolo's motion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 for violation of the STA remained under advisement. Spagnuolo, who was acting pro se with standby counsel (contrary to the advice of the court), requested, \"[I]f it's not too late, add the other drug charge on with that into that motion, incorporate it into that.\" The district court declined to do so, saying it had given Spagnuolo more opportunity than other criminal defendants to submit filings to the court. The court, referring to the STA motion on Counts 1 and 3 which had been filed, said, \"[T]he short of it is I have before me a particular motion. I'm going to act on the particular motion.\" Spagnuolo concedes that he never filed a written motion regarding Count 2, and he does not argue that the oral attempt to add Count 2 to the earlier motion complied with the scheduling deadlines and orders set by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just before jury empanelment, the trial court dismissed Counts 1 and 3 on defendant's motion to dismiss for violation of the STA on lack-of-speedy-indictment grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The court reserved judgment as to whether the dismissal of those two counts would be with or without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spagnuolo proceeded to trial on the remaining Count 2 and Count 4. The jury found defendant guilty on both counts. After trial, the district court granted defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) for judgment of acquittal as to Count 4 for insufficiency of the evidence, but denied the motion for judgment of acquittal as to Count 2. Later, in light of the conviction and sentence on Count 2, the government agreed to an order dismissing Counts 1 and 3 with prejudice. On appeal, Spagnuolo argues that the district court should have dismissed Count 2 on speedy indictment grounds. We reject this argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The STA was amended in 1979 to provide for two, rather than three, periods of time to be counted. <i>See</i> Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, Pub.L.

Literally read, he argues, the Act only requires a motion from the defendant when the government fails to bring defendant to trial within seventy days of indictment, in violation of &#167; 3161(c)(1). Spagnuolo argues that Congress placed no such burden on a defendant to file a motion if the government fails to indict within thirty days of arrest, in violation of &#167; 3161(b), and the language says that \"such charge . . . shall be dismissed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that Spagnuolo has ignored the significance of the last sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2), which provides that \"[f]ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this <i>section</i>\" (emphasis added).

Accordingly, Congress must have been referring to all of &#167; 3162 because it would have used the phrase \"under this paragraph\" if it had intended to restrict the motion and waiver provision to &#167; 3162(a)(2). <i>See id.</i> at 60-61 (noting that the House and Senate manuals on legislative drafting both endorse the use of \"subsection\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(a),\" \"paragraph\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(1),\" \"subparagraph\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(A),\" and \"clause\" for subdivisions beginning with \"(i)\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the normal rules of statutory construction leads us to conclude that the motion and waiver provision of &#167; 3162(a)(2) also applies to &#167; 3162(a)(1) speedy indictment claims, because \"section\" must refer to all of &#167; 3162, and not just to the paragraph in &#167; 3162 where the motion and waiver provision was (improvidently) located. Other references in the STA confirm that the drafters of the Act followed the hierarchy prescribed by the House and Senate drafting manuals. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(d)(1), (d)(2), (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts of appeals also have applied the waiver provision of &#167; 3162(a)(2) to speedy indictment claims under &#167;&#167; 3161(b) and 3162(a)(1). <i>See United States v.

The Act created incentives both for compliance by the government and for enforcement by defendants. It would be odd to use a different set of incentives for the two situations of speedy indictment and speedy trial. Under both, a defendant must move promptly, or waive his rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Zedner,</i> the Supreme Court interpreted &#167; 3162(a)(2) and stated that it \"serves two unrelated purposes\": First, &#167; 3162(a)(2) assigns the role of spotting violations of the Act to defendants &#8212; for the obvious reason that they have the greatest incentive to perform this task. Second, by requiring that a defendant move before the trial starts or a guilty plea is entered, &#167; 3162(a)(2) both limits the effects of a dismissal without prejudice (by ensuring that an expensive and time-consuming trial will not be mooted by a late-filed motion under the Act) and prevents undue defense gamesmanship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1986-87 (footnote omitted). Each of these purposes would be undercut if the motion requirement of &#167; 3162(a)(2) were read not to apply to the speedy indictment provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To accept defendant's argument would lead to an unwarranted difference in the treatment of speedy indictment and speedy trial claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Such a result would be inconsistent with the treatment of periods of excludable delay in &#167; 3161(h), which expressly applies to both speedy indictment and speedy trial calculations. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h) (\"The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which an information or an indictment must be filed, or in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence . . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant does not dispute that if his claim had been a seventy-day speedy trial claim, and not a thirty-day speedy indictment claim, his claim would have been waived if he had not made a motion to dismiss before trial. <i>See United States v. Huguenin,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1991); <i>United States v.

The fact that this is a speedy indictment claim does not change the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the final sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2) requires us to hold that Spagnuolo has waived any speedy indictment claim. That sentence imposes two conditions. A defendant waives his claim if (a) he has not moved for dismissal, and (b) he has not done so before trial or before he enters a guilty plea. Spagnuolo did not meet these requirements. His belated oral request to tack on an additional speedy indictment claim was not a motion within either the meaning of the statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2), or the local rule, D. Mass. R. 7.1, nor was it filed within the time required by the pretrial order. Pointing to the timely motion requirements of the last sentence of &#167; 3162(a)(2), this court has said, \"While . . . the appropriate response to a Speedy Trial Act infraction is dismissal of the indictment, the remedy is not self-executing. . . .\" <i>United States v. Connor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556395\"><a href=\"/opinion/556395/united-states-v-francis-connor-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the statute itself limits the waiver rights under &#167; 3162(a)(2). For example, &#167; 3162(a)(2) does not permit prospective waivers, since such waivers would undercut the statute's purposes. <i>Zedner,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 1987. The situation here, however, does not give rise to a <i>Zedner</i> issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the statute imposes no requirement that the waiver be knowing and voluntary, and we decline to read such a requirement into the statutory language. As noted in <i>United States v. Gomez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706030\"><a href=\"/opinion/706030/united-states-v-lupe-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[J]ust as the Act provides a remedy for violation of its speedy trial mandate, so too it unequivocally provides that the failure of a defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial constitutes a waiver of any right to that remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1520.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Spagnuolo does not have the benefit of \"plain error\" review, since the STA states that the statutory right is waived and there is no issue of constitutional dimension. <i>See id.</i> at 1521. Under these circumstances, a defendant who fails to make a timely motion to dismiss based on a speedy indictment claim does not obtain the benefit of plain error review. \"Deviation from a legal rule is `error' unless the rule has been waived.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
