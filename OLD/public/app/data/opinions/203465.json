Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                    Lipez, Merritt,* and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Scott A.

Defendant George Schussel was\n\nconvicted   after   a   thirteen-day   jury    trial   of   one   count   of\n\nconspiracy to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371 and two counts of tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. §\n\n7201.   He was sentenced to 60 months’ imprisonment on each count,\n\nto run concurrently.    He now appeals his conviction, raising three\n\nissues:   (1) whether documents turned over to the government from\n\nhis attorney’s files violate the attorney-client privilege; (2)\n\nwhether the refusal of the trial court to give certain requested\n\njury instructions violated Schussel’s right to a fair trial; and\n\n(3) whether sufficient evidence supports Schussel’s conviction for\n\nconspiracy.    Schussel does not appeal his sentence.              For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                I.   Facts\n\n     Defendant George Schussel is the founder of and was, at all\n\ntimes relevant to the charges herein, the principal shareholder of\n\nDigital   Consulting,   Inc.   (“DCI”),   a   Massachusetts   corporation\n\nengaged in the business of planning and conducting trade shows and\n\nconferences for businesses in the computer industry. DCI’s primary\n\nsource of revenue came from participants at DCI-organized events\n\nand from vendors at those events that bought booth space to display\n\nsoftware or other products.      Schussel was first the president and\n\nthen the CEO of DCI and he owned 95% of the stock.          Ronald Gomes,\n\nwho owned the other 5% of DCI stock,             succeeded Schussel as\n\n\n                                  - 2 -\n\fpresident of DCI.         Diane Reed was hired in 1985 as DCI’s accountant\n\nand   she   later    became      controller.       She    reported    primarily    to\n\nSchussel.\n\n      Schussel      also     was     the   owner   and    President     of    Digital\n\nConsulting International Limited (“DCIL”), a company established in\n\n1988 and operating in Hamilton, Bermuda, ostensibly to help DCI\n\nexpand its international business.                 DCIL, however, was a shell\n\ncompany that existed in name only; it did not exist as an actual\n\ncompany with employees or a building.               According to testimony of\n\nDiane Reed, DCI’s controller, from the late 1980s through 1995,\n\nSchussel directed her to divert money generated by DCI                         into a\n\nBermuda bank account held in the name of DCIL in order to avoid\n\npaying    taxes     on    DCI    income.     Schussel,     Schussel’s     wife,   and\n\nSchussel’s daughter, Stacy Griffin, were the authorized signatories\n\nof the Bermuda account.             The types of checks deposited into the\n\nBermuda account varied.            Sometimes customer checks were deposited\n\ndirectly into the Bermuda account, but, over time, Reed began\n\nsending     funds    to    the     Bermuda   account     from   various      operating\n\naccounts of DCI known as “user group” accounts.                    DCI used these\n\naccounts to handle incoming and outgoing funds associated with\n\nparticular events run by DCI. The separate accounts allowed DCI to\n\nkeep client and vendor funds separated from DCI funds.\n\n      Between 1988 and 1995, Schussel diverted over $12 million of\n\nDCI’s income to the Bermuda account, much of it from the “user\n\n\n                                           - 3 -\n\fgroup” accounts.    This was taxable income to DCI that was not\n\nreported to the IRS.    After being deposited in the DCIL Bermuda\n\naccount, most of the money was transferred by wire to accounts in\n\nthe United States at Fidelity Investments that were maintained and\n\ncontrolled by Schussel.   The rest of the money deposited in the\n\nBermuda account, about 5%, was transferred to Schussel’s business\n\npartner, Gomes.    By depositing money in the Bermuda account and\n\nthen transferring it to the Fidelity account, Schussel also avoided\n\npaying personal income tax.   Reed kept track of the funds diverted\n\nto the Bermuda account by noting the amount of each deposit made\n\nand the subsequent distribution to Schussel and Gomes.\n\n     In late 1991 and early 1992, the IRS conducted an audit of DCI\n\ncovering tax years 1986 to 1990.   When the IRS agent in charge of\n\nthe audit asked about two payments from DCI to DCIL, he was told\n\nthat the payments were commissions DCI owed to DCIL for foreign\n\nevents.   The agent was also given fabricated documents signed by\n\nSchussel and Gomes that referenced each payment as being made for\n\nservices DCIL purportedly performed for DCI.\n\n     Although tax adjustments were made for DCI for the years 1986\n\nto 1990, the agent took no further action.   In 1995, the IRS again\n\naudited DCI, this time for tax year 1993.       A different agent\n\nhandled the audit, and the existence of the Bermuda account was not\n\nraised by the agent or anyone at DCI.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\f     In the mid-1990s, discussions arose about selling DCI.                  A\n\nconcern arose that DCI would not be able to show its true value and\n\nprofitability to potential buyers because income actually earned by\n\nDCI was being diverted to the DCIL Bermuda account.               Two sets of\n\nnumbers existed in DCI’s books – one set reflected DCI’s true\n\nincome and the other set reflected the income reported by DCI to\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service.     In early 1996, it was decided that\n\nmoney would no longer be diverted to the Bermuda account so that\n\nthe company could be sold for its “true” value.             Tax year 1995,\n\ntherefore, was the last year that the corporate return omitted\n\nincome DCI had diverted to Bermuda.        The Bermuda account was not\n\nclosed until 1997, but Schussel reported on his 1996 personal\n\nreturn that he did not control any foreign bank accounts.\n\n     In early 1997, Gomes and Schussel met with attorney Kenneth\n\nGlusman regarding the sale of DCI.        At an evidentiary hearing to\n\nconsider   admission   into   evidence    of   various      attorney-client\n\ncommunications,   attorney    Glusman    testified   that    at    his   first\n\nmeeting with Schussel and Gomes, the men told him about the shell\n\ncompany DCIL and the Bermuda account to which money had been\n\ndiverted, including the fact that DCI had not been reporting all of\n\nits taxable income to the IRS for a number of years.           Glusman, who\n\ndid not have experience with criminal tax matters, testified that\n\nhis main concern at that point was not Schussel’s and Gomes’\n\nliability for not paying taxes, but the fact that anyone who\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fpurchased DCI would be buying a company with a potentially large\n\nliability for unpaid taxes.\n\n     Also occurring in 1997 was the decision among Schussel, Gomes,\n\nDiane Reed (the controller of DCI), Schussel’s daughter, Stacey\n\nGriffin, and her husband, Michael, both DCI employees, to destroy\n\ncertain DCI records.   Specifically, Michael Griffin recommended a\n\nplan to delete and alter DCI’s computerized accounting records so\n\nthat if an audit were to occur, revenue information in the computer\n\nwould match the revenue information in the 1995 corporate tax\n\nreturn.   The discussion stemmed from concern that potential buyers\n\nmight discover the discrepancies in DCI’s records due to the\n\ndeposits of money into the Bermuda account.       Records in DCI’s\n\ncomputer database showed that DCI’s income receipts did not match\n\nDCI’s corporate bank account due to the monies that had been\n\ntransferred to the Bermuda account.       Gomes testified that the\n\nrecord destruction plan was referred to as “Project Phoenix” and\n\nthe project’s goal was to alter DCI’s electronic database to ensure\n\nthat the information in the database matched income reported in\n\nDCI’s corporate tax returns.1   In July 1997, at Gomes’ direction,\n\nReed prepared a list of documents to “Keep or Lose” in case of an\n\nIRS audit or a sale.   An “All Staff Memo” dated July 29, 1997, from\n\nthe “Archiving Committee” directed the destruction of records as\n\n\n     1\n     Information and records relating to the Bermuda account of\nDCIL were not maintained in the DCI database and were not\ndestroyed.\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fpart of a “routine” clean up.              Reed questioned Gomes about this\n\nmemo and he told her he wanted to make sure all the documents were\n\n“purged.”\n\n         DCI learned in September 1997 that it would undergo an IRS\n\naudit of its 1995 tax return.          On October 27, 1997, Reed, Schussel\n\nand Paul Law, DCI’s accountant, met with Kelly McGovern, an IRS\n\nagent.2        Prior to the October meeting, Reed had collected all of\n\nthe documentation requested by McGovern, other than documents\n\npertaining to DCIL and the Bermuda account.               The over $4 million\n\ndiverted to the Bermuda account in 1995 was therefore not disclosed\n\nto the IRS agent.         Concern arose at DCI, however, when, during the\n\ninvestigation, McGovern found a refund check issued to a vendor\n\nwritten from a “user group” account, the separate accounts DCI used\n\nto handle the funds for certain specific events.             The refund check\n\nhad come from the general DCI account because that particular “user\n\ngroup” account had been closed. This led McGovern to inquire about\n\nthe separate accounts of “user groups.”            DCI became concerned that\n\nif   a       thorough   examination   of   each   “user   group”   account   was\n\nconducted, it would be discovered that money from these accounts\n\nhad been transferred to the Bermuda account.\n\n         McGovern’s discovery of the “user group” accounts led to\n\nanother meeting in November 1998 with Schussel, Schussel’s wife,\n\n\n\n         2\n     IRS Agent McGovern is referred to in various places in the\nrecord and briefs as Kelly Jordan, her married name.\n\n                                      - 7 -\n\fGomes and his wife, Stacey and Michael Griffin, Reed and Glusman,\n\nthe attorney. Reed testified that Glusman was told at that meeting\n\nthat monies from the user group accounts had been transferred to\n\nthe Bermuda account.           Glusman then left the meeting and further\n\ndiscussion took place regarding whether information in the DCI\n\ndatabase     could    be    destroyed     or   at   least   made    confusing    and\n\ndifficult for the IRS to understand.\n\n       Upon learning about the audit, attorney Glusman recommended to\n\nSchussel that he hire an attorney with experience in criminal tax\n\nmatters.      On     Glusman’s    recommendation,      Schussel      hired    Edward\n\nDeFranceschi to represent both Schussel and DCI in the 1997 audit.\n\nGomes and Schussel first met with DeFranceschi in November 1997 and\n\ntold him that income had been diverted from DCI to the Bermuda\n\naccount and had not been reported to the IRS.                     Glusman was also\n\npresent at the meeting.          Reed met with DeFranceschi and showed him\n\nthe user group documentation and checks that had been sent to the\n\nBermuda account.           She also showed him documentation that showed\n\nmoney being sent from DCI user groups to the Bermuda account and\n\nback    to   Schussel’s       Fidelity    account     in    the    United    States.\n\nDeFranceschi took over communicating with IRS agent McGovern and\n\nrecommended that no one from DCI communicate directly with the IRS.\n\nDeFranceschi relied mainly on Schussel for information disclosed to\n\nthe IRS. Reed was instructed by Schussel to provide information to\n\nDeFranceschi and Schussel as needed by DeFranceschi.\n\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\f     In February 1998, McGovern discovered more “user group” checks\n\nand inquired about the relationship between DCI, DCIL and Schussel.\n\nDeFranceschi provided her with a copy of a contract between DCI and\n\nDCIL dated September 1993, given to him by Schussel.                    The contract\n\nwas signed by “J. Cardullo” on behalf of DCIL and provided that DCI\n\nwould compensate DCIL for “services rendered.”                          DeFranceschi\n\nrepresented to McGovern that the contract had been in effect in\n\nvarious forms since 1988.       Gomes and Reed testified that they did\n\nnot see the contract at the time it was executed in 1993.                      Gomes\n\nsaid he first saw the contract in 1997 during the IRS audit.                   Reed,\n\nwho was responsible for maintaining all of DCI’s contracts in her\n\nposition as controller, testified that she did not see the contract\n\nuntil 2003, when it was shown to her by the government.                           John\n\nCardullo,   who   was   hired   by    DCI    in    1988    to    be     Director    of\n\nInternational     Operations,   testified         that    he    never    signed    the\n\ncontract, nor did he authorize anyone else to sign on his behalf.\n\nHe also testified that he had never conducted any business with\n\nDCIL or any other company in Bermuda while at DCI.                      In addition,\n\nCardullo left DCI before September 1993, the date he purportedly\n\nsigned the contract.\n\n     After receiving the contract between DCIL and DCI, IRS agent\n\nMcGovern requested certain documents from DeFranceschi concerning\n\nDCIL,   Schussel’s   relationship      with   DCIL       and    the     relationship\n\nbetween DCI and DCIL.     On March 4, 1998, Schussel faxed responses\n\n\n                                     - 9 -\n\fto some of the questions to DeFranceschi and provided a description\n\nof what had occurred concerning DCIL in the earlier audit in 1991\n\nand 1995.     Schussel asserted that he “had provided [the IRS] with\n\nthe complete file which I had in my possession at that time” and\n\nindicated that on both occasions the IRS had not                  found a problem\n\nwith    the   DCI-DCIL      connection.          Schussel    also    supplied       two\n\n“exhibits” to DeFranceschi that purported to document international\n\nevents for which DCI compensated DCIL.\n\n       DeFranceschi,       using    the   information       supplied   to     him    by\n\nSchussel, drafted a response to the IRS document request.                   He sent\n\nthe draft response to Schussel, who made notations on the draft\n\nthat indicate that he discussed the response with DeFranceschi. On\n\nMarch 12, 1998, DeFranceschi sent the letter to IRS agent McGovern.\n\nBased on the representations in this letter, IRS agent McGovern\n\nconcluded     that   DCI    and    DCIL   were    not   related     entities,   that\n\nSchussel had no control over DCIL, and that the business conducted\n\nby DCIL was outside the scope of her audit of DCI.                     Glusman and\n\nReed testified that McGovern never asked to see the actual records\n\nof DCIL.      Pursuant to a letter dated May 6, 1998, the audit was\n\nconcluded     with   the    IRS    making    certain     adjustments     to     DCI’s\n\ncorporate return for 1995. None of these adjustments reflected the\n\nDCI income that Schussel had diverted to the Bermuda account.\n\n       After the 1997 audit concluded, Gomes and Schussel discussed\n\namending their personal tax returns for 1995 to reflect income that\n\n\n                                      - 10 -\n\fhad not been disclosed at the time.                        At Schussel’s request,\n\ncontroller Reed provided to attorney DeFranceschi documentation\n\nregarding the Bermuda account, as well as documentation concerning\n\nSchussel’s Fidelity account, so that DeFranceschi could prepare an\n\namended return for Schussel.                  Although an amended return was\n\nprepared by DeFranceschi, it was never filed based on advice from\n\nDeFranceschi.\n\n      In October 2001, Darlene Flint, who had worked as Gomes’\n\nsecretary for 18 years, walked into the IRS office in Stoneham,\n\nMassachusetts, with a box of DCI records that included the Bermuda\n\naccount    records.             This       disclosure       triggered     a     criminal\n\ninvestigation of DCI and its employees.                   Reed and Gomes cooperated\n\nin the investigation and provided information implicating Schussel\n\nin both the diversion of taxable income and obstruction of IRS\n\naudits.    In addition to the DCI employees, attorney DeFranceschi’s\n\nconduct was also questioned by the federal prosecutor.                                 Upon\n\nlearning   that     he    was    a    subject       and   potential    target     of   the\n\ninvestigation, DeFranceschi hired his own attorney, Elliot Lobel,\n\nwho   contacted     the    federal         prosecutor     and   offered    to     provide\n\nevidence    that    DeFranceschi            did     not   knowingly     provide    false\n\ninformation    to    the    IRS       or    obstruct      the   1998   audit.      Lobel\n\ndetermined that the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct\n\nallowed    DeFranceschi          to        reveal     attorney-client         privileged\n\ninformation to the extent necessary to defend himself from criminal\n\n\n                                           - 11 -\n\fcharges.      Lobel allowed DeFranceschi to make a statement pursuant\n\nto   a    proffer   letter   with    the    government.      In   the   proffer,\n\nDeFranceschi stated that Schussel had provided him with all the\n\ninformation and material provided to the IRS.             The prosecutor told\n\nLobel that the government would require documentary evidence to\n\nprove      that   DeFranceschi      had    not   knowingly   participated     in\n\nSchussel’s illegal scheme.           Lobel produced a limited number of\n\ndocuments deemed necessary to prove DeFranceschi’s innocence, along\n\nwith an affidavit by DeFranceschi.           DeFranceschi did not turn over\n\nhis entire Schussel file to the government. The government decided\n\nnot to indict DeFranceschi.\n\n         On February 26, 2004, a federal grand jury returned a three-\n\ncount indictment against Schussel, charging him with conspiring\n\nwith unnamed others, known and unknown, to defraud the United\n\nStates in the collection of income taxes in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371 (Count I), and two counts of tax evasion in violation of 26\n\nU.S.C. § 7201.       Specifically, the tax evasion counts allege that\n\nSchussel made false statements to a revenue agent of the Internal\n\nRevenue Service and filed a false and fraudulent corporate income\n\ntax return (Count II) and individual tax return (Count III).                The\n\nindictment charged that the offense conduct in the conspiracy in\n\nCount I began in or about January 1988 and extended through May\n\n1998.      The offense conduct in Counts II and III occurred in March\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 12 -\n\f1998 during an audit of Schussel’s individual and corporate tax\n\nreturns for 1995.\n\n     The indictment charged that Schussel and others “intentionally\n\nand willfully caused the filing of false and fraudulent Corporate\n\nU.S. Income Tax Returns to be filed with the IRS for the purpose of\n\nevading and defeating income tax due and owing for several years.”\n\nIndictment at ¶ 32.   The indictment also specifically stated that\n\nSchussel and others had failed to disclose DCI income which had\n\nbeen diverted to DCIL’s bank account in Bermuda in the amount of\n\n$8.5 million from 1993 through 1995.        The indictment also charged\n\nthat Schussel and others “for purposes of preventing discovery of\n\nDCI’s unreported income, endeavored to impede and obstruct an audit\n\nconducted by the IRS of DCI’s 1995 Corporate U.S. Income Tax\n\nReturn.”    Indictment   at   ¶   34.      The   overt   acts   charged   in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy included Schussel’s hiring of a tax\n\nattorney in 1997 to represent him during the audit and his use of\n\nthe attorney “to impede and obstruct the audit.”          Indictment at ¶\n\n40 (ee).   At issue on appeal are the following overt acts charged\n\nin the indictment:\n\n     gg. On or about March 11, 1998, Schussel caused the tax\n     attorney who was acting on his behalf, to send a letter\n     to the revenue agent, which letter falsely stated, among\n     other things, that Schussel was not an officer of DCIL\n     and falsely represented that payments made by DCI to DCIL\n     were pursuant to the contract purportedly executed\n     between DCI and DCIL in September 1993.\n\n     hh. On or about May 6, 1998, Schussel signed IRS Form\n     CG-4549, acknowledging and agreeing to income tax\n\n                                  - 13 -\n\f     examination changes that the revenue agent had made to\n     DCI’s 1995 Corporate U.S. Income tax Return which showed\n     that $18,859.00 was additional income tax due for DCI’s\n     1995 calendar year. As Schussel well knew, this amount\n     was, in fact, substantially less than the true amount due\n     to the IRS because Schussel had concealed DCI’s true\n     income from 1995 from the revenue agent during the course\n     of the audit.\n\nIndictment at ¶ 40 (gg, hh).\n\n     Count II of the indictment charged that on March 11, 1998,\n\nSchussel did “willfully attempt to evade and defeat” part of the\n\nfederal income tax owed by DCI by “making and causing to be made”\n\nfalse statements to an IRS agent in order to mislead and impede an\n\naudit examination of DCI’s 1995 corporate income tax return, and by\n\n“filing    and   causing    to   be   filed”   with   the   IRS   a   false   and\n\nfraudulent income tax return underreporting DCI’s taxable income\n\nfor 1995.      Indictment at ¶ 91.     Count III charged that on or about\n\nMarch 11, 1998, Schussel willfully attempted to evade and defeat\n\npart of the personal income tax owed by him by “making and causing\n\nto be made false statements” to the revenue agent in order to\n\nmislead and impede the audit of DCI’s 1995 corporate income tax\n\nreturn, and by “filing and causing to be filed” with the IRS a\n\nfalse and fraudulent individual income tax return by underreporting\n\nhis taxable income for 1995.          Indictment at ¶ 93.\n\n     Before trial, Schussel moved to suppress documents on the\n\nbasis     of   various     privileges,    including    the    attorney-client\n\nprivilege, the corporate attorney-client privilege and the joint\n\ndefense/common interest privilege.             An evidentiary hearing was\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\fheld in May 2005 before Magistrate Judge Alexander.                 Reed, Gomes,\n\nSchussel’s attorneys Glusman and DeFranceschi and others testified.\n\nThe magistrate judge found that of the thirteen documents at issue\n\nthree were privileged and the government was prevented from using\n\nthem at trial.      The other ten were either not privileged or the\n\nprivilege was vitiated under an exception, such as the crime-fraud\n\nexception or third-party disclosure rule.            Of the six documents at\n\nissue in this appeal, the Magistrate Judge held that two (Exs. 65\n\nand 73) were not privileged under the third-party disclosure rule\n\nand   one   (Ex.   67)   was   not   privileged      because   it    was   not   a\n\nconfidential communication.          Three documents (Exs. 66, 68 and 71)\n\nlost their privilege under the crime-fraud exception. See Findings\n\nand Recommendation on Motion to Suppress Government’s Use and\n\nAcquisition of Privileged Materials and for Other Appropriate\n\nRelief, August 25, 2005.       Over Schussel’s objection, the district\n\ncourt adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Findings and Recommendation.\n\n                               II.     Analysis\n\n      Schussel     raises   three    main   issues    on   appeal:      (1)    the\n\nattorney-client     relationship      was   violated   when    documents      sent\n\nbetween Schussel and his lawyer were introduced into evidence at\n\ntrial; (2) the district court erred in refusing to give certain\n\njury instructions requested by Schussel pertaining to the tax\n\nevasion counts; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support\n\nthe conspiracy conviction.\n\n\n                                     - 15 -\n\fA.   Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n     The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is “to encourage\n\nfull and frank communication between attorneys and their clients .\n\n. . .”   Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).     The\n\nprivilege is not absolute, however, and does not extend to all\n\ncommunications between an attorney and client.           The privilege\n\nprotects “only those communications that are confidential and are\n\nmade for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice.”        In re\n\nKeeper of Records (Grand Jury Subpoena Addressed to XYZ Corp.), 348\n\nF.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 2003).       The First Circuit has adopted the\n\nfollowing definition of the attorney client privilege:\n\n     (1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a\n     professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3)\n     the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in\n     confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance\n     permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or\n     by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be\n     waived.\n\nUnited States v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.. 129 F.3d 681, 684 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (quoting 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2292, at 554 (McNaughton\n\nrev. 1961)).   The burden of proving an applicable privilege lies\n\nwith the party claiming the privilege.      The party must demonstrate\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence not only that the privilege\n\napplies, but that it has not been waived or that exceptions do not\n\napply.   FDIC v. Ogden Corp., 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n     Following his indictment, Schussel filed a motion to suppress\n\nthirteen    documents   supplied    by    his   tax   attorney,   Edward\n\n\n                                 - 16 -\n\fDeFranceschi, to the government, claiming they were privileged and\n\nconfidential        pursuant    to   attorney-client   privilege.3    Of   the\n\nthirteen documents, the district court found three to be protected\n\nby the attorney-client privilege.           Of the remaining ten documents\n\nat issue, the district court found most of them not to be protected\n\nunder the attorney-client privilege either because they were not\n\nconfidential due to their content or due to the fact that they were\n\nintended to be disclosed to a third-party.             Three documents that\n\nwere found to be confidential had the attorney-client privilege\n\nvitiated      due    to   the   “crime-fraud    exception,”   which   exempts\n\nprivileged documents from protection if the client seeks advice\n\nfrom a lawyer that will serve him in the commission of a crime or\n\nfraud.      Only six of the documents are at issue on appeal; all six\n\ndocuments came from the files of Ed DeFranceschi, Schussel’s\n\nattorney at the time of an IRS audit in 1998.\n\n       The six documents at issue on appeal are:\n\nExhibit 65:         A fax dated 2/16/98 from Schussel to DeFranceschi\n\ntelling DeFranceschi that the information in a 2/13/98 letter sent\n\nto the IRS by DeFranceschi is incorrect and should be corrected to\n\nsay:       “I am advised that the transactions for 1988 through 1991\n\nwere reviewed in 1993 as part of the IRS audit for the years 1987-\n\n1991.”      As the district court ruled, this document was properly\n\n\n       3\n     Schussel also moved to suppress documents provided to the\ngovernment by Gomes and Flint.     The court’s rulings on those\ndocuments are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                       - 17 -\n\fadmitted under the third-party disclosure rule because Schussel\n\nintended, and indeed directed, that DeFranceschi disclose the\n\ninformation to a third-party – the IRS.\n\nExhibit 66:   A fax dated 3/4/98 from Schussel to DeFranceschi with\n\ndraft responses to questions 1-3 of a document request from the\n\nIRS.   This document was admitted under the “crime-fraud exception”\n\nto the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExhibit 67:      A fax dated 3/6/98 from Schussel to DeFranceschi\n\nrequesting that DeFranceschi ask the IRS agent when Schussel can\n\n“take down” the data room at Schussel’s offices that was set up for\n\nthe IRS examination. The district court found this document not to\n\nbe a confidential communication and therefore not privileged.\n\nExhibit 68:   Draft of letter dated 3/11/98 to be sent to IRS agent\n\nconcerning Document request #4.    This document was admitted under\n\nthe “crime-fraud exception” to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExhibit    71:    Fax from Schussel to DeFranceschi dated 3/12/98\n\nreminding DeFranceschi that the auditor who performed the 1993\n\naudit had some questions about a cash transaction involving one of\n\nDCI’s user groups and the questions were answered to the agent’s\n\nsatisfaction at that time.     This document was admitted under the\n\n“crime-fraud exception” to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExhibit 73:      Fax from Schussel to DeFranceschi dated 4/24/98\n\nalerting DeFranceschi to a package of tax forms, schedules and\n\nother material    DeFranceschi will be receiving from Schussel under\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fseparate cover.      This document was admitted under the third-party\n\ndisclosure    rule    because   Schussel   intended   that   DeFranceschi\n\ndisclose the information to a third-party – the IRS.\n\n1.   Waiver\n\n     The government first argues that Schussel waived the privilege\n\nas to all six documents     because in the trial court Schussel made\n\nselective use of the documents as part of an advice-of-counsel\n\ndefense – sometimes wanting to use them in his defense and other\n\ntimes wanting to withhold them on the ground of attorney-client\n\nprivilege.    The government argues that once Schussel put any\n\ncommunications with DeFranceschi in evidence pursuant to an advice-\n\nof-counsel defense, he waived the attorney-client privilege as to\n\nall communications with DeFranceschi.       However, the district court\n\ndid not admit the documents on the basis of waiver and, because a\n\ndetermination of waiver often requires a detailed factual analysis,\n\nwe decline to make such a finding in this appeal.\n\n2.   Contents Not Privileged\n\n     Exhibit 67 is a fax dated March 6, 1998, from Schussel to\n\nDeFranceschi requesting that DeFranceschi ask the IRS agent when\n\nSchussel can dismantle a data and records room at Schussel’s offices\n\nthat was set up for the IRS examination.      Because the communication\n\ndid not seek or give legal advice, the district court found this\n\ndocument not to be a confidential communication and therefore not\n\nprivileged.   This finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                  - 19 -\n\f3.   The Crime-Fraud Exception to the Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n     Under   the   “crime-fraud     exception,”    the    attorney-client\n\nprivilege does not apply when a client seeks advice from a lawyer\n\nthat will serve him in the commission of a crime or fraud.          Clark\n\nv. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 15 (1933); accord In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings, 417 F.3d 18,22 (1st Cir. 2005);             United States v.\n\nReeder, 170 F.3d 93, 106 (1st Cir. 1999).         The exception applies\n\nwhere there is a “reasonable basis to believe that the lawyer’s\n\nservices were used by the client to foster a crime or fraud.”          In\n\nre Grand Jury Proceedings, 417 F.3d at 23.        The exception applies\n\nbased on the client’s intent, not the lawyer’s.          In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings (Violette), 183 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir. 1999).              The\n\nexception applies, therefore, regardless of whether the attorney was\n\nan innocent or willing accomplice.         To “successfully invoke the\n\ncrime-fraud exception, the government must make a prima facie\n\nshowing that the attorney’s assistance was sought in furtherance of\n\na crime or fraud.”   Reeder, 170 F.3d at 106.       The government must\n\nshow: (1) that the client was engaged in (or was planning) criminal\n\nor fraudulent activity when the attorney-client communications took\n\nplace; and (2) that the communications were intended by the client\n\nto facilitate or conceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.          In\n\nre Grand Jury Proceeding, 183 F.3d at 75.         The district co urt\n\nfound that the exception applied to Exhibits 66, 68 and 71, all\n\nthree of which were faxes or drafts sent to DeFranceschi by Schussel\n\n\n                                  - 20 -\n\fin March 1998 when DeFranceschi was trying to gather information\n\nfrom Schussel and DCI to respond to IRS inquiries or document\n\nrequests.       The district court correctly applied the exception\n\nbecause in each of the three documents Schussel was providing\n\nincorrect information to DeFranceschi to be used in responses to\n\ndocument requests and other exchanges with the IRS in an effort to\n\ndeceive the IRS about the true nature of Schussel’s relationship\n\nwith DCIL.\n\n     Schussel’s attempts to characterize these communications as\n\nsimply soliciting legal advice from DeFranceschi belies their\n\ncontent   and    Schussel’s   intent   in   relaying   the   information   to\n\nDeFranceschi. The three documents were clearly sent to DeFranceschi\n\nby Schussel so that Schussel and DCI could continue to evade the\n\ntaxes they owed.       In Exhibit 66, the March 4, 1998, fax from\n\nSchussel to DeFranceschi, Schussel provided false information to\n\nDeFranceschi about the business relationship between DCI and DCIL\n\nby stating that DCIL had performed services for DCI and received\n\ncompensation.     In Exhibit 68, the March 12, 1998, draft letter to\n\nthe IRS from DeFranceschi on behalf of Schussel and DCI, Schussel\n\nprovided false information about the contract between DCI and DCIL.\n\nAs to Exhibit 71, the March 12, 1998, fax to DeFranceschi from\n\nSchussel, Schussel reported to DeFranceschi that in the earlier 1995\n\naudit, the IRS had questioned a cash payment to a user group\n\naccount. Schussel intended for DeFranceschi to use this information\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\fto mislead the IRS into believing that the user group accounts had\n\nalready been examined by the IRS during an earlier audit.\n\n     Schussel argues that the exception cannot apply because he had\n\nnot yet been found guilty of any wrongdoing.          The crime-fraud\n\nexception may apply, however, even if the client is ultimately found\n\nnot to be guilty.   By necessity, the assessment of documents during\n\na legal proceeding is generally preliminary and does not reflect a\n\nfinding that a client acted wrongfully. The required level of proof\n\nto pierce the privilege under the crime-fraud exception is limited\n\nto the issue of whether reasonable cause adequate to pierce the\n\nprivilege exists.    In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 417 F.3d at 22.\n\nBoth the district court and the magistrate judge held hearings where\n\nfindings were made that a sufficient factual predicate existed to\n\npierce the privilege as to these documents.      The district court’s\n\nadmission of Exhibits 66, 68 and 71 under the crime-fraud exception\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n     Schussel also argues that even if the crime-fraud exception\n\napplied, the documents should be suppressed and his conviction\n\nreversed as a sanction against the government for violating his due\n\nprocess rights when it “induced” DeFranceschi to turn over certain\n\ndocuments without notifying Schussel first.      This argument is also\n\nwithout   merit.    Attorneys   may   disclose   confidential   client\n\ninformation to the extent the attorney reasonably believes such\n\ndisclosure is necessary to defend himself against a charge of\n\n\n                                - 22 -\n\fcriminal wrongdoing.        See Mass. Rules of Prof’l Conduct 1.6(b)(2)\n\n(a lawyer may reveal confidential information “to the extent the\n\nlawyer reasonably believes necessary           . . . to establish a defense\n\nto a criminal charge . . . against the lawyer based on conduct in\n\nwhich the client was involved”).          Moreover, an attorney need not\n\nwait to be indicted before making such disclosures.                 Id. cmt. 18\n\n(“Paragraph (b)(2) does not require the lawyer to await commencement\n\nof an action or proceeding that charges such complicity [with the\n\nclient], so that the defense may be established by responding\n\ndirectly to a third party who has made such an assertion.”); United\n\nStates v. Weger, 709 F.2d 1151, 1156-57 (7th Cir. 1983) (permitting\n\na law firm to disclose privileged information before formal charges\n\nfiled to avoid stigma of indictment).\n\n     Under    the     Massachusetts    Rules    of     Professional     Conduct,\n\ntherefore, and general legal principles aimed at preserving client\n\nconfidentiality to the fullest extent possible, DeFranceschi was\n\npermitted to make a limited disclosure of information to the\n\ngovernment to defend himself from indictment.                 Once the United\n\nStates notified DeFranceschi’s attorney that DeFranceschi was a\n\npotential    target    of   the   investigation      into   DCI   and   Schussel,\n\nDeFranceschi became entitled immediately to disclose information\n\nshowing that he should not be charged.\n\n     Citing to United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554 (1989), Schussel\n\nclaims he had a due process right to be notified by either the\n\n\n                                     - 23 -\n\fgovernment or DeFranceschi before DeFranceschi made the disclosure\n\nto the government.        Schussel’s reliance on Zolin is misplaced.\n\nZolin held only that a court may receive contested documents for in\n\ncamera inspection to assess whether the crime-fraud exception\n\napplies.      It makes no requirement that an attorney give advance\n\nnotice   to    the   client   about    his   intention    to     disclose   client\n\ndocuments to a third party in order to defend himself from criminal\n\ncharges.      While we are mindful of Schussel’s argument that notice\n\nis required due to the potential manipulation of an attorney by an\n\noverzealous     or   unethical   prosecutor         accusing   the   attorney   of\n\ncriminal wrongdoing in order to get access to documents that might\n\nbe helpful in building a case against the client, Schussel has cited\n\nno evidence that such was the case here.\n\n     Finally, to the extent there was any error in admitting the\n\nthree documents under the crime-fraud exception, the error was\n\nharmless.       Other   evidence      at   trial,    including    non-privileged\n\ndocuments and testimony by witnesses, including employees of DCI,\n\nwas sufficient to show Schussel’s guilt. Such evidence included the\n\nfalse contract given by Schussel to DeFranceschi, knowing it would\n\nbe turned over to the IRS.            Evidence was also introduced showing\n\nthat after each of the audits, Schussel had signed off on the\n\nadjustments to his and DCI’s taxes recommended by the IRS knowing\n\nthat the income diverted to the Bermuda account was not included in\n\nthe adjustments.        This evidence and the testimony by numerous\n\n\n                                      - 24 -\n\fwitnesses was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Schussel had\n\nthe necessary intent to mislead and deceive the IRS to support the\n\nconspiracy and tax evasion counts.\n\n4.   Third-Party Disclosure\n\n     The third-party disclosure exception supports the principle\n\nthat the attorney-client privilege does not attach to communications\n\nbetween attorney and client when they have been disclosed to a third\n\nparty or were created with the intention of being disclosed to a\n\nthird party.   “When information is transmitted to an attorney with\n\nthe intent that the information will be transmitted to a third-party\n\n. . ., such information is not confidential.”      United States v.\n\nLawless, 709 F.2d 485, 487 (7th Cir. 1983) (finding waiver of\n\nattorney-client privilege where information used to prepare tax\n\nreturn would be disclosed on the tax return itself).\n\n     Both Exhibits 65 and 73 contained information that Schussel\n\nsent to DeFranceschi with the intent that the information be turned\n\nover to the IRS.   Therefore, the documents are not privileged and\n\nno attorney-client confidentiality attaches to them.   Exhibit 65 is\n\na fax sent by Schussel to DeFranceschi in which Schussel provides\n\ninformation for DeFranceschi to give to IRS agent McGovern. Exhibit\n\n73 consists of drafts of amended tax returns for Schussel and Gomes.\n\nAs the information provided in both these documents was intended to\n\nbe disclosed to the IRS, it is not confidential.    Schussel argues\n\nthat Exhibit 73 is a working draft between attorney and client that\n\n\n                               - 25 -\n\fis therefore privileged. If a client transmits information “so that\n\nit might be used on a tax return, such transmission destroys any\n\nexpectation of confidentiality that might have otherwise existed.”\n\n     Lawless, 709 F.2d at 487.   The court below correctly ruled that\n\nthe documents are not privileged.\n\nB.    Jury Instructions\n\n       Schussel claims error as to several of the jury instructions.\n\nSchussel filed requests for specific jury instructions concerning\n\nwillfulness and the attorney-client relationship that were rejected\n\nby the district court as incorrect statements of the law.        Another\n\nrequested    instruction    sought   to   “supplement”   the   conspiracy\n\ninstruction to specifically inform the jury that DeFranceschi,\n\nSchussel’s tax attorney, was not part of the conspiracy.\n\n1.    Willfulness\n\n       Schussel claims it was error for the district court to reject\n\na request he made to instruct the jury on additions to the standard\n\nwillfulness instructions applicable to tax evasion charges under\n\nCheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991).4      The district court’s\n\n\n        4\n     Schussel requested several instructions on willfulness that\nwere rejected by the district court. Although we do not recite\neach of Schussel’s requested willfulness instructions herein, we\nreproduce several examples to demonstrate the nature of the\nrequested instructions:\n\n        Instruction No. 3\n        Willfulness\n\n        Defendant Schussel acted wilfully if the law imposed a\n        duty on him, he knew of that duty, and he voluntarily and\n\n                                 - 26 -\n\finstruction explicitly focused the jury on the requirement that\n\nSchussel have “the specific intent to disobey or disregard the law,”\n\nwhich satisfies the Cheek willfulness requirement.              Schussel’s\n\nrequested instruction changed the standard tax evasion instruction\n\nto instruct the jury that it could not find guilt unless it\n\nconcluded that Schussel knew he had a legal duty to reject his\n\nattorney’s advice, which was based on the misinformation that\n\nSchussel   had   supplied   to   him.     Specifically,   the    requested\n\n\n\n     intentionally violated that duty.    Thus, if defendant\n     Schussel acted in good faith, he cannot be guilty of\n     filing a false and fraudulent tax return, as charged in\n     Counts Two and three. This is a subjective standard; the\n     question is what defendant Schussel actually believed,\n     not what a reasonable person would have believed.\n     negligence, even gross negligence, is not enough to meet\n     the wilfulness [sic] requirement. . . .\n\n     Instruction 3(A)\n\n     Thus, you cannot convict defendant Schussel of the\n     offenses charged in Counts Two or Three unless the\n     government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew\n     that he had the duty to instruct his attorney Edward\n     DeFranceschi to make changes in the letter to the IRS\n     prepared by DeFranceschi dated march 11, 1998.\n\n. . .\n\n     Instruction 3(D)\n\n     . . .\n\n     You may not convict defendant Schussel of the offenses\n     charged in Counts Two or Three based upon the signing of\n     the May 6, 1998, letter unless you find beyond a\n     reasonable doubt that he knew he had a duty to reject his\n     attorney’s advice that he sing the may 6, 1998,\n     adjustment letter.\n\n                                 - 27 -\n\finstruction would have required Schussel to know he had a legal duty\n\nto tell DeFranceschi to change the March 11, 1998, letter sent to\n\nthe IRS and to reject DeFranceschi’s advice to sign the May 6, 1998,\n\ntax adjustment letter because they were based on false or misleading\n\ninformation. The requested instruction indicated, erroneously, that\n\nonce a client hires an attorney and makes certain disclosures to\n\nthat lawyer, the client cannot have acted “willfully” if the lawyer\n\npasses on false information to the IRS. This is an improper reading\n\nof the meaning of “willfulness” under the tax evasion statutes and\n\nthe district court properly rejected this proposed instruction.\n\n       In addition, Schussel’s requested “willfulness” instructions\n\nfocus too much on the lawyer’s duty to the client under ethical and\n\nprofessional responsibility rules instead of on the taxpayer’s\n\nconduct.    The tax evasion statute, and its standard “willfulness”\n\ninstruction, focuses solely on the taxpayer’s duty to pay the tax\n\nimposed and to not mislead the IRS about that amount.      They do not\n\nlook to the attorney’s conduct in representing the client.\n\n       Requested instructions are appropriate only if they correctly\n\nstate the law.    United States v. Buttrick, 432 F.3d 373, 376 (1st\n\nCir.   2005).    Schussel’s   requested   instruction   concerning   the\n\nattorney-client relationship as it        applies to the willfulness\n\nrequirement to prove a tax evasion charge was simply incorrect. The\n\ntax evasion statute at issue, 26 U.S.C. § 7201, prohibits willfully\n\nattempting in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed or\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\fpayment thereof. The relevant legal duty requires that the taxpayer\n\npay the required income tax and not mislead the IRS.                Schussel’s\n\nrequested instruction sought to add on a multitude of concepts from\n\nthe advice-of-counsel defense and attorney ethical rules.\n\n2.   Literal Truth Instruction\n\n      Schussel also claims error concerning the rejection by the\n\ndistrict court of Schussel’s proposed instruction telling the jury\n\nit could not consider as “false” any statement Schussel made\n\nresponding to the IRS if that statement were “literally” true – even\n\nif   the   statement   was   found   by   the   jury   to   be   incomplete   or\n\nmisleading.     The court below found that this instruction only\n\napplied to perjury cases and not to actions taken with the “intent\n\nto mislead or conceal” as stated in the tax evasion statutes.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 29 -\n\f     Schussel’s    requested   instruction5   informed   the   jury   that\n\nDeFranceschi had told the IRS the “literal truth” in answering its\n\ninquiries, such as informing the IRS that Schussel “is” not an\n\nofficer or employee of DCIL and that payments made to DCIL by DCI\n\nwere pursuant to a “contract,” even though DeFranceschi knew that\n\nDCIL was a shell company to which Schussel had diverted funds.\n\nSpecifically, Schussel argues      that DeFranceschi knew that the\n\nanswers in the March 11, 1998, letter to the IRS were misleading,\n\nbut they were in keeping with the general practice whereby attorneys\n\nrecommend that their clients narrowly answer questions without\n\nvolunteering information.\n\n     Schussel’s request that the jury be told specifically that they\n\nmust consider whether the answers given to the IRS in the March 11,\n\n1998, letter were “literally true” does not reflect a correct\n\n\n\n     5\n         The requested instruction reads in relevant part:\n\n     Instruction No. 10\n\n     False Statments\n\n     Counts Two and Three charge defendant Schussel with\n     wilfully attempting to evade and defeat a part of the\n     income tax due and owing by DCI and by himself personally\n     by making false statements to an IRS revenue officer or\n     by causing false statements to be made to an IRS revenue\n     officer. In determining whether defendant Schussel is\n     guilty of the offense charged in Counts Two and Three,\n     you may not consider as false statements any statements\n     which were made in response to questions asked by Revenue\n     Agent Kelly McGovern Jordan and which were literally\n     true, even if those statements are determined by you to\n     have been incomplete or even misleading.\n\n                                 - 30 -\n\fstatement of the law.    A “literal truth” instruction does not take\n\ninto account the language of 26 U.S.C. § 7201, the tax evasion\n\nstatute, which prohibits “any conduct, the likely effect of which\n\nwould be to mislead or conceal.”       (Emphasis added.)   As the statute\n\nprohibits conduct that misleads or conceals, the “literal truth” may\n\nstill violate the tax statute.        The plain language of the statute\n\ncovers   a   broader   range   of   conduct   than   Schussel’s   proposed\n\ninstruction would reflect.      The cases that Schussel relies on for\n\nthe correctness of his “literal truth” instruction all concern\n\nperjury, false statements and obstruction of justice charges, not\n\nthe broader conduct prohibited by the tax evasion statute.\n\n     In addition, the instruction the district court gave to the\n\njury about the March 11 letter asked the jury to consider whether\n\nSchussel had made or caused to be made “false statements to the\n\nrevenue agent.” There is nothing in that instruction that prohibits\n\nthe jury from considering the “literal truth” of Schussel’s answers\n\nand Schussel did in fact make that argument to the jury.\n\n     In sum, what Schussel was trying to accomplish by his requested\n\ninstructions was to inform the jury, incorrectly, that when a\n\ntaxpayer hires professionals to perform legal services for him, the\n\ntaxpayer may rely on those services to such an extent that the\n\ntaxpayer does not act “willfully” under the tax evasion statute if\n\nhe retains counsel for an audit.       The district court was correct to\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 31 -\n\freject the changes to the tax evasion instructions requested by\n\nSchussel.\n\n3.   Supplemental Instruction on DeFranceschi’s Role\n\n     The indictment in this case, which came down on February 26,\n\n2004, alleged that the conspiracy involved “others known and unknown\n\nto the Grand Jury.”   This language permitted the jury to convict\n\nSchussel based on a conspiracy with persons not named in the\n\nindictment and, in fact, the coconspirators are all unnamed.   When\n\ndescribing the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, the\n\nindictment refers to DCI controller Diane Reed as “D.R.” and\n\nminority shareholder Ronald Gomes as R.G.       Stacey and Michael\n\nGriffin, Schussel’s daughter and son-in-law, are also unindicted\n\ncoconspirators.   Attorney Edward DeFranceschi is not mentioned in\n\nthe conspiracy count in any way.\n\n     The statute of limitations for the conspiracy is six years, so\n\nthe government was required to prove an ongoing conspiracy among\n\nSchussel and his coconspirators as of February 26, 1998, during the\n\ntime frame when DeFranceschi was representing Schussel in connection\n\nwith the 1997-98 audit concerning the 1995 tax year.       Schussel\n\nclaims on appeal that the government wanted the jury to believe that\n\nDeFranceschi was part of the conspiracy because it was easier for\n\nthe government to prove the existence of a conspiracy as of February\n\n26, 1998, between Schussel and DeFranceschi than trying to prove\n\nthat Reed, Gomes and others were still part of the conspiracy as of\n\n\n                              - 32 -\n\fthat date.     Schussel’s interaction with DeFranceschi during this\n\ntime period was very clear and Schussel maintains that the others\n\nin the conspiracy, such as Gomes and Reed, had withdrawn from the\n\nconspiracy,    as    argued    by   Schussel   in   his   challenge    to   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence for the conspiracy count, which is\n\naddressed infra.\n\n      In an effort to counter what Schussel calls a “change in\n\ncourse” by the government to have the jury believe that DeFranceschi\n\nwas   part    of    the   conspiracy,   Schussel    requested   a     specific\n\ninstruction that “the government does not allege that DeFranceschi\n\nwas   a coconspirator.”       The district court refused to give the jury\n\nthe supplemental language and gave a standard instruction concerning\n\nthe conspiracy:\n\n      You are not being asked whether any other person is\n      guilty or not guilty of those offenses or should have\n      been charged with a crime. Your verdict should be based\n      solely upon the evidence or lack of evidence as to Dr.\n      Schussel in accordance with my instructions.\n\n      The instruction is not confusing, as argued by Schussel.               It\n\ntold the jury not to take into consideration the question of whether\n\nsome other person should or should not have been charged.                   The\n\ninstruction does not suggest, as Schussel argues, that DeFranceschi\n\nshould have been charged as a coconspirator.          Moreover, the United\n\nStates did not imply or suggest during the trial that DeFranceschi\n\nwas or should have been charged as a coconspirator.             Indeed, the\n\nUnited States told the jury that the evidence did not support the\n\n\n                                    - 33 -\n\finference that Schussel had acted in good faith with DeFranceschi\n\nand instead suggested that Schussel used him as a “scapegoat.” The\n\ngovernment   stated   that   the    evidence     showed   that    DeFranceschi\n\nbelieved that the contract between DCI and DCIL was a true and valid\n\ncontract when he turned it over to the IRS.          Therefore, contrary to\n\nSchussel’s   allegations     that    the     government   tried    to   portray\n\nDeFranceschi as a coconspirator, the United States made clear to the\n\njury that Schussel “use[d] the lawyer as a conduit to give false\n\ninformation to the IRS.”\n\nC.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     The evidence showed that Schussel and unindicted coconspirators\n\nReed, Gomes, and Stacey and Michael Griffin, engaged in a conspiracy\n\nto evade taxes and that the conspiracy lasted until at least May\n\n1998.   Schussel claims that, if a conspiracy existed at all, his\n\ncoconspirators withdrew prior to February 26, 1998, the date on\n\nwhich the conspiracy must have existed to be within the six-year\n\nstatute of limitations. The documents submitted to DeFranceschi and\n\nthe IRS after February 26, 1998, demonstrate that the conspiracy was\n\nstill active   until at least the signing of the adjustment letter\n\nwith the IRS by Schussel in May 1998.               Numerous exhibits and\n\ndocuments show the ongoing nature of the conspiracy after February\n\n26, 1998.\n\n     Withdrawal from a conspiracy as a defense requires affirmative\n\nevidence of an effort to defeat, disavow or confess the conspiracy.\n\n\n                                    - 34 -\n\fUnited States v. Potter, 463 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2006).                              The\n\ndefense requires either a full confession to authorities or a\n\ncommunication to coconspirators that the individual has abandoned\n\nthe enterprise and its goals. United States v. Pizarro-Berrios, 448\n\nF.3d   1,   10    (1st   Cir.    2006).       Mere   cessation       of    activity    in\n\nfurtherance of a conspiracy does not constitute withdrawal.                           Id.\n\nContrary     to    Schussel’s       argument,        none     of     the    unindicted\n\ncoconspirators met the demanding standard for withdrawal.\n\n       Although    Diane   Reed,     DCI’s     controller,         did    not   interact\n\ndirectly with IRS agent McGovern after Schussel hired attorney\n\nDeFranceschi in late 1997, she continued to play an active role in\n\nthe conspiracy as a conduit of information between Schussel and\n\nDeFranceschi.       Reed provided DeFranceschi with information after\n\nFebruary 26, 1998, that was subsequently provided to the IRS, such\n\nas   information     included      in   the    March    11,    1998,       letter   from\n\nDeFranceschi to agent McGovern.\n\n       Schussel’s contention that Gomes withdrew from the conspiracy\n\nalso fails.       Schussel contends that Gomes’ “state of mind” after\n\nJanuary 1996, when DCI ceased sending money to the Bermuda account,\n\ndemonstrates that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy.                         However,\n\nGomes’ “state of mind” is not evidence of an affirmative withdrawal\n\nfrom the conspiracy.            Schussel points        to no affirmative act by\n\nGomes indicating that he left or intended to leave the conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\fHe continued to be a minority shareholder and business partner of\n\nSchussel in DCI.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                             - 36 -\n\f",

Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                    Lipez, Merritt,* and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Scott A.

Defendant George Schussel was\n\nconvicted   after   a   thirteen-day   jury    trial   of   one   count   of\n\nconspiracy to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371 and two counts of tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. §\n\n7201.   He was sentenced to 60 months’ imprisonment on each count,\n\nto run concurrently.    He now appeals his conviction, raising three\n\nissues:   (1) whether documents turned over to the government from\n\nhis attorney’s files violate the attorney-client privilege; (2)\n\nwhether the refusal of the trial court to give certain requested\n\njury instructions violated Schussel’s right to a fair trial; and\n\n(3) whether sufficient evidence supports Schussel’s conviction for\n\nconspiracy.    Schussel does not appeal his sentence.              For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                I.   Facts\n\n     Defendant George Schussel is the founder of and was, at all\n\ntimes relevant to the charges herein, the principal shareholder of\n\nDigital   Consulting,   Inc.   (“DCI”),   a   Massachusetts   corporation\n\nengaged in the business of planning and conducting trade shows and\n\nconferences for businesses in the computer industry. DCI’s primary\n\nsource of revenue came from participants at DCI-organized events\n\nand from vendors at those events that bought booth space to display\n\nsoftware or other products.      Schussel was first the president and\n\nthen the CEO of DCI and he owned 95% of the stock.          Ronald Gomes,\n\nwho owned the other 5% of DCI stock,             succeeded Schussel as\n\n\n                                  - 2 -\n\fpresident of DCI.         Diane Reed was hired in 1985 as DCI’s accountant\n\nand   she   later    became      controller.       She    reported    primarily    to\n\nSchussel.\n\n      Schussel      also     was     the   owner   and    President     of    Digital\n\nConsulting International Limited (“DCIL”), a company established in\n\n1988 and operating in Hamilton, Bermuda, ostensibly to help DCI\n\nexpand its international business.                 DCIL, however, was a shell\n\ncompany that existed in name only; it did not exist as an actual\n\ncompany with employees or a building.               According to testimony of\n\nDiane Reed, DCI’s controller, from the late 1980s through 1995,\n\nSchussel directed her to divert money generated by DCI                         into a\n\nBermuda bank account held in the name of DCIL in order to avoid\n\npaying    taxes     on    DCI    income.     Schussel,     Schussel’s     wife,   and\n\nSchussel’s daughter, Stacy Griffin, were the authorized signatories\n\nof the Bermuda account.             The types of checks deposited into the\n\nBermuda account varied.            Sometimes customer checks were deposited\n\ndirectly into the Bermuda account, but, over time, Reed began\n\nsending     funds    to    the     Bermuda   account     from   various      operating\n\naccounts of DCI known as “user group” accounts.                    DCI used these\n\naccounts to handle incoming and outgoing funds associated with\n\nparticular events run by DCI. The separate accounts allowed DCI to\n\nkeep client and vendor funds separated from DCI funds.\n\n      Between 1988 and 1995, Schussel diverted over $12 million of\n\nDCI’s income to the Bermuda account, much of it from the “user\n\n\n                                           - 3 -\n\fgroup” accounts.    This was taxable income to DCI that was not\n\nreported to the IRS.    After being deposited in the DCIL Bermuda\n\naccount, most of the money was transferred by wire to accounts in\n\nthe United States at Fidelity Investments that were maintained and\n\ncontrolled by Schussel.   The rest of the money deposited in the\n\nBermuda account, about 5%, was transferred to Schussel’s business\n\npartner, Gomes.    By depositing money in the Bermuda account and\n\nthen transferring it to the Fidelity account, Schussel also avoided\n\npaying personal income tax.   Reed kept track of the funds diverted\n\nto the Bermuda account by noting the amount of each deposit made\n\nand the subsequent distribution to Schussel and Gomes.\n\n     In late 1991 and early 1992, the IRS conducted an audit of DCI\n\ncovering tax years 1986 to 1990.   When the IRS agent in charge of\n\nthe audit asked about two payments from DCI to DCIL, he was told\n\nthat the payments were commissions DCI owed to DCIL for foreign\n\nevents.   The agent was also given fabricated documents signed by\n\nSchussel and Gomes that referenced each payment as being made for\n\nservices DCIL purportedly performed for DCI.\n\n     Although tax adjustments were made for DCI for the years 1986\n\nto 1990, the agent took no further action.   In 1995, the IRS again\n\naudited DCI, this time for tax year 1993.       A different agent\n\nhandled the audit, and the existence of the Bermuda account was not\n\nraised by the agent or anyone at DCI.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 4 -\n\f     In the mid-1990s, discussions arose about selling DCI.                  A\n\nconcern arose that DCI would not be able to show its true value and\n\nprofitability to potential buyers because income actually earned by\n\nDCI was being diverted to the DCIL Bermuda account.               Two sets of\n\nnumbers existed in DCI’s books – one set reflected DCI’s true\n\nincome and the other set reflected the income reported by DCI to\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service.     In early 1996, it was decided that\n\nmoney would no longer be diverted to the Bermuda account so that\n\nthe company could be sold for its “true” value.             Tax year 1995,\n\ntherefore, was the last year that the corporate return omitted\n\nincome DCI had diverted to Bermuda.        The Bermuda account was not\n\nclosed until 1997, but Schussel reported on his 1996 personal\n\nreturn that he did not control any foreign bank accounts.\n\n     In early 1997, Gomes and Schussel met with attorney Kenneth\n\nGlusman regarding the sale of DCI.        At an evidentiary hearing to\n\nconsider   admission   into   evidence    of   various      attorney-client\n\ncommunications,   attorney    Glusman    testified   that    at    his   first\n\nmeeting with Schussel and Gomes, the men told him about the shell\n\ncompany DCIL and the Bermuda account to which money had been\n\ndiverted, including the fact that DCI had not been reporting all of\n\nits taxable income to the IRS for a number of years.           Glusman, who\n\ndid not have experience with criminal tax matters, testified that\n\nhis main concern at that point was not Schussel’s and Gomes’\n\nliability for not paying taxes, but the fact that anyone who\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fpurchased DCI would be buying a company with a potentially large\n\nliability for unpaid taxes.\n\n     Also occurring in 1997 was the decision among Schussel, Gomes,\n\nDiane Reed (the controller of DCI), Schussel’s daughter, Stacey\n\nGriffin, and her husband, Michael, both DCI employees, to destroy\n\ncertain DCI records.   Specifically, Michael Griffin recommended a\n\nplan to delete and alter DCI’s computerized accounting records so\n\nthat if an audit were to occur, revenue information in the computer\n\nwould match the revenue information in the 1995 corporate tax\n\nreturn.   The discussion stemmed from concern that potential buyers\n\nmight discover the discrepancies in DCI’s records due to the\n\ndeposits of money into the Bermuda account.       Records in DCI’s\n\ncomputer database showed that DCI’s income receipts did not match\n\nDCI’s corporate bank account due to the monies that had been\n\ntransferred to the Bermuda account.       Gomes testified that the\n\nrecord destruction plan was referred to as “Project Phoenix” and\n\nthe project’s goal was to alter DCI’s electronic database to ensure\n\nthat the information in the database matched income reported in\n\nDCI’s corporate tax returns.1   In July 1997, at Gomes’ direction,\n\nReed prepared a list of documents to “Keep or Lose” in case of an\n\nIRS audit or a sale.   An “All Staff Memo” dated July 29, 1997, from\n\nthe “Archiving Committee” directed the destruction of records as\n\n\n     1\n     Information and records relating to the Bermuda account of\nDCIL were not maintained in the DCI database and were not\ndestroyed.\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fpart of a “routine” clean up.              Reed questioned Gomes about this\n\nmemo and he told her he wanted to make sure all the documents were\n\n“purged.”\n\n         DCI learned in September 1997 that it would undergo an IRS\n\naudit of its 1995 tax return.          On October 27, 1997, Reed, Schussel\n\nand Paul Law, DCI’s accountant, met with Kelly McGovern, an IRS\n\nagent.2        Prior to the October meeting, Reed had collected all of\n\nthe documentation requested by McGovern, other than documents\n\npertaining to DCIL and the Bermuda account.               The over $4 million\n\ndiverted to the Bermuda account in 1995 was therefore not disclosed\n\nto the IRS agent.         Concern arose at DCI, however, when, during the\n\ninvestigation, McGovern found a refund check issued to a vendor\n\nwritten from a “user group” account, the separate accounts DCI used\n\nto handle the funds for certain specific events.             The refund check\n\nhad come from the general DCI account because that particular “user\n\ngroup” account had been closed. This led McGovern to inquire about\n\nthe separate accounts of “user groups.”            DCI became concerned that\n\nif   a       thorough   examination   of   each   “user   group”   account   was\n\nconducted, it would be discovered that money from these accounts\n\nhad been transferred to the Bermuda account.\n\n         McGovern’s discovery of the “user group” accounts led to\n\nanother meeting in November 1998 with Schussel, Schussel’s wife,\n\n\n\n         2\n     IRS Agent McGovern is referred to in various places in the\nrecord and briefs as Kelly Jordan, her married name.\n\n                                      - 7 -\n\fGomes and his wife, Stacey and Michael Griffin, Reed and Glusman,\n\nthe attorney. Reed testified that Glusman was told at that meeting\n\nthat monies from the user group accounts had been transferred to\n\nthe Bermuda account.           Glusman then left the meeting and further\n\ndiscussion took place regarding whether information in the DCI\n\ndatabase     could    be    destroyed     or   at   least   made    confusing    and\n\ndifficult for the IRS to understand.\n\n       Upon learning about the audit, attorney Glusman recommended to\n\nSchussel that he hire an attorney with experience in criminal tax\n\nmatters.      On     Glusman’s    recommendation,      Schussel      hired    Edward\n\nDeFranceschi to represent both Schussel and DCI in the 1997 audit.\n\nGomes and Schussel first met with DeFranceschi in November 1997 and\n\ntold him that income had been diverted from DCI to the Bermuda\n\naccount and had not been reported to the IRS.                     Glusman was also\n\npresent at the meeting.          Reed met with DeFranceschi and showed him\n\nthe user group documentation and checks that had been sent to the\n\nBermuda account.           She also showed him documentation that showed\n\nmoney being sent from DCI user groups to the Bermuda account and\n\nback    to   Schussel’s       Fidelity    account     in    the    United    States.\n\nDeFranceschi took over communicating with IRS agent McGovern and\n\nrecommended that no one from DCI communicate directly with the IRS.\n\nDeFranceschi relied mainly on Schussel for information disclosed to\n\nthe IRS. Reed was instructed by Schussel to provide information to\n\nDeFranceschi and Schussel as needed by DeFranceschi.\n\n\n                                         - 8 -\n\f     In February 1998, McGovern discovered more “user group” checks\n\nand inquired about the relationship between DCI, DCIL and Schussel.\n\nDeFranceschi provided her with a copy of a contract between DCI and\n\nDCIL dated September 1993, given to him by Schussel.                    The contract\n\nwas signed by “J. Cardullo” on behalf of DCIL and provided that DCI\n\nwould compensate DCIL for “services rendered.”                          DeFranceschi\n\nrepresented to McGovern that the contract had been in effect in\n\nvarious forms since 1988.       Gomes and Reed testified that they did\n\nnot see the contract at the time it was executed in 1993.                      Gomes\n\nsaid he first saw the contract in 1997 during the IRS audit.                   Reed,\n\nwho was responsible for maintaining all of DCI’s contracts in her\n\nposition as controller, testified that she did not see the contract\n\nuntil 2003, when it was shown to her by the government.                           John\n\nCardullo,   who   was   hired   by    DCI    in    1988    to    be     Director    of\n\nInternational     Operations,   testified         that    he    never    signed    the\n\ncontract, nor did he authorize anyone else to sign on his behalf.\n\nHe also testified that he had never conducted any business with\n\nDCIL or any other company in Bermuda while at DCI.                      In addition,\n\nCardullo left DCI before September 1993, the date he purportedly\n\nsigned the contract.\n\n     After receiving the contract between DCIL and DCI, IRS agent\n\nMcGovern requested certain documents from DeFranceschi concerning\n\nDCIL,   Schussel’s   relationship      with   DCIL       and    the     relationship\n\nbetween DCI and DCIL.     On March 4, 1998, Schussel faxed responses\n\n\n                                     - 9 -\n\fto some of the questions to DeFranceschi and provided a description\n\nof what had occurred concerning DCIL in the earlier audit in 1991\n\nand 1995.     Schussel asserted that he “had provided [the IRS] with\n\nthe complete file which I had in my possession at that time” and\n\nindicated that on both occasions the IRS had not                  found a problem\n\nwith    the   DCI-DCIL      connection.          Schussel    also    supplied       two\n\n“exhibits” to DeFranceschi that purported to document international\n\nevents for which DCI compensated DCIL.\n\n       DeFranceschi,       using    the   information       supplied   to     him    by\n\nSchussel, drafted a response to the IRS document request.                   He sent\n\nthe draft response to Schussel, who made notations on the draft\n\nthat indicate that he discussed the response with DeFranceschi. On\n\nMarch 12, 1998, DeFranceschi sent the letter to IRS agent McGovern.\n\nBased on the representations in this letter, IRS agent McGovern\n\nconcluded     that   DCI    and    DCIL   were    not   related     entities,   that\n\nSchussel had no control over DCIL, and that the business conducted\n\nby DCIL was outside the scope of her audit of DCI.                     Glusman and\n\nReed testified that McGovern never asked to see the actual records\n\nof DCIL.      Pursuant to a letter dated May 6, 1998, the audit was\n\nconcluded     with   the    IRS    making    certain     adjustments     to     DCI’s\n\ncorporate return for 1995. None of these adjustments reflected the\n\nDCI income that Schussel had diverted to the Bermuda account.\n\n       After the 1997 audit concluded, Gomes and Schussel discussed\n\namending their personal tax returns for 1995 to reflect income that\n\n\n                                      - 10 -\n\fhad not been disclosed at the time.                        At Schussel’s request,\n\ncontroller Reed provided to attorney DeFranceschi documentation\n\nregarding the Bermuda account, as well as documentation concerning\n\nSchussel’s Fidelity account, so that DeFranceschi could prepare an\n\namended return for Schussel.                  Although an amended return was\n\nprepared by DeFranceschi, it was never filed based on advice from\n\nDeFranceschi.\n\n      In October 2001, Darlene Flint, who had worked as Gomes’\n\nsecretary for 18 years, walked into the IRS office in Stoneham,\n\nMassachusetts, with a box of DCI records that included the Bermuda\n\naccount    records.             This       disclosure       triggered     a     criminal\n\ninvestigation of DCI and its employees.                   Reed and Gomes cooperated\n\nin the investigation and provided information implicating Schussel\n\nin both the diversion of taxable income and obstruction of IRS\n\naudits.    In addition to the DCI employees, attorney DeFranceschi’s\n\nconduct was also questioned by the federal prosecutor.                                 Upon\n\nlearning   that     he    was    a    subject       and   potential    target     of   the\n\ninvestigation, DeFranceschi hired his own attorney, Elliot Lobel,\n\nwho   contacted     the    federal         prosecutor     and   offered    to     provide\n\nevidence    that    DeFranceschi            did     not   knowingly     provide    false\n\ninformation    to    the    IRS       or    obstruct      the   1998   audit.      Lobel\n\ndetermined that the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct\n\nallowed    DeFranceschi          to        reveal     attorney-client         privileged\n\ninformation to the extent necessary to defend himself from criminal\n\n\n                                           - 11 -\n\fcharges.      Lobel allowed DeFranceschi to make a statement pursuant\n\nto   a    proffer   letter   with    the    government.      In   the   proffer,\n\nDeFranceschi stated that Schussel had provided him with all the\n\ninformation and material provided to the IRS.             The prosecutor told\n\nLobel that the government would require documentary evidence to\n\nprove      that   DeFranceschi      had    not   knowingly   participated     in\n\nSchussel’s illegal scheme.           Lobel produced a limited number of\n\ndocuments deemed necessary to prove DeFranceschi’s innocence, along\n\nwith an affidavit by DeFranceschi.           DeFranceschi did not turn over\n\nhis entire Schussel file to the government. The government decided\n\nnot to indict DeFranceschi.\n\n         On February 26, 2004, a federal grand jury returned a three-\n\ncount indictment against Schussel, charging him with conspiring\n\nwith unnamed others, known and unknown, to defraud the United\n\nStates in the collection of income taxes in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 371 (Count I), and two counts of tax evasion in violation of 26\n\nU.S.C. § 7201.       Specifically, the tax evasion counts allege that\n\nSchussel made false statements to a revenue agent of the Internal\n\nRevenue Service and filed a false and fraudulent corporate income\n\ntax return (Count II) and individual tax return (Count III).                The\n\nindictment charged that the offense conduct in the conspiracy in\n\nCount I began in or about January 1988 and extended through May\n\n1998.      The offense conduct in Counts II and III occurred in March\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 12 -\n\f1998 during an audit of Schussel’s individual and corporate tax\n\nreturns for 1995.\n\n     The indictment charged that Schussel and others “intentionally\n\nand willfully caused the filing of false and fraudulent Corporate\n\nU.S. Income Tax Returns to be filed with the IRS for the purpose of\n\nevading and defeating income tax due and owing for several years.”\n\nIndictment at ¶ 32.   The indictment also specifically stated that\n\nSchussel and others had failed to disclose DCI income which had\n\nbeen diverted to DCIL’s bank account in Bermuda in the amount of\n\n$8.5 million from 1993 through 1995.        The indictment also charged\n\nthat Schussel and others “for purposes of preventing discovery of\n\nDCI’s unreported income, endeavored to impede and obstruct an audit\n\nconducted by the IRS of DCI’s 1995 Corporate U.S. Income Tax\n\nReturn.”    Indictment   at   ¶   34.      The   overt   acts   charged   in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy included Schussel’s hiring of a tax\n\nattorney in 1997 to represent him during the audit and his use of\n\nthe attorney “to impede and obstruct the audit.”          Indictment at ¶\n\n40 (ee).   At issue on appeal are the following overt acts charged\n\nin the indictment:\n\n     gg. On or about March 11, 1998, Schussel caused the tax\n     attorney who was acting on his behalf, to send a letter\n     to the revenue agent, which letter falsely stated, among\n     other things, that Schussel was not an officer of DCIL\n     and falsely represented that payments made by DCI to DCIL\n     were pursuant to the contract purportedly executed\n     between DCI and DCIL in September 1993.\n\n     hh. On or about May 6, 1998, Schussel signed IRS Form\n     CG-4549, acknowledging and agreeing to income tax\n\n                                  - 13 -\n\f     examination changes that the revenue agent had made to\n     DCI’s 1995 Corporate U.S. Income tax Return which showed\n     that $18,859.00 was additional income tax due for DCI’s\n     1995 calendar year. As Schussel well knew, this amount\n     was, in fact, substantially less than the true amount due\n     to the IRS because Schussel had concealed DCI’s true\n     income from 1995 from the revenue agent during the course\n     of the audit.\n\nIndictment at ¶ 40 (gg, hh).\n\n     Count II of the indictment charged that on March 11, 1998,\n\nSchussel did “willfully attempt to evade and defeat” part of the\n\nfederal income tax owed by DCI by “making and causing to be made”\n\nfalse statements to an IRS agent in order to mislead and impede an\n\naudit examination of DCI’s 1995 corporate income tax return, and by\n\n“filing    and   causing    to   be   filed”   with   the   IRS   a   false   and\n\nfraudulent income tax return underreporting DCI’s taxable income\n\nfor 1995.      Indictment at ¶ 91.     Count III charged that on or about\n\nMarch 11, 1998, Schussel willfully attempted to evade and defeat\n\npart of the personal income tax owed by him by “making and causing\n\nto be made false statements” to the revenue agent in order to\n\nmislead and impede the audit of DCI’s 1995 corporate income tax\n\nreturn, and by “filing and causing to be filed” with the IRS a\n\nfalse and fraudulent individual income tax return by underreporting\n\nhis taxable income for 1995.          Indictment at ¶ 93.\n\n     Before trial, Schussel moved to suppress documents on the\n\nbasis     of   various     privileges,    including    the    attorney-client\n\nprivilege, the corporate attorney-client privilege and the joint\n\ndefense/common interest privilege.             An evidentiary hearing was\n\n                                      - 14 -\n\fheld in May 2005 before Magistrate Judge Alexander.                 Reed, Gomes,\n\nSchussel’s attorneys Glusman and DeFranceschi and others testified.\n\nThe magistrate judge found that of the thirteen documents at issue\n\nthree were privileged and the government was prevented from using\n\nthem at trial.      The other ten were either not privileged or the\n\nprivilege was vitiated under an exception, such as the crime-fraud\n\nexception or third-party disclosure rule.            Of the six documents at\n\nissue in this appeal, the Magistrate Judge held that two (Exs. 65\n\nand 73) were not privileged under the third-party disclosure rule\n\nand   one   (Ex.   67)   was   not   privileged      because   it    was   not   a\n\nconfidential communication.          Three documents (Exs. 66, 68 and 71)\n\nlost their privilege under the crime-fraud exception. See Findings\n\nand Recommendation on Motion to Suppress Government’s Use and\n\nAcquisition of Privileged Materials and for Other Appropriate\n\nRelief, August 25, 2005.       Over Schussel’s objection, the district\n\ncourt adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Findings and Recommendation.\n\n                               II.     Analysis\n\n      Schussel     raises   three    main   issues    on   appeal:      (1)    the\n\nattorney-client     relationship      was   violated   when    documents      sent\n\nbetween Schussel and his lawyer were introduced into evidence at\n\ntrial; (2) the district court erred in refusing to give certain\n\njury instructions requested by Schussel pertaining to the tax\n\nevasion counts; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support\n\nthe conspiracy conviction.\n\n\n                                     - 15 -\n\fA.   Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n     The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is “to encourage\n\nfull and frank communication between attorneys and their clients .\n\n. . .”   Upjohn Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110374\"><a href=\"/opinion/110374/upjohn-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (1981).     The\n\nprivilege is not absolute, however, and does not extend to all\n\ncommunications between an attorney and client.           The privilege\n\nprotects “only those communications that are confidential and are\n\nmade for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice.”        In re\n\nKeeper of Records (Grand Jury Subpoena Addressed to XYZ Corp.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200700\"><a href=\"/opinion/200700/unknown-case-name/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 2003).       The First Circuit has adopted the\n\nfollowing definition of the attorney client privilege:\n\n     (1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a\n     professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3)\n     the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in\n     confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance\n     permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or\n     by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be\n     waived.\n\nUnited States v.

Wigmore, Evidence § 2292, at 554 (McNaughton\n\nrev. 1961)).   The burden of proving an applicable privilege lies\n\nwith the party claiming the privilege.      The party must demonstrate\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence not only that the privilege\n\napplies, but that it has not been waived or that exceptions do not\n\napply.   FDIC v. Ogden Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767482\"><a href=\"/opinion/767482/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-successor-in-interest-to-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n     Following his indictment, Schussel filed a motion to suppress\n\nthirteen    documents   supplied    by    his   tax   attorney,   Edward\n\n\n                                 - 16 -\n\fDeFranceschi, to the government, claiming they were privileged and\n\nconfidential        pursuant    to   attorney-client   privilege.3    Of   the\n\nthirteen documents, the district court found three to be protected\n\nby the attorney-client privilege.           Of the remaining ten documents\n\nat issue, the district court found most of them not to be protected\n\nunder the attorney-client privilege either because they were not\n\nconfidential due to their content or due to the fact that they were\n\nintended to be disclosed to a third-party.             Three documents that\n\nwere found to be confidential had the attorney-client privilege\n\nvitiated      due    to   the   “crime-fraud    exception,”   which   exempts\n\nprivileged documents from protection if the client seeks advice\n\nfrom a lawyer that will serve him in the commission of a crime or\n\nfraud.      Only six of the documents are at issue on appeal; all six\n\ndocuments came from the files of Ed DeFranceschi, Schussel’s\n\nattorney at the time of an IRS audit in 1998.\n\n       The six documents at issue on appeal are:\n\nExhibit 65:         A fax dated 2/16/98 from Schussel to DeFranceschi\n\ntelling DeFranceschi that the information in a 2/13/98 letter sent\n\nto the IRS by DeFranceschi is incorrect and should be corrected to\n\nsay:       “I am advised that the transactions for 1988 through 1991\n\nwere reviewed in 1993 as part of the IRS audit for the years 1987-\n\n1991.”      As the district court ruled, this document was properly\n\n\n       3\n     Schussel also moved to suppress documents provided to the\ngovernment by Gomes and Flint.     The court’s rulings on those\ndocuments are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                       - 17 -\n\fadmitted under the third-party disclosure rule because Schussel\n\nintended, and indeed directed, that DeFranceschi disclose the\n\ninformation to a third-party – the IRS.\n\nExhibit 66:   A fax dated 3/4/98 from Schussel to DeFranceschi with\n\ndraft responses to questions 1-3 of a document request from the\n\nIRS.   This document was admitted under the “crime-fraud exception”\n\nto the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExhibit 67:      A fax dated 3/6/98 from Schussel to DeFranceschi\n\nrequesting that DeFranceschi ask the IRS agent when Schussel can\n\n“take down” the data room at Schussel’s offices that was set up for\n\nthe IRS examination. The district court found this document not to\n\nbe a confidential communication and therefore not privileged.\n\nExhibit 68:   Draft of letter dated 3/11/98 to be sent to IRS agent\n\nconcerning Document request #4.    This document was admitted under\n\nthe “crime-fraud exception” to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExhibit    71:    Fax from Schussel to DeFranceschi dated 3/12/98\n\nreminding DeFranceschi that the auditor who performed the 1993\n\naudit had some questions about a cash transaction involving one of\n\nDCI’s user groups and the questions were answered to the agent’s\n\nsatisfaction at that time.     This document was admitted under the\n\n“crime-fraud exception” to the attorney-client privilege.\n\nExhibit 73:      Fax from Schussel to DeFranceschi dated 4/24/98\n\nalerting DeFranceschi to a package of tax forms, schedules and\n\nother material    DeFranceschi will be receiving from Schussel under\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\fseparate cover.      This document was admitted under the third-party\n\ndisclosure    rule    because   Schussel   intended   that   DeFranceschi\n\ndisclose the information to a third-party – the IRS.\n\n1.   Waiver\n\n     The government first argues that Schussel waived the privilege\n\nas to all six documents     because in the trial court Schussel made\n\nselective use of the documents as part of an advice-of-counsel\n\ndefense – sometimes wanting to use them in his defense and other\n\ntimes wanting to withhold them on the ground of attorney-client\n\nprivilege.    The government argues that once Schussel put any\n\ncommunications with DeFranceschi in evidence pursuant to an advice-\n\nof-counsel defense, he waived the attorney-client privilege as to\n\nall communications with DeFranceschi.       However, the district court\n\ndid not admit the documents on the basis of waiver and, because a\n\ndetermination of waiver often requires a detailed factual analysis,\n\nwe decline to make such a finding in this appeal.\n\n2.   Contents Not Privileged\n\n     Exhibit 67 is a fax dated March 6, 1998, from Schussel to\n\nDeFranceschi requesting that DeFranceschi ask the IRS agent when\n\nSchussel can dismantle a data and records room at Schussel’s offices\n\nthat was set up for the IRS examination.      Because the communication\n\ndid not seek or give legal advice, the district court found this\n\ndocument not to be a confidential communication and therefore not\n\nprivileged.   This finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                  - 19 -\n\f3.   The Crime-Fraud Exception to the Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n     Under   the   “crime-fraud     exception,”    the    attorney-client\n\nprivilege does not apply when a client seeks advice from a lawyer\n\nthat will serve him in the commission of a crime or fraud.

The\n\nexception applies, therefore, regardless of whether the attorney was\n\nan innocent or willing accomplice.         To “successfully invoke the\n\ncrime-fraud exception, the government must make a prima facie\n\nshowing that the attorney’s assistance was sought in furtherance of\n\na crime or fraud.”   Reeder, 170 F.3d at 106.       The government must\n\nshow: (1) that the client was engaged in (or was planning) criminal\n\nor fraudulent activity when the attorney-client communications took\n\nplace; and (2) that the communications were intended by the client\n\nto facilitate or conceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.          In\n\nre Grand Jury Proceeding, 183 F.3d at 75.         The district co urt\n\nfound that the exception applied to Exhibits 66, 68 and 71, all\n\nthree of which were faxes or drafts sent to DeFranceschi by Schussel\n\n\n                                  - 20 -\n\fin March 1998 when DeFranceschi was trying to gather information\n\nfrom Schussel and DCI to respond to IRS inquiries or document\n\nrequests.       The district court correctly applied the exception\n\nbecause in each of the three documents Schussel was providing\n\nincorrect information to DeFranceschi to be used in responses to\n\ndocument requests and other exchanges with the IRS in an effort to\n\ndeceive the IRS about the true nature of Schussel’s relationship\n\nwith DCIL.\n\n     Schussel’s attempts to characterize these communications as\n\nsimply soliciting legal advice from DeFranceschi belies their\n\ncontent   and    Schussel’s   intent   in   relaying   the   information   to\n\nDeFranceschi. The three documents were clearly sent to DeFranceschi\n\nby Schussel so that Schussel and DCI could continue to evade the\n\ntaxes they owed.       In Exhibit 66, the March 4, 1998, fax from\n\nSchussel to DeFranceschi, Schussel provided false information to\n\nDeFranceschi about the business relationship between DCI and DCIL\n\nby stating that DCIL had performed services for DCI and received\n\ncompensation.     In Exhibit 68, the March 12, 1998, draft letter to\n\nthe IRS from DeFranceschi on behalf of Schussel and DCI, Schussel\n\nprovided false information about the contract between DCI and DCIL.\n\nAs to Exhibit 71, the March 12, 1998, fax to DeFranceschi from\n\nSchussel, Schussel reported to DeFranceschi that in the earlier 1995\n\naudit, the IRS had questioned a cash payment to a user group\n\naccount. Schussel intended for DeFranceschi to use this information\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\fto mislead the IRS into believing that the user group accounts had\n\nalready been examined by the IRS during an earlier audit.\n\n     Schussel argues that the exception cannot apply because he had\n\nnot yet been found guilty of any wrongdoing.          The crime-fraud\n\nexception may apply, however, even if the client is ultimately found\n\nnot to be guilty.   By necessity, the assessment of documents during\n\na legal proceeding is generally preliminary and does not reflect a\n\nfinding that a client acted wrongfully. The required level of proof\n\nto pierce the privilege under the crime-fraud exception is limited\n\nto the issue of whether reasonable cause adequate to pierce the\n\nprivilege exists.    In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 417 F.3d at 22.\n\nBoth the district court and the magistrate judge held hearings where\n\nfindings were made that a sufficient factual predicate existed to\n\npierce the privilege as to these documents.      The district court’s\n\nadmission of Exhibits 66, 68 and 71 under the crime-fraud exception\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\n\n     Schussel also argues that even if the crime-fraud exception\n\napplied, the documents should be suppressed and his conviction\n\nreversed as a sanction against the government for violating his due\n\nprocess rights when it “induced” DeFranceschi to turn over certain\n\ndocuments without notifying Schussel first.      This argument is also\n\nwithout   merit.    Attorneys   may   disclose   confidential   client\n\ninformation to the extent the attorney reasonably believes such\n\ndisclosure is necessary to defend himself against a charge of\n\n\n                                - 22 -\n\fcriminal wrongdoing.        See Mass.

Moreover, an attorney need not\n\nwait to be indicted before making such disclosures.                 Id. cmt. 18\n\n(“Paragraph (b)(2) does not require the lawyer to await commencement\n\nof an action or proceeding that charges such complicity [with the\n\nclient], so that the defense may be established by responding\n\ndirectly to a third party who has made such an assertion.”); United\n\nStates v.

Once the United\n\nStates notified DeFranceschi’s attorney that DeFranceschi was a\n\npotential    target    of   the   investigation      into   DCI   and   Schussel,\n\nDeFranceschi became entitled immediately to disclose information\n\nshowing that he should not be charged.\n\n     Citing to United States v. Zolin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112308\"><a href=\"/opinion/112308/united-states-v-zolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), Schussel\n\nclaims he had a due process right to be notified by either the\n\n\n                                     - 23 -\n\fgovernment or DeFranceschi before DeFranceschi made the disclosure\n\nto the government.        Schussel’s reliance on Zolin is misplaced.\n\nZolin held only that a court may receive contested documents for in\n\ncamera inspection to assess whether the crime-fraud exception\n\napplies.      It makes no requirement that an attorney give advance\n\nnotice   to    the   client   about    his   intention    to     disclose   client\n\ndocuments to a third party in order to defend himself from criminal\n\ncharges.      While we are mindful of Schussel’s argument that notice\n\nis required due to the potential manipulation of an attorney by an\n\noverzealous     or   unethical   prosecutor         accusing   the   attorney   of\n\ncriminal wrongdoing in order to get access to documents that might\n\nbe helpful in building a case against the client, Schussel has cited\n\nno evidence that such was the case here.\n\n     Finally, to the extent there was any error in admitting the\n\nthree documents under the crime-fraud exception, the error was\n\nharmless.       Other   evidence      at   trial,    including    non-privileged\n\ndocuments and testimony by witnesses, including employees of DCI,\n\nwas sufficient to show Schussel’s guilt. Such evidence included the\n\nfalse contract given by Schussel to DeFranceschi, knowing it would\n\nbe turned over to the IRS.            Evidence was also introduced showing\n\nthat after each of the audits, Schussel had signed off on the\n\nadjustments to his and DCI’s taxes recommended by the IRS knowing\n\nthat the income diverted to the Bermuda account was not included in\n\nthe adjustments.        This evidence and the testimony by numerous\n\n\n                                      - 24 -\n\fwitnesses was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Schussel had\n\nthe necessary intent to mislead and deceive the IRS to support the\n\nconspiracy and tax evasion counts.\n\n4.   Third-Party Disclosure\n\n     The third-party disclosure exception supports the principle\n\nthat the attorney-client privilege does not attach to communications\n\nbetween attorney and client when they have been disclosed to a third\n\nparty or were created with the intention of being disclosed to a\n\nthird party.   “When information is transmitted to an attorney with\n\nthe intent that the information will be transmitted to a third-party\n\n. . ., such information is not confidential.”      United States v.\n\nLawless, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419790\"><a href=\"/opinion/419790/united-states-of-america-and-william-c-mccormick-special-agent-irs-v-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (7th Cir. 1983) (finding waiver of\n\nattorney-client privilege where information used to prepare tax\n\nreturn would be disclosed on the tax return itself).\n\n     Both Exhibits 65 and 73 contained information that Schussel\n\nsent to DeFranceschi with the intent that the information be turned\n\nover to the IRS.   Therefore, the documents are not privileged and\n\nno attorney-client confidentiality attaches to them.   Exhibit 65 is\n\na fax sent by Schussel to DeFranceschi in which Schussel provides\n\ninformation for DeFranceschi to give to IRS agent McGovern. Exhibit\n\n73 consists of drafts of amended tax returns for Schussel and Gomes.\n\nAs the information provided in both these documents was intended to\n\nbe disclosed to the IRS, it is not confidential.    Schussel argues\n\nthat Exhibit 73 is a working draft between attorney and client that\n\n\n                               - 25 -\n\fis therefore privileged. If a client transmits information “so that\n\nit might be used on a tax return, such transmission destroys any\n\nexpectation of confidentiality that might have otherwise existed.”\n\n     Lawless, 709 F.2d at 487.   The court below correctly ruled that\n\nthe documents are not privileged.\n\nB.    Jury Instructions\n\n       Schussel claims error as to several of the jury instructions.\n\nSchussel filed requests for specific jury instructions concerning\n\nwillfulness and the attorney-client relationship that were rejected\n\nby the district court as incorrect statements of the law.        Another\n\nrequested    instruction    sought   to   “supplement”   the   conspiracy\n\ninstruction to specifically inform the jury that DeFranceschi,\n\nSchussel’s tax attorney, was not part of the conspiracy.\n\n1.    Willfulness\n\n       Schussel claims it was error for the district court to reject\n\na request he made to instruct the jury on additions to the standard\n\nwillfulness instructions applicable to tax evasion charges under\n\nCheek v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"><a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).4      The district court’s\n\n\n        4\n     Schussel requested several instructions on willfulness that\nwere rejected by the district court. Although we do not recite\neach of Schussel’s requested willfulness instructions herein, we\nreproduce several examples to demonstrate the nature of the\nrequested instructions:\n\n        Instruction No. 3\n        Willfulness\n\n        Defendant Schussel acted wilfully if the law imposed a\n        duty on him, he knew of that duty, and he voluntarily and\n\n                                 - 26 -\n\finstruction explicitly focused the jury on the requirement that\n\nSchussel have “the specific intent to disobey or disregard the law,”\n\nwhich satisfies the Cheek willfulness requirement.              Schussel’s\n\nrequested instruction changed the standard tax evasion instruction\n\nto instruct the jury that it could not find guilt unless it\n\nconcluded that Schussel knew he had a legal duty to reject his\n\nattorney’s advice, which was based on the misinformation that\n\nSchussel   had   supplied   to   him.     Specifically,   the    requested\n\n\n\n     intentionally violated that duty.    Thus, if defendant\n     Schussel acted in good faith, he cannot be guilty of\n     filing a false and fraudulent tax return, as charged in\n     Counts Two and three. This is a subjective standard; the\n     question is what defendant Schussel actually believed,\n     not what a reasonable person would have believed.\n     negligence, even gross negligence, is not enough to meet\n     the wilfulness [sic] requirement. . . .\n\n     Instruction 3(A)\n\n     Thus, you cannot convict defendant Schussel of the\n     offenses charged in Counts Two or Three unless the\n     government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew\n     that he had the duty to instruct his attorney Edward\n     DeFranceschi to make changes in the letter to the IRS\n     prepared by DeFranceschi dated march 11, 1998.\n\n. . .\n\n     Instruction 3(D)\n\n     . . .\n\n     You may not convict defendant Schussel of the offenses\n     charged in Counts Two or Three based upon the signing of\n     the May 6, 1998, letter unless you find beyond a\n     reasonable doubt that he knew he had a duty to reject his\n     attorney’s advice that he sing the may 6, 1998,\n     adjustment letter.\n\n                                 - 27 -\n\finstruction would have required Schussel to know he had a legal duty\n\nto tell DeFranceschi to change the March 11, 1998, letter sent to\n\nthe IRS and to reject DeFranceschi’s advice to sign the May 6, 1998,\n\ntax adjustment letter because they were based on false or misleading\n\ninformation. The requested instruction indicated, erroneously, that\n\nonce a client hires an attorney and makes certain disclosures to\n\nthat lawyer, the client cannot have acted “willfully” if the lawyer\n\npasses on false information to the IRS. This is an improper reading\n\nof the meaning of “willfulness” under the tax evasion statutes and\n\nthe district court properly rejected this proposed instruction.\n\n       In addition, Schussel’s requested “willfulness” instructions\n\nfocus too much on the lawyer’s duty to the client under ethical and\n\nprofessional responsibility rules instead of on the taxpayer’s\n\nconduct.    The tax evasion statute, and its standard “willfulness”\n\ninstruction, focuses solely on the taxpayer’s duty to pay the tax\n\nimposed and to not mislead the IRS about that amount.      They do not\n\nlook to the attorney’s conduct in representing the client.\n\n       Requested instructions are appropriate only if they correctly\n\nstate the law.    United States v. Buttrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201935\"><a href=\"/opinion/201935/united-states-v-buttrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376 (1st\n\nCir.   2005).    Schussel’s   requested   instruction   concerning   the\n\nattorney-client relationship as it        applies to the willfulness\n\nrequirement to prove a tax evasion charge was simply incorrect. The\n\ntax evasion statute at issue, 26 U.S.C. § 7201, prohibits willfully\n\nattempting in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed or\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\fpayment thereof. The relevant legal duty requires that the taxpayer\n\npay the required income tax and not mislead the IRS.                Schussel’s\n\nrequested instruction sought to add on a multitude of concepts from\n\nthe advice-of-counsel defense and attorney ethical rules.\n\n2.   Literal Truth Instruction\n\n      Schussel also claims error concerning the rejection by the\n\ndistrict court of Schussel’s proposed instruction telling the jury\n\nit could not consider as “false” any statement Schussel made\n\nresponding to the IRS if that statement were “literally” true – even\n\nif   the   statement   was   found   by   the   jury   to   be   incomplete   or\n\nmisleading.     The court below found that this instruction only\n\napplied to perjury cases and not to actions taken with the “intent\n\nto mislead or conceal” as stated in the tax evasion statutes.\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 29 -\n\f     Schussel’s    requested   instruction5   informed   the   jury   that\n\nDeFranceschi had told the IRS the “literal truth” in answering its\n\ninquiries, such as informing the IRS that Schussel “is” not an\n\nofficer or employee of DCIL and that payments made to DCIL by DCI\n\nwere pursuant to a “contract,” even though DeFranceschi knew that\n\nDCIL was a shell company to which Schussel had diverted funds.\n\nSpecifically, Schussel argues      that DeFranceschi knew that the\n\nanswers in the March 11, 1998, letter to the IRS were misleading,\n\nbut they were in keeping with the general practice whereby attorneys\n\nrecommend that their clients narrowly answer questions without\n\nvolunteering information.\n\n     Schussel’s request that the jury be told specifically that they\n\nmust consider whether the answers given to the IRS in the March 11,\n\n1998, letter were “literally true” does not reflect a correct\n\n\n\n     5\n         The requested instruction reads in relevant part:\n\n     Instruction No. 10\n\n     False Statments\n\n     Counts Two and Three charge defendant Schussel with\n     wilfully attempting to evade and defeat a part of the\n     income tax due and owing by DCI and by himself personally\n     by making false statements to an IRS revenue officer or\n     by causing false statements to be made to an IRS revenue\n     officer. In determining whether defendant Schussel is\n     guilty of the offense charged in Counts Two and Three,\n     you may not consider as false statements any statements\n     which were made in response to questions asked by Revenue\n     Agent Kelly McGovern Jordan and which were literally\n     true, even if those statements are determined by you to\n     have been incomplete or even misleading.\n\n                                 - 30 -\n\fstatement of the law.    A “literal truth” instruction does not take\n\ninto account the language of 26 U.S.C. § 7201, the tax evasion\n\nstatute, which prohibits “any conduct, the likely effect of which\n\nwould be to mislead or conceal.”       (Emphasis added.)   As the statute\n\nprohibits conduct that misleads or conceals, the “literal truth” may\n\nstill violate the tax statute.        The plain language of the statute\n\ncovers   a   broader   range   of   conduct   than   Schussel’s   proposed\n\ninstruction would reflect.      The cases that Schussel relies on for\n\nthe correctness of his “literal truth” instruction all concern\n\nperjury, false statements and obstruction of justice charges, not\n\nthe broader conduct prohibited by the tax evasion statute.\n\n     In addition, the instruction the district court gave to the\n\njury about the March 11 letter asked the jury to consider whether\n\nSchussel had made or caused to be made “false statements to the\n\nrevenue agent.” There is nothing in that instruction that prohibits\n\nthe jury from considering the “literal truth” of Schussel’s answers\n\nand Schussel did in fact make that argument to the jury.\n\n     In sum, what Schussel was trying to accomplish by his requested\n\ninstructions was to inform the jury, incorrectly, that when a\n\ntaxpayer hires professionals to perform legal services for him, the\n\ntaxpayer may rely on those services to such an extent that the\n\ntaxpayer does not act “willfully” under the tax evasion statute if\n\nhe retains counsel for an audit.       The district court was correct to\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 31 -\n\freject the changes to the tax evasion instructions requested by\n\nSchussel.\n\n3.   Supplemental Instruction on DeFranceschi’s Role\n\n     The indictment in this case, which came down on February 26,\n\n2004, alleged that the conspiracy involved “others known and unknown\n\nto the Grand Jury.”   This language permitted the jury to convict\n\nSchussel based on a conspiracy with persons not named in the\n\nindictment and, in fact, the coconspirators are all unnamed.   When\n\ndescribing the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, the\n\nindictment refers to DCI controller Diane Reed as “D.R.” and\n\nminority shareholder Ronald Gomes as R.G.       Stacey and Michael\n\nGriffin, Schussel’s daughter and son-in-law, are also unindicted\n\ncoconspirators.   Attorney Edward DeFranceschi is not mentioned in\n\nthe conspiracy count in any way.\n\n     The statute of limitations for the conspiracy is six years, so\n\nthe government was required to prove an ongoing conspiracy among\n\nSchussel and his coconspirators as of February 26, 1998, during the\n\ntime frame when DeFranceschi was representing Schussel in connection\n\nwith the 1997-98 audit concerning the 1995 tax year.       Schussel\n\nclaims on appeal that the government wanted the jury to believe that\n\nDeFranceschi was part of the conspiracy because it was easier for\n\nthe government to prove the existence of a conspiracy as of February\n\n26, 1998, between Schussel and DeFranceschi than trying to prove\n\nthat Reed, Gomes and others were still part of the conspiracy as of\n\n\n                              - 32 -\n\fthat date.     Schussel’s interaction with DeFranceschi during this\n\ntime period was very clear and Schussel maintains that the others\n\nin the conspiracy, such as Gomes and Reed, had withdrawn from the\n\nconspiracy,    as    argued    by   Schussel   in   his   challenge    to   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence for the conspiracy count, which is\n\naddressed infra.\n\n      In an effort to counter what Schussel calls a “change in\n\ncourse” by the government to have the jury believe that DeFranceschi\n\nwas   part    of    the   conspiracy,   Schussel    requested   a     specific\n\ninstruction that “the government does not allege that DeFranceschi\n\nwas   a coconspirator.”       The district court refused to give the jury\n\nthe supplemental language and gave a standard instruction concerning\n\nthe conspiracy:\n\n      You are not being asked whether any other person is\n      guilty or not guilty of those offenses or should have\n      been charged with a crime. Your verdict should be based\n      solely upon the evidence or lack of evidence as to Dr.\n      Schussel in accordance with my instructions.\n\n      The instruction is not confusing, as argued by Schussel.               It\n\ntold the jury not to take into consideration the question of whether\n\nsome other person should or should not have been charged.                   The\n\ninstruction does not suggest, as Schussel argues, that DeFranceschi\n\nshould have been charged as a coconspirator.          Moreover, the United\n\nStates did not imply or suggest during the trial that DeFranceschi\n\nwas or should have been charged as a coconspirator.             Indeed, the\n\nUnited States told the jury that the evidence did not support the\n\n\n                                    - 33 -\n\finference that Schussel had acted in good faith with DeFranceschi\n\nand instead suggested that Schussel used him as a “scapegoat.” The\n\ngovernment   stated   that   the    evidence     showed   that    DeFranceschi\n\nbelieved that the contract between DCI and DCIL was a true and valid\n\ncontract when he turned it over to the IRS.          Therefore, contrary to\n\nSchussel’s   allegations     that    the     government   tried    to   portray\n\nDeFranceschi as a coconspirator, the United States made clear to the\n\njury that Schussel “use[d] the lawyer as a conduit to give false\n\ninformation to the IRS.”\n\nC.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     The evidence showed that Schussel and unindicted coconspirators\n\nReed, Gomes, and Stacey and Michael Griffin, engaged in a conspiracy\n\nto evade taxes and that the conspiracy lasted until at least May\n\n1998.   Schussel claims that, if a conspiracy existed at all, his\n\ncoconspirators withdrew prior to February 26, 1998, the date on\n\nwhich the conspiracy must have existed to be within the six-year\n\nstatute of limitations. The documents submitted to DeFranceschi and\n\nthe IRS after February 26, 1998, demonstrate that the conspiracy was\n\nstill active   until at least the signing of the adjustment letter\n\nwith the IRS by Schussel in May 1998.               Numerous exhibits and\n\ndocuments show the ongoing nature of the conspiracy after February\n\n26, 1998.\n\n     Withdrawal from a conspiracy as a defense requires affirmative\n\nevidence of an effort to defeat, disavow or confess the conspiracy.\n\n\n                                    - 34 -\n\fUnited States v. Potter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202407\"><a href=\"/opinion/202407/united-states-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1st Cir. 2006).                              The\n\ndefense requires either a full confession to authorities or a\n\ncommunication to coconspirators that the individual has abandoned\n\nthe enterprise and its goals. United States v. Pizarro-Berrios, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202191\"><a href=\"/opinion/202191/united-states-v-pizarro-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   10    (1st   Cir.    2006).       Mere   cessation       of    activity    in\n\nfurtherance of a conspiracy does not constitute withdrawal.                           Id.\n\nContrary     to    Schussel’s       argument,        none     of     the    unindicted\n\ncoconspirators met the demanding standard for withdrawal.\n\n       Although    Diane   Reed,     DCI’s     controller,         did    not   interact\n\ndirectly with IRS agent McGovern after Schussel hired attorney\n\nDeFranceschi in late 1997, she continued to play an active role in\n\nthe conspiracy as a conduit of information between Schussel and\n\nDeFranceschi.       Reed provided DeFranceschi with information after\n\nFebruary 26, 1998, that was subsequently provided to the IRS, such\n\nas   information     included      in   the    March    11,    1998,       letter   from\n\nDeFranceschi to agent McGovern.\n\n       Schussel’s contention that Gomes withdrew from the conspiracy\n\nalso fails.       Schussel contends that Gomes’ “state of mind” after\n\nJanuary 1996, when DCI ceased sending money to the Bermuda account,\n\ndemonstrates that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy.                         However,\n\nGomes’ “state of mind” is not evidence of an affirmative withdrawal\n\nfrom the conspiracy.            Schussel points        to no affirmative act by\n\nGomes indicating that he left or intended to leave the conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\fHe continued to be a minority shareholder and business partner of\n\nSchussel in DCI.\n\n                           CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                             - 36 -\n\f</pre>",
