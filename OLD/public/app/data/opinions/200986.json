Juan Alicio Samayoa Cabrera and\n\nBlanca Margarita Velasquez, citizens of Guatemala,1applied for\n\nasylum,      relief     under     the     Convention    Against     Torture,      and\n\nwithholding of removal.           The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied the\n\napplications,       and   the     Board    of     Immigration     Appeals   (\"BIA\")\n\naffirmed without opinion.           Mr. Samayoa and Ms. Velasquez petition\n\nfor judicial review, claiming that the IJ erred in concluding\n\nthat they are ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\nWe affirm the BIA's decision.\n\n    I.     Background\n\n         Juan Alicio Samayoa Cabrera is a fifty-four-year-old man\n\nfrom the Quiche region of Guatemala.                 His claims for asylum are\n\nbased on his mistreatment at the hands of guerilla fighters in\n\nGuatemala from 1982 to 1992, which he attributes to his political\n\nopinion.      Following the events described below, he came to the\n\nUnited     States     illegally    in     1992,   and   applied    for   asylum    on\n\nDecember 27, 1993.        His case was finally heard by an Immigration\n\nJudge on February 4, 2002.              The oral decision rendered on that\n\ndate was not in his favor, and he appealed to the BIA.                      The BIA\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Ms. Velasquez, Mr. Samayoa’s wife, is included in the asylum\npetition based solely on Mr. Samayoa’s experiences. While this\nopinion refers mainly to petitioner Samayoa, the decision rendered\napplies to both petitioners.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fsummarily affirmed the IJ's decision, and Samayoa petitioned this\n\ncourt for judicial review.\n\n      A. Facts\n\n      The    petitioners'    testimony    elicited    the   following    facts.\n\nMr. Samayoa's first run-in with the guerillas occurred in 1982,\n\nwhen his car was stopped by a group of guerillas who tied him up,\n\nput a gun to his head and threatened to kill him in order to\n\nsteal gasoline from him.          The guerillas warned Mr. Samayoa that\n\nif he mentioned the incident to authorities, they would kill him,\n\nand that they knew where he lived.               Instead of following the\n\nguerillas' instructions, he reported the incident to an army\n\ncolonel.     The colonel advised him that he should leave town, but\n\nMr. Samayoa did not want to, so the colonel made him an aide to\n\nthe military commissioner, a volunteer position which entitled\n\nhim to carry a gun.          Thereafter, Mr. Samayoa was promoted to\n\nmilitary commissioner, in which capacity he engaged in military\n\nrecruiting.      He also became the leader of his neighborhood civil\n\npatrol, a position that put him in charge of a group of five\n\nhundred     patrolmen   that     protected     the   village   from   guerilla\n\nfighters.\n\n      Mr. Samayoa received between thirty and fifty death threats\n\nin   the    years   after   he   became   a   military   commissioner.      The\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthreats were addressed to him by name, and explicitly stated that\n\nhe would be killed by guerillas.               In either 1987 or 1990, his\n\nwife found a bomb under his car outside their house, which she\n\nwas able to deactivate before it detonated.             In 1988, Mr. Samayoa\n\nwas falsely accused of kidnapping.              He was told afterwards that\n\nthe plan had been for someone to kill him while he was in jail.\n\n     In 1991, a land mine exploded on Mr. Samayoa's property\n\nwhile he was walking to milk his cows.                He was wounded in the\n\nface and was immediately surrounded by about eight armed men.\n\n(His son informed him later that there had been approximately\n\nsixty guerillas altogether.)            Mr. Samayoa escaped on foot after\n\nfending them off with the pistol he had been issued by the\n\nmilitary.     In the meantime, the guerillas destroyed his truck.\n\nSoldiers who went looking for the guerillas that attacked Mr.\n\nSamayoa were bombed, and seven soldiers were killed.\n\n     In     1992,   Mr.    Samayoa   was      shot   while   driving   along    a\n\nmountainous road about forty kilometers from his home.                       Other\n\nvehicles were traveling along the road as well, and Mr. Samayoa\n\nswerved to avoid a bus when a land mine exploded nearby.                At that\n\npoint,    twenty-five     to   thirty    guerillas    ran    towards   his    car,\n\nshooting at him.          Mr. Samayoa escaped when his passenger took\n\ncontrol of the vehicle and transported them to a hospital in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fJoyabaj.     There was no fighting going on in the region at the\n\ntime, and no other vehicles on the road were subjected to such an\n\nattack.     While he was at the Joyabaj hospital, the building was\n\nsubject to guerilla surveillance, but Mr. Samayoa was smuggled\n\nout and airlifted to a military hospital in Guatemala City.                  Mr.\n\nSamayoa was in a coma for three days.              He remained in intensive\n\ncare for a month and was guarded by two military personnel.\n\n     Upon    his   discharge    from    the   hospital,     Mr.    Samayoa   was\n\nunwilling to return to his home for fear of the guerillas, so his\n\nwife rented a house in Guatemala City.               He was put on active\n\npayroll by the military and received outpatient treatment at the\n\nhospital.      Even after Mr. Samayoa had relocated to Guatemala\n\nCity, the guerillas continued to search for him.\n\n     Mr.     Samayoa   determined      that   he    could    not    remain    in\n\nGuatemala, and applied for a visa at the United States embassy.\n\nHis application was denied, and although the Guatemalan military\n\nauthorities offered to help him obtain a visa, he thought it best\n\nto enter the United States illegally.          Even after he had left the\n\ncountry the guerillas continued to look for him.\n\n     B.     The IJ's Decision\n\n     The IJ did not make an express finding, one way or the\n\nother, as to Mr. Samayoa's credibility, but concluded that he had\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fnot suffered persecution on account of one or more of the five\n\nstatutory    grounds    set    forth    in    Section    101(a)(42)(A)      of   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act.             The IJ determined that the acts\n\nsuffered by Mr. Samayoa did not constitute persecution but were\n\ninstead     attributable      to     generalized    violence     in   the    area.\n\nAssuming for the sake of argument that Mr. Samayoa had been\n\npersecuted in the 1992 incident, the IJ concluded that there had\n\nnot been a showing that he had been targeted on one or more of\n\nthe five statutory grounds.            The IJ noted that Ms. Velasquez was\n\nable to live peacefully in her home with hired security and that\n\nthe guerillas had not come looking for Mr. Samayoa since shortly\n\nafter he left Guatemala in 1992.              The IJ noted that the civil war\n\nin Guatemala ended some time ago, and that although there remains\n\na high level of crime, Mr. Samayoa did not appear to have a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution on one or more of the five\n\nstatutory    grounds.        Because    Mr.    Samayoa    had   not   established\n\neligibility for asylum, he was not eligible for withholding of\n\nremoval.     The IJ concluded that there had been no showing that\n\nSamayoa    or   his   wife    were    eligible     for   protection    under     the\n\nConvention Against Torture.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f  II.   Discussion\n\n    On appeal, the BIA's findings of fact must be upheld \"unless\n\nany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"   8 U.S.C § 1252(b)(4)(B); Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359\n\nF.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).   Because the BIA summarily affirmed\n\nthe IJ's decision, we review the IJ's decision.   Laurent, 359 F.\n\n3d at 64 n.3.\n\n     As a prerequisite to establishing eligibility for asylum, an\n\nalien must establish that he is a refugee, as set forth in\n\nsection 101(a)(42)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b).   In that section, \"refugee\" is defined as:\n\n     any person who is outside any country of such person's\n     nationality or, in the case of a person having no\n     nationality, is outside any country in which such\n     person last habitually resided, and who is unable or\n     unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to\n     avail himself or herself of the protection of, that\n     country because of persecution or a well-founded fear\n     of   persecution   on  account   of  race,   religion,\n     nationality, membership in a particular social group,\n     or political opinion.\n\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).   In order to demonstrate that he is a\n\nrefugee, Mr. Samayoa must establish both that he suffers from a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution and that the feared persecution\n\nis based on one of the five statutory grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f       The crux of Mr. Samayoa's petition for judicial review is\n\nthat the IJ erred when she found that Mr. Samayoa had not been\n\nspecifically targeted because of his opposition to the guerilla\n\nmovement given the number of threats and attempts he had been\n\nsubjected to.     While Mr. Samayoa presents a sympathetic case and\n\nhis argument that he was specifically targeted has some merit, he\n\nmust also establish that he was persecuted on one of the five\n\nstatutory grounds.\n\n       Mr. Samayoa argues that his task is not to establish the\n\nexact motivation of a persecutor, but only to demonstrate the\n\nreasonableness of a motivation which is related to one of the\n\nenumerated   grounds.      While    an     alien   seeking   asylum      is   not\n\nrequired to provide direct proof of his persecutors' motives, he\n\nmust   provide   some   evidence    of    such   motives.    INS    v.   Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992).             There is little to tie\n\nthe    alleged   persecution   to    Mr.    Samayoa's   imputed      political\n\nopinion other than the fact that after the first attack, he\n\ninitiated his involvement with the military in order to secure\n\nthe right to carry a weapon.             Participation in a civil defense\n\npatrol does not by itself compel a conclusion that an individual\n\nis subject to politically-inspired persecution.                See Aguilar-\n\nSolis v. INS, 168 F. 3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).                  Mr. Samayoa\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fhas not provided such evidence as would require a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to conclude that his fear of future persecution was\n\nbased on his actual or imputed political opinion.\n\n  III. Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons set forth above, the order of the BIA is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\f",

The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied the applications, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed without opinion. Mr. Samayoa and Ms. Velasquez petition for judicial review, claiming that the IJ erred in concluding that they are ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. We affirm the BIA's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juan Alicio Samayoa Cabrera is a fifty-four-year-old man from the Quiche region of Guatemala. His claims for asylum are based on his mistreatment at the hands of guerilla fighters in Guatemala from 1982 to 1992, which he attributes to his political opinion. Following the events described below, he came to the United States illegally in 1992, and applied for asylum on December 27, 1993. His case was finally heard by an Immigration Judge on February 4, 2002. The oral decision rendered on that date was not in his favor, and he appealed to the BIA. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision, and Samayoa petitioned this court for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners' testimony elicited the following facts. Mr. Samayoa's first run-in with the guerillas occurred in 1982, when his car was stopped by a group of guerillas who tied him up, put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him in order to steal gasoline from him. The guerillas warned Mr. Samayoa that if he mentioned the incident to authorities, they would kill him, and that they knew where he lived. Instead of following the guerillas' instructions, he reported the incident to an army colonel. The colonel advised him that he should leave town, but Mr. Samayoa did not want to, so the colonel made him an aide to the military commissioner, a volunteer position which entitled him to carry a gun. Thereafter, Mr. Samayoa was promoted to military commissioner, in which capacity he engaged in military recruiting. He also became the leader of his neighborhood civil patrol, a position that put him in charge of a group of five hundred patrolmen that protected the village from guerilla fighters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Samayoa received between thirty and fifty death threats in the years after he became a military commissioner. The threats were addressed to him by name, and explicitly stated that he would be killed by guerillas. In either 1987 or 1990, his wife found a bomb under his car outside their house, which she was able to deactivate before it detonated. In 1988, Mr. Samayoa was falsely accused of kidnapping. He was told afterwards that the plan had been for someone to kill him while he was in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, a land mine exploded on Mr. Samayoa's property while he was walking to milk his cows. He was wounded in the face and was immediately surrounded by about eight armed men. (His son informed him later that there had been approximately sixty guerillas altogether.) Mr. Samayoa escaped on foot after fending them off with the pistol he had been issued by the military. In the meantime, the guerillas destroyed his truck. Soldiers who went looking for the guerillas that attacked Mr. Samayoa were bombed, and seven soldiers were killed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Mr. Samayoa was shot while driving along a mountainous road about forty kilometers from his home. Other vehicles were traveling along the road as well, and Mr. Samayoa swerved to avoid a bus when a land mine exploded nearby. At that point, twenty-five to thirty guerillas ran towards his car, shooting at him. Mr. Samayoa escaped when his passenger took control of the vehicle and transported them to a hospital in Joyabaj. There was no fighting going on in the region at the time, and no other vehicles on the road were subjected to such an attack. While he was at the Joyabaj hospital, the building was subject to guerilla surveillance, but Mr. Samayoa was smuggled out and airlifted to a military hospital in Guatemala City. Mr. Samayoa was in a coma for three days. He remained in intensive care for a month and was guarded by two military personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon his discharge from the hospital, Mr. Samayoa was unwilling to return to his home for fear of the guerillas, so his wife rented a house in Guatemala City. He was put on active payroll by the military and received outpatient treatment at the hospital. Even after Mr. Samayoa had relocated to Guatemala City, the guerillas continued to search for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Samayoa determined that he could not remain in Guatemala, and applied for a visa at the United States embassy. His application was denied, and although the Guatemalan military authorities offered to help him obtain a visa, he thought it best to enter the United States illegally. Even after he had left the country the guerillas continued to look for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The IJ's Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ did not make an express finding, one way or the other, as to Mr. Samayoa's credibility, but concluded that he had not suffered persecution on account of one or more of the five statutory grounds set forth in Section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The IJ determined that the acts suffered by Mr. Samayoa did not constitute persecution but were instead attributable to generalized violence in the area. Assuming for the sake of argument that Mr. Samayoa had been persecuted in the 1992 incident, the IJ concluded that there had not been a showing that he had been targeted on one or more of the five statutory grounds. The IJ noted that Ms. Velasquez was able to live peacefully in her home with hired security and that the guerillas had not come looking for Mr. Samayoa since shortly after he left Guatemala in 1992. The IJ noted that the civil war in Guatemala ended some time ago, and that although there remains a high level of crime, Mr. Samayoa did not appear to have a well-founded fear of future persecution on one or more of the five statutory grounds. Because Mr. Samayoa had not established eligibility for asylum, he was not eligible for withholding of removal. The IJ concluded that there had been no showing that Samayoa or his wife were eligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.
