Ocasio-Robles and Ocasio-Robles Law Offices, P.S.C. on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Pedro Santiago-Rivera and Reichard & Escalera on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 26, 2007\n\f              SMITH, District Judge.          When this case was last before\n\nus, we stated unequivocally that the Complaint in this matter\n\nfailed   to    state     any   viable   constitutional    claims.        Pagán   v.\n\nCalderón, 448 F.3d 16, 37 (1st Cir. 2006).               Given the holding in\n\nPagán, dismissal on remand by the District Court of appellant ARCAM\n\nPharmaceutical         Corporation’s    (“ARCAM”)    claims    was   inevitable.\n\nNevertheless, ARCAM now appeals the dismissal of its suit against\n\nappellees Antonio Faría and Vilma Pellot.              ARCAM argues that the\n\nPagán decision was not binding on its claims against Faría and\n\nPellot, and that the District Court erred in extending Pagán to\n\ndismiss the claims against these Defendants.                   After reviewing\n\nARCAM’s arguments and the record, we affirm the District Court’s\n\ndismissal of the suit.\n\n              The facts giving rise to the Complaint fully were set\n\nforth by this Court in Pagán, and need not be repeated in detail\n\nhere. See Pagán, 448 F.3d at 23-26.             To summarize, briefly, “[t]he\n\nunderlying     action       involves    multiple    plaintiffs    and    multiple\n\ndefendants     .   .    .   The   plaintiffs’    overarching     claim   is   that\n\nCalderón, then the governor of Puerto Rico, improperly influenced\n\nthe decision of a government lender to reject a loan sought by the\n\nmain plaintiff, ARCAM.”            Id. at 23.      All that is necessary for\n\npurposes of this appeal is as follows:             Appellees Faría and Pellot\n\nwere President and a “high ranking” official, respectively, of the\n\nBanco de Desarrollo Económico para Puerto Rico (“BDE”), the lender\n\n\n                                          3\n\fwhich denied ARCAM its sought after commercial loan for $5,000,000.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that Faría and Pellot were the vehicles through\n\nwhich Calderón exerted undue influence over BDE’s directors in\n\norder to prevent BDE from granting ARCAM’s loan request.\n\n           After this Court’s decision in Pagán, the remaining\n\nclaims of the underlying Complaint, if alive at all, were on life\n\nsupport.   In Pagán, we had before us Calderón’s appeal of the\n\nDistrict Court’s denial of her motion to dismiss all claims against\n\nher on the grounds of qualified immunity.          We first took up the\n\nissue of justiciability, and concluded that only ARCAM had standing\n\nto pursue its claims against Defendants.         We therefore dismissed\n\nthe claims of all other Plaintiffs.         With all Plaintiffs except\n\nARCAM out of the picture, and only ARCAM’s equal protection and\n\nsubstantive due process claims remaining, we turned to Calderón’s\n\nclaim of qualified immunity.        Id. at 23.      Applying the usual\n\nqualified immunity rubric, see, e.g., Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d\n\n39, 44 (1st Cir. 2004), we conclusively found that ARCAM “failed\n\nadequately to plead a violation of its constitutional rights,”\n\ndirected   the   District   Court   to   grant   Calderón’s   motion   for\n\ndismissal of all claims against her, and remanded for further\n\nconsistent proceedings.1     Pagán, 448 F.3d at 23.\n\n\n\n     1\n       Because only Calderón appealed the District Court’s Order,\nthis Court was compelled to return the case to the District Court\nfor appropriate disposition of ARCAM’s claims against Pellot and\nFaría.\n\n                                    4\n\f               On remand, the District Court quite predictably ordered\n\nthe parties to show cause why the remaining claims should not be\n\ndismissed based on the holding of Pagán.             After considering the\n\nparties’ submissions, the Court then incorporated in toto this\n\nCourt’s analysis in Pagán, and disposed of all further pending\n\nmatters, including supplemental claims raised under Puerto Rican\n\nlaw.2       Now before us is ARCAM’s last-gasp appeal of the District\n\nCourt’s dismissal of its remaining claims against Pellot and Faría.\n\nARCAM stands on shaky ground when it claims that this Court’s\n\nanalysis in Pagán was little more than dicta as to Pellot and\n\nFaría.      We have held that “when a statement in a judicial decision\n\nis essential to the result reached in the case, it becomes part of\n\nthe court’s holding.”         Rossiter v. Potter, 357 F.3d 26, 31 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).      The result, along with those portions of the opinion\n\nnecessary to the result, are binding, whereas dicta is not. Id.\n\n“Dictum constitutes neither the law of the case nor the stuff of\n\nbinding precedent,” Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy,\n\nInc., 972 F.2d 453, 459 (1st Cir. 1992); rather, it “comprises\n\nobservations      in   a   judicial   opinion   or   order   that   are   ‘not\n\nessential’ to the determination of the legal questions then before\n\nthe court.”       Municipality of San Juan v. Rullán, 318 F.3d 26, 29\n\nn.3 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Dedham Water Co., 972 F.2d at 459);\n\n\n\n        2\n       These claims, sounding solely in the law of Puerto Rico,\nwere dismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                       5\n\fsee also Pierre N. Leval, Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta\n\nAbout Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249, 1256 (2006) (Dictum is\n\nsuperfluous content - “an assertion in a court’s opinion of a\n\nproposition of law which does not explain why the court’s judgment\n\ngoes in favor of the winner”).\n\n          Because Calderón was the sole appellant in Pagán, our\n\nreversal of the District Court’s refusal to dismiss ARCAM’s equal\n\nprotection and substantive due process claims technically related\n\nonly to those allegations aimed at Calderón.     However, the holding\n\nwas premised on the essential finding that ARCAM’s allegations “do\n\nnot state viable constitutional claims,” a determination that was\n\nby no means uniquely applicable to Calderón, but instead spoke\n\nbroadly to the failings of the Complaint as a whole.           Pagán, 448\n\nF.3d at 37.\n\n          As   to   ARCAM’s     specific   allegation   that     Calderón\n\ntransgressed its substantive due process rights when, through\n\nPellot and Faría, she exerted undue influence over BDE’s directors\n\nso that they would deny ARCAM’s loan request, we concluded that\n\n“the mere withholding of the loan, simplicitor, cannot support a\n\nconstitutional claim.”        Id. at 33.    This conclusion required\n\ndismissal of ARCAM’s substantive due process claim, was not dicta,\n\nand applies with equal force to the identical claims alleged\n\nagainst Pellot and Faría. We were similarly forthright with regard\n\nto ARCAM’s equal protection claim: “. . . [the claim]           does not\n\n\n                                    6\n\fpass constitutional muster.”   Id. at 35.    Here, the analysis was\n\ntwo-pronged: first, ARCAM failed to plead facts establishing that\n\na similarly situated borrower was treated differently than it; and\n\nsecond, the Complaint offered no allegations indicating that the\n\ndisparate treatment of which ARCAM complains resulted from a gross\n\nabuse of power, invidious discrimination, or fundamentally unfair\n\nprocedures.3   These flaws doomed ARCAM’s equal protection claims\n\nagainst all remaining Defendants, not just Calderón.\n\n          Though our holding in Pagán was limited to Calderón’s\n\nappeal, it cannot, as ARCAM urges, reasonably be read in isolation\n\nfrom the case as a whole.   Rather, as set forth above, the core\n\nholding of Pagán – that the Complaint in this matter fails to\n\nallege viable constitutional claims - extends with equal, if not\n\nmore force to allegations aimed at Pellot and Faría.   In sum, with\n\nour holding in Pagán, we sounded the death knell for ARCAM’s\n\nremaining claims against Pellot and Faría, leaving the District\n\nCourt no choice but to bring down the axe.\n\n          The Order of the District Court dated November 27, 2006\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n     3\n       To the extent that ARCAM seeks to rely on its equal\nprotection and due process claims against Calderón, Pellot, and\nFaría to redress what it alleges to have been unconstitutional\npolitical discrimination or retaliation, it cannot do so. Pagán v.\nCalderón, 448 F.3d 16, 34, 36-7 (1st Cir. 2006).       Rather, the\nproper avenue for such assertions is a First Amendment claim, one\nwhich ARCAM brought, and which the District Court below dismissed\nas to all Defendants in its March 30, 2005 Opinion and Order.

Condon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201063\"><a href=\"/opinion/201063/limone-v-condon/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2004), we conclusively found that ARCAM \"failed adequately to plead a violation of its constitutional rights,\" directed the District Court to grant Calderón's motion for dismissal of all claims against her, and remanded for further consistent proceedings.<sup>[1]</sup><i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 23.</p>\n<p>On remand, the District Court quite predictably ordered the parties to show cause why the remaining claims should not be dismissed based on the holding of <i>Pagán.</i> After considering the parties' submissions, the Court then incorporated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> <i>in toto</i> this Court's analysis in <i>Pagán,</i> and disposed of all further pending matters, including supplemental claims raised under Puerto Rican law.<sup>[2]</sup> Now before us is ARCAM's last-gasp appeal of the District Court's dismissal of its remaining claims against Pellot and Faría. ARCAM stands on shaky ground when it claims that this Court's analysis in <i>Pagán</i> was little more than dicta as to Pellot and Faría. We have held that \"when a statement in a judicial decision is essential to the result reached in the case, it becomes part of the court's holding.\" <i>Rossiter v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200832\"><a href=\"/opinion/200832/rossiter-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2004). The result, along with those portions of the opinion necessary to the result, are binding, whereas dicta is not. <i>Id.</i> \"Dictum constitutes neither the law of the case nor the stuff of binding precedent,\" <i>Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy; Inc.,</i> 972 F.2d 453; 459 (1st Cir. 1992); rather, it \"comprises observations in a judicial opinion or order that are `not essential' to the determination of the legal questions then before the court.\" <i>Municipality of San Juan v. Rullan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200302\"><a href=\"/opinion/200302/municipality-of-san-v-rullan/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29 n. 3 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Dedham Water Co.,</i> 972 F.2d at 459); <i>see also</i> Pierre N. Leval, <i>Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta,</i> 81 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1249, 1256 (2006) (Dictum is superfluous content\"an assertion in a court's opinion of a proposition of law which does not explain why the court's judgment goes in favor of the winner\").</p>\n<p>Because Calderón was the sole appellant in <i>Pagán,</i> our reversal of the District Court's refusal to dismiss ARCAM's equal protection and substantive due process claims technically related only to those allegations aimed at Calderón. However, the holding was premised on the essential finding that ARCAM's allegations \"do not state viable constitutional claims,\" a determination that was by no means uniquely applicable to Calderón, but instead spoke broadly to the failings of the Complaint as a whole. <i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 37.</p>\n<p>As to ARCAM's specific allegation that Calderón transgressed its substantive due process rights when, through Pellot and Faría, she exerted undue influence over BDE's directors so that they would deny ARCAM's loan request, we concluded that \"the mere withholding of the loan, simplicitor, cannot support a constitutional claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 33. This conclusion required dismissal of ARCAM's substantive due process claim, was not dicta, and applies with equal force to the identical claims alleged against Pellot and Faría. We were similarly forthright with regard to ARCAM's equal protection claim: \". . . . [the claim] does not pass constitutional muster.\" <i>Id.</i> at 35. Here, the analysis was two-pronged:. first, ARCAM failed to plead facts establishing that a similarly situated borrower was treated differently than it; and second, the Complaint offered no allegations indicating that the disparate treatment of which ARCAM complains resulted from a gross abuse of power, invidious discrimination, or fundamentally unfair procedures.<sup>[3]</sup> These flaws doomed ARCAM's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> equal protection claims against all remaining Defendants, not just Calderón.</p>\n<p>Though our holding in <i>Pagán</i> was limited to Calderón's appeal, it cannot, as ARCAM urges, reasonably be read in isolation from the case as a whole. Rather, as set forth above, the core holding of <i>Pagán</i>that the Complaint in this matter fails to allege viable constitutional claims extends with equal, if not more force to allegations aimed at Pellot and Faría. In sum, with our holding in <i>Pagán,</i> we sounded the death knell for ARCAM's remaining claims against Pellot and Faría, leaving the District Court no choice but to bring down the axe.</p>\n<p>The Order of the District Court dated November 27, 2006 is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Because only Calderón appealed the District Court's Order, this Court was compelled to return the case to the District Court for appropriate disposition of ARCAM's claims against Pellot and Faría.</p>\n<p>[2]  These claims, sounding solely in the law of Puerto Rico, were dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p>[3]  To the extent that ARCAM seeks to rely on its equal protection and due process claims against Calderón; Pellot, and Faría to redress what it alleges to have been unconstitutional political discrimination or retaliation, it cannot do so. <i>Pagan v. Calderón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202216\"><a href=\"/opinion/202216/pagan-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 34, 36-7 (1st Cir.2006). Rather, the proper avenue for such assertions is a First Amendment claim, one which ARCAM brought, and which the District Court below dismissed as to all Defendants in its March 30, 2005 Opinion and Order. <i>See id.</i> at 36.</p>\n\n</div>",
