Plaintiff International\n\nStrategies Group, Ltd. (\"ISG\") brought suit against attorney A.\n\nJohn   Pappalardo and two law firms, Greenburg Traurig, LLP (\"GT\"),\n\nPappalardo's current firm, and Eckert, Seamans, Cherin & Mellott,\n\nLLC (\"ESCM\"), Pappalardo's former firm.         ISG's claims against\n\ndefendants arose from the loss of roughly $4 million, which it\n\ninvested with Corporation of the BankHouse (\"COB\"), a Boston-based\n\ninvestment firm.   Attorney Pappalardo represented COB as it sought\n\nto recover about $19 million, including ISG's funds, that COB had\n\nlost through a series of fraudulent transfers.\n\n           The district court granted summary judgment as to all of\n\nISG's claims against the three defendants, finding a failure to\n\ndemonstrate    causation   and   to   file   within   the   statute   of\n\nlimitations.    We affirm, concluding that summary judgment was\n\nappropriate as to ISG's negligence, misrepresentation, breach of\n\nfiduciary duty, breach of contract, and 93A unfair trade practices\n\nclaims because no attorney-client relationship was formed between\n\nISG and any of the defendants.          Further, we hold that ISG's\n\nremaining two claims, for conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud\n\nand breach of fiduciary duty, fail because they were not filed\n\nwithin the statutory period.     We also affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of ISG's motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                I. Background\n\n             This    case   involves      a    complex      set     of    financial\n\ntransactions involving numerous individuals and entities.                         We do\n\nnot delve into every nuance in our recitation of the facts below,\n\nbut only those necessary to explain our decision.                  Because we are\n\nreviewing a grant of summary judgment, we draw all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of the non-moving party, ISG.                 Maldonado-Denis\n\nv. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nA. The Scheme\n\n             ISG, a Hong Kong-based company, invested $4 million with\n\nCOB    in   April   1998,   through    COB's   so-called         \"Federal    Reserve\n\nGuarantee Program.\" COB told potential investors that this program\n\ngenerated profits by controlling the circulation of U.S. dollars.\n\nCOB promised investors substantial profits, along with a guarantee\n\nof    non-depletion    of   their   original        investment.       Having       been\n\nessentially promised profit at zero risk, ISG transferred its $4\n\nmillion investment to a COB account at ABN Amro Bank in Belgium on\n\nMay   15,   1998.     Two   weeks     later,   on    May   29,    1998,     COB    made\n\nunauthorized transfers of $821,500 of ISG's investment into an ESCM\n\nbank account in Pennsylvania, and $328,500 into a COB bank account\n\nin Boston. Both transactions violated the non-depletion agreement,\n\nand were made without ISG's permission or knowledge.\n\n             COB then engaged in a Ponzi scheme, according to ISG's\n\nallegations, using funds from new investors to cover the depletion\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fof funds provided by previous investors, amounting to millions of\n\ndollars in ill-gotten gains by COB and a variety of individuals and\n\nentities not involved in this suit. ISG estimates that COB amassed\n\nabout $19 million dollars through this scheme, and then transferred\n\nthese   funds    in     November   1998,    without    the    permission    of   any\n\ninvestor, to an entity called Swan Trust.                   Henry Pearlberg, the\n\ntrustee of Swan Trust, then depleted the Swan Trust account through\n\na series of transactions in late 1998 and early 1999, depositing\n\nmost of the money ($16.7 million) in an account held by First\n\nMerchant Bank (\"FMB\"), which ISG characterizes as a \"rogue Northern\n\nCyprus bank.\"         Pearlberg also appropriated about $2.3 million for\n\nhis own use.      ISG alleges that FMB dissipated the $16.7 million\n\naccount through yet another series of fraudulent transactions from\n\nFebruary to May 1999.\n\n           In April 1999, COB and its CEO, James Pomeroy, persuaded\n\nPearlberg to execute a Deed of Assignment, which assigned to\n\nPomeroy, as agent for COB, all rights to the misappropriated funds\n\nheld by FMB, Swan Trust, and Pearlberg.                    In July 1999, Pomeroy\n\nreceived a disbursement of $1.2 million from FMB based on this\n\nassignment.       These recovered funds were not passed on to the\n\ninvestors,      but    were   retained     by   COB   or   Pomeroy   and   are   now\n\ndissipated.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fB. Attempts to Recover Dissipated Funds\n\n            In June 1998, ISG had become concerned that COB was not\n\nhonoring the non-depletion agreement and unsuccessfully sought\n\nassurance from COB that its funds were intact.         By mid-1999 ISG's\n\ndirector,   Phillip   Clark,   a   Hong   Kong   attorney,   was   actively\n\ninvestigating COB's handling of ISG's investment.            By then, ISG\n\nknew that COB had transferred funds to Swan Trust, and that\n\nPearlberg had subsequently transferred the majority of those funds\n\nto the FMB account.       By this time, ISG also had learned of\n\nPearlberg's assignment to Pomeroy and Pomeroy's recovery of $1.2\n\nmillion based on the assignment.     By April 2000, ISG had learned of\n\nCOB's initial depletion of its investment -- the May 1998 transfers\n\nto the ESCM and COB accounts in the United States.1\n\n            In July 1999, Pappalardo, then an attorney with ESCM,\n\nbegan representing COB. On August 11, 1999, COB's Pomeroy sent ISG\n\nan email detailing COB's \"options for retrieval\" of the lost funds.\n\nPomeroy also informed ISG that, \"I have chosen to move to prepare\n\nlitigation against the parties utilizing the law firm of Greenberg\n\n& Traurig. I have utilized the law firm of Seamin Cherin & Melott\n\n[sic] for the criminal assistance against the parties.\"\n\n\n     1\n      ISG learned much of this information from its cooperation\nwith a Belgian judge's investigation into the COB fraud.       ISG\ncommunicated with Belgian authorities on its own, without\nassistance from Pappalardo. Indeed, during this period, ISG admits\nthat it filed a criminal complaint with the Belgian authorities\nagainst a COB employee, Albert Pans.    ISG filed this complaint\nwithout the assistance of Pappalardo.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f               During this same period, ISG's Clark flew to Boston to\n\nconfront COB over the missing funds.             When the parties met in\n\nBoston, Pappalardo told Clark that he had been retained by COB;\n\nthat COB was also a victim of the fraudulent scheme; that all\n\nnecessary steps, including litigation, would be taken to recover\n\nthe funds; and that any independent action by ISG against COB,\n\nPomeroy,       or     other   parties    would   jeopardize   Pappalardo's\n\nnegotiations to recover the missing funds.         ISG alleges that these\n\nrepresentations, and other events that we detail below, led it to\n\nbelieve that Pappalardo was ISG's legal representative and that an\n\nattorney-client relationship had been formed.2\n\n               Pappalardo informed ISG on several occasions that a\n\nnegotiated recovery of the funds was imminent, as was COB's filing\n\nof a civil complaint against the perpetrators of the fraud.          When\n\nPappalardo had neither recovered the funds nor filed a complaint in\n\nover two years, ISG finally retained outside counsel on November 7,\n\n2001.       Through counsel, ISG filed suit against COB and Pomeroy in\n\nMarch 2002.         ISG obtained a $10 million judgment in that suit, but\n\nthe award has proven uncollectible.           ISG also filed suit against\n\nABN Amro Bank, FMB, and two individuals associated with COB's\n\nscheme.       Those suits are currently pending.\n\n\n        2\n      ISG alleges that it established three attorney-client\nrelationships, one with each defendant. However, for simplicity,\nthis opinion analyzes only the alleged ISG-Pappalardo relationship,\nbecause it is the only hook for ISG's allegations regarding the\nfirms. Pappalardo left ESCM for GT on March 13, 2001.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fC. Proceedings Below\n\n           ISG brought three claims against all three defendants:\n\nnegligence, in the form of legal malpractice; misrepresentation;\n\nand violation of Chapter 93A, the Massachusetts consumer protection\n\nlaw, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 1 et seq.      ISG brought two\n\nadditional claims against Pappalardo alone, for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and breach of express and implied contract.      Finally, ISG\n\nbrought two claims against ESCM alone, for conversion, and aiding\n\nand abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, based on the May\n\n1998 transfer of funds to ESCM's escrow account.\n\n           Defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. The\n\ndistrict court declined the defendants' request to grant summary\n\njudgment on the ground that no attorney-client relationship was\n\nformed. However, holding that ISG had failed to establish a viable\n\ntheory of causation, the court granted summary judgment as to most\n\nof ISG's claims, including negligence, misrepresentation, violation\n\nof Chapter 93A, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.\n\nThe court also granted summary judgment as to the remaining two\n\nclaims -- conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of\n\nfiduciary duty -- concluding that the statute of limitations had\n\nexpired.\n\n           ISG filed a motion for reconsideration or relief from\n\njudgment, which the district court denied. ISG timely appealed the\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fdistrict court's grant of summary judgment and denial of its motion\n\nfor reconsideration.\n\n                           II. Analysis\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n          On appeal, we review a district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party. See Fontánez-Núñez v. Janssen Ortho LLC, 447\n\nF.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is appropriate where\n\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.      See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).   An appellate court is not \"tied to the district court's\n\nrationale,\" but may affirm a grant of summary judgment \"on any\n\nground revealed by the record.\"    Iverson v. City of Boston, 452\n\nF.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          We review a district court's denial of a motion for\n\nreconsideration or relief from judgment for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Ruíz-Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2000).      \"To\n\nobtain relief, the movant must demonstrate either that newly\n\ndiscovered evidence (not previously available) has come to light or\n\nthat the rendering court committed a manifest error of law.\"\n\nPalmer v. Champion Mortgage, 465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fB. Duty of Care\n\n               Most of ISG's claims3 against defendants are predicated\n\non establishing the existence of an attorney-client relationship or\n\nother duty of care between ISG and the defendants, including the\n\nclaims of negligence,4 misrepresentation,5 and violation of Chapter\n\n93A.6       In addition, ISG's claims against Pappalardo, for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty and breach of contract, are also predicated on the\n\nexistence of an attorney-client relationship or other duty of care\n\nbetween Pappalardo and ISG.7\n\n\n        3\n      All parties agree that Massachusetts law governs ISG's\nclaims. See Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 n.2 (1st Cir.\n1987) (a federal court \"ordinarily should\" honor an agreement\nbetween the parties as to what substantive law controls).\n        4\n      See Miller v. Mooney, 431 Mass. 57, 725 N.E.2d 545, 549\n(2000) (under Massachusetts law \"[e]xistence of an attorney-client\nrelationship is an element of a malpractice plaintiff's proof.\").\n        5\n      A misrepresentation claim can rest upon an attorney-client\nrelationship, or a duty to a nonclient where \"the attorney knows\n[the nonclient] will rely on the services rendered.\" Miller, 725\nN.E.2d at 550 (quoting Robertson v. Gaston Snow & Ely Bartlett, 404\nMass. 515, 536 N.E.2d 344, 350, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 894 (1989)).\n        6\n      In Robertson, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held\nthat, where a plaintiff's 93A claim alleges unfair or deceptive\nacts during the course of the defendant's \"legal representation of\nthe plaintiff,\" proof of \"an attorney-client relationship between\nthe plaintiff and [defendant] is critical to the plaintiff's 93A\nclaim.\" 536 N.E.2d at 351. Here, ISG predicated its 93A claim on\nthe existence of an attorney-client relationship with defendants.\nSpecifically, ISG's 93A count alleges that the defendants wrongly\n\"under[took] joint representation\" and committed unfair and\ndeceptive acts while \"representing ISG.\"\n        7\n      ISG's complaint alleges the existence of a fiduciary duty\nbased on Pappalardo's \"undertaking to represent ISG.\" Similarly,\nISG's claim of breach of express or implied contract is based on\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          ISG puts forth two theories for the existence of a duty\n\nof care by defendants.     First, ISG argues that an attorney-client\n\nrelationship was in fact formed.        Second, ISG avers that \"the\n\nforbearance of ISG induced by Pappalardo while at GT and ESCM,\n\ncreated a duty of care.\"    This second argument is an invocation of\n\nthe foreseeable reliance exception that, under Massachusetts law,\n\ncreates a duty of care toward nonclients.     See Sheinkopf v. Stone,\n\n927 F.2d 1259, 1268 (1st Cir. 1991).        Thus, we first examine\n\nwhether an attorney-client relationship was created in fact; if\n\nnot, we then consider whether the foreseeable reliance exception\n\nfor nonclients applies in this case.\n\n          1.   Attorney-Client Relationship\n\n          Under Massachusetts law, an attorney-client relationship\n\nmay be shown by an express contract, see Miller, 725 N.E.2d at 549,\n\nor may be implied \"when (1) a person seeks advice or assistance\n\nfrom an attorney, (2) the advice or assistance sought pertains to\n\nmatters within the attorney's professional competence, and (3) the\n\nattorney expressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually gives\n\nthe advice or assistance,\" DeVaux v. Am. Home Assurance Co., 387\n\nMass. 814, 444 N.E.2d 355, 357 (1983) (quoting Kurtenback v.\n\nTeKippe, 260 N.W.2d 53, 56 (Iowa 1977)).      The third prong of the\n\nDeVaux test may be established \"by proof of detrimental reliance,\n\n\n\nthe existence of an obligation by Pappalardo \"to use utmost good\nfaith and due care in protecting ISG's interests.\"\n\n                                 -10-\n\fwhen the person seeking legal services reasonably relies on the\n\nattorney to provide them, and the attorney, aware of such reliance,\n\ndoes nothing to negate it.\"   Id.\n\n          It is not entirely clear whether ISG alleges that an\n\nexpress attorney-client relationship was formed.    Nonetheless, we\n\ncan easily conclude that this is not the case.          There is no\n\nevidence here of a retainer agreement or other contract for legal\n\nservices between ISG and any of the defendants; nor is there\n\nevidence of billing or remittances for such services.\n\n          ISG points to the power of attorney that it executed in\n\nfavor of Pappalardo in July 2000, authorizing him to transfer to an\n\ninterest bearing escrow account any funds belonging to ISG that he\n\nsucceeded in recovering from Swan Trust. However, by executing the\n\npower of attorney, ISG granted only a circumscribed agency power to\n\nPappalardo in order to facilitate the physical return of the\n\nmissing funds.   While the power of attorney may have some impact on\n\nour analysis of whether an implied attorney-client relationship was\n\nformed, it is certain that such a limited power of attorney did not\n\ncreate an express attorney-client relationship.     See Williams v.\n\nDugan, 217 Mass. 526, 528, 105 N.E. 615 (1914) (noting that a power\n\nof attorney creates limited agency relationship as to expressly\n\nenumerated powers and no additional powers may be inferred); see\n\nalso Bachner v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, 113 F.R.D. 644, 649 (D.\n\nAlaska 1987) (\"A power of attorney establishes the relationship of\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fattorney-in-fact, which is an agency relationship different from\n\nthe relationship of an attorney-at-law.\").\n\n           We turn next to ISG's contention that an attorney-client\n\nrelationship was created by implication, under the DeVaux three-\n\npart test.    On appeal, ISG contends that, based on Pappalardo's\n\nassurance that he represented the interests of the investors and\n\nhis warnings that filing independent charges would jeopardize his\n\nattempts to negotiate a recovery of the funds, ISG reasonably\n\nbelieved   that    Pappalardo   was    its   attorney   and   forebore    from\n\npursuing independent legal action on that basis. In contrast, the\n\ndefendants    maintain   that   Pappalardo     made   clear   that   he   only\n\nrepresented COB, and ISG demonstrated an understanding of this\n\nfact; that ISG never relied on Pappalardo for legal services; and\n\nthat ISG, as a sophisticated, represented entity, understood that\n\nits position was potentially adverse to Pappalardo's client, and\n\nindeed threatened suit against COB on this basis several times.\n\n           Our analysis of whether an implied relationship was\n\ncreated must start with the conjunctive, three-part DeVaux test.\n\nUnder part one of the test, we ask whether ISG sought legal advice\n\nor assistance from Pappalardo. See DeVaux, 444 N.E.2d at 357.\n\nCourts interpreting DeVaux have understood this first prong to\n\nrequire concrete communication by the plaintiff requesting that the\n\nattorney represent him, or explicitly seeking individualized legal\n\nadvisement.       For example, in Robertson v. Gaston Snow & Ely\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fBartlett,     404   Mass.    515,   536   N.E.2d   344,   351   (1989),   the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") found no implied\n\nattorney-client relationship between a corporate officer and a law\n\nfirm   representing    the    corporation,    where   the   officer    never\n\nexplicitly requested that the firm represent him regarding his\n\nemployment status at the corporation after a reorganization.              The\n\nSJC reached this conclusion even though the officer had previously\n\nbeen a client of the firm in regard to other matters, had numerous\n\ndiscussions with the firm about the corporate reorganization and\n\nhis future employment with the corporation, and had requested and\n\nreceived a sample employment agreement from the firm.           Id.   The SJC\n\nconcluded that an implied relationship cannot be formed without\n\nactive communication from the plaintiff to the lawyer requesting\n\nlegal representation or legal advice:\n\n            In spite of several written and many oral\n            communications between the plaintiff and the\n            other participants, the plaintiff introduced\n            no evidence of a specific reference to [the\n            firm] as his personal counsel. His claim is\n            essentially, therefore, that he thought that\n            [the firm] represented him but that he\n            failed to communicate his thought to anyone.\n\nId. at 349.\n\n            Similarly, in Sheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1266-67\n\n(1st Cir. 1991), this court held that no implied attorney-client\n\nrelationship arose under Massachusetts law between an attorney and\n\nan investor, where the investor bought into a joint investment\n\nventure managed by the attorney.            We reached this result even\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthough the attorney prepared various legal documents for the\n\ninvestor's signature and requested that he sign them; promised to\n\n\"protect\" the investor; told the investor that \"other clients of\n\n[the firm]\" were also investing in the venture; listed the firm's\n\naddress on the joint venture's legal documents; and transacted\n\njoint venture business out of his law firm office and with the\n\nassistance of his law firm secretary.         Id. at 1265-66.    This court\n\nfound particularly persuasive that the investor \"never explicitly\n\nrequested [the attorney] or [the law firm] to represent him, never\n\nsought any legal advice from them, and was never billed for\n\nservices.\"    Id. at 1268.\n\n           Here, ISG's claim is in some ways weaker than those of\n\nplaintiffs in Robertson and Sheinkopf.             Not only is there no\n\nevidence     or   allegation   that    ISG   explicitly   requested   legal\n\nrepresentation from Pappalardo, but on at least two occasions ISG\n\nacknowledged that it was not Pappalardo's client.               First, in a\n\nMarch 30, 2000, letter, Clark wrote to Pappalardo:\n\n           While   I  appreciate   that  you   act  for\n           Corporation of the Bankhouse (COB), I find\n           that your failure to respond to any of our\n           correspondence insulting and unprofessional.\n           It is not beyond the parameters of your\n           ethical requirements for you to correspond\n           with International Strategies Group (ISG) on\n           COB's instruction.\n\n(emphasis added).      Second, on August 15, 2001, having grown more\n\nfrustrated at Pappalardo's lack of communication and failure to\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\frecover the funds through negotiation, C.M. Barber, another ISG\n\ndirector, wrote to Pappalardo:\n\n            John, you seem to be testing our resolve to\n            take [independent] action. How do we respond?\n            . . . We can prepare a comprehensive complaint\n            to the Massachusetts State Bar with respect to\n            your treatment of us as third parties,\n            particularly in the circumstances of the Power\n            of Attorney.\n\n(emphasis added).    These acknowledgments that Pappalardo did not\n\nrepresent ISG were consistent with Pappalardo's advisement to ISG\n\non at least two occasions that he represented COB alone. Following\n\nPappalardo's first meeting with ISG, he wrote to Clark on August\n\n20, 1999:\n\n            As you know, I am counsel along with others,\n            for Societè Bank House (\"C.O.B.\") and\n            represent that entity and its employees in\n            connection with certain matters arising from\n            their relationship with Swan Trust and its\n            successors.\n\nThree months later, Pappalardo began a letter to ISG's Barber with\n\na similar notification:     \"I am writing to you at the request of my\n\nclient, Corporation of the BankHouse, Incorporated ('COB') in\n\nconnection   with   the   recovery    of    funds   from   the   transactions\n\ninvolving the Swan Trust.\"\n\n            In addition, there is no evidence that ISG requested\n\nlegal advice from Pappalardo respecting ISG's potential individual\n\nclaims.8     Such a request would have raised a serious ethical\n\n\n     8\n      There is evidence that ISG asked Pappalardo on several\noccasions about the status of COB's potential civil claims to\n\n                                     -15-\n\fdilemma for Pappalardo, as one of ISG's foremost claims would have\n\nbeen against COB, Pappalardo's client.              Indeed, in a March 23,\n\n2000, letter to COB, ISG's Clark acknowledged that ISG did not have\n\nan attorney-client relationship with COB's attorneys, and therefore\n\nprodded   COB   to   consult   with   its    own   attorneys   regarding   the\n\nprospects for a COB civil suit:\n\n           [W]e are of the view that the urgent\n           instigation of civil proceedings against\n           Swan Trust, May Davis and others is now a\n           priority.   May we seek your consultation\n           with your civil attorneys as to the process\n           and timing of implementing same. It is our\n           view that there will be economies in process\n           and costs through the various investors\n           and/or their fiduciary proceeding in concert\n           and together with Corporation of the\n           BankHouse (\"CoB\") in its separate function\n           as fiduciary to such parties. There would\n           be a requirement for all such parties to be\n           privy   to   the  benefits   of   a   client\n           relationship with your appointed attorneys.\n\n\n(emphasis added).     Though ISG here proposed a joint representation\n\nof all the investors by COB's attorneys, there is no evidence or\n\n\n\n\nrecover the funds, including an August 16, 2001, letter from ISG to\nPappalardo. However, ISG asking COB's attorney about potential COB\nclaims is quite different from ISG seeking legal advice from\nPappalardo regarding its own potential claims, and is not\nsufficient to satisfy prong one of DeVaux. Further, even if such\na request for information might in some circumstances satisfy prong\none, the record shows, and ISG concedes, that Pappalardo never\nprovided ISG with the information it sought regarding COB's\npotential civil claims. Therefore, the third prong of DeVaux --\nthe provision of the requested legal services -- would not be\nsatisfied, and no implied relationship could be said to have\narisen.\n\n                                      -16-\n\feven allegation that COB responded to this proposal or took any\n\naction to implement it.\n\n            In sum, the record indicates that ISG did not explicitly\n\nrequest legal representation from Pappalardo, nor did it seek\n\nadvice regarding its own legal position vis-à-vis the entities\n\nimplicated in the fraud.        Therefore, we conclude that ISG has set\n\nforth    insufficient   facts    to   support   its   claim   of    an   implied\n\nrelationship under part one of the DeVaux test.\n\n            We turn next to the third prong of the DeVaux test,9 and\n\nask whether Pappalardo expressly or impliedly agreed to give or\n\nactually gave the requested advice or assistance.             See DeVaux, 444\n\nN.E.2d at 357.     This prong may be satisfied if ISG reasonably\n\nrelied on Pappalardo to provide legal services, and Pappalardo,\n\naware of such reliance, did nothing to negate it.             Id.\n\n            The reasonable reliance test captures the essence of\n\nISG's allegation that an implied relationship was created.                  ISG\n\nargues that Pappalardo urged it not to proceed on its own, but\n\nrather to wait for Pappalardo to orchestrate a negotiated return of\n\nthe missing funds on behalf of the \"team\" of investors; therefore,\n\nthe argument goes, ISG reasonably relied on Pappalardo to provide\n\nlegal services, and Pappalardo, aware of this reliance, did nothing\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      We temporarily skip prong two of DeVaux as our analysis of\nprong three will shed considerable light on the outcome under prong\ntwo. We revisit prong two at the end of this section.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fto negate the impression that he was acting as ISG's attorney.\n\nHowever, the facts before us do not support this account.\n\n            The    problem    with   ISG's   allegation   here   is   that   no\n\nevidence suggests that ISG was relying on Pappalardo to provide ISG\n\nwith legal services.         Instead, all the evidence suggests that ISG\n\nwas relying on Pappalardo to recover the funds for COB, with the\n\nexpectation that ISG would be an eventual financial beneficiary of\n\nsuch a recovery.       Pappalardo told ISG that, in his opinion, his\n\nnegotiations were more likely to lead to a recovery of the missing\n\nfunds if ISG refrained from filing its own charges.               This was a\n\nstrategic opinion from the attorney of a potential adversary, which\n\nISG was free to accept at face value, ignore, or seek legal advice\n\nregarding.        ISG chose to forego its own action, expecting to\n\nbenefit financially from a successful COB recovery. However, ISG's\n\nanticipated financial benefit does not transform Pappalardo's legal\n\nwork on behalf of COB into a duty to ISG.                  Nor does ISG's\n\nexpectation of an eventual financial recovery support the notion\n\nthat it was reasonable for ISG to rely on Pappalardo for legal\n\nservices.\n\n            This situation is analogous to one the SJC confronted in\n\nSpinner v. Nutt, 417 Mass. 549, 631 N.E.2d 542 (1994).                 There,\n\ntrust beneficiaries brought suit against the attorneys for the\n\nestate's trustees.      The SJC found no duty of care as between the\n\nestate's attorneys and the estate's beneficiaries: \"The fact that\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthird parties are thus benefitted, or damaged, by the attorney's\n\nperformance does not give rise to a duty by the attorney to such\n\nthird parties, and hence cannot be the basis for a cause of action\n\nby the third parties for the attorney's negligence.\"           Id. at 546\n\n(quoting Goldberg v. Frye, 266 Cal. Rptr. 483, 489 (Cal. Ct. App.\n\n1990)).   The SJC concluded that, \"In these cases the third parties\n\nare incidental beneficiaries, and '[a]n incidental benefit does not\n\nsuffice to impose a duty upon the attorney.'\" Id. (quoting Ronald\n\nE. Mallen and Jeffrey M. Smith, 1 Legal Malpractice § 7.11 (3d ed.\n\n1989)).\n\n           Similarly here, where ISG relied on Pappalardo to recover\n\nthe missing money on behalf of COB, rather than to provide ISG\n\ndirectly with legal counsel, ISG put itself in the position of an\n\nincidental third-party financial beneficiary, and therefore no\n\nimplied attorney-client relationship was established.          ISG relied\n\non Pappalardo only to recover the missing funds for COB, not to\n\nprovide ISG with legal services.\n\n           Furthermore, assuming arguendo that ISG did rely on\n\nPappalardo    to   provide   direct   legal   services,   no   reasonable\n\nfactfinder could conclude that ISG's reliance in this regard was\n\nreasonable.   ISG attempts to rebut this conclusion by pointing to\n\nseveral pieces of evidence, including three statements made by\n\nPappalardo.    ISG notes that: (1) Pappalardo sent ISG an \"action\n\nplan\" for recovery of the funds which noted that he \"represent[ed]\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fthe team,\" comprised of the investors and COB; (2) Pappalardo told\n\nISG that COB and ISG's interests were \"one and the same\"; and (3)\n\nPappalardo told ISG that he was preparing a civil suit against the\n\nfraudulent parties \"to protect [ISG's] interest.\"\n\n           However, these comments must be analyzed in the broader\n\ncontext of the parties' course of dealing.             As discussed above,\n\nPappalardo had told ISG on several occasions that he represented\n\nCOB alone, and ISG made several statements which indicated its\n\nunderstanding    of   this    arrangement.    Also,    ISG   had   chosen    to\n\nforebear in bringing its own legal action, hoping instead that\n\nPappalardo's negotiations on behalf of COB would succeed, resulting\n\nin an eventual financial benefit to ISG.        Finally, ISG was aware of\n\nits ability to bring suit against COB and Pomeroy, and reminded\n\nPappalardo and COB of this fact on several occasions.\n\n           Evaluating the three statements cited by ISG in this\n\nlarger context, we conclude that ISG's alleged reliance was not\n\nreasonable.     First, Pappalardo's statement in the \"action plan\"\n\nthat he represented the investors as a team simply reflected the\n\nreality that ISG had chosen to coordinate its strategy with COB by\n\ndeferring individual action in favor of Pappalardo's efforts to\n\nrecover   the   funds   for    COB.     Pappalardo's   statement    that     he\n\nrepresented the team is even less problematic than that made by the\n\nattorney in Sheinkopf, who told an investor that \"other clients of\n\n[the firm]\" were also investing in the attorney's venture.                  927\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fF.2d at 1265. We were unpersuaded in Sheinkopf that that statement\n\nwas a reasonable basis for an implied relationship.   In this case,\n\nPappalardo's statement accurately reflected a choice made by ISG to\n\nforebear in favor of Pappalardo's efforts on COB's behalf.\n\n          Second, Pappalardo's statement that the interests of his\n\nclient and ISG were one and the same also did not form a reasonable\n\nbasis for ISG's reliance on Pappalardo for legal services.       As\n\ndiscussed above, ISG had threatened to sue COB and Pomeroy on\n\nseveral occasions, indicating that it was well aware that their\n\ninterests were not fully aligned.\n\n          Third, when read in the context of the entire letter,\n\nPappalardo's statement that he was preparing a civil suit on behalf\n\nof COB in order to \"protect [ISG's] interest\" also does not provide\n\na reasonable basis for ISG's reliance.     ISG highlights just one\n\nsentence in the October 22, 1999, letter from Pappalardo to ISG:\n\n\"To also protect your interest and as part of pursuing our position\n\nfor collection, COB has been preparing its own civil fraud case\n\nagainst the US based parties.\"    It is a sign of the tenuousness of\n\nISG's claim that the sentence it chose to highlight contains a\n\nclear statement by Pappalardo that the civil suit would be brought\n\nsolely on behalf of his client, COB.      Further, because ISG knew\n\nthat the suit would be brought on behalf of COB alone, it is clear\n\nthat the \"interest\" that Pappalardo referred to was simply ISG's\n\nrecovery of its investment funds as an incidental beneficiary of\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fthe lawsuit.        This is particularly so given that the same letter\n\nbegan,   \"I    am    writing   to   you   at   the    request     of   my   client,\n\nCorporation of the BankHouse Incorporated (\"COB\") . . .\" and the\n\nsecond paragraph stated:\n\n              As our client is bound by confidentiality\n              agreements, I am reluctant to share specifics\n              of the details or process, for fear of\n              jeopardizing    the   sensitive   arrangements\n              involved or breaching specific confidentiality\n              agreements that are integral to the matters\n              involved. However, I want to provide you with\n              an understanding of the actions that are being\n              taken on behalf of COB.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n              ISG also points to the power of attorney and accompanying\n\n\"side letter\" as grounds for its alleged reasonable reliance on\n\nPappalardo for legal services.            As discussed above, the power of\n\nattorney granted to Pappalardo the limited agency right to transfer\n\nany recovered ISG funds to an interest-bearing escrow account. The\n\n\"side letter\" was drafted by ISG and given to Pappalardo along with\n\nthe signed power of attorney.         It read:\n\n              The Directors of ISG seek to . . . clarify . .\n              . that the captioned Power of Attorney is\n              given to [ESCM and Pappalardo] upon the\n              understanding that it will be actioned by the\n              attorney with the utmost good faith and due\n              care having regard to the interests of ISG.\n\nThe   \"side    letter\"    simply    reiterated       the   duty   of   care   that\n\naccompanies any agency relationship and did not expand the very\n\nlimited grant of authority contained in the power of attorney.                  No\n\nreasonable factfinder could conclude that ISG, a sophisticated\n\n                                      -22-\n\fentity, was reasonable to rely on Pappalardo to provide broad legal\n\nservices simply because it appointed him attorney-in-fact for the\n\nlimited purpose of transferring funds.                Indeed, in an August 2001\n\nletter to Pappalardo, ISG acknowledged that it remained a nonclient\n\nthird party even after the power of attorney was signed.10\n\n              Therefore, we hold that ISG's claim fails the third prong\n\nof   DeVaux    because      ISG   did    not   rely   on   Pappalardo    for   legal\n\nservices, but merely for incidental financial benefit. Further, we\n\nconclude      that   even    if   ISG    did   rely   on   Pappalardo    for   legal\n\nservices, such reliance was not reasonable given the parties'\n\ncourse of dealings.\n\n              We also briefly note that these conclusions are fatal to\n\nISG's claim under prong two of DeVaux, which requires the plaintiff\n\nto   have   sought    advice      or    assistance    on   a   matter   within   the\n\nattorney's professional legal competence.                  See DeVaux, 444 N.E.2d\n\nat 357.       As we noted in Sheinkopf, attorneys \"routinely wear a\n\nmultitude of hats,\" 927 F.2d at 1265, and mere interaction with an\n\nattorney for assistance of any kind is not enough under DeVaux.\n\nThe assistance sought must be legal in nature.                 The facts here show\n\nthat ISG relied on Pappalardo only for a financial benefit.                      ISG\n\n\n\n\n      10\n      In the August 15, 2001, letter, ISG threatened to file ethics\ncharges against Pappalardo for his \"treatment of [ISG] as third\nparties, particularly in the circumstances of the Power of\nAttorney.\"\n\n                                          -23-\n\fhaving failed all three prongs of the DeVaux test, we conclude that\n\nno implied attorney-client relationship was created.\n\n          2. Foreseeable Reliance Exception for Nonclients\n\n          Generally, under Massachusetts law, an attorney only owes\n\na duty of care to clients.      See One Nat'l Bank v. Antonellis, 80\n\nF.3d 606, 609 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"'[A]n attorney's liability for\n\nnegligence arises out of a duty owed to a client.'\") (quoting\n\nNorman v. Brown, Todd & Heyburn, 693 F.Supp. 1259, 1265 (D. Mass.\n\n1988)).   However, Massachusetts courts have carved out a limited\n\n\"foreseeable reliance\" exception to this rule, which creates a duty\n\nto nonclients where the attorney knew, or should have reasonably\n\nforeseen, that the nonclient would rely on his services.              See\n\nAntonellis,   80   F.3d   at   609;   Sheinkopf,   927   F.2d   at   1268.\n\nNonetheless, this duty will not be imposed if \"such an independent\n\nduty would potentially conflict with the duty the attorney owes to\n\nhis or her client.\"   Antonellis, 80 F.3d at 609 (quoting Lamare v.\n\nBasbanes, 418 Mass. 274, 636 N.E.2d 218, 219 (1994)).\n\n          ISG invokes this nonclient exception to no avail, for the\n\nsimple reason that ISG and COB were potentially adverse parties.\n\nImposing on Pappalardo a duty to ISG would create a potential\n\nconflict with Pappalardo's preexisting duty to COB, his client.\n\nSee id. (\"Massachusetts and federal case law has consistently found\n\nthat a potential conflict between an attorney's duty to his or her\n\n\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fclient and the alleged duty to the nonclient is sufficient to\n\ndefeat the nonclient's malpractice claim.\").\n\n             ISG and COB were potentially adverse parties since ISG\n\ninvested in COB's scheme.     ISG became aware of an actual conflict\n\nwith COB when it began investigating the fraudulent transfers in\n\nearly 1999.       In a letter to COB sent in early 1999, before\n\nPappalardo was hired, ISG bitterly complained that COB was not\n\nkeeping ISG apprised of its account positions, and threatened to\n\npursue legal actions if COB \"had been in any way misleading or\n\ninaccurate\" regarding the funds:\n\n             You seem to be under the mistaken impression\n             that I am posturing with respect to the need\n             for ISG to consider it's [sic] legal options.\n             I should clarify perhaps that [ISG directors]\n             could well be taken to task with regard to our\n             failure to take local state legal advice.\n\nGiven this very real conflict between ISG and COB, we decline to\n\nimpose on Pappalardo a duty to ISG as a nonclient.\n\n             Therefore, because we have determined that no reasonable\n\nfactfinder could conclude that an attorney-client relationship was\n\ncreated, either expressly or by implication, and that no duty of\n\ncare was owed to ISG as a nonclient, we conclude that summary\n\njudgment was appropriate as to the five counts11 predicated upon the\n\nexistence of such a duty.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n          See supra, Part II.B.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fC. The Remaining Claims\n\n          Two claims remain -- conversion, and aiding and abetting\n\nfraud and breach of fiduciary duty, both brought against ESCM\n\nalone.   ISG bases these claims on COB's unauthorized transfer of\n\n$821,500 of ISG's investment to an ESCM account on May 29, 1998.\n\nBoth claims against ESCM sound in tort, see Gallagher v. R.E.\n\nCunniff, Inc., 314 Mass. 7, 49 N.E.2d 448, 449 (1943) (conversion);\n\nArcidi v. Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Inc., 447 Mass. 616, 856\n\nN.E.2d 167, 173 (2006) (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary\n\nduty), meaning the claims are subject to a three-year statute of\n\nlimitations,   see   Mass.   Gen.   Laws   ch.   260,   §   2A   (\"Except   as\n\notherwise provided, actions of tort, actions of contract to recover\n\nfor personal injuries, and actions of replevin, shall be commenced\n\nonly within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\").\n\n          Massachusetts courts have said that a tort claim accrues\n\nwhen the plaintiff knew or should have known of the alleged injury.\n\nSee Joseph A. Fortin Constr., Inc. v. Mass. Hous. Fin. Agency, 392\n\nMass. 440, 466 N.E.2d 514, 516 (1984) (\"[I]t is a well-settled rule\n\nthat causes of action in tort generally accrue under G.L. c. 260,\n\n§ 2A, at the time the plaintiff is injured.\"); Hendrickson v.\n\nSears, 365 Mass. 83, 310 N.E.2d 131, 135 (1974) (\"[A] cause of\n\naction accrues on the happening of an event likely to put the\n\nplaintiff on notice.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f          The defendants assert that the limitations period began\n\nto run in April 2000, when ISG learned of the transfer of funds to\n\nESCM's account.12 Citing the doctrine of continuous representation,\n\nISG argues that the limitations period should be equitably tolled\n\nduring the period that ISG was allegedly represented by Pappalardo.\n\nSee Murphy v. Smith, 411 Mass. 133, 579 N.E.2d 165, 167 (1991) (the\n\ncontinuing   representation     doctrine     \"tolls    the    statute   of\n\nlimitations in legal malpractice actions where the attorney in\n\nquestion continues to represent the plaintiff's interests in the\n\nmatter in question\"). Thus, ISG suggests that the statutory period\n\ndid not begin to run until October 2001, when ISG \"disengaged\n\nentirely from its relationship with Pappalardo and his firms.\"\n\n          Because   we   have   determined   that     no   attorney-client\n\nrelationship existed between ISG and Pappalardo, the continuous\n\nrepresentation doctrine clearly is not applicable here. Therefore,\n\nISG's claims accrued in April 2000, when it first learned of its\n\ninjury.   Because more than three years elapsed between April 2000\n\nand the filing of this action on June 30, 2004, ISG's claims were\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      It is clear from the record that ISG had actual notice of\nthis transfer by April 17, 2000.      On that date, ISG faxed to\nPappalardo a summary of the information it had learned from a\nBelgian judge who was investigating the fraudulent transfers. The\ndocument presents a timeline of eight separate unauthorized\ntransfers of ISG funds by COB, including the first on the list:\n\"29th of May 1998: USD 821.500 to MELLON BANK, Pittsburgh, USA . .\n. holder ECKERT DEMANS [sic] CHERIN & MELLOT.\"\n\n                                  -27-\n\fnot timely filed, and the district court correctly granted summary\n\njudgment on this basis.\n\nD. Motion for Reconsideration or Relief from Judgment\n\n           We also affirm the district court's rejection of ISG's\n\nmotion for reconsideration or relief from judgment.   ISG's motion\n\nfor reconsideration, which we review for abuse of discretion, see\n\nBarrett v. Lombardi, 239 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), consisted\n\nonly of \"theories previously advanced and rejected,\" Palmer v.\n\nChampion Mortgage, 465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2006), and arguments\n\nunrelated to the grounds upon which we found summary judgment to be\n\nappropriate.\n\n                          III. Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of defendants as to all of ISG's\n\nclaims.

(\"ISG\") brought suit against attorney A. John Pappalardo and two law firms, Greenburg Traurig, LLP (\"GT\"), Pappalardo's current firm, and Eckert, Seamans, Cherin &amp; Mellott, LLC (\"ESCM\"), Pappalardo's former firm. ISG's claims against defendants arose from the loss of roughly $4 million, which it invested with Corporation of the BankHouse (\"COB\"), a Boston-based investment firm. Attorney Pappalardo represented COB as it sought to recover about $19 million, including ISG's funds, that COB had lost through a series of fraudulent transfers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment as to all of ISG's claims against the three defendants, finding a failure to demonstrate causation and to file within the statute of limitations. We affirm, concluding that summary judgment was appropriate as to ISG's negligence, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and 93A unfair trade practices claims because no attorney-client relationship was formed between ISG and any of the defendants. Further, we hold that ISG's remaining two claims, for conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, fail because they were not filed within the statutory period. We also affirm the district court's denial of ISG's motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves a complex set of financial transactions involving numerous individuals and entities. We do not delve into every nuance in our recitation of the facts below, but only those necessary to explain our decision. Because we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, ISG. <i>Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez,</i> 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Scheme</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG, a Hong Kong-based company, invested $4 million with COB in April 1998, through COB's so-called \"Federal Reserve Guarantee Program.\" COB told potential investors that this program generated profits by controlling the circulation of U.S. dollars. COB promised investors substantial profits, along with a guarantee of non-depletion of their original investment. Having been essentially promised profit at zero risk, ISG transferred its $4 million investment to a COB account at ABN Amro Bank in Belgium on May 15, 1998. Two weeks later, on May 29, 1998, COB made unauthorized transfers of $821,500 of ISG's investment into an ESCM bank account in Pennsylvania, and $328,500 into a COB bank account in Boston. Both transactions violated the non-depletion agreement, and were made without ISG's permission or knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COB then engaged in a Ponzi scheme, according to ISG's allegations, using funds from new investors to cover the depletion of funds provided by previous investors, amounting to millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains by COB and a variety of individuals and entities not involved in this suit. ISG estimates that COB amassed about $19 million dollars through this scheme, and then transferred these funds in November 1998, without the permission of any investor, to an entity called Swan Trust. Henry Pearlberg, the trustee of Swan Trust, then depleted the Swan Trust account through a series of transactions in late 1998 and early 1999, depositing most of the money ($16.7 million) in an account held by First Merchant Bank (\"FMB\"), which ISG characterizes as a \"rogue Northern Cyprus bank.\" Pearlberg also appropriated about $2.3 million for his own use. ISG alleges that FMB dissipated the $16.7 million account through yet another series of fraudulent transactions from February to May 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1999, COB and its CEO, James Pomeroy, persuaded Pearlberg to execute a Deed of Assignment, which assigned to Pomeroy, as agent for COB, all rights to the misappropriated funds held by FMB, Swan Trust, and Pearlberg. In July 1999, Pomeroy received a disbursement of $1.2 million from FMB based on this assignment. These recovered funds were not passed on to the investors, but were retained by COB or Pomeroy and are now dissipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Attempts to Recover Dissipated Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, ISG had become concerned that COB was not honoring the non-depletion agreement and unsuccessfully sought assurance from COB that its funds were intact. By mid-1999 ISG's director, Phillip Clark, a Hong Kong attorney, was actively investigating COB's handling of ISG's investment. By then, ISG knew that COB had transferred funds to Swan Trust, and that Pearlberg had subsequently transferred the majority of those funds to the FMB account. By this time, ISG also had learned of Pearlberg's assignment to Pomeroy and Pomeroy's recovery of $1.2 million based on the assignment. By April 2000, ISG had learned of COB's initial depletion of its investment &#8212; the May 1998 transfers to the ESCM and COB accounts in the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, Pappalardo, then an attorney with ESCM, began representing COB. On August 11, 1999, COB's Pomeroy sent ISG an email detailing COB's \"options for retrieval\" of the lost funds. Pomeroy also informed ISG that, \"I have chosen to move to prepare litigation against the parties utilizing the law firm of Greenberg &amp; Traurig. I have utilized the law firm of Seamin Cherin &amp; Melott [sic] for the criminal assistance against the parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this same period, ISG's Clark flew to Boston to confront COB over the missing funds. When the parties met in Boston, Pappalardo told Clark that he had been retained by COB; that COB was also a victim of the fraudulent scheme; that all necessary steps, including litigation, would be taken to recover the funds; and that any independent action by ISG against COB, Pomeroy, or other parties would jeopardize Pappalardo's negotiations to recover the missing funds. ISG alleges that these representations, and other events that we detail below, led it to believe that Pappalardo was ISG's legal representative and that an attorney-client relationship had been formed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pappalardo informed ISG on several occasions that a negotiated recovery of the funds was imminent, as was COB's filing of a civil complaint against the perpetrators of the fraud. When Pappalardo had neither recovered the funds nor filed a complaint in over two years, ISG finally retained outside counsel on November 7, 2001. Through counsel, ISG filed suit against COB and Pomeroy in March 2002. ISG obtained a $10 million judgment in that suit, but the award has proven uncollectible. ISG also filed suit against ABN Amro Bank, FMB, and two individuals associated with COB's scheme. Those suits are currently pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG brought three claims against all three defendants: negligence, in the form of legal malpractice; misrepresentation; and violation of Chapter 93A, the Massachusetts consumer protection law, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 1 et seq. ISG brought two additional claims against Pappalardo alone, for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of express and implied contract. Finally, ISG brought two claims against ESCM alone, for conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, based on the May 1998 transfer of funds to ESCM's escrow account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. The district court declined the defendants' request to grant summary judgment on the ground that no attorney-client relationship was formed. However, holding that ISG had failed to establish a viable theory of causation, the court granted summary judgment as to most of ISG's claims, including negligence, misrepresentation, violation of Chapter 93A, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The court also granted summary judgment as to the remaining two claims &#8212; conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty &#8212; concluding that the statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG filed a motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment, which the district court denied. ISG timely appealed the district court's grant of summary judgment and denial of its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we review a district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>See Font&#225;nez-N&#250;&#241;ez v. Janssen Ortho LLC,</i> 447 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An appellate court is not \"tied to the district court's rationale,\" but may affirm a grant of summary judgment \"on any ground revealed by the record.\" <i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment for abuse of discretion. <i>See Ru&#237;z-Rivera v. Riley,</i> 209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2000). \"To obtain relief, the movant must demonstrate either that newly discovered evidence (not previously available) has come to light or that the rendering court committed a manifest error of law.\" <i>Palmer v. Champion Mortgage,</i> 465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Duty of Care</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of ISG's claims<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> against defendants are predicated on establishing the existence of an attorney-client relationship or other duty of care between ISG and the defendants, including the claims of negligence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> misrepresentation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and violation of Chapter 93A.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In addition, ISG's claims against Pappalardo, for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, are also predicated on the existence of an attorneyclient relationship or other duty of care between Pappalardo and ISG.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG puts forth two theories for the existence of a duty of care by defendants. First, ISG argues that an attorney-client relationship was in fact formed. Second, ISG avers that \"the forbearance of ISG induced by Pappalardo while at GT and ESCM, created a duty of care.\" This second argument is an invocation of the foreseeable reliance exception that, under Massachusetts law, creates a duty of care toward nonclients. <i>See Sheinkopf v. Stone,</i> 927 F.2d 1259, 1268 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, we first examine whether an attorney-client relationship was created in fact; if not, we then consider whether the foreseeable reliance exception for nonclients applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Attorney-Client Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, an attorney-client relationship may be shown by an express contract, <i>see Miller,</i> 725 N.E.2d at 549, or may be implied \"when (1) a person seeks advice or assistance from an attorney, (2) the advice or assistance sought pertains to matters within the attorney's professional competence, and (3) the attorney expressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually gives the advice or assistance,\" <i>DeVaux v. Am. Home Assurance Co.,</i> 387 Mass. 814, 444 N.E.2d 355, 357 (1983) (quoting <i>Kurtenbach v. TeKippe,</i> 260 N.W.2d 53, 56 (Iowa 1977)). The third prong of the <i>DeVaux</i> test may be established \"by proof of detrimental reliance, when the person seeking legal services reasonably relies on the attorney to provide them, and the attorney, aware of such reliance, does nothing to negate it.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not entirely clear whether ISG alleges that an express attorney-client relationship was formed. Nonetheless, we can easily conclude that this is not the case. There is no evidence here of a retainer agreement or other contract for legal services between ISG and any of the defendants; nor is there evidence of billing or remittances for such services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG points to the power of attorney that it executed in favor of Pappalardo in July 2000, authorizing him to transfer to an interest bearing escrow account any funds belonging to ISG that he succeeded in recovering from Swan Trust. However, by executing the power of attorney, ISG granted only a circumscribed agency power to Pappalardo in order to facilitate the physical return of the missing funds. While the power of attorney may have some impact on our analysis of whether an implied attorney-client relationship was formed, it is certain that such a limited power of attorney did not create an express attorney-client relationship. <i>See Williams v. Dugan,</i> 217 Mass. 526, 528, 105 N.E. 615 (1914) (noting that a power of attorney creates limited agency relationship as to expressly enumerated powers and no additional powers may be inferred); <i>see also Bachner v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n,</i> 113 F.R.D. 644, 649 (D.Alaska 1987) (\"A power of attorney establishes the relationship of attorney-in-fact, which is an agency relationship different from the relationship of an attorney-at-law.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to ISG's contention that an attorney-client relationship was created by implication, under the <i>DeVaux</i> three-part test. On appeal, ISG contends that, based on Pappalardo's assurance that he represented the interests of the investors and his warnings that filing independent charges would jeopardize his attempts to negotiate a recovery of the funds, ISG reasonably believed that Pappalardo was its attorney and forebore from pursuing independent legal action on that basis. In contrast, the defendants maintain that Pappalardo made clear that he only represented COB, and ISG demonstrated an understanding of this fact; that ISG never relied on Pappalardo for legal services; and that ISG, as a sophisticated, represented entity, understood that its position was potentially adverse to Pappalardo's client, and indeed threatened suit against COB on this basis several times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of whether an implied relationship was created must start with the conjunctive, three-part <i>DeVaux</i> test. Under part one of the test, we ask whether ISG sought legal advice or assistance from Pappalardo. <i>See DeVaux,</i> 444 N.E.2d at 357. Courts interpreting <i>DeVaux</i> have understood this first prong to require concrete communication by the plaintiff requesting that the attorney represent him, or explicitly seeking individualized legal advisement. For example, in <i>Robertson v. Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett,</i> 404 Mass. 515, 536 N.E.2d 344, 351 (1989), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") found no implied attorney-client relationship between a corporate officer and a law firm representing the corporation, where the officer never explicitly requested that the firm represent him regarding his employment status at the corporation after a reorganization. The SJC reached this conclusion even though the officer had previously been a client of the firm in regard to other matters, had numerous discussions with the firm about the corporate reorganization and his future employment with the corporation, and had requested and received a sample employment agreement from the firm. <i>Id.</i> The SJC concluded that an implied relationship cannot be formed without active communication from the plaintiff to the lawyer requesting legal representation or legal advice:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of several written and many oral communications between the plaintiff and the other participants, the plaintiff introduced no evidence of a specific reference to [the firm] as his personal counsel. His claim is essentially, therefore, that he thought that [the firm] represented him but that he failed to communicate his thought to anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 349.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in <i>Sheinkopf v. Stone,</i> 927 F.2d 1259, 1266-67 (1st Cir.1991), this court held that no implied attorney-client relationship arose under Massachusetts law between an attorney and an investor, where the investor bought into a joint investment venture managed by the attorney. We reached this result even though the attorney prepared various legal documents for the investor's signature and requested that he sign them; promised to \"protect\" the investor; told the investor that \"other clients of [the firm]\" were also investing in the venture; listed the firm's address on the joint venture's legal documents; and transacted joint venture business out of his law firm office and with the assistance of his law firm secretary. <i>Id.</i> at 1265-66. This court found particularly persuasive that the investor \"never explicitly requested [the attorney] or [the law firm] to represent him, never sought any legal advice from them, and was never billed for services.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1268.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, ISG's claim is in some ways weaker than those of plaintiffs in <i>Robertson</i> and <i>Sheinkopf.</i> Not only is there no evidence or allegation that ISG explicitly requested legal representation from Pappalardo, but on at least two occasions ISG acknowledged that it was not Pappalardo's client. First, in a March 30, 2000, letter, Clark wrote to Pappalardo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>While I appreciate that you act for Corporation of the Bankhouse (COB),</i> I find that your failure to respond to any of our correspondence insulting and unprofessional. It is not beyond the parameters of your ethical requirements for you to correspond with International Strategies Group (ISG) <i>on COB's instruction.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Second, on August 15, 2001, having grown more frustrated at Pappalardo's lack of communication and failure to recover the funds through negotiation, C.M. Barber, another ISG director, wrote to Pappalardo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John, you seem to be testing our resolve to take [independent] action. How do we respond? . . . We can prepare a comprehensive complaint to the Massachusetts State Bar with respect to <i>your treatment of us as third parties,</i> particularly in the circumstances of the Power of Attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). These acknowledgments that Pappalardo did not represent ISG were consistent with Pappalardo's advisement to ISG on at least two occasions that he represented COB alone. Following Pappalardo's first meeting with ISG, he wrote to Clark on August 20, 1999:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As you know, I am counsel along with others, for Societ&#233; Bank House (\"C.O.B.\") and represent that entity and its employees in connection with certain matters arising from their relationship with Swan Trust and its successors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three months later, Pappalardo began a letter to ISG's Barber with a similar notification: \"I am writing to you at the request of my client, Corporation of the Bank-House, Incorporated (`COB') in connection with the recovery of funds from the transactions involving the Swan Trust.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there is no evidence that ISG requested legal advice from Pappalardo respecting ISG's potential individual claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Such a request would have raised a serious ethical dilemma for Pappalardo, as one of ISG's foremost claims would have been against COB, Pappalardo's client. Indeed, in a March 23, 2000, letter to COB, ISG's Clark acknowledged that ISG did not have an attorney-client relationship with COB's attorneys, and therefore prodded COB to consult with its own attorneys regarding the prospects for a COB civil suit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e are of the view that the urgent instigation of civil proceedings against Swan Trust, May Davis and others is now a priority. <i>May we seek your consultation with your civil attorneys as to the process and timing of implementing same.</i> It is our view that there will be economies in process and costs through the various investors and/or their fiduciary proceeding in concert and together with Corporation of the BankHouse (\"CoB\") in its separate function as fiduciary to such parties. <i>There would be a requirement for all such parties to be privy to the benefits of a client relationship with your appointed attorneys.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Though ISG here proposed a joint representation of all the investors by COB's attorneys, there is no evidence or even allegation that COB responded to this proposal or took any action to implement it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record indicates that ISG did not explicitly request legal representation from Pappalardo, nor did it seek advice regarding its own legal position vis-&#224;-vis the entities implicated in the fraud. Therefore, we conclude that ISG has set forth insufficient facts to support its claim of an implied relationship under part one of the <i>DeVaux</i> test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the third prong of the <i>DeVaux</i> test,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and ask whether Pappalardo expressly or impliedly agreed to give or actually gave the requested advice or assistance. <i>See DeVaux,</i> 444 N.E.2d at 357. This prong may be satisfied if ISG reasonably relied on Pappalardo to provide legal services, and Pappalardo, aware of such reliance, did nothing to negate it. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable reliance test captures the essence of ISG's allegation that an implied relationship was created. ISG argues that Pappalardo urged it not to proceed on its own, but rather to wait for Pappalardo to orchestrate a negotiated return of the missing funds on behalf of the \"team\" of investors; therefore, the argument goes, ISG reasonably relied on Pappalardo to provide legal services, and Pappalardo, aware of this reliance, did nothing to negate the impression that he was acting as ISG's attorney. However, the facts before us do not support this account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with ISG's allegation here is that no evidence suggests that ISG was relying on Pappalardo to provide ISG with legal services. Instead, all the evidence suggests that ISG was relying on Pappalardo to recover the funds for COB, with the expectation that ISG would be an eventual financial beneficiary of such a recovery. Pappalardo told ISG that, in his opinion, his negotiations were more likely to lead to a recovery of the missing funds if ISG refrained from filing its own charges. This was a strategic opinion from the attorney of a potential adversary, which ISG was free to accept at face value, ignore, or seek legal advice regarding. ISG chose to forego its own action, expecting to benefit financially from a successful COB recovery. However, ISG's anticipated financial benefit does not transform Pappalardo's legal work on behalf of COB into a duty to ISG. Nor does ISG's expectation of an eventual financial recovery support the notion that it was reasonable for ISG to rely on Pappalardo for legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This situation is analogous to one the SJC confronted in <i>Spinner v. Nutt,</i> 417 Mass. 549, 631 N.E.2d 542 (1994). There, trust beneficiaries brought suit against the attorneys for the estate's trustees. The SJC found no duty of care as between the estate's attorneys and the estate's beneficiaries: \"The fact that third parties are thus benefitted, or damaged, by the attorney's performance does not give rise to a duty by the attorney to such third parties, and hence cannot be the basis for a cause of action by the third parties for the attorney's negligence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 546 (quoting <i>Goldberg v. Frye,</i> 217 Cal.App.3d 1258, 266 Cal.Rptr. 483, 489 (1990)). The SJC concluded that, \"In these cases the third parties are incidental beneficiaries, and `[a]n incidental benefit does not suffice to impose a duty upon the attorney.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Ronald E. Mallen and Jeffrey M. Smith, 1 Legal Malpractice &#167; 7.11 (3d ed.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly here, where ISG relied on Pappalardo to recover the missing money on behalf of COB, rather than to provide ISG directly with legal counsel, ISG put itself in the position of an incidental third-party financial beneficiary, and therefore no implied attorney-client relationship was established. ISG relied on Pappalardo only to recover the missing funds for COB, not to provide ISG with legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that ISG did rely on Pappalardo to provide direct legal services, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that ISG's reliance in this regard was reasonable. ISG attempts to rebut this conclusion by pointing to several pieces of evidence, including three statements made by Pappalardo. ISG notes that: (1) Pappalardo sent ISG an \"action plan\" for recovery of the funds which noted that he \"represent[ed] the team,\" comprised of the investors and COB; (2) Pappalardo told ISG that COB and ISG's interests were \"one and the same\"; and (3) Pappalardo told ISG that he was preparing a civil suit against the fraudulent parties \"to protect [ISG's] interest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, these comments must be analyzed in the broader context of the parties' course of dealing. As discussed above, Pappalardo had told ISG on several occasions that he represented COB alone, and ISG made several statements which indicated its understanding of this arrangement. Also, ISG had chosen to forebear in bringing its own legal action, hoping instead that Pappalardo's negotiations on behalf of COB would succeed, resulting in an eventual financial benefit to ISG. Finally, ISG was aware of its ability to bring suit against COB and Pomeroy, and reminded Pappalardo and COB of this fact on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evaluating the three statements cited by ISG in this larger context, we conclude that ISG's alleged reliance was not reasonable. First, Pappalardo's statement in the \"action plan\" that he represented the investors as a team simply reflected the reality that ISG had chosen to coordinate its strategy with COB by deferring individual action in favor of Pappalardo's efforts to recover the funds for COB. Pappalardo's statement that he represented the team is even less problematic than that made by the attorney in <i>Sheinkopf,</i> who told an investor that \"other clients of [the firm]\" were also investing in the attorney's venture. 927 F.2d at 1265. We were unpersuaded in <i>Sheinkopf</i> that that statement was a reasonable basis for an implied relationship. In this case, Pappalardo's statement accurately reflected a choice made by ISG to forebear in favor of Pappalardo's efforts on COB's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pappalardo's statement that the interests of his client and ISG were one and the same also did not form a reasonable basis for ISG's reliance on Pappalardo for legal services. As discussed above, ISG had threatened to sue COB and Pomeroy on several occasions, indicating that it was well aware that their interests were not fully aligned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, when read in the context of the entire letter, Pappalardo's statement that he was preparing a civil suit on behalf of COB in order to \"protect [ISG's] interest\" also does not provide a reasonable basis for ISG's reliance. ISG highlights just one sentence in the October 22, 1999, letter from Pappalardo to ISG: \"To also protect your interest and as part of pursuing our position for collection, COB has been preparing its own civil fraud case against the U.S. based parties.\" It is a sign of the tenuousness of ISG's claim that the sentence it chose to highlight contains a clear statement by Pappalardo that the civil suit would be brought solely on behalf of his client, COB. Further, because ISG knew that the suit would be brought on behalf of COB alone, it is clear that the \"interest\" that Pappalardo referred to was simply ISG's recovery of its investment funds as an incidental beneficiary of the lawsuit. This is particularly so given that the same letter began, \"I am writing to you at the request of my client, Corporation of the BankHouse Incorporated (\"COB\") . . .\" and the second paragraph stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As our client is bound by confidentiality agreements, I am reluctant to share specifics of the details or process,</i> for fear of jeopardizing the sensitive arrangements involved or breaching specific confidentiality agreements that are integral to the matters involved. However, I want to provide you with an understanding of the <i>actions that are being taken on behalf of COB.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG also points to the power of attorney and accompanying \"side letter\" as grounds for its alleged reasonable reliance on Pappalardo for legal services. As discussed above, the power of attorney granted to Pappalardo the limited agency right to transfer any recovered ISG funds to an interest-bearing escrow account. The \"side letter\" was drafted by ISG and given to Pappalardo along with the signed power of attorney. It read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Directors of ISG seek to . . . clarify . . . that the captioned Power of Attorney is given to [ESCM and Pappalardo] upon the understanding that it will be actioned by the attorney with the utmost good faith and due care having regard to the interests of ISG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"side letter\" simply reiterated the duty of care that accompanies any agency relationship and did not expand the very limited grant of authority contained in the power of attorney. No reasonable factfinder could conclude that ISG, a sophisticated entity, was reasonable to rely on Pappalardo to provide broad legal services simply because it appointed him attorney-in-fact for the limited purpose of transferring funds. Indeed, in an August 2001 letter to Pappalardo, ISG acknowledged that it remained a nonclient third party even after the power of attorney was signed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we hold that ISG's claim fails the third prong of <i>DeVaux</i> because ISG did not rely on Pappalardo for legal services, but merely for incidental financial benefit. Further, we conclude that even if ISG did rely on Pappalardo for legal services, such reliance was not reasonable given the parties' course of dealings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also briefly note that these conclusions are fatal to ISG's claim under prong two of <i>DeVaux,</i> which requires the plaintiff to have sought advice or assistance on a matter within the attorney's professional legal competence. <i>See DeVaux,</i> 444 N.E.2d at 357. As we noted in <i>Sheinkopf,</i> attorneys \"routinely wear a multitude of hats,\" 927 F.2d at 1265, and mere interaction with an attorney for assistance of any kind is not enough under <i>DeVaux.</i> The assistance sought must be legal in nature. The facts here show that ISG relied on Pappalardo only for a financial benefit. ISG having failed all three prongs of the <i>DeVaux</i> test, we conclude that no implied attorney-client relationship was created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Foreseeable Reliance Exception for Nonclients</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, under Massachusetts law, an attorney only owes a duty of care to clients. <i>See One Nat'l Bank v. Antonellis,</i> 80 F.3d 606, 609 (1st Cir.1996) (\"`[A]n attorney's liability for negligence arises out of a duty owed to a client.'\") (quoting <i>Norman v. Brown, Todd &amp; Heyburn,</i> 693 F.Supp. 1259, 1265 (D.Mass.1988)). However, Massachusetts courts have carved out a limited \"foreseeable reliance\" exception to this rule, which creates a duty to nonclients where the attorney knew, or should have reasonably foreseen, that the nonclient would rely on his services. <i>See Antonellis,</i> 80 F.3d at 609; <i>Sheinkopf,</i> 927 F.2d at 1268. Nonetheless, this duty will not be imposed if \"such an independent duty would potentially conflict with the duty the attorney owes to his or her client.\" <i>Antonellis,</i> 80 F.3d at 609 (quoting <i>Lamare v. Basbanes,</i> 418 Mass. 274, 636 N.E.2d 218, 219 (1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG invokes this nonclient exception to no avail, for the simple reason that ISG and COB were potentially adverse parties. Imposing on Pappalardo a duty to ISG would create a potential conflict with Pappalardo's preexisting duty to COB, his client. <i>See id.</i> (\"Massachusetts and federal case law has consistently found that a potential conflict between an attorney's duty to his or her client and the alleged duty to the nonclient is sufficient to defeat the nonclient's malpractice claim.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG and COB were potentially adverse parties since ISG invested in COB's scheme. ISG became aware of an actual conflict with COB when it began investigating the fraudulent transfers in early 1999. In a letter to COB sent in early 1999, before Pappalardo was hired, ISG bitterly complained that COB was not keeping ISG apprised of its account positions, and threatened to pursue legal actions if COB \"had been in any way misleading or inaccurate\" regarding the funds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You seem to be under the mistaken impression that I am posturing with respect to the need for ISG to consider it's [sic] legal options. I should clarify perhaps that [ISG directors] could well be taken to task with regard to our failure to take local state legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this very real conflict between ISG and COB, we decline to impose on Pappalardo a duty to ISG as a nonclient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, because we have determined that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that an attorney-client relationship was created, either expressly or by implication, and that no duty of care was owed to ISG as a nonclient, we conclude that summary judgment was appropriate as to the five counts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> predicated upon the existence of such a duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Remaining Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two claims remain &#8212; conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, both brought against ESCM alone. ISG bases these claims on COB's unauthorized transfer of $821,500 of ISG's investment to an ESCM account on May 29, 1998. Both claims against ESCM sound in tort, <i>see Gallagher v. R.E. Cunniff, Inc.,</i> 314 Mass. 7, 49 N.E.2d 448, 449 (1943) (conversion); <i>Arcidi v. Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Inc.,</i> 447 Mass. 616, 856 N.E.2d 167, 173 (2006) (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty), meaning the claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 2A (\"Except as otherwise provided, actions of tort, actions of contract to recover for personal injuries, and actions of replevin, shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts have said that a tort claim accrues when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the alleged injury. <i>See Joseph A. Fortin Constr., Inc. v. Mass. Hous. Fin. Agency,</i> 392 Mass. 440, 466 N.E.2d 514, 516 (1984) (\"[I]t is a wellsettled rule that causes of action in tort generally accrue under G.L. c. 260, &#167; 2A, at the time the plaintiff is injured.\"); <i>Hendrickson v. Sears,</i> 365 Mass. 83, 310 N.E.2d 131, 135 (1974) (\"[A] cause of action accrues on the happening of an event likely to put the plaintiff on notice.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants assert that the limitations period began to run in April 2000, when ISG learned of the transfer of funds to ESCM's account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Citing the doctrine of continuous representation, ISG argues that the limitations period should be equitably tolled during the period that ISG was allegedly represented by Pappalardo. <i>See Murphy v. Smith,</i> 411 Mass. 133, 579 N.E.2d 165, 167 (1991) (the continuing representation doctrine \"tolls the statute of limitations in legal malpractice actions where the attorney in question continues to represent the plaintiff's interests in the matter in question\"). Thus, ISG suggests that the statutory period did not begin to run until October 2001, when ISG \"disengaged entirely from its relationship with Pappalardo and his firms.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have determined that no attorney-client relationship existed between ISG and Pappalardo, the continuous representation doctrine clearly is not applicable here. Therefore, ISG's claims accrued in April 2000, when it first learned of its injury. Because more than three years elapsed between April 2000 and the filing of this action on June 30, 2004, ISG's claims were not timely filed, and the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

ISG's motion for reconsideration, which we review for abuse of discretion, <i>see Barrett v. Lombardi,</i> 239 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir.2001), consisted only of \"theories previously advanced and rejected,\" <i>Palmer v.

However, ISG asking COB's attorney about potential COB claims is quite different from ISG seeking legal advice from Pappalardo regarding its own potential claims, and is not sufficient to satisfy prong one of<i>DeVaux.</i> Further, even if such a request for information might in some circumstances satisfy prong one, the record shows, and ISG concedes, that Pappalardo never provided ISG with the information it sought regarding COB's potential civil claims. Therefore, the third prong of <i>DeVaux</i> &#8212; the provision of the requested legal services &#8212; would not be satisfied, and no implied relationship could be said to have arisen.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We temporarily skip prong two of<i>DeVaux</i> as our analysis of prong three will shed considerable light on the outcome under prong two.

ISG's claims against defendants arose from the loss of roughly $4 million, which it invested with Corporation of the BankHouse (\"COB\"), a Boston-based investment firm.

Further, we hold that ISG's remaining two claims, for conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, fail because they were not filed within the statutory period.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves a complex set of financial transactions involving numerous individuals and entities. We do not delve into every nuance in our recitation of the facts below, but only those necessary to explain our decision. Because we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, ISG. <i>Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 581 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Scheme</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG, a Hong Kong-based company, invested $4 million with COB in April 1998, through COB's so-called \"Federal Reserve Guarantee Program.\" COB told potential investors that this program generated profits by controlling the circulation of U.S. dollars. COB promised investors substantial profits, along with a guarantee of non-depletion of their original investment. Having been essentially promised profit at zero risk, ISG transferred its $4 million investment to a COB account at ABN Amro Bank in Belgium on May 15, 1998. Two weeks later, on May 29, 1998, COB made unauthorized transfers of $821,500 of ISG's investment into an ESCM bank account in Pennsylvania, and $328,500 into a COB bank account in Boston. Both transactions violated the non-depletion agreement, and were made without ISG's permission or knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COB then engaged in a Ponzi scheme, according to ISG's allegations, using funds from new investors to cover the depletion of funds provided by previous investors, amounting to millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains by COB and a variety of individuals and entities not involved in this suit. ISG estimates that COB amassed about $19 million dollars through this scheme, and then transferred these funds in November 1998, without the permission of any investor, to an entity called Swan Trust. Henry Pearlberg, the trustee of Swan Trust, then depleted the Swan Trust account through a series of transactions in late 1998 and early 1999, depositing most of the money ($16.7 million) in an account held by First Merchant Bank (\"FMB\"), which ISG characterizes as a \"rogue Northern Cyprus bank.\" Pearlberg also appropriated about $2.3 million for his own use. ISG alleges that FMB dissipated the $16.7 million account through yet another series of fraudulent transactions from February to May 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1999, COB and its CEO, James Pomeroy, persuaded Pearlberg to execute a Deed of Assignment, which assigned to Pomeroy, as agent for COB, all rights to the misappropriated funds held by FMB, Swan Trust, and Pearlberg. In July 1999, Pomeroy received a disbursement of $1.2 million from FMB based on this assignment. These recovered funds were not passed on to the investors, but were retained by COB or Pomeroy and are now dissipated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Attempts to Recover Dissipated Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1998, ISG had become concerned that COB was not honoring the non-depletion agreement and unsuccessfully sought assurance from COB that its funds were intact. By mid-1999 ISG's director, Phillip Clark, a Hong Kong attorney, was actively investigating COB's handling of ISG's investment. By then, ISG knew that COB had transferred funds to Swan Trust, and that Pearlberg had subsequently transferred the majority of those funds to the FMB account. By this time, ISG also had learned of Pearlberg's assignment to Pomeroy and Pomeroy's recovery of $1.2 million based on the assignment. By April 2000, ISG had learned of COB's initial depletion of its investment &#8212; the May 1998 transfers to the ESCM and COB accounts in the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, Pappalardo, then an attorney with ESCM, began representing COB. On August 11, 1999, COB's Pomeroy sent ISG an email detailing COB's \"options for retrieval\" of the lost funds. Pomeroy also informed ISG that, \"I have chosen to move to prepare litigation against the parties utilizing the law firm of Greenberg &amp; Traurig. I have utilized the law firm of Seamin Cherin &amp; Melott [sic] for the criminal assistance against the parties.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this same period, ISG's Clark flew to Boston to confront COB over the missing funds. When the parties met in Boston, Pappalardo told Clark that he had been retained by COB; that COB was also a victim of the fraudulent scheme; that all necessary steps, including litigation, would be taken to recover the funds; and that any independent action by ISG against COB, Pomeroy, or other parties would jeopardize Pappalardo's negotiations to recover the missing funds. ISG alleges that these representations, and other events that we detail below, led it to believe that Pappalardo was ISG's legal representative and that an attorney-client relationship had been formed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pappalardo informed ISG on several occasions that a negotiated recovery of the funds was imminent, as was COB's filing of a civil complaint against the perpetrators of the fraud. When Pappalardo had neither recovered the funds nor filed a complaint in over two years, ISG finally retained outside counsel on November 7, 2001. Through counsel, ISG filed suit against COB and Pomeroy in March 2002. ISG obtained a $10 million judgment in that suit, but the award has proven uncollectible. ISG also filed suit against ABN Amro Bank, FMB, and two individuals associated with COB's scheme. Those suits are currently pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG brought three claims against all three defendants: negligence, in the form of legal malpractice; misrepresentation; and violation of Chapter 93A, the Massachusetts consumer protection law, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 1 et seq. ISG brought two additional claims against Pappalardo alone, for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of express and implied contract. Finally, ISG brought two claims against ESCM alone, for conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, based on the May 1998 transfer of funds to ESCM's escrow account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. The district court declined the defendants' request to grant summary judgment on the ground that no attorney-client relationship was formed. However, holding that ISG had failed to establish a viable theory of causation, the court granted summary judgment as to most of ISG's claims, including negligence, misrepresentation, violation of Chapter 93A, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The court also granted summary judgment as to the remaining two claims &#8212; conversion, and aiding and abetting fraud and breach of fiduciary duty &#8212; concluding that the statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG filed a motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment, which the district court denied. ISG timely appealed the district court's grant of summary judgment and denial of its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

First, ISG argues that an attorney-client relationship was in fact formed. Second, ISG avers that \"the forbearance of ISG induced by Pappalardo while at GT and ESCM, created a duty of care.\" This second argument is an invocation of the foreseeable reliance exception that, under Massachusetts law, creates a duty of care toward nonclients. <i>See Sheinkopf v. Stone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557334\"><a href=\"/opinion/557334/warren-b-sheinkopf-v-john-kp-stone-iii-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span>, 1268 (1st Cir.1991). Thus, we first examine whether an attorney-client relationship was created in fact; if not, we then consider whether the foreseeable reliance exception for nonclients applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Attorney-Client Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, an attorney-client relationship may be shown by an express contract, <i>see Miller,</i> 725 N.E.2d at 549, or may be implied \"when (1) a person seeks advice or assistance from an attorney, (2) the advice or assistance sought pertains to matters within the attorney's professional competence, and (3) the attorney expressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually gives the advice or assistance,\" <i>DeVaux v. Am. Home Assurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032741\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032741/devaux-v-american-home-assurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032741\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032741/devaux-v-american-home-assurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 357 (1983) (quoting <i>Kurtenbach v.

The third prong of the <i>DeVaux</i> test may be established \"by proof of detrimental reliance, when the person seeking legal services reasonably relies on the attorney to provide them, and the attorney, aware of such reliance, does nothing to negate it.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not entirely clear whether ISG alleges that an express attorney-client relationship was formed. Nonetheless, we can easily conclude that this is not the case. There is no evidence here of a retainer agreement or other contract for legal services between ISG and any of the defendants; nor is there evidence of billing or remittances for such services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG points to the power of attorney that it executed in favor of Pappalardo in July 2000, authorizing him to transfer to an interest bearing escrow account any funds belonging to ISG that he succeeded in recovering from Swan Trust. However, by executing the power of attorney, ISG granted only a circumscribed agency power to Pappalardo in order to facilitate the physical return of the missing funds. While the power of attorney may have some impact on our analysis of whether an implied attorney-client relationship was formed, it is certain that such a limited power of attorney did not create an express attorney-client relationship. <i>See Williams v. Dugan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></span>, 528, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></span> (1914) (noting that a power of attorney creates limited agency relationship as to expressly enumerated powers and no additional powers may be inferred); <i>see also Bachner v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></span>, 649 (D.Alaska 1987) (\"A power of attorney establishes the relationship of attorney-in-fact, which is an agency relationship different from the relationship of an attorney-at-law.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to ISG's contention that an attorney-client relationship was created by implication, under the <i>DeVaux</i> three-part test. On appeal, ISG contends that, based on Pappalardo's assurance that he represented the interests of the investors and his warnings that filing independent charges would jeopardize his attempts to negotiate a recovery of the funds, ISG reasonably believed that Pappalardo was its attorney and forebore from pursuing independent legal action on that basis. In contrast, the defendants maintain that Pappalardo made clear that he only represented COB, and ISG demonstrated an understanding of this fact; that ISG never relied on Pappalardo for legal services; and that ISG, as a sophisticated, represented entity, understood that its position was potentially adverse to Pappalardo's client, and indeed threatened suit against COB on this basis several times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of whether an implied relationship was created must start with the conjunctive, three-part <i>DeVaux</i> test. Under part one of the test, we ask whether ISG sought legal advice or assistance from Pappalardo. <i>See DeVaux,</i> 444 N.E.2d at 357. Courts interpreting <i>DeVaux</i> have understood this first prong to require concrete communication by the plaintiff requesting that the attorney represent him, or explicitly seeking individualized legal advisement. For example, in <i>Robertson v. Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2009033\"><a href=\"/opinion/2009033/robertson-v-gaston-snow-ely-bartlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2009033\"><a href=\"/opinion/2009033/robertson-v-gaston-snow-ely-bartlett/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 351 (1989), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") found no implied attorney-client relationship between a corporate officer and a law firm representing the corporation, where the officer never explicitly requested that the firm represent him regarding his employment status at the corporation after a reorganization. The SJC reached this conclusion even though the officer had previously been a client of the firm in regard to other matters, had numerous discussions with the firm about the corporate reorganization and his future employment with the corporation, and had requested and received a sample employment agreement from the firm. <i>Id.</i> The SJC concluded that an implied relationship cannot be formed without active communication from the plaintiff to the lawyer requesting legal representation or legal advice:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of several written and many oral communications between the plaintiff and the other participants, the plaintiff introduced no evidence of a specific reference to [the firm] as his personal counsel. His claim is essentially, therefore, that he thought that [the firm] represented him but that he failed to communicate his thought to anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 349.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in <i>Sheinkopf v. Stone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557334\"><a href=\"/opinion/557334/warren-b-sheinkopf-v-john-kp-stone-iii-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span>, 1266-67 (1st Cir.1991), this court held that no implied attorney-client relationship arose under Massachusetts law between an attorney and an investor, where the investor bought into a joint investment venture managed by the attorney. We reached this result even though the attorney prepared various legal documents for the investor's signature and requested that he sign them; promised to \"protect\" the investor; told the investor that \"other clients of [the firm]\" were also investing in the venture; listed the firm's address on the joint venture's legal documents; and transacted joint venture business out of his law firm office and with the assistance of his law firm secretary. <i>Id.</i> at 1265-66. This court found particularly persuasive that the investor \"never explicitly requested [the attorney] or [the law firm] to represent him, never sought any legal advice from them, and was never billed for services.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1268.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, ISG's claim is in some ways weaker than those of plaintiffs in <i>Robertson</i> and <i>Sheinkopf.</i> Not only is there no evidence or allegation that ISG explicitly requested legal representation from Pappalardo, but on at least two occasions ISG acknowledged that it was not Pappalardo's client. First, in a March 30, 2000, letter, Clark wrote to Pappalardo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>While I appreciate that you act for Corporation of the Bankhouse (COB),</i> I find that your failure to respond to any of our correspondence insulting and unprofessional. It is not beyond the parameters of your ethical requirements for you to correspond with International Strategies Group (ISG) <i>on COB's instruction.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Second, on August 15, 2001, having grown more frustrated at Pappalardo's lack of communication and failure to recover the funds through negotiation, C.M. Barber, another ISG director, wrote to Pappalardo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John, you seem to be testing our resolve to take [independent] action. How do we respond? . . . We can prepare a comprehensive complaint to the Massachusetts State Bar with respect to <i>your treatment of us as third parties,</i> particularly in the circumstances of the Power of Attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). These acknowledgments that Pappalardo did not represent ISG were consistent with Pappalardo's advisement to ISG on at least two occasions that he represented COB alone. Following Pappalardo's first meeting with ISG, he wrote to Clark on August 20, 1999:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As you know, I am counsel along with others, for Societ&#233; Bank House (\"C.O.B.\") and represent that entity and its employees in connection with certain matters arising from their relationship with Swan Trust and its successors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three months later, Pappalardo began a letter to ISG's Barber with a similar notification: \"I am writing to you at the request of my client, Corporation of the Bank-House, Incorporated (`COB') in connection with the recovery of funds from the transactions involving the Swan Trust.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there is no evidence that ISG requested legal advice from Pappalardo respecting ISG's potential individual claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Such a request would have raised a serious ethical dilemma for Pappalardo, as one of ISG's foremost claims would have been against COB, Pappalardo's client. Indeed, in a March 23, 2000, letter to COB, ISG's Clark acknowledged that ISG did not have an attorney-client relationship with COB's attorneys, and therefore prodded COB to consult with its own attorneys regarding the prospects for a COB civil suit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e are of the view that the urgent instigation of civil proceedings against Swan Trust, May Davis and others is now a priority. <i>May we seek your consultation with your civil attorneys as to the process and timing of implementing same.</i> It is our view that there will be economies in process and costs through the various investors and/or their fiduciary proceeding in concert and together with Corporation of the BankHouse (\"CoB\") in its separate function as fiduciary to such parties. <i>There would be a requirement for all such parties to be privy to the benefits of a client relationship with your appointed attorneys.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Though ISG here proposed a joint representation of all the investors by COB's attorneys, there is no evidence or even allegation that COB responded to this proposal or took any action to implement it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record indicates that ISG did not explicitly request legal representation from Pappalardo, nor did it seek advice regarding its own legal position vis-&#224;-vis the entities implicated in the fraud. Therefore, we conclude that ISG has set forth insufficient facts to support its claim of an implied relationship under part one of the <i>DeVaux</i> test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the third prong of the <i>DeVaux</i> test,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and ask whether Pappalardo expressly or impliedly agreed to give or actually gave the requested advice or assistance. <i>See DeVaux,</i> 444 N.E.2d at 357. This prong may be satisfied if ISG reasonably relied on Pappalardo to provide legal services, and Pappalardo, aware of such reliance, did nothing to negate it. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonable reliance test captures the essence of ISG's allegation that an implied relationship was created. ISG argues that Pappalardo urged it not to proceed on its own, but rather to wait for Pappalardo to orchestrate a negotiated return of the missing funds on behalf of the \"team\" of investors; therefore, the argument goes, ISG reasonably relied on Pappalardo to provide legal services, and Pappalardo, aware of this reliance, did nothing to negate the impression that he was acting as ISG's attorney. However, the facts before us do not support this account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with ISG's allegation here is that no evidence suggests that ISG was relying on Pappalardo to provide ISG with legal services. Instead, all the evidence suggests that ISG was relying on Pappalardo to recover the funds for COB, with the expectation that ISG would be an eventual financial beneficiary of such a recovery. Pappalardo told ISG that, in his opinion, his negotiations were more likely to lead to a recovery of the missing funds if ISG refrained from filing its own charges. This was a strategic opinion from the attorney of a potential adversary, which ISG was free to accept at face value, ignore, or seek legal advice regarding. ISG chose to forego its own action, expecting to benefit financially from a successful COB recovery. However, ISG's anticipated financial benefit does not transform Pappalardo's legal work on behalf of COB into a duty to ISG. Nor does ISG's expectation of an eventual financial recovery support the notion that it was reasonable for ISG to rely on Pappalardo for legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This situation is analogous to one the SJC confronted in <i>Spinner v. Nutt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1981773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1981773/spinner-v-nutt/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1981773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1981773/spinner-v-nutt/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span> (1994). There, trust beneficiaries brought suit against the attorneys for the estate's trustees. The SJC found no duty of care as between the estate's attorneys and the estate's beneficiaries: \"The fact that third parties are thus benefitted, or damaged, by the attorney's performance does not give rise to a duty by the attorney to such third parties, and hence cannot be the basis for a cause of action by the third parties for the attorney's negligence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 546 (quoting <i>Goldberg v. Frye,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2125251\"><a href=\"/opinion/2125251/goldberg-v-frye/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 489 (1990)). The SJC concluded that, \"In these cases the third parties are incidental beneficiaries, and `[a]n incidental benefit does not suffice to impose a duty upon the attorney.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting Ronald E. Mallen and Jeffrey M. Smith, 1 Legal Malpractice &#167; 7.11 (3d ed.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly here, where ISG relied on Pappalardo to recover the missing money on behalf of COB, rather than to provide ISG directly with legal counsel, ISG put itself in the position of an incidental third-party financial beneficiary, and therefore no implied attorney-client relationship was established. ISG relied on Pappalardo only to recover the missing funds for COB, not to provide ISG with legal services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that ISG did rely on Pappalardo to provide direct legal services, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that ISG's reliance in this regard was reasonable. ISG attempts to rebut this conclusion by pointing to several pieces of evidence, including three statements made by Pappalardo. ISG notes that: (1) Pappalardo sent ISG an \"action plan\" for recovery of the funds which noted that he \"represent[ed] the team,\" comprised of the investors and COB; (2) Pappalardo told ISG that COB and ISG's interests were \"one and the same\"; and (3) Pappalardo told ISG that he was preparing a civil suit against the fraudulent parties \"to protect [ISG's] interest.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, these comments must be analyzed in the broader context of the parties' course of dealing. As discussed above, Pappalardo had told ISG on several occasions that he represented COB alone, and ISG made several statements which indicated its understanding of this arrangement. Also, ISG had chosen to forebear in bringing its own legal action, hoping instead that Pappalardo's negotiations on behalf of COB would succeed, resulting in an eventual financial benefit to ISG. Finally, ISG was aware of its ability to bring suit against COB and Pomeroy, and reminded Pappalardo and COB of this fact on several occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evaluating the three statements cited by ISG in this larger context, we conclude that ISG's alleged reliance was not reasonable. First, Pappalardo's statement in the \"action plan\" that he represented the investors as a team simply reflected the reality that ISG had chosen to coordinate its strategy with COB by deferring individual action in favor of Pappalardo's efforts to recover the funds for COB. Pappalardo's statement that he represented the team is even less problematic than that made by the attorney in <i>Sheinkopf,</i> who told an investor that \"other clients of [the firm]\" were also investing in the attorney's venture. 927 F.2d at 1265. We were unpersuaded in <i>Sheinkopf</i> that that statement was a reasonable basis for an implied relationship. In this case, Pappalardo's statement accurately reflected a choice made by ISG to forebear in favor of Pappalardo's efforts on COB's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Pappalardo's statement that the interests of his client and ISG were one and the same also did not form a reasonable basis for ISG's reliance on Pappalardo for legal services. As discussed above, ISG had threatened to sue COB and Pomeroy on several occasions, indicating that it was well aware that their interests were not fully aligned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, when read in the context of the entire letter, Pappalardo's statement that he was preparing a civil suit on behalf of COB in order to \"protect [ISG's] interest\" also does not provide a reasonable basis for ISG's reliance. ISG highlights just one sentence in the October 22, 1999, letter from Pappalardo to ISG: \"To also protect your interest and as part of pursuing our position for collection, COB has been preparing its own civil fraud case against the U.S. based parties.\" It is a sign of the tenuousness of ISG's claim that the sentence it chose to highlight contains a clear statement by Pappalardo that the civil suit would be brought solely on behalf of his client, COB. Further, because ISG knew that the suit would be brought on behalf of COB alone, it is clear that the \"interest\" that Pappalardo referred to was simply ISG's recovery of its investment funds as an incidental beneficiary of the lawsuit. This is particularly so given that the same letter began, \"I am writing to you at the request of my client, Corporation of the BankHouse Incorporated (\"COB\") . . .\" and the second paragraph stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As our client is bound by confidentiality agreements, I am reluctant to share specifics of the details or process,</i> for fear of jeopardizing the sensitive arrangements involved or breaching specific confidentiality agreements that are integral to the matters involved. However, I want to provide you with an understanding of the <i>actions that are being taken on behalf of COB.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG also points to the power of attorney and accompanying \"side letter\" as grounds for its alleged reasonable reliance on Pappalardo for legal services. As discussed above, the power of attorney granted to Pappalardo the limited agency right to transfer any recovered ISG funds to an interest-bearing escrow account. The \"side letter\" was drafted by ISG and given to Pappalardo along with the signed power of attorney. It read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Directors of ISG seek to . . . clarify . . . that the captioned Power of Attorney is given to [ESCM and Pappalardo] upon the understanding that it will be actioned by the attorney with the utmost good faith and due care having regard to the interests of ISG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"side letter\" simply reiterated the duty of care that accompanies any agency relationship and did not expand the very limited grant of authority contained in the power of attorney. No reasonable factfinder could conclude that ISG, a sophisticated entity, was reasonable to rely on Pappalardo to provide broad legal services simply because it appointed him attorney-in-fact for the limited purpose of transferring funds. Indeed, in an August 2001 letter to Pappalardo, ISG acknowledged that it remained a nonclient third party even after the power of attorney was signed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we hold that ISG's claim fails the third prong of <i>DeVaux</i> because ISG did not rely on Pappalardo for legal services, but merely for incidental financial benefit. Further, we conclude that even if ISG did rely on Pappalardo for legal services, such reliance was not reasonable given the parties' course of dealings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also briefly note that these conclusions are fatal to ISG's claim under prong two of <i>DeVaux,</i> which requires the plaintiff to have sought advice or assistance on a matter within the attorney's professional legal competence. <i>See DeVaux,</i> 444 N.E.2d at 357. As we noted in <i>Sheinkopf,</i> attorneys \"routinely wear a multitude of hats,\" 927 F.2d at 1265, and mere interaction with an attorney for assistance of any kind is not enough under <i>DeVaux.</i> The assistance sought must be legal in nature. The facts here show that ISG relied on Pappalardo only for a financial benefit. ISG having failed all three prongs of the <i>DeVaux</i> test, we conclude that no implied attorney-client relationship was created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span>, 1265 (D.Mass.1988)). However, Massachusetts courts have carved out a limited \"foreseeable reliance\" exception to this rule, which creates a duty to nonclients where the attorney knew, or should have reasonably foreseen, that the nonclient would rely on his services. <i>See Antonellis,</i> 80 F.3d at 609; <i>Sheinkopf,</i> 927 F.2d at 1268. Nonetheless, this duty will not be imposed if \"such an independent duty would potentially conflict with the duty the attorney owes to his or her client.\" <i>Antonellis,</i> 80 F.3d at 609 (quoting <i>Lamare v.

Imposing on Pappalardo a duty to ISG would create a potential conflict with Pappalardo's preexisting duty to COB, his client. <i>See id.</i> (\"Massachusetts and federal case law has consistently found that a potential conflict between an attorney's duty to his or her client and the alleged duty to the nonclient is sufficient to defeat the nonclient's malpractice claim.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISG and COB were potentially adverse parties since ISG invested in COB's scheme. ISG became aware of an actual conflict with COB when it began investigating the fraudulent transfers in early 1999. In a letter to COB sent in early 1999, before Pappalardo was hired, ISG bitterly complained that COB was not keeping ISG apprised of its account positions, and threatened to pursue legal actions if COB \"had been in any way misleading or inaccurate\" regarding the funds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You seem to be under the mistaken impression that I am posturing with respect to the need for ISG to consider it's [sic] legal options.

Because more than three years elapsed between April 2000 and the filing of this action on June 30, 2004, ISG's claims were not timely filed, and the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

However, ISG asking COB's attorney about potential COB claims is quite different from ISG seeking legal advice from Pappalardo regarding its own potential claims, and is not sufficient to satisfy prong one of<i>DeVaux.</i> Further, even if such a request for information might in some circumstances satisfy prong one, the record shows, and ISG concedes, that Pappalardo never provided ISG with the information it sought regarding COB's potential civil claims. Therefore, the third prong of <i>DeVaux</i> &#8212; the provision of the requested legal services &#8212; would not be satisfied, and no implied relationship could be said to have arisen.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We temporarily skip prong two of<i>DeVaux</i> as our analysis of prong three will shed considerable light on the outcome under prong two.
