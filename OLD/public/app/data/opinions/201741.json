Jose Altagracia Castillo appeals from his sentence\n\nimposed following his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of\n\ncocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.1              The district court\n\nenhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), based upon\n\na finding that his role in the offense was that of an \"organizer.\"\n\nOn appeal, Castillo argues for the first time that the facts on the\n\nrecord do not support that enhancement.             We agree and remand for\n\nresentencing.\n\n      The   only    facts   contained    in   the   district   court   record\n\nconcerning Castillo's role in the offense are those contained in\n\nthe \"Stipulation of Facts\" incorporated in the plea agreement:\n\n      1.    Beginning not later than September 1999, JOSE\n            CASTILLO entered into an agreement with CRISTOBAL\n            GARCIA, and numerous others, to acquire and\n            distribute cocaine.\n\n      2.    In furtherance of the conspiracy, JOSE CASTILLO\n            helped arrange for transportation and distribution\n            of   multiple   kilograms   of  cocaine   in   the\n            northeastern United States.\n\nBased on those facts, the presentence report calculated that \"a\n\ntwo-level enhancement is warranted for being an organizer pursuant\n\nto   U.S.S.G.   §   3B1.1(c).\"     The    district    court    followed   that\n\nreasoning verbatim in applying a two-level enhancement, resulting\n\n\n\n      1\n       Castillo was sentenced in January 2003, before the U.S.\nSupreme Court issued its decisions in Blakely v.

Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).              \"If\n\nthose three factors are all met, the court of appeals then has\n\ndiscretion to correct the error only if it 'seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\n\nId. at 736.\" United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n      The district court imposed a two-level enhancement pursuant to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c) which mandates such enhancement \"[i]f the\n\ndefendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any\n\ncriminal activity other than described in (a) or (b)[providing for\n\ngreater enhancements if five or more participants were involved in\n\n\n\n      2\n       As the government confirmed at the sentencing hearing, the\nplea agreement contemplated that Castillo would receive a two-level\nreduction in his base offense level for his minor role in the\noffense.

A two-level increase under §\n\n3B1.1(c) is justified only if the government proves that\n\n      \"(1) the criminal enterprise involved at least two\n      complicit participants (of whom the defendant may be\n      counted as one), and (2) the defendant, in committing the\n      offense, exercised control over, organized, or was\n      otherwise responsible for superintending the activities\n      of at least one of those other persons.\"\n\nGarcia-Morales, 382 F.3d at 19 (quoting United States v.

When this is not so,\n\nhowever,     the    sentencing     court,      in   order      to   apply   such   an\n\nenhancement, must make a specific finding which identifies those\n\nbeing managed 'with enough particularity to give credence to the\n\nupward adjustment.'\" United States v. Medina, 167 F.3d 77, 80 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).    The record in this case does not contain an apparent\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbasis for the role-in-offense enhancement.                 The record establishes\n\nonly    that      Castillo      \"helped      arrange    for   transportation     and\n\ndistribution\" of large quantities of cocaine.                  It is not apparent\n\nfrom that description that Castillo organized the activity of at\n\nleast one other participant.\n\n       At the time of Castillo's guilty plea, after hearing Castillo\n\naccept the stipulation of facts quoted above, the district court\n\nstated that the plea agreement contemplated that Castillo would\n\nreceive a two-level downward adjustment because of his minor role\n\nin   the    offense.         The   sentencing    judge    stated   that   he    would\n\n\"determine, after the probation officer reports, whether you will\n\nactually get that minus two level reduction.\" However, after the\n\nPSR was filed, the district court imposed a two-level enhancement\n\nbased      upon   the    same      factual    information     contained    in     the\n\nstipulation of facts which was incorporated in the plea agreement.\n\n             Under these circumstances, it was plain error for the\n\ndistrict     court      to   enhance   Castillo's       sentence   pursuant     to   §\n\n3B1.1(c) absent any finding, or any basis in the record for\n\nfinding, that Castillo had organized the activities of at least one\n\nother participant.             Castillo has demonstrated that the error\n\naffects his substantial rights.              Absent the two-level enhancement,\n\nthe adjusted offense level would have been 35, yielding a guideline\n\nsentencing range of 168-210 months.                    Given the court's express\n\ninclination to sentence Castillo at the bottom of the applicable\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\frange, there is a reasonable probability that Castillo might well\n\nhave received a sentence of less than 210 months.\n\n     Resentencing is appropriate here because there is no factual\n\nsupport in this sparse record for a finding that Castillo organized\n\nthe activities of another participant.      See United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 302 n. 6 (1st Cir. 2005)(applying\n\nplain error review and stating that \"[h]ad the district court erred\n\nin making factual findings underlying . . . upward adjustment and,\n\nas a result, misapplied guideline enhancements in a way that\n\nincreased the appellant's sentence, such errors would require\n\nresentencing even under our pre-Booker precedents\".\n\n     Castillo also complains that the district court refused to\n\nallow him in the middle of sentencing to offer an amended plea\n\nagreement even though the government did not object.   The district\n\njudge's reaction was understandable and given the delay in making\n\nthe motion and the fact that sentencing was underway, we would be\n\nunlikely to regard this refusal as an abuse of discretion, but we\n\nneed not decide the matter.   Since resentencing will be necessary\n\nin any event, the district court on remand may well be inclined to\n\nallow the parties to propose an amended plea agreement.\n\n     Castillo's sentence is vacated and the action is remanded for\n\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",

The district\n\njudge's reaction was understandable and given the delay in making\n\nthe motion and the fact that sentencing was underway, we would be\n\nunlikely to regard this refusal as an abuse of discretion, but we\n\nneed not decide the matter.   Since resentencing will be necessary\n\nin any event, the district court on remand may well be inclined to\n\nallow the parties to propose an amended plea agreement.\n\n     Castillo's sentence is vacated and the action is remanded for\n\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f</pre>",
