Nuri Otus and Maureen Cunningham,\n\ndefendants   in    the    district    court,    seek    review     of   three\n\ninterlocutory orders entered by the district court at the behest of\n\nthe plaintiff, Micro Signal Research, Inc. (\"Micro\").            The purpose\n\nof the orders was to provide security to satisfy the money judgment\n\nthat Micro is seeking against the defendants.\n\n          The facts, drawn from the initial filings in the district\n\ncourt, appear as follows.     Otus and Cunningham are married to each\n\nother and work together in business ventures.                  One of their\n\nventures involved a business entity called AuctioNet.              AuctioNet\n\nran a website (auctionet.com) and specialized in buying and selling\n\nused technology equipment.\n\n          The     exact   relationship     of   Otus   and    Cunningham   to\n\nAuctioNet is cloudy.      From 1999 to 2001, AuctioNet was affiliated\n\nwith a California corporation called AuctioNet.com, Inc.; in July\n\n2001 it merged into Realm Connect Corporation (“Realm”), which\n\napparently continued the AuctioNet business.           Otus and Cunningham\n\ntogether owned 44 percent of the equity in Realm.            Otus was Realm’s\n\npresident and CEO and one of its three directors; Cunningham was\n\npresent for at least one board meeting and, according to Micro's\n\nlater affidavit, held herself out to be AuctioNet’s CFO and vice\n\npresident.\n\n          During October 2003, Otus discussed with Daniel Epstein,\n\nPresident of Micro, a joint venture to buy certain electronic\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fequipment that Otus said was available and some of which the pair\n\nviewed together.   By e-mail exchanges during October and November,\n\nthe two men agreed that Micro would provide $210,000 for a half\n\nshare in the acquisition venture.      On November 10, 2003, Otus e-\n\nmailed Epstein to wire the money to Cupertino National Bank &\n\nTrust, as the destination bank, payable to AuctioNet.com.    Epstein\n\nwired the money.\n\n          Thereafter, Otus advised by e-mail that he had contracted\n\nto buy the equipment and described deals allegedly being set up so\n\nthe equipment could be resold at a profit.      In April 2004, after\n\ndelays by Otus in providing further information, Epstein discovered\n\nthat Otus had never purchased the equipment, which had been sold in\n\nNovember 2003 to someone else.   When Epstein sought the return of\n\nhis $210,000, Otus over several months claimed that he would repay\n\nthe money, eventually saying that he and Cunningham were on the\n\nverge of refinancing their house to pay Micro back.\n\n          No repayment ever occurred.      Instead, in August 2004,\n\nRealm went out of business, unable to pay its creditors.          By\n\nOctober 2004, Otus and Cunningham were engaged in the same business\n\nthrough a new company called Asset Management Associates Group,\n\nLtd. (“AMA”)--Cunningham as a shareholder and Otus allegedly as an\n\nindependent contractor serving as an “auctioneer.” On October 28,\n\n2004, Micro filed the present action against Otus, Cunningham and\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fCupertino in the federal district court in Massachusetts based on\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.\n\n          Micro’s complaint made claims against Otis and Cunningham\n\nfor inter alia conversion, fraud, breach of contract, and under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (2002), which provides for multiple damages\n\nand attorneys' fees for egregious misconduct. Micro also sought as\n\ninterim relief a preliminary injunction requiring Otus and his wife\n\nto pay to Micro or into the registry of the district court “all\n\nfunds” up to $210,000 “that they are presently earning from the[ir]\n\nnew business entity”; trustee process attachment of all funds up to\n\nthe same amount held at Cupertino in the couples’ name; and\n\nattachment of real property (also up to $210,000) held by the\n\ncouple in Massachusetts or California.1\n\n          On November 4, 2004, after a hearing the district court\n\ngranted all three requests for interim relief, requiring by the\n\npreliminary injunction that the $210,000 from present earnings be\n\npaid into court rather than Micro.   The grant followed submission\n\nof motion papers, an opposition and affidavits. The district court\n\n\n\n     1\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. 64 allows for the grant of prejudgment\nsecurity \"in the manner provided by the law of the state in which\nthe district court is held.\" Massachusetts allows attachment of\nproperty \"upon a writ of attachment in any action in which the debt\nor damages are recoverable . . . .\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223 § 42\n(2002); Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.1. A trustee process attachment is a\ndifferent Massachusetts device to freeze interests held by a third\nparty but belonging to the defendant. See Xerox Fin. Servs. Life\nIns. Co. v. High Plains Ltd. P’ship, 44 F.3d 1033, 1036-37 (1st\nCir. 1995); Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.2.\n\n                               -4-\n\fmade no findings in the order granting relief, beyond saying that\n\nthe defendants admitted their debt to Micro.                Otus and Cunningham\n\nnow   appeal,     contesting     all   three    grants     of    interim   relief.\n\nCupertino has never entered an appearance.\n\n           The grant of a preliminary injunction is immediately\n\nappealable, 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) (2000); Charlesbank Equity Fund\n\nII v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 155-56 (1st Cir. 2004), and\n\nmust be justified under the familiar four-part test: likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits, irreparable injury absent relief, harm to\n\nthe   defendant    if   relief    is   granted,     and    any   public    interest\n\nconsiderations.       Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,\n\n102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996).               Review, except on issues of\n\nabstract law, is deferential.          Id.\n\n           In attacking the preliminary injunction, defendants' main\n\narguments are that the joint venture was between Micro and Realm,\n\nthat Otus was acting on its behalf rather than in a personal\n\ncapacity, that facts necessary to “pierce the corporate veil” have\n\nnot been show, and that neither husband nor wife is liable for\n\nRealm’s debts.     Thus, they say, Micro has not shown a likelihood of\n\nsuccess   on    the     merits   which,      with   rare    exceptions,     is   an\n\nindependent precondition for a preliminary injunction.\n\n           As to Otus, the argument is hopeless.                   The facts set\n\nforth above, based on the evidence thus far, strongly suggest fraud\n\non Otus's part.         Even if AuctioNet or Realm was a legitimate\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbusiness venture and Otus was merely acting on its behalf, fraud by\n\na corporate officer normally makes him independently liable without\n\nany   need   to    pierce   the   corporate   veil.2      Otus   may   offer   a\n\ncountervailing version of events when the merits are tried but, on\n\nthis record, a likelihood of success on the fraud claim against him\n\npersonally is made out.\n\n             The defendants also deny that irreparable injury has been\n\nestablished.       The possibility that a defendant may not have assets\n\non the day of judgment may not automatically make out a showing of\n\nirreparable injury, GA Enters., Inc. v. Leisure Living Cmtys.,\n\nInc., 355 F. Supp. 947, 948 (D. Mass. 1973), but the story is quite\n\ndifferent where there is a strong indication that the defendant may\n\ndissipate or conceal assets.         See, e.g., Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co.\n\nv. New Images of Beverly Hills, 321 F.3d 878, 881 (9th Cir. 2003);\n\nElliot v. Kiesewetter, 98 F.3d 47, 58 (3d Cir. 1996).                   Otus's\n\nprobable fraud, his prevarications about repayment, and the switch\n\nof the business from Realm to AMA are ample indication of the need\n\nfor relief against Otus.\n\n             The    preliminary   injunction    against    Cunningham    is    a\n\ndifferent story, since her involvement in the fraud is less clear.\n\nIn explaining the basis for the injunction, the district court’s\n\n\n      2\n      See Bond Leather Co. v. Q.T. Shoe Mfg. Co., 764 F.2d 928, 938\n(1st Cir. 1985); Townsends, Inc. v. Beaupre, 716 N.E.2d 160, 164\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1999); Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., 598 P.2d 45, 52\n(Cal. 1979); A-1 Check Cashing Serv., Inc. v. Goodman, 538 N.Y.S.2d\n830, 831 (App. Div. 1989).\n\n                                      -6-\n\forder   merely   said--before   specifying   the   relief   granted--that\n\n“defendants do not contest the existence of the [$210,000] debt\n\nowed to plaintiff, and they have repeatedly acknowledged their\n\nobligation to repay same.”      Micro Signal Research, Inc. v. Otus,\n\nNo. 04-12300 (D. Mass. Nov. 4, 2004).\n\n           The lack of detail does not preclude us from affirming if\n\nthe record demonstrates that Cunningham has admitted her own\n\nliability.   Although Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) requires fact-findings\n\nin support of a preliminary injunction, appellate courts are not\n\noverly demanding where the evidence makes clear what the court has\n\nimplicitly found. In all events, an admission in court of personal\n\nliability would not need further explanation.\n\n           Whether Cunningham admitted liability could be disputed.\n\nThe only pertinent portion of the transcript furnished to us\n\nreveals defense counsel saying to the district judge: \"[T]hey [the\n\ndefendants] acknowledge the existence of the debt, and they have\n\nmade attempts to try and work out arrangements whereby --\" [counsel\n\nis then cut off by the judge].           There is also evidence in the\n\ncorrespondence of supposed      efforts to refinance the family home,\n\nwhich is probably the effort to which counsel is referring.         This\n\nis about all in the record.\n\n           In Micro’s brief, plaintiff’s counsel asserts that when\n\nMicro threatened to take the matter to the police,\n\n           [a]ppellants . . . promised to personally\n           repay the debt. They did so repeatedly both\n\n                                   -7-\n\f          orally and in writing through their counsel\n          for a period of approximately six months.\n          Appellants went so far as to state that they\n          would refinance their own home to repay the\n          debt and, indeed, provided supposed refinance\n          documents from their bank to reassure [Micro].\n\nBut there is no citation in support of the prior oral admissions,\n\nand the pertinent correspondence in the record from California\n\ncounsel appears to be written primarily on behalf of Otus. Nothing\n\nin Epstein’s affidavit in the district court describes any oral\n\nadmission by Cunningham.\n\n          The proof at trial might implicate Cunningham in the\n\nfraud or provide a basis for finding that the contractual agreement\n\nwas with her and Otus personally or ultimately prove that Realm was\n\na shell and she and Otus were the real parties in interest. But all\n\nthis is unclear and the district judge made no findings on the\n\npoint.   Nor, as with Otus, can we say that the admission is\n\nirrelevant because of the patent evidence of personal liability\n\n(contained, as to Otus, in the Epstein affidavit).\n\n          Nevertheless, defense counsel’s above quoted statement in\n\ncourt looks like an admission of liability--although not of fraud--\n\nas to both defendants.   If there were some doubt about its meaning\n\n(e.g., that counsel was only intending to admit that Otus was\n\nliable), we could expect counsel to have said so in his reply\n\nbrief, since Micro’s answering brief (like the district judge)\n\nrelies so squarely on defense counsel’s admission as binding both\n\ndefendants.   Nothing of the kind is claimed.\n\n                                -8-\n\f              Instead, the reply brief attempts to assert that any\n\nadmissions that defendants may have made earlier in attempting to\n\nsettle      the   case   were   “offers    of   compromise”   or   “gratuitous”\n\npromises that are not enforceable.              Not a word is said to suggest\n\nthat       defense   counsel’s    statement       in   open   court   has   been\n\nmisinterpreted.          Whatever the status of out-of-court offers to\n\ncompromise or pay, an admission by counsel of his clients’ personal\n\nliability in open court is ample basis for determining that the\n\nother side is likely to prevail on the merits.\n\n              For all we know, the admission, seemingly on behalf of\n\nboth defendants, might have led Micro to withhold evidence or\n\narguments that might otherwise have been presented, or dissuaded\n\nthe district judge from seeking more evidence and making more\n\ndetailed findings.        If counsel meant to concede only the liability\n\nof Otus and to deny it as to Cunningham, it would have been easy\n\nenough to say so.         Whatever the significance of the admission in\n\nfurther proceedings, it is enough to support the preliminary\n\ninjunction.\n\n              This disposes of the claims made on appeal pertaining to\n\nthe preliminary injunction.3          There remain claims by defendants\n\n\n       3\n      Appellants might have argued that injunctive relief in these\ncircumstances is beyond the historic role of equity, see Grupo\nMexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S.\n308, 332-33 (1999), but that case involved only federal equity\npower and a claimed breach of contract. In this diversity case,\nstate law might arguably govern, see R.G. v. Hall, 640 N.E.2d 492,\n492 & n.3 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (upholding such relief), but in any\n\n                                          -9-\n\fthat the district court had no authority to issue its attachment\n\norder as to defendants' real property located in California, and\n\nthat it lacked jurisdiction to order trustee process attachment\n\ndirected   at    Cupertino,    a   bank    apparently    located   only    in\n\nCalifornia.     Compare Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 246 § 1 (2002).\n\n           But unlike preliminary injunctions, which are immediately\n\nappealable by statute, no such exception to the normal final\n\njudgment rule exists as to attachments.         See Charlesbank, 370 F.3d\n\nat 156; Teradyne, Inc. v. Mostek Corp., 797 F.2d 43, 45-46 (1st\n\nCir. 1986).     Nor have defendants made any effort to show that, in\n\ntheir particular circumstances, the collateral order exception to\n\nthe final judgment rule applies to their case.          See Rhode Island v.\n\nU.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 378 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\n\nCohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546-47 (1949).\n\n           Defendants do argue that the attachment of their property\n\nand the trustee process attachment are in substance preliminary\n\ninjunctions.    Admittedly, substance, and not the name given in the\n\norder, controls as to whether relief amounts to an injunction.\n\nCharlesbank, 370 F.3d at 156; Teradyne, 797 F.2d at 46-47.            But in\n\nboth   those    cases,   the   orders     involved   directives    that   the\n\ndefendants there act or refrain from acting--the substance of a\n\nclassic injunction.       E.g., Teradyne, 797 F.2d at 44-45 (order\n\n\n\nevent the Grupo objection was not made an appeal and so is\nforfeited.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fenjoining defendant from disposing of $4 million and requiring the\n\nmoney to be put aside in an account).\n\n          By contrast, the attachment of appellants’ real property\n\nmerely imposes a lien and does not compel them to do or refrain\n\nfrom doing anything. The trustee process is a closer case because,\n\nalthough it does not compel the defendants to do or refrain from\n\ndoing anything, it effectively prevents the trustee from turning\n\nover the property to them.    On the merits, trustee process may be\n\nbarred here if Cupertino has no connection with Massachusetts.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 246 § 1 (2002).     See also Wyshak v. Anaconda\n\nCopper Mining Co., 103 N.E.2d 230, 232 (Mass. 1952).\n\n          However, defendants argue in support of our jurisdiction\n\nonly that the two attachments were part of the same request as the\n\npreliminary injunction. That argument proves nothing. See FDIC v.\n\nElio, 39 F.3d 1239, 1249 (1st Cir. 1994).        Part of a single\n\njudgment may be appealable and another part not.       It is up to\n\ndefendants to show that we have jurisdiction over their appeal of\n\nthe attachments; whether or not a stronger case for jurisdiction\n\ncould have been made, it has not been provided here.\n\n          The preliminary injunction is affirmed.    Insofar as the\n\nappeal is from the attachments, the appeal is dismissed.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

From 1999 to 2001, AuctioNet was affiliated\n\nwith a California corporation called AuctioNet.com, Inc.; in July\n\n2001 it merged into Realm Connect Corporation (“Realm”), which\n\napparently continued the AuctioNet business.           Otus and Cunningham\n\ntogether owned 44 percent of the equity in Realm.            Otus was Realm’s\n\npresident and CEO and one of its three directors; Cunningham was\n\npresent for at least one board meeting and, according to Micro's\n\nlater affidavit, held herself out to be AuctioNet’s CFO and vice\n\npresident.\n\n          During October 2003, Otus discussed with Daniel Epstein,\n\nPresident of Micro, a joint venture to buy certain electronic\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fequipment that Otus said was available and some of which the pair\n\nviewed together.   By e-mail exchanges during October and November,\n\nthe two men agreed that Micro would provide $210,000 for a half\n\nshare in the acquisition venture.      On November 10, 2003, Otus e-\n\nmailed Epstein to wire the money to Cupertino National Bank &\n\nTrust, as the destination bank, payable to AuctioNet.com.    Epstein\n\nwired the money.\n\n          Thereafter, Otus advised by e-mail that he had contracted\n\nto buy the equipment and described deals allegedly being set up so\n\nthe equipment could be resold at a profit.      In April 2004, after\n\ndelays by Otus in providing further information, Epstein discovered\n\nthat Otus had never purchased the equipment, which had been sold in\n\nNovember 2003 to someone else.   When Epstein sought the return of\n\nhis $210,000, Otus over several months claimed that he would repay\n\nthe money, eventually saying that he and Cunningham were on the\n\nverge of refinancing their house to pay Micro back.\n\n          No repayment ever occurred.      Instead, in August 2004,\n\nRealm went out of business, unable to pay its creditors.          By\n\nOctober 2004, Otus and Cunningham were engaged in the same business\n\nthrough a new company called Asset Management Associates Group,\n\nLtd. (“AMA”)--Cunningham as a shareholder and Otus allegedly as an\n\nindependent contractor serving as an “auctioneer.” On October 28,\n\n2004, Micro filed the present action against Otus, Cunningham and\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fCupertino in the federal district court in Massachusetts based on\n\ndiversity jurisdiction.\n\n          Micro’s complaint made claims against Otis and Cunningham\n\nfor inter alia conversion, fraud, breach of contract, and under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (2002), which provides for multiple damages\n\nand attorneys' fees for egregious misconduct. Micro also sought as\n\ninterim relief a preliminary injunction requiring Otus and his wife\n\nto pay to Micro or into the registry of the district court “all\n\nfunds” up to $210,000 “that they are presently earning from the[ir]\n\nnew business entity”; trustee process attachment of all funds up to\n\nthe same amount held at Cupertino in the couples’ name; and\n\nattachment of real property (also up to $210,000) held by the\n\ncouple in Massachusetts or California.1\n\n          On November 4, 2004, after a hearing the district court\n\ngranted all three requests for interim relief, requiring by the\n\npreliminary injunction that the $210,000 from present earnings be\n\npaid into court rather than Micro.   The grant followed submission\n\nof motion papers, an opposition and affidavits. The district court\n\n\n\n     1\n      Fed. R. Civ.

Review, except on issues of\n\nabstract law, is deferential.          Id.\n\n           In attacking the preliminary injunction, defendants' main\n\narguments are that the joint venture was between Micro and Realm,\n\nthat Otus was acting on its behalf rather than in a personal\n\ncapacity, that facts necessary to “pierce the corporate veil” have\n\nnot been show, and that neither husband nor wife is liable for\n\nRealm’s debts.     Thus, they say, Micro has not shown a likelihood of\n\nsuccess   on    the     merits   which,      with   rare    exceptions,     is   an\n\nindependent precondition for a preliminary injunction.\n\n           As to Otus, the argument is hopeless.                   The facts set\n\nforth above, based on the evidence thus far, strongly suggest fraud\n\non Otus's part.         Even if AuctioNet or Realm was a legitimate\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbusiness venture and Otus was merely acting on its behalf, fraud by\n\na corporate officer normally makes him independently liable without\n\nany   need   to    pierce   the   corporate   veil.2      Otus   may   offer   a\n\ncountervailing version of events when the merits are tried but, on\n\nthis record, a likelihood of success on the fraud claim against him\n\npersonally is made out.\n\n             The defendants also deny that irreparable injury has been\n\nestablished.

Otus,\n\nNo. 04-12300 (D. Mass. Nov. 4, 2004).\n\n           The lack of detail does not preclude us from affirming if\n\nthe record demonstrates that Cunningham has admitted her own\n\nliability.   Although Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) requires fact-findings\n\nin support of a preliminary injunction, appellate courts are not\n\noverly demanding where the evidence makes clear what the court has\n\nimplicitly found. In all events, an admission in court of personal\n\nliability would not need further explanation.\n\n           Whether Cunningham admitted liability could be disputed.\n\nThe only pertinent portion of the transcript furnished to us\n\nreveals defense counsel saying to the district judge: \"[T]hey [the\n\ndefendants] acknowledge the existence of the debt, and they have\n\nmade attempts to try and work out arrangements whereby --\" [counsel\n\nis then cut off by the judge].           There is also evidence in the\n\ncorrespondence of supposed      efforts to refinance the family home,\n\nwhich is probably the effort to which counsel is referring.         This\n\nis about all in the record.\n\n           In Micro’s brief, plaintiff’s counsel asserts that when\n\nMicro threatened to take the matter to the police,\n\n           [a]ppellants . . . promised to personally\n           repay the debt. They did so repeatedly both\n\n                                   -7-\n\f          orally and in writing through their counsel\n          for a period of approximately six months.\n          Appellants went so far as to state that they\n          would refinance their own home to repay the\n          debt and, indeed, provided supposed refinance\n          documents from their bank to reassure [Micro].\n\nBut there is no citation in support of the prior oral admissions,\n\nand the pertinent correspondence in the record from California\n\ncounsel appears to be written primarily on behalf of Otus. Nothing\n\nin Epstein’s affidavit in the district court describes any oral\n\nadmission by Cunningham.\n\n          The proof at trial might implicate Cunningham in the\n\nfraud or provide a basis for finding that the contractual agreement\n\nwas with her and Otus personally or ultimately prove that Realm was\n\na shell and she and Otus were the real parties in interest. But all\n\nthis is unclear and the district judge made no findings on the\n\npoint.   Nor, as with Otus, can we say that the admission is\n\nirrelevant because of the patent evidence of personal liability\n\n(contained, as to Otus, in the Epstein affidavit).\n\n          Nevertheless, defense counsel’s above quoted statement in\n\ncourt looks like an admission of liability--although not of fraud--\n\nas to both defendants.   If there were some doubt about its meaning\n\n(e.g., that counsel was only intending to admit that Otus was\n\nliable), we could expect counsel to have said so in his reply\n\nbrief, since Micro’s answering brief (like the district judge)\n\nrelies so squarely on defense counsel’s admission as binding both\n\ndefendants.   Nothing of the kind is claimed.\n\n                                -8-\n\f              Instead, the reply brief attempts to assert that any\n\nadmissions that defendants may have made earlier in attempting to\n\nsettle      the   case   were   “offers    of   compromise”   or   “gratuitous”\n\npromises that are not enforceable.              Not a word is said to suggest\n\nthat       defense   counsel’s    statement       in   open   court   has   been\n\nmisinterpreted.          Whatever the status of out-of-court offers to\n\ncompromise or pay, an admission by counsel of his clients’ personal\n\nliability in open court is ample basis for determining that the\n\nother side is likely to prevail on the merits.\n\n              For all we know, the admission, seemingly on behalf of\n\nboth defendants, might have led Micro to withhold evidence or\n\narguments that might otherwise have been presented, or dissuaded\n\nthe district judge from seeking more evidence and making more\n\ndetailed findings.        If counsel meant to concede only the liability\n\nof Otus and to deny it as to Cunningham, it would have been easy\n\nenough to say so.         Whatever the significance of the admission in\n\nfurther proceedings, it is enough to support the preliminary\n\ninjunction.\n\n              This disposes of the claims made on appeal pertaining to\n\nthe preliminary injunction.3          There remain claims by defendants\n\n\n       3\n      Appellants might have argued that injunctive relief in these\ncircumstances is beyond the historic role of equity, see Grupo\nMexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v.

But in\n\nboth   those    cases,   the   orders     involved   directives    that   the\n\ndefendants there act or refrain from acting--the substance of a\n\nclassic injunction.       E.g., Teradyne, 797 F.2d at 44-45 (order\n\n\n\nevent the Grupo objection was not made an appeal and so is\nforfeited.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fenjoining defendant from disposing of $4 million and requiring the\n\nmoney to be put aside in an account).\n\n          By contrast, the attachment of appellants’ real property\n\nmerely imposes a lien and does not compel them to do or refrain\n\nfrom doing anything. The trustee process is a closer case because,\n\nalthough it does not compel the defendants to do or refrain from\n\ndoing anything, it effectively prevents the trustee from turning\n\nover the property to them.    On the merits, trustee process may be\n\nbarred here if Cupertino has no connection with Massachusetts.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 246 § 1 (2002).     See also Wyshak v.
