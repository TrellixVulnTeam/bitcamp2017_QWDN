Rya W. Zobel,       U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                     Torruella, Lipez and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Joseph Pope on brief pro se.\n     Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\nJoan T. Kennedy, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                            February 10, 2011\n\f            Per Curiam.       Appellant Joseph Pope filed an action,\n\nprimarily   based   on   42   U.S.C.   §   1983,   against   various   prison\n\nofficials and the attorney who was representing these officials.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to the officials and\n\ndismissed appellant’s complaint against the attorney.             We affirm\n\nboth decisions for essentially the reasons given by the court in\n\nthe two relevant Orders (docket # 104 and # 71), adding only the\n\nfollowing comments.\n\n            Summary judgment was appropriate on appellant’s claim\n\nthat the manner in which his first Kufi had been seized had exposed\n\nhim to danger in violation of the Eighth Amendment.                That is,\n\nappellant was required, among other things, to submit objective\n\nevidence showing that the seizure had posed “a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm.”      Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).\n\nHowever, the only evidence in this regard is appellant’s subjective\n\nstatement that he had feared that an inmate insurrection might\n\noccur as a result of the seizure, and this simply is not enough to\n\nmake out an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n            Summary judgment also was appropriate on appellant’s\n\nclaim that the seizure of his Kufi was not accomplished pursuant to\n\nthe applicable state regulations and thus violated due process.\n\nThe problem with this claim is that the seizure of the Kufi must be\n\nconsidered to have been “unauthorized” -- having been allegedly\n\ntaken in contravention of the regulations -- and it is well-settled\n\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\fthat   actions     which    cannot    be    controlled    in   advance   do    not\n\nconstitute a due process violation “until and unless [the State] .\n\n. . refuses to provide a suitable postdeprivation remedy.”                  Hudson\n\nv. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533 (1984).            Since appellant nowhere even\n\nalleged, much less submitted facts showing, that Massachusetts does\n\nnot provide such remedies, Hudson precludes this claim.\n\n              As for the claims against counsel, we will assume,\n\nwithout deciding, that absolute immunity does not apply to the\n\nallegations that she had ordered the search of appellant’s cell and\n\nthe seizure of a second Kufi found therein.                     We nonetheless\n\nconclude that, even taking these allegations as true, the complaint\n\nin regard to these actions is “patently meritless and beyond all\n\nhope   of    redemption,”    and     thus   dismissal    was   warranted.      See\n\nGonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States, 257 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).      We begin with appellant’s retaliation claims and then turn\n\nto his other constitutional claims.\n\n              First, the courts to have addressed the issue have held\n\nthat the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, of which 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1997d is a part, authorizing as it does the attorney\n\ngeneral to initiate a suit, does not create a private right of\n\naction in favor of an individual.              See, e.g., Price v. Brittain,\n\n874 F.2d 252, 262 (5th Cir. 1989); McRorie v. Shimoda, 795 F.2d\n\n780, 782 n. 3 (9th Cir. 1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 3 -\n\f            As for the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court has held\n\nthat, since society is not prepared to recognize a prisoner's\n\nexpectation of privacy in his or her cell, searches and seizures in\n\nsuch locations are not protected by that Amendment’s proscription\n\nagainst unreasonableness.         Hudson, 468 U.S. at 525-26, 528 n.8.\n\nThus, in Hudson, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment did not\n\nprovide a basis for the plaintiff’s claims (1) that the search of\n\nhis cell had been done solely for purposes of harassment and (2)\n\nthat his property had been destroyed.           Id.      Given this, Hudson\n\nprecludes Fourth Amendment challenges to prison cell searches and\n\nseizures taken for any reason, whether reasonable or not.                  See\n\nHanrahan v. Lane, 747 F.2d 1137, 1139 (7th Cir. 1984) (per curiam).\n\n            In    regard    to   retaliation   that   violates     the   First\n\nAmendment, a prisoner, to succeed on such a claim, must establish,\n\namong other things, “a retaliatory adverse act” that is more than\n\nde minimis.      Morris v. Powell, 449 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).            As explained in\n\nMorris, an act is not de minimis if it “would chill or silence a\n\nperson   of      ordinary    firmness   from    future     First    Amendment\n\nactivities.” Id. at 685-86 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).     Under this standard, the courts have held that even the\n\nfiling of a single, later-dismissed disciplinary charge against an\n\ninmate, even if taken with a retaliatory motive, is insufficient to\n\nqualify as more than de minimis.         See, e.g., Bridges v. Gilbert,\n\n\n                                     - 4 -\n\f557 F.3d 541, 555 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that “[a] single\n\nretaliatory    disciplinary   charge   that   is   later   dismissed   is\n\ninsufficient to serve as the basis of a § 1983 action”); Starr v.\n\nDube, 334 Fed. Appx. 341, 342-43 (1st Cir. 2009) (per curiam)\n\n(same). Here, appellant never even had a disciplinary charge filed\n\nagainst him regarding possession of the Kufi, and he had no privacy\n\nexpectations in his cell under Hudson. Given this, any claim based\n\non the search of appellant’s cell and the seizure of his Kufi can\n\nonly be described as de minimis.\n\n           As for the Eighth Amendment, appellant does not contest\n\nthe district court’s conclusion that the seizure of the first Kufi\n\nhad not violated the Eighth Amendment as it had not resulted in the\n\ndenial of “the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.”\n\nOrder, at 5 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (docket\n\n# 104).   This is binding, given the absence of any facts indicating\n\nthat the second seizure was materially different than the first.\n\nThe same conclusion also applies to the search of appellant’s cell,\n\nespecially as he has set out no facts describing the nature or\n\nscope of the search.\n\n           Appellant’s claim under the due process clause similarly\n\nis deficient as he does not allege that either the search or the\n\nseizure were accomplished pursuant to established state procedures\n\nor policies.    Thus, such actions cannot violate procedural due\n\nprocess unless there are no adequate postdeprivation remedies. See\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fHudson, 468 U.S. at 533.               However, and as with his due process\n\nclaim    against    the       other    defendants,      appellant   simply   nowhere\n\nalleges    that    such       remedies    are   lacking,     and    absent   such   an\n\nallegation, dismissal is appropriate. See, e.g., Romero-Barcelo v.\n\nHernandez-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming the\n\ndismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint where he failed to allege\n\nthe     absence    of     adequate       postdeprivation      remedies);     Rumford\n\nPharmacy, Inc. v. City of East Providence, 970 F.2d 996, 999-1000\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (same).                In any event, it appears that public\n\nemployees may be held personally liable for their intentional torts\n\nunder Massachusetts law.              See, e.g., Spring v. Geriatric Auth. of\n\nHolyoke, 475 N.E.2d 727, 734 n.9 (Mass. 1985).\n\n            This leaves appellant’s equal protection claim.                         “In\n\norder to state a claim for discrimination that violates equal\n\nprotection, [a plaintiff] must allege that he was intentionally\n\ntreated differently from others similarly situated and there was no\n\nrational    basis       for   the     difference   in    treatment.”     Toledo      v.\n\nSanchez, 454 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 2006).                    As with appellant’s\n\nother claims against Kennedy, the allegation of an equal protection\n\nviolation is completely conclusory.                     In particular, appellant\n\nnowhere claims that he was subject to the search and seizure based\n\non his Muslim religion, and, more significantly, he nowhere alleges\n\nthat his treatment differed from the treatment accorded to other\n\nprisoners.    As such, the claim is meritless.\n\n\n                                          - 6 -\n\fSummarily affirmed.   See Local Rule 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                      - 7 -\n\f",

City of East Providence, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587575\"><a href=\"/opinion/587575/rumford-pharmacy-inc-v-city-of-east-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999-1000\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (same).                In any event, it appears that public\n\nemployees may be held personally liable for their intentional torts\n\nunder Massachusetts law.              See, e.g., Spring v. Geriatric Auth. of\n\nHolyoke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 n.9 (Mass. 1985).\n\n            This leaves appellant’s equal protection claim.                         “In\n\norder to state a claim for discrimination that violates equal\n\nprotection, [a plaintiff] must allege that he was intentionally\n\ntreated differently from others similarly situated and there was no\n\nrational    basis       for   the     difference   in    treatment.”     Toledo      v.\n\nSanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202306\"><a href=\"/opinion/202306/toledo-v-sanchez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1st Cir. 2006).                    As with appellant’s\n\nother claims against Kennedy, the allegation of an equal protection\n\nviolation is completely conclusory.                     In particular, appellant\n\nnowhere claims that he was subject to the search and seizure based\n\non his Muslim religion, and, more significantly, he nowhere alleges\n\nthat his treatment differed from the treatment accorded to other\n\nprisoners.    As such, the claim is meritless.\n\n\n                                          - 6 -\n\fSummarily affirmed.   See Local Rule 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                      - 7 -\n\f</pre>",
