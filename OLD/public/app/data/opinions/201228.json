Palmieri was\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          August 30, 2004\n\f            CYR,     Senior    Circuit    Judge.       The     Paul    Revere    Life\n\nInsurance Company (“Paul Revere”) appeals a district court order\n\nwhich   dismissed     its     declaratory       judgment     action    against    its\n\ninsured,    Daniel    E.    Bromberg,     due    to   lack    of     subject    matter\n\njurisdiction.        Bromberg     was    employed     by     Ascent    Technologies\n\n(\"Ascent\") as a computer software engineer, from July 1999 to\n\nNovember 2000, during which time he participated in the Employee\n\nSecurity Plan (“Plan”) established by Ascent.                      Moreover, it is\n\nundisputed    that     Paul    Revere,     pursuant     to     the    Plan,     issued\n\nindividual disability insurance policies to Ascent employees and\n\nthat the Plan was governed by the provisions of the Employee\n\nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461.\n\n             On November 15, 2000, Bromberg resigned from Ascent due\n\nto a job-related repetitive stress injury to his elbow, which\n\nprevented him from performing the required job functions (e.g.,\n\ntyping).    In January 2001, Bromberg began paying premiums to Paul\n\nRevere in order to continue his insurance coverage under the Plan\n\npolicy.    But Bromberg never applied to Paul Revere for a new non-\n\nPlan policy.       In May 2001, Bromberg submitted a claim to Paul\n\nRevere,    contending      that   the   elbow    injury      had   left   him   fully\n\ndisabled.    Paul Revere denied coverage, maintaining that Bromberg\n\nhad made material misrepresentations in the July 1999 application\n\nfor coverage under the Plan.\n\n            Subsequently, Paul Revere lodged its complaint in the\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\n\ndemanding a judicial declaration of non-coverage under the Plan.\n\nIn turn, Bromberg moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction, on the ground that ERISA did not\n\ngovern the May 2001 disability claim, due to the fact that, by that\n\ntime, Bromberg was no longer covered by the Ascent Plan, but rather\n\nby   his    individually-funded,   post-termination       policy    with   Paul\n\nRevere.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. § 1132(e)(1).\n\n             The district court dismissed the complaint, and Paul\n\nRevere now appeals.      As the predicate jurisdictional facts are not\n\nin dispute, the Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction is reviewed de novo. See Skwira v. United States, 344\n\nF.3d 64, 71-72 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 2836\n\n(2004).     The Paul Revere complaint for a judicial declaration of\n\nnon-coverage invites a determination as to whether Bromberg was\n\ninsured under the policy in effect at the time of the alleged\n\ninjury.\n\n             The policies issued under the Plan constituted occurrence\n\npolicies,     viz.,   policies   which    (i)   define    “injury”    as   any\n\n“accidental bodily injury sustained after the date of issue and\n\nwhile your policy is in force,” and (ii) provide that “[a]ll losses\n\nmust occur while your policy is in force.”         See CPC Int’l, Inc. v.\n\nNorthbrook Excess & Surplus Ins. Co., 46 F.3d 1211, 1221 (1st Cir.\n\n1995)      (“[A]n   occurrence   policy    provides      coverage    for   any\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f‘occurrence’   which   takes   place    during   the   policy    period.”);\n\nDiLuglio v. New England Ins. Co., 959 F.2d 355, 358 (1st Cir.\n\n1992). Bromberg acknowledged, in writing, as follows: “I resigned\n\nfrom Ascent on November 15th, 2000, and it was from this date\n\nexactly that I am claiming disability.”      As the job-related injury\n\nsustained by Bromberg occurred under the Plan policy, which plainly\n\nis governed by ERISA, see 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1) (defining “employee\n\nwelfare benefit plan”), the declaratory judgment action complaint\n\nadequately pled \"federal question\" jurisdiction.\n\n          Furthermore, the fact that Bromberg submitted his claim\n\nsix months after resigning from Ascent, and after he had assumed\n\nindividual responsibility for the premium payments, does not alter\n\nthe fact that he was covered (if at all) only for an injury under\n\nthe policy in effect on or before November 15, 2000.            See Leahy v.\n\nRaytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that former\n\nemployee filed claim under ERISA plan six months after job furlough\n\nbased on a pre-furlough injury); see also CPC Int’l, 46 F.3d at\n\n1221 (“Under [an occurrence] policy it is irrelevant whether the\n\nresulting claim is brought against the insured during or after the\n\npolicy period, as long as the injury-causing event happens during\n\nthe policy period.”).   In fact, ERISA defines a Plan “participant”\n\nas including such former employees.       See 29 U.S.C. § 1002(7).\n\n          The district court premised its Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal\n\non our decision in Demars v. CIGNA Corp., 173 F.3d 443 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f1999).    However, in Demars the issue was whether ERISA applies to\n\nan individual policy to which the employee “converted” from the\n\nERISA group policy after quitting her job.                 Id. at 444.         We\n\ndetermined that ERISA was inapplicable to the individual policy\n\nbecause the employer’s responsibility for administering and funding\n\nher coverage ended once its employee obtained the conversion\n\npolicy.     Id. at 446.      However, unlike Bromberg, the injury for\n\nwhich Demars claimed coverage did not take place while the ERISA\n\ngroup plan policy remained in force, but after the conversion\n\npolicy had come into effect.           See id. at 445 (“We review de novo\n\nthe legal question whether ERISA preemption applies to claims\n\narising from a conversion policy.”) (emphasis added).\n\n            In other words, in Demars the claimant was not disabled\n\nat the time she quit CIGNA.       Instead, she continued to work in her\n\nown business for some three and one half years before filing a\n\ndisability claim presumably related to a recently occurring medical\n\ncondition.     See    id.    (noting    that   Demars   “stipulated      to   the\n\ndismissal of her ERISA claim”).         Therefore, Demars’ covered injury\n\nplainly “arose from” (viz., during the term of) her individual\n\nconversion policy, which we held was no longer part of the ERISA\n\nplan coverage in effect before leaving CIGNA.\n\n            Indeed, the authorities cited by Demars involve cases –\n\nunlike Bromberg’s     –     wherein    the   injuries   giving    rise   to   the\n\ninsurance    claims   occurred    after      the   effective     dates   of   the\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\frespective policies.   See Barringer-Willis v. Healthsource N.C.,\n\nInc., 14 F. Supp. 2d 780, 781 (E.D.N.C. 1998) (noting that covered\n\ninjury occurred five years after conversion); Mizrahi v. Provident\n\nLife and Accident Ins. Co., 994 F. Supp. 1452, 1453 (S.D. Fla.\n\n1998) (four months after conversion); Powers v. United Health Plans\n\nof New England, Inc., 979 F. Supp. 64, 65 (D. Mass. 1997) (five\n\nmonths after conversion); Mimbs v. Commercial Life Ins. Co., 818 F.\n\nSupp. 1556, 1558 (S.D. Ga. 1993) (one month after conversion); see\n\nalso McCale v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., 881 F. Supp. 233,\n\n234(S.D. W. Va. 1995) (noting that insured’s death postdated\n\nconversion of life insurance policy).   Moreover, subsequent cases\n\nwhich have adopted the Demars rationale all involve such post-\n\nconversion injuries.   See, e.g., Waks v. Empire Blue Cross/Blue\n\nShield, 263 F.3d 872, 874 (9th Cir. 2001) (three years after\n\nconversion); Owen v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., 285 F. Supp. 2d 778, 780\n\n(E.D. Tex. 2003) (eleven years after conversion).\n\n          As Demars is legally, as well as factually, inapposite to\n\nthe Paul Revere complaint for a declaration of non-coverage, the\n\ndistrict court erred in granting the Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the complaint, and Paul Revere now appeals. As the predicate jurisdictional facts are not in dispute, the Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed <i>de novo. See Skwira v.

The Paul Revere complaint for a judicial declaration of non-coverage invites a determination as to whether Bromberg was insured under the policy in effect at the time of the alleged injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policies issued under the Plan constituted occurrence policies, <i>viz.,</i> policies which (i) define \"injury\" as any \"accidental bodily injury sustained after the date of issue and while your policy is in force,\" and (ii) provide that \"[a]ll losses must occur while your policy is in force.\" <i>See CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195856\"><a href=\"/opinion/195856/cpc-v-northbrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span>, 1221 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[A]n occurrence policy provides coverage for any `occurrence' which takes place during the policy period.\"); <i>DiLuglio v. New England Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579947\"><a href=\"/opinion/579947/thomas-a-diluglio-v-new-england-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 358 (1st Cir.1992). Bromberg acknowledged, in writing, as follows: \"I resigned from Ascent on November 15th, 2000, and it was from this date exactly that I am claiming disability.\" As the job-related injury sustained by Bromberg occurred under the Plan policy, which plainly is governed by ERISA, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(1) (defining \"employee welfare benefit plan\"), the declaratory judgment action complaint adequately pled \"federal question\" jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the fact that Bromberg submitted his claim six months after resigning from Ascent, and after he had assumed individual responsibility for the premium payments, does not alter the fact that he was covered (if at all) only for an injury under the policy in effect on or before November 15, 2000. <i>See Leahy v. Raytheon Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200246\"><a href=\"/opinion/200246/leahy-v-raytheon-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that former employee filed claim under ERISA plan six months <i>after</i> job furlough based on a pre-furlough injury); <i>see also CPC Int'l,</i> 46 F.3d at 1221 (\"Under [an occurrence] policy it is irrelevant whether the resulting claim is brought against the insured during or after the policy period, as long as the injury-causing event happens during the policy period.\"). In fact, ERISA defines a Plan \"participant\" as including such former employees. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court premised its Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal on our decision in <i>Demars v. CIGNA Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763220\"><a href=\"/opinion/763220/22-employee-benefits-cas-2913-pens-plan-guide-cch-p-23954b-jeanne-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999). However, in <i>Demars</i> the issue was whether ERISA applies to an individual policy to which the employee \"converted\" from the ERISA group policy after quitting her job. <i>Id.</i> at 444. We determined that ERISA was inapplicable to the individual policy because the employer's responsibility for administering and funding her coverage ended once its employee obtained the conversion policy. <i>Id.</i> at 446. However, unlike Bromberg, the injury for which Demars claimed coverage did not take place while the ERISA group plan policy remained in force, but after the conversion policy had come into effect. <i>See id.</i> at 445 (\"We review de novo the legal question whether ERISA preemption applies to claims <i>arising from a conversion policy.</i>\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, in <i>Demars</i> the claimant was not disabled at the time she quit CIGNA. Instead, she continued to work in her own business for some three and one half years before filing a disability claim presumably related to a recently occurring medical condition. <i>See id.</i> (noting that Demars \"stipulated to the dismissal of her ERISA claim\"). Therefore, Demars' covered injury plainly \"arose from\" (<i>viz.,</i> during the term of) her individual conversion policy, which we held was no longer part of the ERISA plan coverage in effect before leaving CIGNA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the authorities cited by <i>Demars</i> involve cases&#8212;unlike Bromberg's&#8212;wherein the injuries giving rise to the insurance claims occurred <i>after</i> the effective dates of the respective policies. <i>See Barringer-Willis v.
