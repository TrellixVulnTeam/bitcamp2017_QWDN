Báez-Godínez and Law Office of Enrique A. Báez-\nGodínez on brief for appellants.\n     Luis F. Antonetti-Zequeira, Javier G. Vázquez-Segarra and\nGoldman Antonetti & Córdova, P.S.C. on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                              June 14, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.     In June 2001, Jovita Menendez, an account\n\nmanager at Scotiabank of Puerto Rico, applied for a posted job as\n\nsenior account manager.         On June 22, the job went instead to\n\nFrancisco Vazquez, whose rank (branch manager) was higher than that\n\nof Menendez and just below senior account manager.            Vazquez was a\n\nmale aged 35; Menendez was then 54 years old.\n\n           On the same day as the decision to promote Vazquez,\n\nMenendez wrote to the head of Scotiabank, claiming that age and\n\ngender discrimination had deprived her of the post.              In October\n\n2001, Menendez left Scotiabank on sick leave and then applied for\n\ndisability.    On July 12, 2002, Menendez filed an age and gender\n\ndiscrimination charge with the EEOC, which issued her a \"right-to-\n\nsue\" letter that same day.\n\n           Menendez brought suit in federal court on October 1,\n\n2002, against Scotiabank and its parent company (collectively\n\n“Scotiabank”), alleging violations of Title VII and the ADEA, as\n\nwell as Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination law.            42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e\n\nto 2000e-17 (2000); 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634 (2000); 29 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§§ 146-155 (2001).        The centerpiece of the complaint was the\n\nfailure   to   promote,   but   the    complaint   also    alleged   various\n\ngrievances from earlier years (inadequate supplies, a failure at an\n\nearly point to raise her job classification, her increased work\n\nload).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f             In addition to defending the choice to promote Vazquez\n\nrather than Menendez, Scotiabank sought summary judgment on statute\n\nof limitations grounds.       It asserted that the filing for the\n\nfederal claims had to be made within 300 days of the violation and\n\nfor the local claims within 365 days; Menendez had in fact waited\n\n385 days.1    Menendez replied that the violations were systemic and\n\nserial and that, as to those claims, genuine issues of material\n\nfact precluded summary judgment.\n\n             On May 27, 2004, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment for Scotiabank in a detailed 21-page decision.     After an\n\nunsuccessful Rule 59 motion for reconsideration, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n59(e), Menendez brought this appeal, arguing in substance that four\n\ndiscriminatory acts occurring after June 2001 precluded summary\n\njudgment.    Our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.\n\nNoviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 84 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             First, Menendez says that Nestor Vale, one of Menendez'\n\nsupervisors, began after June 2001 to address Menendez as “Doña\n\nJovita.”     “Doña,” says Menendez, is a term used to denote respect\n\nfor “elderly individuals” and was used by Vale in a “cynical and\n\ncontemptuous” manner. It is almost impossible to find any evidence\n\n\n     1\n      See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); 29 U.S.C. § 626(d); see also\nNational Railroad Passenger Co. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110-14\n(2002) (under Title VII, \"discrete discriminatory acts are not\nactionable if time-barred, even when they are related to acts\nalleged in timely filed charges\"); American Airlines, Inc. v.\nCardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 122 (1st Cir. 1998) (ADEA); id. at\n124-25 (Puerto Rico's \"Law 100\").\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsupplied by Menendez as to when these statements were made or in\n\nwhat context but, in any event, they are not enough to rescue her\n\nclaim.\n\n          Menendez does not say that these remarks were themselves\n\nviolations of any anti-discrimination laws, and they were not\n\nidentified in her complaint.   Whether or not they are evidence of\n\nmotive bearing on the failure to promote does not matter: Menendez’\n\nown letter to Scotiabank’s CEO shows that she was on immediate\n\nnotice of the alleged discriminatory motive.   Nor do such remarks\n\nturn a specific employment action occurring at an earlier time into\n\na serial or systemic violation.\n\n          Second, Menendez says that when she went on sick leave\n\nand applied for disability, her work was taken over for the time\n\nbeing--Puerto Rico law protected for 12 months Menendez’ right to\n\nreturn to her position--by another employee, Liza Nieves.   Nieves,\n\nsays Menendez, was a younger woman with a higher job classification\n\nand salary.   Menendez nowhere in her brief explains just why she\n\nthinks this helps her case.\n\n          Possibly Menendez infers that Nieves’ temporary handling\n\nof the work shows that all along Menendez’ job should have enjoyed\n\nthe higher rank and salary.    But the brief does not say this and\n\nthe inference is pretty lame as applied to a temporary assumption\n\nof duties; during strikes, for example, management employees often\n\ntake over lower-level jobs.    Even a stronger inference would at\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fbest be evidence as to the prior failure-to-promote charge--and so\n\nof no help on the limitations issue.\n\n           Third, Menendez claims that, unlike other employees, she\n\nwas given inadequate office equipment and work space. The district\n\ncourt found that any deprivations occurred in 1999 or 2000, well\n\nbefore the failure to promote.           Menendez points to no specific\n\nevent occurring after the later date.            Nor does she explain how\n\nthese events bolster her claim of a pattern of either age or gender\n\ndiscrimination, given the lack of any indication that other women\n\nor older employees suffered in the same way.\n\n           Fourth, Menendez says that she was denied her “VIP bonus”\n\nfor the fiscal year ending on October 31, 2001.          Menendez says that\n\nit was ordinary practice to pro-rate the bonus for employees on\n\nmedical leave.     The company says that Menendez was not entitled to\n\na bonus, because she was not an active employee at year’s end and\n\nhad not gotten an evaluation for the year.               The written bonus\n\npolicy, submitted by Scotiabank, does list both requirements and\n\nsays nothing about pro-rating bonuses.\n\n           In any event, if intended by Menendez to suggest a\n\ndiscriminatory motive for the failure to promote, this bonus\n\nincident does not extend the statute for the known failure to\n\npromote.    And,    if   intended   as    a   separate   actionable   act   of\n\ndiscrimination, Menendez points to no substantial evidence that the\n\ndecision as to the bonus was based upon age or gender; nor did she\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\finclude the incident as a discriminatory act in either her EEOC\n\nclaim or her court complaint.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
