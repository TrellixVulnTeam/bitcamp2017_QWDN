John J. Diamond, III, debtor\n\nand plaintiff below, appeals the district court's affirmance of the\n\nbankruptcy court's dismissal of his complaint for failure to state\n\na claim.     After careful review, we reverse the district court's\n\ndismissal and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n            Diamond, a seventeen year veteran of the real estate\n\nindustry, filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in\n\nOctober 2000 that he later converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding.\n\nOne unsecured creditor, Premier Capital, Inc. (\"Premier\"), filed an\n\nadversary proceeding to deny Diamond a discharge pursuant to 11\n\nU.S.C. § 727 on the basis that Diamond had concealed assets and\n\nmade false oaths.\n\n            While   negotiating     a     settlement   in    the    discharge\n\nproceeding,    Premier's   attorney,      Randall   Pratt,   allegedly    told\n\nDiamond's attorney that if the dischargeability issue was not\n\nresolved in Premier's favor, he would take action at the New\n\nHampshire Real Estate Commission to revoke Diamond's real estate\n\nbroker's license. Diamond agreed to Premier's proposed settlement,\n\nbut   the   bankruptcy   court    rejected   the    settlement     and   denied\n\nPremier's complaint on all grounds.\n\n            Diamond filed a bankruptcy court complaint against both\n\nPremier and Pratt alleging that Pratt's statement was an improper\n\nattempt to collect, assess, or recover a debt by using coercive\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fnegotiation tactics in violation of the Bankruptcy Code's (\"Code\")\n\nautomatic stay.       See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) (2000).            Diamond sought\n\nactual damages, costs, attorney's fees, and punitive damages.\n\n          Premier and Pratt moved to dismiss the complaint on the\n\ngrounds that Diamond failed to state a claim upon which relief\n\ncould be granted. The bankruptcy court refused to construe Pratt's\n\nstatement as a violation of the automatic stay, holding that\n\n\"lawyers have to be free to -- I can't say use every tactic, but\n\nuse tactics within bounds to try to negotiate the best deal for\n\ntheir client.\"    Accepting as true the facts alleged in Diamond's\n\ncomplaint, the bankruptcy court concluded Pratt's statement did not\n\n\"go over the line\" and dismissed the complaint.               Diamond appealed\n\nto the district court, which affirmed the dismissal.                     He now\n\nappeals the dismissal to this Court.\n\n                                 II.    Analysis\n\n          Diamond argues that Premier's statement that it would\n\nseek revocation of his real estate license, which occurred during\n\nnegotiations     to    settle     the    adversary      proceeding   regarding\n\ndischarge,   constituted        coercive      tactics   in   violation   of   the\n\nautomatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code.                  According to\n\nDiamond, the district court erred in dismissing his complaint on\n\nthe basis that the statement could not be considered coercive.                 We\n\nreview the dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, assuming\n\nthe truth of all well-pleaded material facts and indulging all\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\freasonable inferences in favor of Diamond.                Arruda v. Sears,\n\nRoebuck & Co., 310 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nA.   Settlement Negotiations Concerning Denial of Discharge\n\n            We begin with the issue of whether negotiations regarding\n\na § 727 challenge to discharge are ever permissible, or if such\n\nnegotiations    should   be   considered   a   per   se   violation   of   the\n\nautomatic stay.1\n\n            \"The automatic stay is one of the fundamental protections\n\nthat the Bankruptcy Code affords to debtors.\"              Jamo v. Katahdin\n\nFederal Credit Union (In re Jamo), 283 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     Under 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(6), the filing of a bankruptcy\n\npetition operates as an automatic stay of \"any act to collect,\n\nassess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the\n\ncommencement of the case.\"        Section 727 is a specific exemption\n\nfrom the automatic stay to allow for a challenge to discharge.\n\n            Whether settlement negotiations pertaining to a challenge\n\nto discharge violate the automatic stay is an issue of first\n\nimpression in this Court.      Recently, however, we held that, \"while\n\nthe automatic stay is in effect, a creditor may engage in post-\n\npetition     negotiations     pertaining       to    a    bankruptcy-related\n\n\n1\n    Although Diamond's brief presents arguments that the Court\nshould adopt a per se rule that negotiations about discharge\nviolate the automatic stay, we do not believe this is a matter in\ndispute.   At oral arguments and indeed in parts of his brief,\nDiamond's attorney clearly stated that negotiations about a\ndischarge are allowed if such negotiations are not coercive. Thus,\nDiamond and Premier agree on this issue.\n\n                                    -4-\n\freaffirmation agreement so long as the creditor does not engage in\n\ncoercive or harassing tactics.\"      Jamo, 283 F.3d at 399.   We agree\n\nwith the parties that it makes sense to extend the Jamo rule and\n\nadopt the majority approach allowing settlement negotiations in\n\n§ 727 discharge proceedings. See generally Terrence L. Michael and\n\nMichael R. Pacewicz, Settling Objections to Discharge in Bankruptcy\n\nCases: An Unsettling Look at Very Unsettled Law, 37 Tulsa L. Rev.\n\n637 (2002) (reviewing the    approaches to the settlement of § 727\n\nproceedings and indicating that the majority of courts allow\n\nsettlement on a case-by-case basis).       Absent controversy on the\n\npoint, we need not belabor the issue.\n\nB.   Coerciveness of the Threat\n\n          Having   agreed   with    the   parties   that   negotiations\n\nregarding discharge are not per se violations of the automatic\n\nstay, we turn to the settlement negotiations in this case to\n\ndetermine whether Premier's statement regarding Diamond's real\n\nestate license could have constituted impermissible \"coercion or\n\nharassment.\"   Jamo, 283 F.3d at 399.2     A 12(b)(6) dismissal would\n\nbe appropriate only if \"it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff\n\ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would\n\nentitle him to relief.\"     Medina-Claudio v. Rodríguez-Mateo, 292\n\n\n2\n     Since the proposed settlement was rejected and Diamond\nultimately prevailed in the discharge proceeding, we need not\nconsider the merits of the settlement itself. The only issue here\nis whether the alleged statement could constitute an impermissible\nnegotiation tactic.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fF.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            In evaluating the coerciveness of a statement made in the\n\ncourse of negotiations, this Court has not enunciated a specific\n\ntest, but does look at the immediateness of any threatened action\n\nand the context in which a statement is made.       See Jamo, 283 F.3d\n\nat 402 (citing In re Brown, 851 F.2d 81, 86 (3d Cir. 1988))\n\n(considering creditor's references to foreclosure in context and\n\ndeciding they were not coercive because, rather than signaling\n\n\"immediate action,\" they indicated that foreclosure was not \"on the\n\n[creditor's] agenda\").\n\n            Here, Premier's alleged statement could \"reasonably be\n\ndeemed tantamount to a threat\" of immediate action against Diamond.\n\nJamo, 283 F.3d at 402.   Premier's statement placed Diamond between\n\na rock and a hard place.     If he prevailed in the § 727 proceeding,\n\nas he ultimately did, he would face an administrative proceeding\n\nand quite possibly the revocation of his real estate license, the\n\nsource of his livelihood.          If Premier prevailed in the § 727\n\nproceeding, then Diamond would suffer because he would not obtain\n\na discharge of his debts.    Thus, Diamond would lose either way.   In\n\nthis   situation,    where    an     unsecured   creditor's   statement\n\nfunctionally forces the debtor to treat a professional license as\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fcollateral, a dismissal on the pleadings is unacceptable because\n\nthe statement could be found to be coercive by a trier of fact.3\n\n          Premier   presents   several    arguments    against   the\n\nstatement's coerciveness, but we find none of them convincing.\n\nFirst, Premier argues that the statement, which was a one-time\n\ncommunication,4 did not threaten immediate action because it was\n\nconditioned on the outcome of the adversary proceeding.    We cannot\n\nagree.   Filing of the administrative proceeding to have Diamond's\n\nlicense revoked at the time of the statement likely would have\n\nviolated the automatic stay, thus making truly instantaneous action\n\nto that effect risky if not impossible.   See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1)\n\n(barring initiation of \"administrative or other proceeding against\n\nthe debtor\" once bankruptcy petition has been filed).    In light of\n\n\n\n3\n   In Jamo, the Court acknowledged that \"a Chapter 7 debtor is not\ninoculated against the necessity for making hard choices\" and that\n\"[b]ankruptcy, as life itself, is a series of tradeoffs.\" Id. at\n400. The Jamo Court also noted that \"reaffirmation agreements are\nconsensual, and a debtor always has the option of walking away from\nan unattractive proposal.\" Id. A debtor can either reaffirm his\nsecured debt and keep the collateral or surrender the collateral\nand receive complete debt relief. Although it may appear at first\nblush that Diamond would face a similar dilemma, we note that\nDiamond's real estate license was not collateral for the unsecured\ndebt to Premier. Thus, Premier cannot put him in a position where\nhis license would be the functional equivalent to collateral, such\nthat he would choose to either keep it and repay his debt to\nPremier or surrender it in exchange for a discharge.\n4\n   The fact that the statement was made once may in    fact weigh in\nfavor of coerciveness. If settlement occurred soon     thereafter --\nsomething that is unclear on this undeveloped record   -- then it was\nperhaps such a coercive statement that it only         needed to be\ncommunicated once.\n\n                               -7-\n\fthe    procedural   block   to    an   immediate      filing      of   revocation\n\nproceedings, the statement threatened action that was as immediate\n\nas possible, and sufficiently imminent to be potentially coercive.\n\n            Second, Premier argues that the communication could not\n\nbe considered coercive because it occurred between counsel during\n\nan administrative proceeding, not reaffirmation. The fact that the\n\nstatement was made by Premier's attorney to Diamond's attorney does\n\nnot detract from its coerciveness.            In Jamo, the statements at\n\nissue were also between counsel, but the Jamo Court did not find\n\nthis fact relevant to the coerciveness determination.                  Id. at 402.\n\nSimilarly, we do not find it determinative that the statement was\n\nmade   to   Diamond's   counsel     rather    than    to    Diamond      himself,\n\nparticularly where counsel swiftly communicated the threat to his\n\nclient.     Although we doubt Premier's proposition that statements\n\nmade in an adversary context should be given greater leniency, we\n\nleave that issue for the district court's consideration on remand.\n\n            Finally,    Premier    would     have    us    find   that    it   was\n\nunreasonable for Diamond to perceive the threat as coercive, and\n\nfurther that Diamond's complaint is insufficient because it failed\n\nto allege Premier lacked a good faith basis for a complaint to the\n\nReal Estate Commission.5         If the threat was an empty one -- in\n\n\n5\n    Premier relies on the New Hampshire Rules of Professional\nConduct (\"New Hampshire Rules\") in its argument that Diamond had to\nallege lack of a good faith basis, and urges this Court to turn to\nthe Rules as authority for what constitutes coercive behavior.\nAlthough the district court's order referred to the NH Rules and\n\n                                       -8-\n\fother words if it lacked a good faith basis -- we do not think that\n\nPremier would have made it at all.    Further, Premier cannot have it\n\nboth ways, arguing it had a good faith basis for making the threat\n\nwhile simultaneously claiming that the threat was an empty one.\n\n          We conclude that the alleged statement could be found\n\ncoercive, and Diamond could indeed prove a set of facts -- that\n\nPremier made the statement and that it coerced Diamond to settle --\n\nthat would entitle him to relief.     We note, however, that because\n\nDiamond would have had to defend against the § 727 discharge\n\nproceeding regardless of the statement's coerciveness, his damages\n\nare unclear.   The remedy issue is one the district court should\n\nexamine more closely on remand.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the dismissal of\n\nDiamond's complaint and remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n          Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\nthe American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct\n(\"Model Rules\"), it did so only as an illustration of what\nreasonable people might view as coercive.        No authority is\npresented to support use of the New Hampshire Rules or the Model\nRules as the guideposts for determining if a statement made during\nsettlement negotiations is coercive. We need not decide here if\nsuch an approach should be adopted in cases involving alleged\nviolations of the automatic stay.\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

Rodr&#237;guez-Mateo,</i> 292 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the coerciveness of a statement made in the course of negotiations, this Court has not enunciated a specific test, but does look at the immediateness of any threatened action and the context in which a statement is made. <i>See Jamo,</i> 283 F.3d at 402 (citing <i>In re Brown,</i> 851 F.2d 81, 86 (3d Cir.1988)) (considering creditor's references to foreclosure in context and deciding they were not coercive because, rather than signaling \"immediate action,\" they indicated that foreclosure was not \"on the [creditor's] agenda\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Premier's alleged statement could \"reasonably be deemed tantamount to a threat\" of immediate action against Diamond. <i>Jamo,</i> 283 F.3d at 402. Premier's statement placed Diamond between a rock and a hard place. If he prevailed in the &#167; 727 proceeding, as he ultimately did, he would face an administrative proceeding and quite possibly the revocation of his real estate license, the source of his livelihood. If Premier prevailed in the &#167; 727 proceeding, then Diamond would suffer because he would not obtain a discharge of his debts. Thus, Diamond would lose either way. In this situation, where an unsecured creditor's statement functionally forces the debtor to treat a professional license as collateral, a dismissal on the pleadings is unacceptable because the statement could be found to be coercive by a trier of fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Premier presents several arguments against the statement's coerciveness, but we find none of them convincing. First, Premier argues that the statement, which was a one-time communication,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> did not threaten immediate action because it was conditioned on the outcome of the adversary proceeding. We cannot agree. Filing of the administrative proceeding to have Diamond's license revoked at the time of the statement likely would have violated the automatic stay, thus making truly instantaneous action to that effect risky if not impossible. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(1) (barring initiation of \"administrative or other proceeding against the debtor\" once bankruptcy petition has been filed). In light of the procedural block to an immediate filing of revocation proceedings, the statement threatened action that was as immediate as possible, and sufficiently imminent to be potentially coercive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Premier argues that the communication could not be considered coercive because it occurred between counsel during an administrative proceeding, not reaffirmation. The fact that the statement was made by Premier's attorney to Diamond's attorney does not detract from its coerciveness. In <i>Jamo,</i> the statements at issue were also between counsel, but the <i>Jamo</i> Court did not find this fact relevant to the coerciveness determination. <i>Id.</i> at 402. Similarly, we do not find it determinative that the statement was made to Diamond's counsel rather than to Diamond himself, particularly where counsel swiftly communicated the threat to his client. Although we doubt Premier's proposition that statements made in an adversary context should be given greater leniency, we leave that issue for the district court's consideration on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Premier would have us find that it was unreasonable for Diamond to perceive the threat as coercive, and further that Diamond's complaint is insufficient because it failed to allege Premier lacked a good faith basis for a complaint to the Real Estate Commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If the threat was an empty one &#8212; in other words if it lacked a good faith basis &#8212; we do not think that Premier would have made it at all. Further, Premier cannot have it both ways, arguing it had a good faith basis for making the threat while simultaneously claiming that the threat was an empty one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the alleged statement could be found coercive, and Diamond could indeed prove a set of facts &#8212; that Premier made the statement and that it coerced Diamond to settle &#8212; that would entitle him to relief. We note, however, that because Diamond would have had to defend against the &#167; 727 discharge proceeding regardless of the statement's coerciveness, his damages are unclear.

Diamond, III, debtor and plaintiff below, appeals the district court's affirmance of the bankruptcy court's dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. After careful review, we reverse the district court's dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diamond, a seventeen year veteran of the real estate industry, filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in October 2000 that he later converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding. One unsecured creditor, Premier Capital, Inc. (\"Premier\"), filed an adversary proceeding to deny Diamond a discharge pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727 on the basis that Diamond had concealed assets and made false oaths.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While negotiating a settlement in the discharge proceeding, Premier's attorney, Randall Pratt, allegedly told Diamond's attorney that if the dischargeability issue was not resolved in Premier's favor, he would take action at the New Hampshire Real Estate Commission to revoke Diamond's real estate broker's license. Diamond agreed to Premier's proposed settlement, but the bankruptcy court rejected the settlement and denied Premier's complaint on all grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diamond filed a bankruptcy court complaint against both Premier and Pratt alleging that Pratt's statement was an improper attempt to collect, assess, or recover a debt by using coercive negotiation tactics in violation of the Bankruptcy Code's (\"Code\") automatic stay. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a) (2000). Diamond sought actual damages, costs, attorney's fees, and punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Premier and Pratt moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Diamond failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The bankruptcy court refused to construe Pratt's statement as a violation of the automatic stay, holding that \"lawyers have to be free to &#8212; I can't say use every tactic, but use tactics within bounds to try to negotiate the best deal for their client.\" Accepting as true the facts alleged in Diamond's complaint, the bankruptcy court concluded Pratt's statement did not \"go over the line\" and dismissed the complaint. Diamond appealed to the district court, which affirmed the dismissal. He now appeals the dismissal to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Diamond argues that Premier's statement that it would seek revocation of his real estate license, which occurred during negotiations to settle the adversary proceeding regarding discharge, constituted coercive tactics in violation of the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code. According to Diamond, the district court erred in dismissing his complaint on the basis that the statement could not be considered coercive. We review the dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo, assuming the truth of all well-pleaded material facts and indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of Diamond. <i>Arruda v.

Under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(6), the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay of \"any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case.\" Section 727 is a specific exemption from the automatic stay to allow for a challenge to discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether settlement negotiations pertaining to a challenge to discharge violate the automatic stay is an issue of first impression in this Court.
