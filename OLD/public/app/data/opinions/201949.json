Restani, Chief Judge of the United States\nCourt of International Trade, sitting by designation.\n\f           RESTANI, Judge. Clifford Gorfinkle (“Gorfinkle”) brought\n\na negligence claim against U.S. Airways, Inc. (“U.S. Airways”) in\n\nMassachusetts state court.           U.S. Airways then removed the case to\n\nfederal court based upon diversity of citizenship, and brought a\n\nthird-party claim against F.F. Santarpio (“Santarpio”).                  Gorfinkle\n\nsubsequently filed a Second Amended Complaint adding Santarpio, a\n\nnondiverse      party,    as   a   direct   defendant,    and     thus   destroyed\n\ndiversity. The case proceeded to the merits without the parties or\n\nthe district court recognizing the diversity issue and the court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Gorfinkle.\n\n           We dismiss the complaint against Santarpio with prejudice\n\nin order to preserve diversity jurisdiction, and otherwise affirm\n\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment.\n\n                  I.     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n           Gorfinkle claims that he was injured on March 9, 1996,\n\nbecause U.S. Airways created a hazardous condition in its baggage\n\nclaim area, and then failed to warn him of, and protect him from,\n\nthe hazardous condition.             The hazardous condition consisted of\n\nstacked luggage in a baggage claim area at Logan International\n\nAirport in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n           The    night     before    Gorfinkle’s     accident,     U.S.    Airways\n\ncanceled his flight from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.      His luggage was sent ahead to Logan International\n\nAirport   and    Gorfinkle     followed     on   an   overnight    train.     Upon\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\farriving, Gorfinkle went to the airport to pick up his luggage.\n\nOnce at the airport, he went into a roped-off baggage claim area\n\nwhere luggage had been stacked about two to three bags high. He\n\nclimbed on top of the stacked luggage and walked on top of the\n\nstacks to find his suitcase.         Gorfinkle then attempted to pull out\n\na suitcase from underneath two other bags, but let go when he\n\nrealized it was not his.        He then lost his balance, fell, and\n\ninjured himself.\n\n            Afterwards, Gorfinkle brought a negligence claim against\n\nU.S. Airways in Suffolk Superior Court.               On May 27, 1999, U.S.\n\nAirways removed the action to federal court based upon diversity of\n\ncitizenship – Gorfinkle is a domiciliary of Massachusetts, while\n\nU.S. Airways is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of\n\nbusiness    in   Virginia.   U.S.    Airways   then      filed   a   third-party\n\ncomplaint against Santarpio, the skycap for the baggage claim area\n\nand   a   Massachusetts   corporation       with   its   principal     place   of\n\nbusiness in Massachusetts.          While this did not defeat diversity,\n\nGorfinkle destroyed diversity when he filed a Second Amended\n\nComplaint adding Santarpio as a direct defendant.1\n\n            The district court did not realize that diversity was\n\ndefeated and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n\n      1\n      The Second Amended Complaint included claims brought by\nGorfinkle’s daughter, Alexandra Rebecca Jean Garston, and wife,\nDeborah A. Garston. Alexandra’s claim was dismissed on August 8,\n2003, and Deborah’s claim was dismissed on January 30, 2004.\nNeither are party to this appeal.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fGorfinkle      appealed     the    grant   of    summary   judgment.    Upon   oral\n\nargument, the court discovered that complete diversity had been\n\ndefeated.      In his supplemental brief, Gorfinkle asks the court to\n\nremand   the    case   to    state    court,     while   appellees   request   the\n\ndismissal of Santarpio to preserve diversity jurisdiction.\n\n                          II.     DIVERSITY JURISDICTION\n\n            In order to maintain an action in federal court based\n\nupon diversity jurisdiction, the plaintiff must be diverse from the\n\ndefendant in the case.            See Am. Fiber & Finishing, Inc. v. Tyco\n\nHealthcare Group, LP, 362 F.3d 136, 139 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing\n\nStrawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806)).                The addition of a non-\n\ndiverse defendant in an amended complaint defeats diversity.                   See\n\nid. at 141–42.\n\n            If the nondiverse party is dispensable, however, an\n\nappellate court can preserve diversity jurisdiction by dismissing\n\nthe non-diverse party from the action.               See Newman-Green, Inc. v.\n\nAlfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 837 (1989). In taking this step, an\n\nappellate court “should carefully consider whether the dismissal of\n\na nondiverse party will prejudice any of the parties in the\n\nlitigation.” Id. at 838.\n\n            In the instant case, Gorfinkle added a nondiverse party,\n\nSantarpio, as a defendant in his amended complaint.                    Even though\n\nSantarpio’s presence defeated diversity, the case proceeded to a\n\ndecision on the merits. We conclude that we can preserve diversity\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fjurisdiction by dismissing Santarpio because he is a dispensable\n\nparty and his dismissal will not prejudice any of the remaining\n\nparties.\n\n            First, we can dismiss Santarpio because he is a potential\n\njoint tortfeasor, and thus a dispensable party.            See id. at 838 (in\n\nregards to a party that was “jointly and severally liable, it\n\ncannot be argued that [the party] was indispensable to the suit”);\n\nTemple v. Synthes Corp, Ltd., 498 U.S. 5, 7 (1990); Casas Office\n\nMachs., Inc. v. Mita Copystar Am., Inc., 42 F.3d 668, 677 (1st Cir.\n\n1994); Austin v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 705 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n1983).     Under Massachusetts tort law, parties are jointly and\n\nseverally liable “if [they] negligently contribute to the personal\n\ninjury     of   another   by     their   several     acts,    which    operate\n\nconcurrently, so that in effect the damages suffered are rendered\n\ninseparable.”     O’Connor v. Raymark Indus., 518 N.E.2d 510, 513\n\n(Mass. 1988) (citing to Chase v. Roy, 294 N.E.2d 336 (Mass. 1973)).\n\nHere, Santarpio is a potential joint tortfeasor because Gorfinkle’s\n\ninjuries    stemmed   from     one   fall,   which   he   attributes   to   the\n\nnegligence of both U.S. Airways and Santarpio.2           Thus, Santarpio is\n\nalso a dispensable party that the court can dismiss.\n\n            Second, Santarpio’s dismissal will not prejudice any of\n\n\n     2\n      Gorfinkle’s complaint alleges that U.S. Airways and Santarpio\nnegligently allowed a hazardous condition to exist, Compl. at 2, ¶\n6, negligently failed to warn about the hazardous condition, Compl.\nat 2, ¶ 7, and negligently failed to protect Gorfinkle from the\nhazardous condition, Compl. at 2, ¶ 8.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe remaining parties.    In examining prejudice, the Supreme Court\n\ncautioned that “[i]t may be that the presence of the nondiverse\n\nparty produced a tactical advantage for one party or another.”\n\nNewman-Green, 490 U.S. at 838.          The Court found no tactical\n\nadvantage when “[d]iscovery directed to [the nondiverse defendant]\n\nwhile he was a party would have been available even if he had not\n\nbeen a party.”   Id.; see also Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., 926 F.2d 29,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 1991) (plaintiff could have called the same witness\n\nand introduced the same evidence even in the nondiverse defendant’s\n\nabsence); Casas Office Machs., 42 F.3d at 677 (plaintiff could have\n\nobtained the same business and financial records even if the\n\nnondiverse defendant was absent in the case).         Likewise, in this\n\ncase, even in Santarpio’s absence, Gorfinkle would have been able\n\nto conduct the same discovery – call Santarpio as a witness, take\n\ndepositions, and request documents. Thus, Santarpio’s presence did\n\nnot provide Gorfinkle with any tactical advantage.\n\n          Finally, the only party here who would be prejudiced by\n\nSantarpio’s   dismissal   is   Santarpio   himself.      Santarpio   had\n\nparticipated in the litigation from the beginning, the case had\n\nreached a judgment on the merits, and Santarpio may have to\n\nrelitigate the suit in state court if he is dismissed.       We resolve\n\nthis problem by dismissing Santarpio with prejudice.3       See Newman-\n\n     3\n      We are mindful that in a similar case, Casas Office Machines,\nwe remanded the issue of whether to dismiss with or without\nprejudice to the district court. Casas Office Machines was before\nus on interlocutory appeal and we emphasized that unlike in Newman-\n\n                                  -6-\n\fGreen, 490 U.S. at 837–38 (nondiverse defendant was dismissed with\n\nprejudice because he had participated in the litigation from the\n\nstart, the case had reached a judgment on the merits, and he would\n\nbe faced with the possibility of a new suit if he were dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice).\n\n           Therefore, we are able to preserve diversity jurisdiction\n\nand can review the merits of Gorfinkle’s appeal.\n\n                   III.   OPEN AND OBVIOUS DANGER\n\n           The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nU.S. Airways, finding that U.S. Airways owed no duty to Gorfinkle\n\nbecause walking on top of stacked luggage was an open and obvious\n\ndanger.   Summary judgment is appropriate if “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nThe evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.    Nicolo v. Philip Morris Inc., 201 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           Upon careful review of this case, we hold that the\n\n\n\n\nGreen, the defendants did not have their claims adjudicated by the\ndistrict court and the parties had not had a chance to argue the\nissue. 42 F.3d at 677–78. Here, the parties fully litigated their\nclaims.\n\n     Additionally, a joint tortfeasor defendant dismissed with\nprejudice to preserve diversity jurisdiction may still be liable to\nthe remaining defendant for indemnity or contribution. See Newman-\nGreen, 490 U.S. at 838.     Here, because we affirm the district\ncourt’s judgment in U.S. Airways’ favor, the issue is irrelevant.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdistrict court properly granted summary judgment in favor of U.S.\n\nAirways.     The undisputed material facts show the existence of an\n\nopen and obvious danger that negated U.S. Airway’s duty of care to\n\nGorfinkle.\n\n           “Before liability for negligence can be imposed, there\n\nmust first be a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.”\n\nDavis v. Westwood Group, 652 N.E.2d 567, 569 (Mass. 1995). Whether\n\nor not a duty of care existed is a question of law for the court.\n\nO’Sullivan v. Shaw, 726 N.E.2d 951, 954 (Mass. 2000); Yakubowicz v.\n\nParamount Pictures Corp., 536 N.E.2d 1067, 1070 (Mass. 1989).\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, a property owner does not owe a\n\nduty to a visitor to warn him of, or protect him from, dangers that\n\nare “obvious to persons of average intelligence.”4 O’Sullivan, 726\n\nN.E.2d at 954.     The open and obvious doctrine asks “whether the\n\ndangerous condition was . . . so obvious that the defendant would\n\nbe   reasonable   in   concluding   that   an   ordinarily   intelligent\n\n\n\n     4\n      Gorfinkle relies on Michalski v. Home Depot, Inc., a Second\nCircuit case applying New York law, to argue that even if a danger\nwere open and obvious, defendants would be liable to plaintiffs as\nlong as the plaintiffs’ injuries were foreseeable. 225 F.3d 113,\n119 (2d Cir. 2000). This is not the law in Massachusetts. In\nMassachusetts, an open and obvious danger “operates to negate the\nexistence of a duty of care.” O’Sullivan, 726 N.E.2d at 956.\n\n     Wilson v. Copen, 244 F.3d 178, 181–82 (1st Cir. 2001), also\ndoes not contradict the holding of O’Sullivan. In fact, Wilson\nnoted that an open and obvious danger does relieve a homeowner of\na duty to warn, and that summary judgment can be granted when no\nreasonable jury could conclude otherwise. Id. at 182 n.1.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fplaintiff would perceive it and avoid it.”           Id. at 955 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n            Here, Gorfinkle was injured while he was searching for\n\nhis luggage in a roped-off baggage claim area.            The bags in the\n\narea had been stacked two to three high.            Rather than requesting\n\nassistance or removing them one by one to look for his suitcase,\n\nGorfinkle climbed on top of the stacked luggage and walked on top\n\nof it.    He then fell off the stacked luggage and injured himself.\n\n            Under the law of Massachusetts, the danger of walking\n\nacross stacked luggage is open and obvious.5             See Tetreault v.\n\nDupuis, 222 N.E.2d 876 (Mass. 1967) (no duty owed to plaintiff who\n\nwalked over debris that was swept into a pile); Boike v. Brinker\n\nMass. Corp., 19 Mass. L. Rptr. 40 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2005) (no duty\n\nto warn plaintiff about the dangers of walking on a wet, soapy and\n\ngreasy staircase); Moise v. Holyoke Hosp., Inc., 2002 Mass. App.\n\nDiv. 14 (Mass. Dist. Ct. 2002) (no duty owed to plaintiff who\n\nclimbed over a 3 to 3 1/2 foot snowbank).       Here, it would have been\n\napparent to an ordinarily intelligent plaintiff that he might fall\n\nif   he   attempted   to   walk   over    stacked    luggage.    Gorfinkle\n\n\n\n      5\n      Gorfinkle argues that Costa v. Boston Red Sox Baseball Club,\n809 N.E.2d 1090, 1093 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004), states that the open\nand obvious doctrine only applies to negligent failure to warn.\nCosta does not stand for this proposition but instead, was a case\nin which the alleged negligence was limited to the defendant’s\nfailure to warn. Moreover, as indicated in O’Sullivan, the Supreme\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts does not limit the application of\nthe doctrine to failure to warn cases. 726 N.E.2d at 954.\n\n                                    -9-\n\facknowledges that he was aware he needed to be careful while\n\nwalking on top of the luggage.      Therefore, we conclude, as did the\n\ndistrict court, that walking on top of stacked luggage was an open\n\nand obvious danger.6\n\n           Accordingly, Gorfinkle has failed to establish that U.S.\n\nAirways had a duty to warn or otherwise protect him from the open\n\nand obvious danger.      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the\n\ndistrict   court’s   grant   of   summary   judgment   in   favor   of   U.S.\n\nAirways.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Gorfinkle also argues that the open and obvious doctrine does\nnot absolve U.S. Airway’s negligence for maintaining the luggage\narea in a hazardous condition. Gorfinkle cites Martins v. Healy,\nin which the court held that a deck was unreasonably dangerous\nbecause it had no pool lights illuminating the deck and because\nthere was no railing or fence around the deck to prevent the\nplaintiff from falling off the deck. 15 Mass. L. Rptr. 42 (Mass.\nSuper. Ct. 2002). The current case is different, however, because\nthe condition of the luggage itself, stacked together in an obvious\nmanner in a lighted baggage claim area, is not unreasonably\ndangerous.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

He then lost his balance, fell, and\n\ninjured himself.\n\n            Afterwards, Gorfinkle brought a negligence claim against\n\nU.S. Airways in Suffolk Superior Court.               On May 27, 1999, U.S.\n\nAirways removed the action to federal court based upon diversity of\n\ncitizenship – Gorfinkle is a domiciliary of Massachusetts, while\n\nU.S. Airways is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of\n\nbusiness    in   Virginia.   U.S.    Airways   then      filed   a   third-party\n\ncomplaint against Santarpio, the skycap for the baggage claim area\n\nand   a   Massachusetts   corporation       with   its   principal     place   of\n\nbusiness in Massachusetts.          While this did not defeat diversity,\n\nGorfinkle destroyed diversity when he filed a Second Amended\n\nComplaint adding Santarpio as a direct defendant.1\n\n            The district court did not realize that diversity was\n\ndefeated and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\n\n\n      1\n      The Second Amended Complaint included claims brought by\nGorfinkle’s daughter, Alexandra Rebecca Jean Garston, and wife,\nDeborah A. Garston. Alexandra’s claim was dismissed on August 8,\n2003, and Deborah’s claim was dismissed on January 30, 2004.\nNeither are party to this appeal.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fGorfinkle      appealed     the    grant   of    summary   judgment.    Upon   oral\n\nargument, the court discovered that complete diversity had been\n\ndefeated.      In his supplemental brief, Gorfinkle asks the court to\n\nremand   the    case   to    state    court,     while   appellees   request   the\n\ndismissal of Santarpio to preserve diversity jurisdiction.\n\n                          II.     DIVERSITY JURISDICTION\n\n            In order to maintain an action in federal court based\n\nupon diversity jurisdiction, the plaintiff must be diverse from the\n\ndefendant in the case.

The addition of a non-\n\ndiverse defendant in an amended complaint defeats diversity.                   See\n\nid. at 141–42.\n\n            If the nondiverse party is dispensable, however, an\n\nappellate court can preserve diversity jurisdiction by dismissing\n\nthe non-diverse party from the action.

In taking this step, an\n\nappellate court “should carefully consider whether the dismissal of\n\na nondiverse party will prejudice any of the parties in the\n\nlitigation.” Id. at 838.\n\n            In the instant case, Gorfinkle added a nondiverse party,\n\nSantarpio, as a defendant in his amended complaint.                    Even though\n\nSantarpio’s presence defeated diversity, the case proceeded to a\n\ndecision on the merits. We conclude that we can preserve diversity\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fjurisdiction by dismissing Santarpio because he is a dispensable\n\nparty and his dismissal will not prejudice any of the remaining\n\nparties.\n\n            First, we can dismiss Santarpio because he is a potential\n\njoint tortfeasor, and thus a dispensable party.

The Court found no tactical\n\nadvantage when “[d]iscovery directed to [the nondiverse defendant]\n\nwhile he was a party would have been available even if he had not\n\nbeen a party.”   Id.; see also Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556388\"><a href=\"/opinion/556388/dolores-sweeney-v-westvaco-company-dolores-sweeney-v-westvaco-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 1991) (plaintiff could have called the same witness\n\nand introduced the same evidence even in the nondiverse defendant’s\n\nabsence); Casas Office Machs., 42 F.3d at 677 (plaintiff could have\n\nobtained the same business and financial records even if the\n\nnondiverse defendant was absent in the case).         Likewise, in this\n\ncase, even in Santarpio’s absence, Gorfinkle would have been able\n\nto conduct the same discovery – call Santarpio as a witness, take\n\ndepositions, and request documents. Thus, Santarpio’s presence did\n\nnot provide Gorfinkle with any tactical advantage.\n\n          Finally, the only party here who would be prejudiced by\n\nSantarpio’s   dismissal   is   Santarpio   himself.      Santarpio   had\n\nparticipated in the litigation from the beginning, the case had\n\nreached a judgment on the merits, and Santarpio may have to\n\nrelitigate the suit in state court if he is dismissed.       We resolve\n\nthis problem by dismissing Santarpio with prejudice.3       See Newman-\n\n     3\n      We are mindful that in a similar case, Casas Office Machines,\nwe remanded the issue of whether to dismiss with or without\nprejudice to the district court.

OPEN AND OBVIOUS DANGER\n\n           The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nU.S. Airways, finding that U.S. Airways owed no duty to Gorfinkle\n\nbecause walking on top of stacked luggage was an open and obvious\n\ndanger.   Summary judgment is appropriate if “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nThe evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.    Nicolo v.

Here, the parties fully litigated their\nclaims.\n\n     Additionally, a joint tortfeasor defendant dismissed with\nprejudice to preserve diversity jurisdiction may still be liable to\nthe remaining defendant for indemnity or contribution. See Newman-\nGreen, 490 U.S. at 838.     Here, because we affirm the district\ncourt’s judgment in U.S. Airways’ favor, the issue is irrelevant.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdistrict court properly granted summary judgment in favor of U.S.\n\nAirways.

Whether\n\nor not a duty of care existed is a question of law for the court.\n\nO’Sullivan v.

The open and obvious doctrine asks “whether the\n\ndangerous condition was . . . so obvious that the defendant would\n\nbe   reasonable   in   concluding   that   an   ordinarily   intelligent\n\n\n\n     4\n      Gorfinkle relies on Michalski v. Home Depot, Inc., a Second\nCircuit case applying New York law, to argue that even if a danger\nwere open and obvious, defendants would be liable to plaintiffs as\nlong as the plaintiffs’ injuries were foreseeable. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770243\"><a href=\"/opinion/770243/jacqueline-e-michalski-v-the-home-depot-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n119 (2d Cir. 2000). This is not the law in Massachusetts. In\nMassachusetts, an open and obvious danger “operates to negate the\nexistence of a duty of care.” O’Sullivan, 726 N.E.2d at 956.\n\n     Wilson v. Copen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199342\"><a href=\"/opinion/199342/wilson-v-copen/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181–82 (1st Cir. 2001), also\ndoes not contradict the holding of O’Sullivan. In fact, Wilson\nnoted that an open and obvious danger does relieve a homeowner of\na duty to warn, and that summary judgment can be granted when no\nreasonable jury could conclude otherwise. Id. at 182 n.1.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fplaintiff would perceive it and avoid it.”           Id. at 955 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n            Here, Gorfinkle was injured while he was searching for\n\nhis luggage in a roped-off baggage claim area.            The bags in the\n\narea had been stacked two to three high.            Rather than requesting\n\nassistance or removing them one by one to look for his suitcase,\n\nGorfinkle climbed on top of the stacked luggage and walked on top\n\nof it.    He then fell off the stacked luggage and injured himself.\n\n            Under the law of Massachusetts, the danger of walking\n\nacross stacked luggage is open and obvious.5             See Tetreault v.\n\nDupuis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 1967) (no duty owed to plaintiff who\n\nwalked over debris that was swept into a pile); Boike v. Brinker\n\nMass. Corp., 19 Mass. L. Rptr. 40 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2005) (no duty\n\nto warn plaintiff about the dangers of walking on a wet, soapy and\n\ngreasy staircase); Moise v. Holyoke Hosp., Inc., 2002 Mass. App.\n\nDiv. 14 (Mass. Dist. Ct. 2002) (no duty owed to plaintiff who\n\nclimbed over a 3 to 3 1/2 foot snowbank).       Here, it would have been\n\napparent to an ordinarily intelligent plaintiff that he might fall\n\nif   he   attempted   to   walk   over    stacked    luggage.    Gorfinkle\n\n\n\n      5\n      Gorfinkle argues that Costa v. Boston Red Sox Baseball Club,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1093 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004), states that the open\nand obvious doctrine only applies to negligent failure to warn.\nCosta does not stand for this proposition but instead, was a case\nin which the alleged negligence was limited to the defendant’s\nfailure to warn. Moreover, as indicated in O’Sullivan, the Supreme\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts does not limit the application of\nthe doctrine to failure to warn cases. 726 N.E.2d at 954.\n\n                                    -9-\n\facknowledges that he was aware he needed to be careful while\n\nwalking on top of the luggage.      Therefore, we conclude, as did the\n\ndistrict court, that walking on top of stacked luggage was an open\n\nand obvious danger.6\n\n           Accordingly, Gorfinkle has failed to establish that U.S.\n\nAirways had a duty to warn or otherwise protect him from the open\n\nand obvious danger.      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the\n\ndistrict   court’s   grant   of   summary   judgment   in   favor   of   U.S.\n\nAirways.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Gorfinkle also argues that the open and obvious doctrine does\nnot absolve U.S. Airway’s negligence for maintaining the luggage\narea in a hazardous condition. Gorfinkle cites Martins v. Healy,\nin which the court held that a deck was unreasonably dangerous\nbecause it had no pool lights illuminating the deck and because\nthere was no railing or fence around the deck to prevent the\nplaintiff from falling off the deck. 15 Mass. L. Rptr. 42 (Mass.\nSuper. Ct. 2002). The current case is different, however, because\nthe condition of the luggage itself, stacked together in an obvious\nmanner in a lighted baggage claim area, is not unreasonably\ndangerous.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f</pre>",
