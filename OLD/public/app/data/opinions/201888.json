Thomas Kerner, by appointment of the court, on supplemental\nbrief for appellant.\n     Virginia M. Vander Jagt, Assistant United States Attorney,\nAppeals Unit, and Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on\nsupplemental brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 28, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.        Germain Florentino pleaded guilty to drug\n\nand immigration violations, and was found by the district court to\n\nbe a career offender, triggering a guideline sentencing range of\n\n151 to 181 months.         At sentencing, he argued that one of the prior\n\nconvictions which provided the basis for his career offender status\n\nwas improperly relied upon because it was the product of an unusual\n\ntwo-tier     trial    system     that     has     since    been   abolished      in\n\nMassachusetts;       the     district     court    disagreed      and    sentenced\n\nFlorentino    to     151    months,     the    minimum    permitted     under   the\n\nguidelines, also rejecting a requested downward departure.\n\n           We affirmed the sentence in United States v. Florentino,\n\n385 F.3d 60 (1st Cir. 2004), finding that Florentino's conviction\n\nunder the two-tier system, where he was convicted in the first tier\n\nand lodged an \"appeal\" to the second tier which he later abandoned,\n\nwas properly counted as a prior conviction for the purposes of\n\nU.S.S.G. ยง 4B1.1.          Florentino petitioned the Supreme Court for\n\ncertiorari, which vacated our judgment and remanded in light of its\n\nintervening decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).    We invited supplemental briefing on the question whether\n\nto remand to the district court for re-sentencing in light of\n\nBooker.\n\n           Florentino's Booker claim is not preserved, despite his\n\nclaims to the contrary, and we review for plain error.                      United\n\nStates v. Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).                        A\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fBooker error is preserved if the defendant argued to the district\n\ncourt    that   the   guidelines     were    unconstitutional     or    that    his\n\nsentence violated Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), or\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).               Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 76.     Florentino made no such argument at his sentencing; he\n\ndid argue that it was not proper to use his prior conviction under\n\nthe two-tier system to classify him as a career offender, but his\n\ngrounds had nothing to do with the Sixth Amendment, Apprendi or\n\nBlakely.1\n\n            Under     the   plain   error    test   for   a   remand,   the    main\n\nquestion is the likelihood that on remand a lower sentence might be\n\nimposed, United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); the burden of showing such a likelihood lies with the\n\ndefendant.      Id.   Florentino presents several bases that he claims\n\ndemonstrate the likelihood of a lower sentence on remand, meeting\n\nthe third criterion for plain error.            None is persuasive.\n\n            Florentino      first    argues    that   his     brother   (also    a\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy to which Florentino pleaded guilty)\n\nwas found to be responsible for a far greater amount of drugs but\n\n\n\n     1\n      Florentino spends much of this portion of the brief arguing\nthat his contested conviction is not typical and thus should not\nfall into the exception for \"prior convictions\" carved out of the\nApprendi line of cases. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523\nU.S. 224 (1998). Our prior decision, finding that Florentino's\nconviction from the two-tier system counted for the purposes of\nfederal sentencing, resolved the issue as to whether to count the\nconviction. Florentino, 385 F.3d at 63-65.\n\n                                       -3-\n\freceived a lower sentence.         This argument was made to and rejected\n\nby the district judge.        The disparity between these sentences is\n\neasily attributable to the fact that Florentino was a career\n\noffender and his brother was a first-time offender.                  Nor do we see\n\nhow   it    helps   Florentino     that    the    government,       in   opposing    a\n\ndeparture     for   him,   urged    in    the    alternative    that       he   should\n\ncertainly not get a sentence lower than his brother.\n\n             Florentino     also      says       that   the     district        judge\n\nmisapprehended      his    argument      about    the   use    of    the    disputed\n\nconviction and thought he was arguing that the conviction should\n\nnot be used at all.        Florentino claims to have been arguing that\n\nthe conviction should have been used only as an upward adjustment\n\nto    his   criminal   history     level.        Even   if    his    position     was\n\nmisunderstood, which is far from clear, nothing indicates that\n\nregarding the point to the district judge would likely lead to a\n\nlower sentence.\n\n             Florentino next argues that the district judge sentenced\n\nhim at the lowest end of the applicable guidelines range, and that\n\nat sentencing the judge stated, in choosing the lowest end of the\n\nguidelines range, that Florentino's career offender status had\n\nresulted in \"a long sentence.\"            A lowered sentence helps but does\n\nnot alone warrant a remand.           United States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d\n\n89, 99-100 (1st Cir. 2005).              Florentino also omits the district\n\njudge's statement that \"the defendant's criminal history scoring in\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthis   case    does   not   overstate   the   severity   of   his   criminal\n\nbehavior.\"\n\n              Florentino says that his brother received a departure\n\nbecause as a deportable alien he was held in harsher conditions\n\nthan usual.     But this is not a consideration that was forbidden or\n\ndiscouraged by the guidelines. Compare Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.\n\nIf the circumstance is true as to Florentino, it could have been\n\nargued at the original sentencing.        Even now Florentino makes only\n\nthe bare assertion that he was held in such conditions as a\n\ndeportable alien, offering no detail.         This claim does not furnish\n\nthe \"specific facts\" needed to justify a remand.              Kornegay, 410\n\nF.3d at 100.\n\n              The sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",

Even if his position was misunderstood, which is far from clear, nothing indicates that regarding the point to the district judge would likely lead to a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Florentino next argues that the district judge sentenced him at the lowest end of the applicable guidelines range, and that at sentencing the judge stated, in choosing the lowest end of the guidelines range, that Florentino's career offender status had resulted in \"a long sentence.\" A lowered sentence helps but does not alone warrant a remand. <i>United States v. Kornegay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201633\"><a href=\"/opinion/201633/united-states-v-kornegay/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 99-100 (1st Cir.2005). Florentino also omits the district judge's statement that \"the defendant's criminal history scoring in this case does not overstate the severity of his criminal behavior.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Florentino says that his brother received a departure because as a deportable alien he was held in harsher conditions than usual. But this is not a consideration that was forbidden or discouraged by the guidelines. <i>Compare Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 224. If the circumstance is true as to Florentino, it could have been argued at the original sentencing. Even now Florentino makes only the bare assertion that he was held in such conditions as a deportable alien, offering no detail. This claim does not furnish the \"specific facts\" needed to justify a remand. <i>Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d at 100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Florentino spends much of this portion of the brief arguing that his contested conviction is not typical and thus should not fall into the exception for \"prior convictions\" carved out of the<i>Apprendi</i> line of cases. <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (1998). Our prior decision, finding that Florentino's conviction from the two-tier system counted for the purposes of federal sentencing, resolved the issue as to whether to count the conviction. <i>Florentino,</i> 385 F.3d at 63-65.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
