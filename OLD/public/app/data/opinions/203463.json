George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Guy D. Loranger with whom Nichols, Webb & Loranger, PA were on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Robert W. Kline for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 28, 2008\n\f             LYNCH, Chief Judge. Bonnie Chaloult sued her former\n\nemployer, Interstate Brands Corporation (\"IBC\"), alleging she had\n\nsuffered sexual harassment by her supervisor, Kevin Francoeur, in\n\nthe six months before she quit her job.           The district court entered\n\nsummary judgment for the employer.\n\n             The issue on appeal turns on the affirmative defense\n\navailable to employers when the harassment is by the plaintiff's\n\nsupervisor.\n\n             Under Title VII, an employer is subject to vicarious\n\nliability for sexual harassment by an employee's supervisor which\n\ndoes not constitute a tangible employment action. But the employer\n\nmay prevail if it demonstrates a two-part affirmative defense:\n\nthat   its   own   actions   to   prevent   and    correct   harassment   were\n\nreasonable and that the employee's actions in seeking to avoid harm\n\nwere not reasonable.     See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S.\n\n775, 807 (1998); Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742,\n\n765 (1998).     This case turns on the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative\n\ndefense.\n\n             The question here concerns the employer's affirmative\n\ndefense that it is not vicariously liable because on summary\n\njudgment it has established that (i) the employee's own actions\n\nwere not reasonable (here plaintiff did not herself complain to\n\nmanagement); (ii) the employer had reasonably set up and educated\n\nemployees on appropriate procedures for handling sexual harassment\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fallegations; (iii) the employer did reasonably investigate the\n\noriginal allegation plaintiff made to management at the time of her\n\nresignation; (iv) no one at a managerial level equal to or superior\n\nto   the   harasser   had   notice   of    the   different   allegations   of\n\nharassment made in the lawsuit; and (v) the co-worker who had some\n\nnotice of some of the different allegations did not consider the\n\nconduct he knew of to be harassment and did not call it to the\n\nattention of management.\n\n            The plaintiff-employee argued that as a matter of law the\n\nknowledge of a co-worker with the title of supervisor, who was in\n\nfact a peer of the plaintiff's and who also reported to the\n\nharasser, was attributed to the employer under the company's policy\n\nand that defeats the Faragher-Ellerth defense.          The district court\n\nrejected the plaintiff's argument.\n\n            Conducting our independent review of the record, we find\n\nthe employer made out its Faragher-Ellerth defense to vicarious\n\nliability.     We affirm the entry of summary judgment for the\n\nemployer.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We describe the facts, drawing all inferences in the\n\nplaintiff's favor, as we must do in summary judgment.             Mellen v.\n\nTrs. of Boston Univ., 504 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Bonnie Chaloult began working at IBC's Biddeford, Maine\n\nproduction plant in June 1999.        In July 2004, when an entry-level\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fbread supervisor position opened up, Chaloult applied for and\n\nreceived it, and she began working as a bread supervisor in\n\nSeptember 2004.    When she first started working as a supervisor,\n\nshe was in production, then she was moved to wrapping, and then\n\nback to production.      When she was moved back to production in\n\nFebruary 2005, her immediate supervisor became Kevin Francoeur, who\n\nwas the assistant production manager.       At that time, Chaloult's\n\nshift was the night shift, from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.\n\n            On June 8, 2005, Chaloult and other supervisors attended\n\na   \"WARN   meeting,\"   under   the    Worker   Adjustment   Rehearing\n\nNotification Act, at which they were put on notice that their\n\npositions could potentially be eliminated in sixty days.      This was\n\noccasioned by the company's going into bankruptcy.           Chaloult\n\nunderstood that this could mean she was out of a job as of August\n\n12, 2005.    Chaloult conceded at deposition that her attendance at\n\nwork \"deteriorated\" after this meeting, and other evidence supports\n\nthis.\n\n            At no time prior to her resignation did Chaloult complain\n\nabout sexual harassment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          After an incident with a co-worker,1 on August 4, 2005,\n\nChaloult submitted a letter of resignation.   Chaloult was pregnant\n\nwhen she left IBC in August 2005, and was not re-employed until\n\nJune 30, 2006.   The letter of resignation stated, verbatim:\n\n                 I respectfully request to give forth my\n          two week notice, in accordance with the\n          companies involuntary leave slip, my last date\n          of work will be 8/19/05.\n\n                 I would like to take the time to thank\n          you, (Paul) and IBC for the experience I now\n          have under management.\n\n                 However,   when   I  filled   out   my\n          application for employment with IBC, it never\n          stated that at any time would my supervisors\n          above me, have the right to question my\n          personal affairs and demand information.\n\n                 This I learned from yet another\n          supervisor being accused of fore-play.\n\n                 Is this company Policy?  I tried to\n          change shifts, told I had day hours for 6-\n          strap production then I was denied.   I no\n\n\n     1\n          The record shows that Chaloult was having a dispute with\nan oven operator named Dobre in late July 2005. Sue Bisson wrote\na \"To whom it may concern\" letter, dated August 3, noting two\nincidents: on July 28, Chaloult told Dobre not to call a mechanic\nregarding a problem with the oven because he was causing the\nproblem, but it turned out that a mechanic was needed and the\nmistake was not Dobre's. On July 29, Chaloult told Bisson that\nDobre was making another mistake involving machinery, which Bisson\ninformed Chaloult was not Dobre's fault, at which point Chaloult\n\"proceeded to walk out of the office and leave.\" On July 30 or 31,\nChaloult wrote a report stating that Dobre had shoved equipment and\nmade a loud noise as she walked by.\n          The parties have not argued that the tension between\nChaloult and Dobre (and apparently Bisson) is related to her\nproblems with Francoeur, but it does suggest that she was unhappy\nat work for reasons unrelated to Francoeur in the days before she\nwrote her letter of resignation on August 4.\n\n                                -5-\n\f              longer feel      comfortable     working    for    this\n              supervisor.\n\nThe letter did not directly accuse her supervisor of harassing her,\n\nbut of questioning her personal affairs with another supervisor, a\n\nsituation she learned about from the supervisor who, she said, was\n\naccused of having a sexual relationship with her.                The letter did\n\nstate   she     no   longer    felt   comfortable      working    for    her   own\n\nsupervisor.\n\n              Chaloult   put    her   letter    into    the    mailbox    of   her\n\ndepartment manager, Paul Santos. Santos met with her the first day\n\nhe was back at work after receiving the letter.                  Before meeting\n\nwith Chaloult, Santos discussed her letter with Joseph Cabral,\n\nAssistant Human Resources Manager, and gave a copy of the letter to\n\nHuman Resources so they could put it on file.                 Cabral and Santos\n\ndecided that Santos should ask her what the letter meant, since\n\nthey did not know to what she was referring.\n\n              At the meeting, Chaloult said she was referring to an\n\nincident that had taken place on July 15, in which Francoeur had\n\napproached a co-worker, Jim Anderson, and demanded to know whether\n\nAnderson and Chaloult were having sexual relations.               Chaloult, who\n\nhad a fianc√© at the time, had not been present during this\n\nconversation and said that Anderson had told her about it the\n\nfollowing morning.\n\n              When asked why she did not come forward sooner, she told\n\nSantos that she was worried about issues \"coming back at me.\"                  She\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdid not say to Santos that there had been any other incidents of\n\nconcern involving Francoeur.      At deposition she admitted there was\n\nnothing that prevented her from reporting other instances to the\n\ncompany.\n\n           Santos   told   her   that   he   would   follow   up   with   both\n\nAnderson and Francoeur and report the incident to Human Resources.\n\nSantos did what he promised.       Immediately after his meeting with\n\nChaloult, Santos called Cabral and briefed him. Santos then called\n\nFrancoeur into his office; they met for about half an hour.                He\n\ntold Francoeur what Chaloult had said. Francoeur said that was not\n\nwhat happened. Francoeur explained his version of what happened to\n\nSantos as follows:\n\n           [H]e explained to me that he had been calling\n           for both [Anderson and Chaloult], he had tried\n           calling for her, tried calling for him on the\n           radio, neither one of them were responding on\n           the radio. He was walking from the six strap\n           makeup area going towards the wrap office. He\n           had passed Bonnie in transit or she was going\n           -- he noticed her going one way towards\n           makeup, and he was going towards wrapping. He\n           walked into the wrap office and said, Jim,\n           what, are you and Bonnie fucking with me,\n           screwing with me?     And he said that Jim\n           started laughing. He was like, no, we didn't\n           hear the calls on the radio.       And that's\n           pretty much it.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fSantos made Francoeur write down his version of events.                The\n\ndocument   was   submitted   into   evidence   and   is   consistent   with\n\nSantos's description of the meeting.2\n\n           Santos then met with Anderson.       Anderson told Santos:\n\n           [Francoeur] just came in and was like, what,\n           are you and Bonnie trying to fuck me? I was\n           like, okay. I go, what else was said? He was\n           like, nothing. We just laughed and he wanted\n           some numbers, and I went out on the floor and\n           that was it. He says he was trying to call\n           us. I didn't hear him. Maybe our radios were\n           down, and that was it.\n\n           During the interview Santos also asked Anderson what he\n\nsaid to Chaloult.    Santos described his conversation with Anderson\n\nas follows:\n\n           [I asked] what did Kevin say to you? What do\n           you recall Kevin saying to you? He said, he\n           just came in and he was like, what, are you\n           and Bonnie trying to fuck me?    I was like,\n           okay. I go, what else was said? He was like,\n           nothing. We just laughed and he wanted some\n           numbers, and I went out on the floor and that\n           was it. He says he was trying to call us. I\n           didn't hear him. Maybe our radios were down,\n           and that was it. I go, so he didn't come in\n           and ask if you guys were fucking? He said,\n           no. No, he just came in and he wanted to know\n           if we were fucking with him.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           I said, Bonnie is saying that you went to her\n           and told her that Kevin asked you if you and\n           her were having sex. He was like, oh, I don't\n           remember what I told her.    I go, well, you\n\n\n     2\n          At his deposition, Francoeur confirmed Santos's account\nof their meeting and of his statement to Anderson. There is no\nevidence to the contrary.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f            just told me that he came in and asked if you\n            two guys were fucking with him and then you\n            turn around and went to Bonnie and told Bonnie\n            that Kevin asked if you and her were fucking.\n            I go, so which one is it? He was like, no, he\n            just came in and he said if we were fucking\n            him. I was like, so then why did you go to\n            Bonnie and tell her something different? And\n            he made a comment about, oh, Bonnie and I were\n            just laughing about it, we were joking about\n            it, and that was it. I was like, well, it's\n            not a joking matter because this is where\n            we're at right now.\n\n            When he received Francoeur's statement, Santos discussed\n\nthe matter with Cabral.     They concluded that what Francoeur had\n\nsaid to Anderson was \"are you guys fucking with me?\"      As a result,\n\nFrancoeur was given a letter, dated September 1, 2005, warning\n\nabout the use of inappropriate language (\"fuck\") and language which\n\ncould be taken out of context in the workplace.      The letter stated:\n\n\"While our investigation to date shows that the broad allegations\n\nmade by the employee may not be 100% confirmed, it is clear that,\n\nbased on your admission, that your comment was inappropriate and\n\nunwarranted.\"     It also made clear that \"[a] manager must never\n\ndiscriminate, harass, or retaliate against any employee.             If a\n\nManager     knowingly   condones   discrimination,     harassment,     or\n\nretaliation by another, the Manager will be considered to have\n\npersonally engaged in the conduct.\"\n\n            After Chaloult gave her two week's notice on August 4,\n\nshe worked only a few more days and did not show up to work after\n\nAugust 8.   As a result, IBC did not have the opportunity to conduct\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fits usual exit interview.      On November 11, Chaloult met, at his\n\nrequest, with Joseph Cabral; no specific information is provided\n\nabout this meeting, and there is no evidence that Chaloult told\n\nCabral the allegations she later made. Chaloult also filed an exit\n\ncomment form, dated November 11, 2005, in which she made the\n\ncomment: \"Sexual harassment from upper management for an ongoing\n\nperiod with other people . . . involved.\"        Santos stated that he\n\ndid not see this exit comment form.       He said he first became aware\n\nof Chaloult's other allegations after she filed suit.\n\n          On October 10, 2006, more than a year after she left her\n\nemployment, Chaloult filed suit in federal district court against\n\nIBC, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000(e), and the Maine Human Rights Act.          She\n\nsought general, non-economic, and punitive damages.            Chaloult\n\nalleged that she was sexually harassed by her superior, Francoeur,\n\nfrom February 5, 2005, when she first reported to Francoeur, to\n\nAugust 2005, when she left the company.         For the first time she\n\nrelated   a   number   of   very   specific   complaints   about   other\n\nstatements.\n\n          Chaloult's testimony at deposition included the following\n\nspecific allegations, which she had not mentioned to Santos or in\n\nher November 11, 2005 exit comment form.3      One claim of harassment\n\n\n     3\n          For summary judgment purposes, we use her testimony at\ndeposition.   Her testimony is materially different from some\nallegations in her unverified complaint.   For example, Chaloult\n\n                                   -10-\n\fis that Francoeur frequently complained about his wife and his lack\n\nof   sexual    relations   with   her.     At   deposition,   Chaloult   said\n\nFrancoeur made these comments openly to supervisors and also said\n\nhe wished he could murder his wife.             Chaloult did not report the\n\ncomments to anyone.\n\n              Further, there were comments about breasts.         On several\n\noccasions when they were outside on break during the winter,\n\nFrancoeur asked Chaloult about the distance between her nipples and\n\ntold her to go home and measure this distance.                He also at one\n\npoint asked if her nipples chafed or stood out like headlights.\n\nShe walked away and shook her head but did not report the comments\n\nto anyone. At some point Chaloult walked into an office where\n\nFrancoeur was in conversation with another worker named Steve\n\nLeclair and, without using her name but looking right at her,\n\nFrancoeur indicated that Chaloult's breasts were \"melons.                Big\n\nhooters.\"      Chaloult did not report this incident and stated that\n\nnothing prevented her from doing so.\n\n              Once, when they were alone in his office Francoeur asked\n\nChaloult to hold her breath and push her chest out.              She did not\n\nunderstand why he made the comment.         She shook her head and walked\n\noff, saying nothing to Francoeur and not reporting the incident.\n\n\ntestified that Francoeur never asked to see her nipples although\nthat was alleged in the complaint. Chaloult's complaint stated\nthat Francoeur would tell her that \"she looked like she needed to\nget laid,\" but at deposition she said that it was a female co-\nworker who made that comment.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fShe said she did not report it because she did not \"want any\n\nretaliation coming back.\"\n\n            She said statements about her relationship with her\n\nboyfriend    were       harassing.     Chaloult      had   broken       up    with       her\n\nboyfriend in January of 2005.             She got back together with him in\n\nApril and they became engaged in May 2005. Francoeur made comments\n\nto her to the effect she should not get back together with her\n\nboyfriend.       The more serious allegation is that toward the end of\n\nspring, Francoeur offered to come over to her house and have sex\n\nwith her; specifically that \"he'd come to my house and show me what\n\nfucking    was    about.\"       Chaloult    said    that     Anderson        and    a    few\n\nmaintenance people were in the area at the time Francoeur made this\n\ncomment.    Chaloult walked away, spurning the offer.                   Chaloult did\n\nnot report the incident.\n\n            Another time, Chaloult joined Francoeur and Anderson on\n\na patio for a smoke.            Chaloult and Anderson were discussing a\n\nmotorcycle       trip    that   Chaloult     had   made    with    her       boyfriend.\n\nFrancoeur made the statement, \"well, girls who ride motorcycles\n\nnormally like it from the back side, huh?             Is that true, Bonnie[?]\"\n\nChaloult turned and walked off, and shook her head.                      She did not\n\nreport    Francoeur       for   that   statement;     nothing      kept       her       from\n\nreporting it.\n\n            In another instance, Chaloult, another supervisor named\n\nDan   Lariviere,        and   Francoeur    were    sitting    in   an    office         and\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fLariviere was eating an eclair.     Francoeur said he wanted to see\n\nhow far Chaloult could stick the eclair down her throat. Lariviere\n\nsaid he would also like to see that.      Then Francoeur said \"[i]f\n\nthere isn't enough cream in there, . . . I have plenty.\"    Chaloult\n\nsaid nothing to either of them or to anyone in management above\n\nFrancoeur about this.4     She \"may have\" told Anderson about the\n\nincident.\n\n            At some time in May, Chaloult had picked up a piece of\n\ndough off the machinery, and Francoeur made a comment to her that\n\n\"if the dough ball wasn't enough for me to play with, he had some\n\nballs that I could play with.\"    Chaloult stated that a production\n\nemployee named Amy Ramsell was present when Francoeur made this\n\ncomment, but she is not sure whether Ramsell heard it.      Chaloult\n\nwalked off and did not report the incident; she stated that nothing\n\nprevented her from reporting it.\n\n            In another instance, Chaloult was apparently in a bit of\n\na frenzy in the presence of other workers over having misplaced her\n\nkey card to get into the building.       A female employee in the\n\noffice, Sue Bisson, said \"it looks like somebody needs to get laid.\n\nKevin [Francoeur] turns around and goes yeah, I guess so.    Because\n\n\n\n     4\n          Francoeur also denied making the statements plaintiff\nattributes to him as evidence of harassment, including the offer to\ngo home with her, but we take plaintiff's version as true for\nsummary judgment purposes. As to the eclair statement, Francoeur\nsaid it was made by another supervisor, Dan Lariviere, and that\nafterwards he told Lariviere that the statement was inappropriate.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fI was apparently a little too hyper.\"          Chaloult did not complain to\n\neither of them or report them and nothing prevented her from doing\n\nso.\n\n            Finally,   on    July   15,   as   discussed   above,   Francoeur\n\nallegedly walked into an office where Anderson was doing some\n\npaperwork and yelled at him, \"so how long have you and Bonnie been\n\nfucking?\"\n\n            There   were    no   objectionable    statements   by   Francoeur\n\nbetween July 15 and Chaloult's letter of resignation on August 4.5\n\n            IBC had in place anti-sexual-harassment policies which\n\nincluded methods for reporting harassment.             The company's Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Policy stated:\n\n            Interstate    strictly    prohibits    sexual\n            harassment. . . . Examples of the prohibited\n            conduct include unwelcome sexual advances,\n            requests for sexual favors, and gender slurs\n            or other offensive, derogatory, or demeaning\n            comments, jokes, graffiti, or other verbal or\n            physical   conduct  and   written   or  taped\n            materials relating to gender.\n\n            . . . .\n\n\n      5\n          Chaloult decided to keep a contemporaneous diary of\nFrancoeur's comments.    In that diary, she made no mention of\nFrancoeur's comments about coming over to her house to have sex; no\nmention of the alleged incident involving dough balls; no mention\nof Francoeur's gestures about melons, which she took to be about\nher breasts; nothing about Sue Bisson's comments; and nothing about\nFrancoeur's comment about girls who ride motorcycles.\n          The diary did include references to Francoeur's\ncomplaining about his wife, but nothing about comments regarding\nhis sexual relations with his wife. The diary also did refer to\nFrancoeur's comments about the distance between Chaloult's nipples,\nchafed nipples, and the eclair incident.\n\n                                     -14-\n\f          Any person who believes that the person has\n          been   subjected        to discrimination,\n          harassment, or retaliation or who knows of\n          possible    discrimination,    harassment,   or\n          retaliation    against   anyone   else   should\n          immediately report it to supervision or to\n          Richard W. Morgano, [phone number redacted] or\n          to Rhonda Tracy, [phone number redacted]. Do\n          not wait until a situation is severe or\n          pervasive; report any possible discrimination\n          or harassment or retaliation as soon as you\n          know of it.\n\nChaloult signed an updated version of this policy on September 16,\n\n2003, indicating that \"I . . . have read and understand IBC's Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Policy and have participated in 'In this\n\nTogether' Harassment Training.\"\n\n          Chaloult had also signed, when she first began working\n\nfor the company on June 10, 1999, the company's Sexual Harassment\n\nPolicy, which included the following provisions:\n\n          II. Awareness\n                 A. Supervisors must be sensitive to the\n                 problem of sexual harassment.\n                 B. Employees shall be encouraged to\n                 report an incident of sexual harassment\n                 to their supervisor.\n                 C. If a supervisor becomes aware of any\n                 violation or possible violation of the\n                 EEOC guidelines, the incident should be\n                 reported immediately to the human\n                 resources manager or plant general\n                 manager.\n                 D. Supervisors have an affirmative duty\n                 to keep their work area free from\n                 sexual harassment of any kind and shall\n                 take appropriate steps to prevent and\n                 eliminate such harassment.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fChaloult was also aware that IBC had a confidential toll-free\n\ncomplaint line for employees.\n\n             Chaloult admittedly did not at any time before submitting\n\nher letter of resignation make any complaint about Francoeur to the\n\nHuman Resources manager, the plant manager, or to any other person\n\nwho was superior or equal to Francoeur's level at the company.\n\n             When asked at deposition why she did not come forward\n\nsooner with her complaints, Chaloult responded, \"I had talked with\n\nJim Anderson, and Jim Anderson knew about these comments.\"              When\n\nasked whether she had asked Anderson to report her concerns to\n\nmanagement, Chaloult stated that she had not.              She asserted that\n\nAnderson was present at the time of Francoeur's comment about\n\nmeasuring the distance between nipples, when Francoeur made the\n\ncomment about girls who ride motorcycles, and when Francoeur told\n\nChaloult that he wanted to come over to her house and have sex with\n\nher, and that he told her about Francoeur's comment suggesting that\n\nChaloult and Anderson were having a sexual relationship on July 15.\n\n             Chaloult and Anderson were peers; they, along with one\n\nother person, were entry-level supervisors on the overnight shift\n\nin   the   bread   department;   Francoeur,     as   the    assistant   bread\n\nproduction manager in charge of the overnight shift, was their\n\ndirect     supervisor.   There   were    also   three   other    entry-level\n\nsupervisors in the bread department who worked during a second\n\nshift.\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f            At   deposition,   Anderson    confirmed   that   it   is   his\n\nunderstanding that if supervisors receive a complaint of sexual\n\nharassment, they are supposed to report it right away.             However,\n\nwhen asked whether he was ever aware of behavior which could have\n\nviolated the company's sexual harassment policy, he said that he\n\nwas not.    When asked whether anyone had ever complained to him\n\nabout conduct that could have been construed as sexual harassment,\n\nAnderson said no.\n\n            Anderson further testified that he was never present when\n\nanyone objected to something that Francoeur said, nor did he ever\n\nget the impression that something Francoeur said upset someone.\n\nAnderson testified that the group of supervisors of whom he and\n\nChaloult were part got along \"pretty good.       I mean, we were loosey\n\ngoosey.    We joked around with each other.\"\n\n            As to Chaloult's specific allegations of harassment,\n\nAnderson said that one day Francoeur said to other workers during\n\na smoke break that he had heard people on a radio program referring\n\nto the distance between nipples as \"spread points,\" and \"we all got\n\na laugh out of it.\"    Anderson said that Francoeur asked a group of\n\npeople, not just Chaloult, to measure their \"spread points.\"            More\n\nspecifically, \"[h]e made a general statement for all of us to go\n\nhome and do it. . . . I didn't think nothing of it at the time.            I\n\ndidn't think there was nothing wrong because we all just laughed\n\nabout it and we left the office.\"         When asked whether he thought\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fthat Francoeur violated the company's sexual harassment policy when\n\nhe made comments about \"spread points\" to a group of people that\n\nincluded women, Anderson stated, \"I didn't read nothing into it\n\nbecause we all had a chuckle about it.    So, I mean, I don't think\n\nany of us read anything into it because we all laughed and went\n\non . . . .\"   Chaloult has not called this testimony into question.\n\n          Anderson had a different recollection of the incident\n\ninvolving an eclair.      He stated that one day he, Francoeur,\n\nChaloult, and Lariviere were eating a box of eclairs they had\n\nbrought back from the shipping dock, something that they did fairly\n\noften.   On this particular occasion: \"Bonnie would take a bite of\n\none and Kevin [Francoeur] made a noise out of his mouth.    Then Dan\n\nhad said, like, how far can it go.     And we all laughed, and that\n\nwas the end of that.   We finished eating, and we all went back out\n\non the floor.\"   Anderson testified that of all the times when they\n\nate eclairs, this was the only occasion when a comment was made\n\nabout someone putting an eclair in their mouth.         He did not\n\nconsider this to be sexual harassment.6\n\n          Anderson also testified that Francoeur once in a while\n\ntalked about his own nipples being chafed or irritated.    One time,\n\nwhen Chaloult as well as others, both male and female, were\n\n\n\n     6\n          When asked whether he knew if Lariviere had been\ndisciplined for his comment, Anderson stated that was \"none of\n[his] business . . . as far as an entry-level supervisor. Only\nupper management would know if something like that happened.\"\n\n                                -18-\n\fpresent,    Francoeur    asked   if    other   people   had   hard   nipples.\n\nAnderson said that he heard Francoeur talk about the breasts of\n\nfemale employees \"once or twice,\" but never about Chaloult's in\n\nparticular, and never in her presence. When asked why he did not\n\nreport to management Francoeur's comments about breasts, Anderson\n\nreplied that Francoeur \"was talking to me -- I mean, at that point\n\nI felt it was a guy to guy talk.             I mean, you just talk; and I\n\ndidn't really think nothing of it.           I mean, it was just me and him\n\nin the office or outside.\"       Again, Anderson did not consider this\n\nto be harassment.       Chaloult has not rebutted this testimony.\n\n            With respect to the incident Chaloult referred to in her\n\nletter of resignation, Anderson testified that Francoeur did not\n\nask him whether he and Chaloult were having sexual relations.\n\nRather, Francoeur came into the office where Anderson was sitting\n\nand asked whether Anderson and Chaloult were \"f[]ing with him\" by\n\nnot answering their radios because Francoeur had unsuccessfully\n\nbeen trying to get a hold of them.             Anderson said that he told\n\nChaloult about the episode a few days later: \"[I]t got worked into\n\nthe conversation . . . . I was telling her, Kevin came in the\n\noffice and he was pretty mad that we weren't answering our radios\n\nand he asked if we were F-ing, if we were F-ing with him and stuff\n\nlike that.\"     Chaloult also has not called this testimony into\n\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            Anderson testified that Chaloult never asked him to do\n\nanything    with,      or    about,       Francoeur's      comments.        There    is    no\n\ntestimony    from      Chaloult     that      she    ever    used    the    term    \"sexual\n\nharassment\" in her conversations with Anderson about Francoeur.\n\n                                             II.\n\n            The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that an employer\n\nis   strictly     liable      for     a    hostile     environment         created    by   a\n\nsupervisor when the employer neither knew nor reasonably could have\n\nknown of the alleged misconduct. Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson,\n\n477 U.S. 57, 70-72 (1986).\n\n            In    Faragher      and        Ellerth,    the    Court     adopted      as    an\n\nalternative       to    an    automatic       liability        rule    an    affirmative\n\n\"composite\" defense under which an employer may show, under the\n\nfirst prong, that \"the employer had exercised reasonable care to\n\navoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur,\" and,\n\nunder the second prong, that \"the complaining employee had failed\n\nto   act   with    like      reasonable       care    to     take    advantage      of    the\n\nemployer's safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have\n\nbeen avoided.\"         Faragher, 524 U.S. at 805.\n\n            We separately evaluate the two prongs, recognizing that\n\nthere may be a relationship between the two.                        For example, if the\n\ncompany has not provided information about a complaint procedure,\n\nthat may affect whether the employee's failure to use the procedure\n\nis reasonable, and vice versa.                Reasonable effort is required on\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\fboth sides.    As we said in Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.,\n\n333 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 2003), the Supreme Court \"certainly knew[]\n\nits   regime   necessarily   requires   the   employee   in   normal\n\ncircumstances to make [the effort to put the company on notice] if\n\nthe employee wants to impose vicarious liability on the employer\n\nand collect damages under Title VII.\"    Id. at 35; see also, e.g.,\n\nFreytes-Torres v. City of Sanford, No. 05-15805, 2008 WL 763216, at\n\n*3 (11th Cir. Mar. 25, 2008); Nurse \"BE\" v. Columbia Palms W. Hosp.\n\nLtd. P'ship, 490 F.3d 1302, 1309-12 (11th Cir. 2007); Hardage v.\n\nCBS Broad., Inc., 427 F.3d 1177, 1186 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n          Plaintiff does not contest that IBC has met the second\n\nprong of the Faragher-Ellerth defense.    The district court found\n\nthat Chaloult had waived any challenge to the company's claim that\n\nshe had not acted reasonably by failing to report the harassment.\n\nWe take it as true7 then that Chaloult \"unreasonably failed to take\n\nadvantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by\n\n\n\n\n      7\n          Clearly Chaloult's behavior in not complaining was not\nreasonable. There is absolutely no evidence of Chaloult's having\n\"more than ordinary fear or embarrassment,\" as Reed v. MBNA\nMarketing Systems, Inc., 333 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2003), requires.\nTo the contrary, Chaloult was a supervisor herself who had worked\nfor the company for over five years.\n          In Reed, this circuit held that a jury question was\npresented on the second prong regarding whether it was unreasonable\nfor a seventeen-year-old plaintiff to fail to complain about her\nsupervisor's sexual assault when the supervisor was twice her age\nand told her that they would both be fired if she reported and that\nhis father was good friends with the company's owner. Id. at 37.\n\n                                -21-\n\fthe employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\"               Faragher, 524 U.S. at\n\n807.\n\n            Chaloult has posed the question as one under the first\n\nprong of Faragher-Ellerth, that is, whether the company acted\n\nreasonably.      We agree that, depending on the facts, there may be\n\ninstances   in    which   the    employee   acted   unreasonably,      but   the\n\nemployer also did not exercise reasonable care.               But that is not\n\nthe case. Chaloult concedes that IBC did have an acceptable sexual\n\nharassment policy and complaint process in place, that the company\n\nhad trained its employees regarding its policies, and that Chaloult\n\nknew of these policies.         Chaloult thus concedes that the employer\n\nhas met the initial aspect of the first prong -- that the employer\n\ntook reasonable care to avoid sexual harassment.              She argues that\n\nthe employer failed to meet the second aspect -- that the employer\n\nfailed to take reasonable care to eliminate harassment when it\n\nmight occur.\n\n            Specifically, Chaloult argues that Anderson's putative\n\nknowledge of Chaloult's being harassed in the manner described in\n\nthe    lawsuit   must   be   attributed     to   IBC,   and   that   given   the\n\nattributed knowledge, IBC failed to take appropriate corrective\n\nactions.    It is important to note that there is no claim of any\n\nactual knowledge on the part of any IBC personnel who were superior\n\nto Francoeur, or anyone superior to Chaloult, other than Francoeur.\n\nNor is there a claim the company routinely ignored harassment\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fcomplaints or that there were prior complaints against others.\n\nMoreover,    Chaloult    does    not    claim       that    the   company       acted\n\nunreasonably in responding to a complaint after she submitted her\n\nletter of resignation and put it on notice of Francoeur's comments\n\nregarding an alleged sexual relationship between Chaloult and\n\nFrancoeur.\n\n            Chaloult argues that case law requires imputation to a\n\ncompany of a co-worker's knowledge so long as the co-worker had any\n\nobligation    to   report    harassment,      and    that   the    scope    of   the\n\nFaragher-Ellerth defense is defined, as a matter of law, by the\n\ncompany's own sexual harassment policies.                    Here, because the\n\ncompany    voluntarily      required    all   supervisors         to   report    any\n\nharassment, as a matter of law the knowledge of anyone bearing the\n\ntitle of supervisor must be attributed to the company for purposes\n\nof the company's obligation to eliminate harassment.\n\n            We disagree with the plaintiff's argument.                  Given the\n\ncombination of factors from the events in this case, we think that\n\nthe company was entitled to summary judgment under Faragher-\n\nEllerth.     Here, the employer had an appropriate policy, it was\n\nwidely known and disseminated, it was known to the plaintiff, and\n\nthe plaintiff failed to use the complaint procedures for the\n\nmatters at issue.    It is also clear, as to the second aspect of the\n\nfirst prong, that as to the one matter reported to the employer by\n\nplaintiff's August 4 letter, the company did act reasonably in\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fresponse.   The employer promptly interviewed Chaloult, Francoeur,\n\nand   Anderson   and   concluded   that   Chaloult's    account    of    what\n\nFrancoeur said to Anderson was inaccurate, but that Francoeur\n\nshould be punished for using inappropriate language.         Further, the\n\ncomplaint Chaloult made in her letter of resignation actually had\n\nto do with invasion of personal privacy and reasonably could be\n\nviewed as not being about sexual harassment.            The employer also\n\nreasonably viewed the matter as closed since Chaloult had raised no\n\nother issues in her letter or in her meeting with Santos.          Thus the\n\nemployer was fully in compliance with the second aspect of the\n\nfirst   prong    of   Faragher-Ellerth    as   to   information   of    which\n\nmanagement had actual notice.\n\n            Nor is there knowledge that should be imputed to the\n\ncompany that would render unreasonable its response under the\n\nsecond aspect of the first Faragher-Ellerth prong. Chaloult argues\n\nthat whatever Anderson knew must be attributed to the company and\n\nthat what Anderson knew was the full range of behavior that\n\nChaloult complains about in her lawsuit.        We outline our reasoning\n\nfor rejecting Chaloult's proposition that the employer here was on\n\nadequate notice and failed to take appropriate steps.\n\n            Chaloult's position is not supported by the case law.\n\nChaloult relies on cases which she characterizes as holding that\n\nthe unreported knowledge of sexual harassment by any employee\n\nbearing the title supervisor, even peers with no authority over the\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fharasser, is sufficient itself to attribute knowledge to the\n\nemployer.    As a general proposition this cannot be consistent with\n\nthe    defense   outlined     by   the   Supreme      Court,    which   provides\n\nincentives for employers to develop sexual harassment reporting\n\npolicies and to educate employees about and promote compliance with\n\nsuch procedures in order to avoid vicarious liability.\n\n             Chaloult relies heavily on Dees v. Johnson Controls World\n\nServices, Inc., 168 F.3d 417 (11th Cir. 1999), a case which is not\n\nat all like this.    Dees concerned the adequacy of evidence that the\n\nharasser's supervisors had knowledge of the harassment and did\n\nnothing.      In Dees, there was evidence that superiors of the\n\nharasser had actual knowledge of harassment prior to plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint. Specifically, a Human Resources employee told plaintiff\n\nthat   the   employer   was    aware     of   prior    sexual    harassment   in\n\nplaintiff's department, and plaintiff's superior informed her on\n\nmultiple occasions that he had reported the harassment up the\n\nladder \"because he realized that [plaintiff] could not file a\n\ncomplaint herself.\"     Id. at 422-23.\n\n             Chaloult's argument about attribution to the company\n\nturns on the fact that Anderson's title was supervisor.                 In fact,\n\nthat was plaintiff's title as well.            Anderson was her co-worker,\n\nand they both reported to the alleged harasser.                This situation is\n\nunlike other cases in which people in management at levels above or\n\nat the same level as the harasser either observed directly or were\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\ftold of the harassment. Cf., e.g., Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-Mart P.R.,\n\nInc., 434 F.3d 75, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2006); Dees, 168 F.3d at 423;\n\nCoates v. Sundor Brands, Inc., 164 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.\n\n1999); Distasio v. Perkin Elmer Corp., 157 F.3d 55, 64 (2d Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            This   raises    the     question    of   whether     the    company's\n\nvoluntary    adoption   of     a     policy     requiring   all       supervisors,\n\nregardless   of    whether    they    are     co-workers,   to    report    sexual\n\nharassment increases the scope of the company's legal liability as\n\na matter of law under Title VII.                We think not, although one\n\ncircuit has adopted such an approach.             See Clark v. United Parcel\n\nServ., Inc., 400 F.3d 341, 350 (6th Cir. 2005).8             Adoption of this\n\nview would set a legal standard different from the Supreme Court's\n\nreasonableness     approach    in    Faragher-Ellerth.           It    would   also\n\ndiscourage and penalize voluntary efforts which go beyond what the\n\nlaw requires.      And it would be inconsistent with approaches to\n\nvoluntary efforts in other areas of Title VII law.                      See, e.g.,\n\nWalker v. Prudential Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 286 F.3d 1270, 1279\n\n(11th Cir. 2002) (an employer's deviation from a voluntarily\n\n\n\n     8\n          The case Clark cites in support of this proposition,\nCoates v. Sundor Brands, Inc., 164 F.3d 1361 (11th Cir. 1999), says\nno such thing. The language from Coates, that a company \"itself\nanswered the question of when it would be deemed to have notice of\nthe harassment,\" was used in the context of whether an employee had\nsufficiently reported harassment to the company, not whether the\ncompany was liable for a co-worker supervisor's knowledge.

Runyon, No. 92-6078, 1993 WL 264669, at *3 (6th\n\nCir. July 12, 1993) (same).9\n\n                  Even if all of Anderson's knowledge were imputed to IBC,\n\nthis would not make IBC's actions unreasonable, since it is clear\n\nthat Anderson did not consider himself on notice of harassment.\n\nAnderson testified that he did hear several comments by Francoeur\n\nwhich Chaloult attributed to Francoeur, but Anderson believed the\n\ncomments were not harassing, and so there was no basis to report.\n\nAs to the most suggestive of the alleged comments, i.e., that\n\nFrancoeur offered to go and have sex with Chaloult, Anderson says\n\nhe did not hear them.               Chaloult did not testify that Anderson did\n\nhear       them    or   that   he    must,   of     necessity,   have   heard   them.10\n\nAnderson also testified that had he observed or known of any claims\n\nby Chaloult of harassment, he would have reported them up the\n\nchain.\n\n\n\n       9\n          This does not mean that Anderson had no duty to report\nharassment under IBC's policy. But the existence of any such duty\ndoes not, as a matter of law, automatically impute to IBC all of\nAnderson's knowledge for the purpose of determining the\nreasonableness of IBC's actions under Faragher-Ellerth.\n       10\n          In an affidavit accompanying her opposition to summary\njudgment, Chaloult added new information: that after Francoeur made\nthe offer to go to her house and have sex with her, Anderson \"said\nthat Mr. Francoeur's behavior was getting worse, and, it would get\nhim into trouble at some point.\"         Since this statement is\ninconsistent with Chaloult's deposition testimony, we disregard it.\nTorrech-Hern√°ndez v. Gen. Elec. Co., 519 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.\n2008); Abreu-Guzman v.

The defendant met the reasonableness standard.\n\nThis is not an instance in which the employer is trying to utilize\n\nits sexual harassment reporting chain to immunize itself from\n\nknowledge it actually had of the harassment allegations.11               Varner\n\nv. Nat'l Super Markets, Inc., 94 F.3d 1209, 1213-14 (8th Cir.\n\n1996).     Rather, this is a case where the company was deprived of\n\nthe   opportunity   to   take    remedial   action     because    --   with    the\n\nexception of the one incident Chaloult reported, which Santos\n\npromptly    investigated   and    acted    on   --   Chaloult    did   not    make\n\nallegations of sexual harassment until she filed suit over a year\n\nafter leaving her job at IBC.\n\n            We affirm the entry of summary judgment for defendant.\n\n\n\n                     -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n      11\n          This is also not a case where the employer was aware of\nprior instances of Francoeur's harassment through complaints made\nby other people. There is no indication that any complaints were\nmade about Francoeur by anyone else at any time.\n\n                                    -28-\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.             Three propositions\n\nunderlie the decision of the majority to affirm summary judgment\n\nfor IBC: (1) the terms of the sexual harassment policy that IBC\n\nchose to adopt should not be applied as written, (2) with the\n\npolicy    cast   aside,   Chaloult's       unreasonable    failure    to   take\n\nadvantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by\n\nIBC's sexual harassment policy (the second element of the Faragher-\n\nEllerth   affirmative     defense)    becomes    the   decisive      factor   in\n\ndetermining that IBC exercised reasonable care to prevent and\n\ncorrect promptly sexually harassing behavior (the first element of\n\nthe Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense), and (3) there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact about whether Anderson was aware of\n\nthe sexual harassment of Chaloult.\n\n            I disagree with each of these propositions.           Therefore,\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            IBC's    sexual    harassment        policy     states     without\n\nqualification:\n\n     If a supervisor becomes aware of any violation or\n     possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident\n     should be reported immediately to the human resources\n     manager or plant general manager . . . . Supervisors have\n     an affirmative duty to keep their work area free from\n     sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate\n     steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.\n\nAlthough the majority acknowledges that Anderson was a supervisor,\n\nit insists that his awareness of sexual harassment could not be\n\n                                     -29-\n\fattributed to IBC because Chaloult also was a supervisor on the\n\nsame level as Anderson, and both reported to Francoeur, the alleged\n\nharasser.     The majority also notes that no one in management at\n\nFrancoeur's    level    or       above   had    knowledge       of   the    harassment.\n\nTherefore, according to the majority, IBC should be entitled to the\n\naffirmative defense.\n\n            The majority has added its own gloss to the company's\n\nclearly stated policy.            As drafted, the policy did not qualify\n\nAnderson's obligations under the company's sexual harassment policy\n\nsimply   because   he    and      Chaloult     were    supervisors         at   the   same\n\nemployment level. Likewise, as drafted, the policy did not qualify\n\nAnderson's    obligations         because      the    alleged    harasser       was    the\n\nimmediate supervisor of both Anderson and Chaloult.\n\n            Indeed, that policy demonstrates that IBC knew how to\n\ndistinguish    between       a    particular     category       of   supervisor       and\n\nsupervisors generally.            The \"Awareness\" section of the company's\n\nsexual harassment policy reads in its totality as follows:\n\n            II. Awareness\n                A. Supervisors must be sensitive to the problem\n                of sexual harassment.\n                B. Employees shall be encouraged to report an\n                incident   of  sexual   harassment   to   their\n                supervisor.\n                C. If a supervisor becomes aware of any\n                violation or possible violation of the EEOC\n                guidelines, the incident should be reported\n                immediately to the human resources manager or\n                plant general manager.\n                D. Supervisors have an affirmative duty to keep\n                their work area free from sexual harassment of\n\n\n                                                -30-\n\f              any kind and shall take appropriate steps to\n              prevent and eliminate such harassment.\n\n(emphases added).\n\n          Pursuant   to   this     policy,     employees     experiencing\n\nharassment are specifically \"encouraged to report an incident of\n\nsexual harassment to their supervisor.\"              However, supervisors\n\ngenerally \"must be sensitive to the problems of sexual harassment,\"\n\nand must \"report immediately to the human resources manager or\n\nplant general manager\" any violation or possible violation of the\n\nEEOC guidelines. They also \"have an affirmative duty to keep their\n\nwork area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take\n\nappropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.\"\n\n          Anderson   understood     that     these    obligations   of     a\n\nsupervisor to deal with sexual harassment applied to him.           As the\n\nmajority points out, Anderson confirmed at his deposition that \"it\n\nis his understanding that if supervisors receive a complaint of\n\nsexual harassment, they are supposed to report it right away.\"\n\nAlthough Chaloult never said to Anderson \"I am being sexually\n\nharassed by Francoeur and I want you to help me,\" she alleges that\n\nshe did complain to Anderson about Francoeur's conduct and she\n\nasserts that Anderson was aware of many of her encounters with\n\nFrancoeur independently of any complaint by her.         Yet the majority\n\ninsists that Anderson had no legal obligation to do anything - and\n\nthe company thus could not be found to have acted unreasonably -\n\nbecause IBC's policy requires more than Title VII demands.               The\n\n                                  -31-\n\fmajority simply ignores as improvident or legally irrelevant IBC's\n\npolicy choice to imbue all supervisors with the responsibility for\n\nreporting and preventing sexual harassment.12\n\n          Other courts have agreed that a company's stated sexual\n\nharassment policy is critical to an evaluation of the question\n\nposed by the first element of the affirmative defense -- whether\n\n\"the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\n\npromptly any sexually harassing behavior.\"       Faragher v. City of\n\nBoca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807 (1998).   In Clark v. United Parcel\n\nServ., Inc., 400 F.3d 341 (6th Cir. 2005), the court rejected the\n\nemployer's argument that, as a matter of law, supervisors who \"were\n\nnot high enough in the company hierarchy and had no authority to\n\ncontrol [the harasser]\" had no duty to convey their knowledge of\n\nharassment to higher management.   Id. at 350.    The court observed\n\nthat \"[t]his argument might have merit but for the fact that UPS\n\nitself has, through its sexual harassment policy, placed a duty on\n\n\n\n     12\n       In footnote 9 of its opinion, the majority states that it\nis not saying that Anderson had no duty to report harassment under\nIBC's policy. Rather, the majority insists that Anderson had no\nduty to report Francoeur's harassment of Chaloult under the\ncircumstances of this case.      Those circumstances include two\nindefensible legal propositions put forth by the majority. First,\nas explained above, the majority says that Anderson's status as a\nsupervisor under the IBC policy does not matter here because\nChaloult was a supervisor at the same level as Anderson and because\nthe harasser, Francoeur, was the supervisor for both of them.\nSecond, as I explain more fully in Parts II and III of the dissent,\nthe majority says that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's\ntreatment of Chaloult did not constitute awareness of sexual\nharassment as a matter of law.\n\n                               -32-\n\fall supervisors and managers to 'report[] incidents of sexual\n\nharassment to the appropriate management people.'\"          Id. (emphasis\n\nin original); see also Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc., 164 F.3d\n\n1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999).13\n\n             The majority justifies its decision not to enforce IBC's\n\npolicy as written on the ground that to do so would \"set a legal\n\nstandard different from the Supreme Court's reasonableness approach\n\nin   Faragher-Ellerth.\"      According     to   the   majority,   allowing\n\nknowledge of sexual harassment by \"any employee bearing the title\n\nsupervisor\" to be sufficient to attribute knowledge to the employer\n\nis inconsistent with the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense,\n\nwhich     \"provides   incentives   for    employers   to   develop   sexual\n\nharassment reporting policies and to educate employees about and\n\npromote compliance with such procedures.\"\n\n             The majority misapprehends Title VII's \"basic policies of\n\nencouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting\n\nemployees.\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807. The animating principle of\n\n\n     13\n       In Coates, the court held that when an employer's sexual\nharassment policy designates the people responsible for reporting\nmisconduct, the company \"itself answered the question of when it\nwould be deemed to have notice of the harassment sufficient to\nobligate it or its agents to take prompt and appropriate remedial\nmeasures.\" 164 F.3d at 1364. The majority correctly notes that\nthe court in Coates was considering whether an employee had\nsufficiently reported harassment to the company and did not address\nthe issue of whether a company was liable for a co-worker\nsupervisor's knowledge. Even with this factual distinction, the\ncentral point remains the same -- a company's own harassment policy\nanswers the question of who within the company is responsible for\nreporting and responding to known incidences of harassment.\n\n                                   -33-\n\fTitle    VII     is       \"not   to   provide      redress   [for   employment\n\ndiscrimination] but to avoid harm.\"             Faragher, 524 U.S. at 806.    By\n\ninvolving supervisors at all levels in the reporting and prevention\n\nof   sexual    harassment,       IBC's    sexual    harassment   policy   seeks\n\ncomprehensively to avoid harm.             If the failures of a particular\n\nsupervisor in the reporting of sexual harassment belie the promise\n\nof that comprehensive policy, a court should not forgive the\n\nfailure of the supervisor by declaring the policy too ambitious.\n\n            Not surprisingly, I can find no other cases in which an\n\nemployer prevailed on the first element of the Faragher-Ellerth\n\naffirmative defense because a court thought its sexual harassment\n\npolicy   imposed      a    broader    reporting    obligation    than   the   law\n\nrequired.      If the majority believes that IBC's policy states the\n\nreporting responsibilities of supervisors too broadly to justify\n\nvicarious liability, IBC should rewrite that policy, not the court.\n\n                                         II.\n\n            I agree with the majority that there may be instances in\n\nwhich there is a relationship between the two prongs of the\n\nFaragher-Ellerth affirmative defense.              That is, facts relevant to\n\nan assessment of the unreasonableness of the employee in not taking\n\nadvantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities afforded by\n\na company's sexual harassment policy may also be relevant to an\n\nassessment of the reasonable care taken by an employer to prevent\n\nand correct promptly sexual harassment. Some of the cases cited by\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\fthe majority present such scenarios. For example, in Nurse \"BE\" v.\n\nColumbia Palms W. Hosp. Ltd. P'ship, 490 F.3d 1302 (11th Cir.\n\n2007), an employee explicitly \"requested that [her supervisor] not\n\nreport    the    incident   [of   sexual    harassment]    and   premised   the\n\ncomplaint on [the supervisor]'s promise of confidentiality.\"                Id.\n\nat 1310.    Similarly, in Hardage v. CBS Broad., Inc., 427 F.3d 1177\n\n(9th Cir. 2005), the employee told the supervisor with whom he had\n\ndiscussed the allegedly harassing behavior that he wanted to\n\n\"handle the situation by himself.\"          Id. at 1186.   In Nurse \"BE\" and\n\nHardage, the employee's conduct -- telling the supervisor not to\n\naddress    the   harassment   --   appropriately    affected      the   court's\n\ninquiry into the reasonableness of the measures taken by the\n\nemployer. However, those cases are inapplicable here because there\n\nthe employees took affirmative steps to thwart their supervisors'\n\ncompliance with the reporting requirements.          Here, Chaloult merely\n\nfailed to act.      That is often the case in sexual harassment cases\n\nfor many different reasons.         That failure has no relationship to\n\nAnderson's responsibilities as a supervisor if he was aware of the\n\nharassing conduct by Francoeur.\n\n            The majority sees it differently.        With its disregard of\n\nIBC's sexual harassment policy, it seeks to minimize the importance\n\nof Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's conduct notwithstanding the\n\nobligation to report imposed on him by IBC's policy, and it makes\n\nChaloult's failure to use the complaint procedures of the company\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fthe decisive factor in deciding that the company acted reasonably.\n\nIn effect, the majority double counts Chaloult's failure to report\n\nsexual harassment to higher management (once in each element of the\n\naffirmative defense).          It gives little or no weight at all to\n\nAnderson's awareness of Chaloult's encounters with Francoeur.                For\n\nthis approach, the majority cites language from Reed v. MBNA Mktg.\n\nSys., Inc., 333 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 2003), where we said that the\n\nSupreme Court \"certainly knew [] its [Faragher-Ellerth] regime\n\nnecessarily requires the employee in normal circumstances to make\n\n[the effort to report sexually offensive conduct] if the employee\n\nwants to impose vicarious liability on the employer and collect\n\ndamages under Title VII.\"        Id. at 35 (emphasis in original).\n\n            This statement is merely an explanation of why there is\n\na second element of the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense that\n\nfocuses on the reporting responsibilities and conduct of the\n\nemployee.    That statement did not mean, because it could not mean,\n\nthat the unreasonable failure of the employee to report sexual\n\nharassment    trumps     the   failure   of     the   employer    to   exercise\n\nreasonable care to prevent and correct promptly sexual harassment\n\nin a case where the employer has knowledge of the sexual harassment\n\nindependently of any reporting by the employee. It is only because\n\nof   the    majority's    insistence     that    Anderson's      knowledge    of\n\nFrancoeur's treatment of Chaloult cannot be imputed to IBC under\n\nelement one of the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense that the\n\n\n                                    -36-\n\fmajority can rule as a matter of law that IBC prevails on that\n\ndefense.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           Near the end of its opinion, the majority qualifies its\n\ninsistence that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of\n\nChaloult cannot be imputed to IBC.        The majority says that ‚Äú[e]ven\n\nif all of Anderson's knowledge were imputed to IBC, this would not\n\nmake IBC's actions unreasonable, since it is clear that Anderson\n\ndid not consider himself on notice of harassment.‚Äù                    I do not\n\nunderstand     how   the    majority   can    ascribe        such   dispositive\n\nsignificance    to   Anderson's    alleged     insensitivity        to   sexual\n\nharassment.      Chaloult    describes    a   number    of    encounters   with\n\nFrancoeur that Anderson admittedly witnessed.            She also describes\n\nother encounters which she says Anderson was aware of and he denies\n\nit.   Those encounters are central to my view that we must vacate\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment.               Taking the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to Chaloult - as we must - Anderson was\n\naware of a series of episodes that a jury could view as sexual\n\nharassment.     Even accepting only what Anderson acknowledges he\n\nheard and observed, a jury could still find that he should have\n\nreported the conduct to IBC and that his failure to do so is\n\nproperly imputed to the company.         The majority looks at those same\n\nencounters and sees grounds for affirming summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\f            It does so by the misapplication of the summary judgment\n\nstandard.   That misapplication includes an inappropriate effort to\n\nundermine    Chaloult's    credibility.       The   majority    notes   that\n\nChaloult's contemporaneous diary of Francoeur's comments did not\n\ninclude all of the incidents alleged in the complaint; that she\n\nconceded in a deposition that her work deteriorated after she was\n\nput on notice that her position could be eliminated; and that she\n\nacknowledged her displeasure with her job for reasons unrelated to\n\nthe alleged sexual harassment.          Although these details are fair\n\ngame for a trial, they have no place in the summary judgment\n\nanalysis, where we are not permitted to draw negative inferences\n\nabout Chaloult's credibility.         That is a job for the jury at trial.\n\n            Then   there   is   the    majority's   curious    treatment   of\n\nChaloult's insistence that Anderson knew of some incidents that he\n\ndoes not acknowledge.      For example, Chaloult alleges that Anderson\n\nand a few maintenance people were in the area when Francoeur told\n\nher that he was going to come to her house to show her what\n\n‚Äúfucking was about.‚Äù The obvious import of Chaloult's statement is\n\nthat Anderson overheard the remark.            In response, the majority\n\nobserves that Anderson says that he did not hear those comments.\n\nThe majority apparently accepts Anderson's denial.             In so doing,\n\nthe majority distorts the summary judgment standard that requires\n\nus to take all facts in the light most favorable to Chaloult.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\f           Finally,        there    is    the    majority's     odd    treatment     of\n\nundisputed    portions      of     the   summary     judgment    record.       It     is\n\nundisputed that Anderson heard Francoeur: remark that women who\n\nrode motorcycles enjoyed sex from the backside after he learned\n\nthat   Chaloult      had   recently      taken   a   motorcycle       trip;   make   an\n\ninappropriate noise while Chaloult ate an eclair and another\n\nsupervisor \"asked how far can it go\"; state that he had heard a\n\nradio program that discussed \"spread points\" between breasts; and\n\nask other employees to measure their \"spread points.\" With respect\n\nto this spread points incident, the majority recounts in detail\n\nAnderson's version, including his insistence that he \"read nothing\n\ninto it because we all had a chuckle about it.\"                 The majority then\n\nsays that \"Chaloult has not called this testimony into question,\"\n\nwithout explaining how or why Chaloult has to challenge Anderson's\n\nstatement that he did not view this particular conduct as sexual\n\nharassment.\n\n           Anderson's dismissal of such conduct as \"guy talk\" and\n\nfunny incidences that provoked laughter may only mean that he was\n\na company supervisor who did not understand the nature of sexual\n\nharassment. Contrary to the inapt observation of the majority that\n\nChaloult     never    \"used      the     term    'sexual   harassment'        in     her\n\nconversations with Anderson about Francoeur,\" Chaloult had no\n\nobligation to explain to Anderson the significance of what he was\n\nseeing. The testimony about those encounters described by Chaloult\n\n\n                                         -39-\n\fshould have been heard by a jury charged with determining whether\n\nAnderson was placed on notice of sexual harassment, which would\n\nthen be imputable to IBC under the terms of its own sexual\n\nharassment policy.   Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the\n\ndecision of the majority to terminate this case.\n\n\n\n\n                              -40-\n\f",

Loranger with whom Nichols, Webb &amp; Loranger, PA were on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Robert W. Kline, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, BOUDIN and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Bonnie Chaloult sued her former employer, Interstate Brands Corporation (\"IBC\"), alleging she had suffered sexual harassment by her supervisor, Kevin <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> Francoeur, in the six months before she quit her job. The district court entered summary judgment for the employer.</p>\n<p>The issue on appeal turns on the affirmative defense available to employers when the harassment is by the plaintiff's supervisor.</p>\n<p>Under Title VII, an employer is subject to vicarious liability for sexual harassment by an employee's supervisor which does not constitute a tangible employment action. But the employer may prevail if it demonstrates a two-part affirmative defense: that its own actions to prevent and correct harassment were reasonable and that the employee's actions in seeking to avoid harm were not reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998); <i>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998). This case turns on the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>The question here concerns the employer's affirmative defense that it is not vicariously liable because on summary judgment it has established that (i) the employee's own actions were not reasonable (here plaintiff did not herself complain to management); (ii) the employer had reasonably set up and educated employees on appropriate procedures for handling sexual harassment allegations; (iii) the employer did reasonably investigate the original allegation plaintiff made to management at the time of her resignation; (iv) no one at a managerial level equal to or superior to the harasser had notice of the different allegations of harassment made in the lawsuit; and (v) the co-worker who had some notice of some of the different allegations did not consider the conduct he knew of to be harassment and did not call it to the attention of management.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff-employee argued that as a matter of law the knowledge of a co-worker with the title of supervisor, who was in fact a peer of the plaintiff's and who also reported to the harasser, was attributed to the employer under the company's policy and that defeats the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense. The district court rejected the plaintiff's argument.</p>\n<p>Conducting our independent review of the record, we find the employer made out its <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense to vicarious liability. We affirm the entry of summary judgment for the employer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We describe the facts, drawing all inferences in the plaintiff's favor, as we must do in summary judgment. <i>Mellen v. Trs. of Boston Univ.,</i> 504 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>Bonnie Chaloult began working at IBC's Biddeford, Maine production plant in June 1999. In July 2004, when an entry-level bread supervisor position opened up, Chaloult applied for and received it, and she began working as a bread supervisor in September 2004. When she first started working as a supervisor, she was in production, then she was moved to wrapping, and then back to production. When she was moved back to production in February 2005, her immediate supervisor became Kevin Francoeur, who was the assistant production manager. At that time, Chaloult's shift was the night shift, from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>On June 8, 2005, Chaloult and other supervisors attended a \"WARN meeting,\" under the Worker Adjustment Rehearing Notification Act, at which they were put on notice that their positions could potentially be eliminated in sixty days. This was occasioned by the company's going into bankruptcy. Chaloult understood that this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> could mean she was out of a job as of August 12, 2005. Chaloult conceded at deposition that her attendance at work \"deteriorated\" after this meeting, and other evidence supports this.</p>\n<p>At no time prior to her resignation did Chaloult complain about sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>After an incident with a co-worker,<sup>[1]</sup> on August 4, 2005, Chaloult submitted a letter of resignation. Chaloult was pregnant when she left IBC in August 2005, and was not re-employed until June 30, 2006. The letter of resignation stated, verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote>I respectfully request to give forth my two week notice, in accordance with the companies involuntary leave slip, my last date of work will be 8/19/05.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I would like to take the time to thank you, (Paul) and IBC for the experience I now have under management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>However, when I filled out my application for employment with IBC, it never stated that at any time would my supervisors above me, have the right to question my personal affairs and demand information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This I learned from yet another supervisor being accused of fore-play.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Is this company Policy? I tried to change shifts, told I had day hours for 6-strap production then I was denied. I no longer feel comfortable working for this supervisor.</blockquote>\n<p>The letter did not directly accuse her supervisor of harassing her, but of questioning her personal affairs with another supervisor, a situation she learned about from the supervisor who, she said, was accused of having a sexual relationship with her. The letter did state she no longer felt comfortable working for her own supervisor.</p>\n<p>Chaloult put her letter into the mailbox of her department manager, Paul Santos. Santos met with her the first day he was back at work after receiving the letter. Before meeting with Chaloult, Santos discussed her letter with Joseph Cabral, Assistant Human Resources Manager, and gave a copy of the letter to Human Resources so they could put it on file. Cabral and Santos decided that Santos should ask her what the letter meant, since they did not know to what she was referring.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Chaloult said she was referring to an incident that had taken place on July 15, in which Francoeur had approached a co-worker, Jim Anderson, and demanded to know whether Anderson and Chaloult were having sexual relations. Chaloult, who had a fianc√© at the time, had not been present during this conversation and said that Anderson had told her about it the following morning.</p>\n<p>When asked why she did not come forward sooner, she told Santos that she was worried about issues \"coming back at me.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> She did not say to Santos that there had been any other incidents of concern involving Francoeur. At deposition she admitted there was nothing that prevented her from reporting other instances to the company.</p>\n<p>Santos told her that he would follow up with both Anderson and Francoeur and report the incident to Human Resources. Santos did what he promised. Immediately after his meeting with Chaloult, Santos called Cabral and briefed him. Santos then called Francoeur into his office; they met for about half an hour. He told Francoeur what Chaloult had said. Francoeur said that was not what happened. Francoeur explained his version of what happened to Santos as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[H]e explained to me that he had been calling for both [Anderson and Chaloult], he had tried calling for her, tried calling for him on the radio, neither one of them were responding on the radio. He was walking from the six strap makeup area going towards the wrap office. He had passed Bonnie in transit or she was going ¬ó he noticed her going one way towards makeup, and he was going towards wrapping. He walked into the wrap office and said, Jim, what, are you and Bonnie fucking with me, screwing with me? And he said that Jim started laughing. He was like, no, we didn't hear the calls on the radio. And that's pretty much it.</blockquote>\n<p>Santos made Francoeur write down his version of events. The document was submitted into evidence and is consistent with Santos's description of the meeting.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Santos then met with Anderson. Anderson told Santos:</p>\n<blockquote>[Francoeur] just came in and was like, what, are you and Bonnie trying to fuck me? I was like, okay. I go, what else was said? He was like, nothing. We just laughed and he wanted some numbers, and I went out on the floor and that was it. He says he was trying to call us. I didn't hear him. Maybe our radios were down, and that was it.</blockquote>\n<p>During the interview Santos also asked Anderson what he said to Chaloult. Santos described his conversation with Anderson as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[I asked] what did Kevin say to you? What do you recall Kevin saying to you? He said, he just came in and he was like, what, are you and Bonnie trying to fuck me? I was like, okay. I go, what else was said? He was like, nothing. We just laughed and he wanted some numbers, and I went out on the floor and that was it. He says he was trying to call us. I didn't hear him. Maybe our radios were down, and that was it. I go, so he didn't come in and ask if you guys were fucking? He said, no. No, he just came in and he wanted to know if we were fucking with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I said, Bonnie is saying that you went to her and told her that Kevin asked you if you and her were having sex. He was like, oh, I don't remember what I told her. I go, well, you just told me that he came in and asked if you two guys were fucking with him and then you turn around and went to Bonnie and told Bonnie that Kevin asked if you and her were fucking. I go, so which one is it? He was like, no, he just came in and he said if we were fucking him. I was like, so then why did you go to Bonnie and tell her something different? And he made a comment about, oh, Bonnie and I were just laughing about it, we were joking about it, and that was it. I was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> like, well, it's not a joking matter because this is where we're at right now.</blockquote>\n<p>When he received Francoeur's statement, Santos discussed the matter with Cabral. They concluded that what Francoeur had said to Anderson was \"are you guys fucking with me?\" As a result, Francoeur was given a letter, dated September 1, 2005, warning about the use of inappropriate language (\"fuck\") and language which could be taken out of context in the workplace. The letter stated: \"While our investigation to date shows that the broad allegations made by the employee may not be 100% confirmed, it is clear that, based on your admission, that your comment was inappropriate and unwarranted.\" It also made clear that \"[a] manager must never discriminate, harass, or retaliate against any employee. If a Manager knowingly condones discrimination, harassment, or retaliation by another, the Manager will be considered to have personally engaged in the conduct.\"</p>\n<p>After Chaloult gave her two week's notice on August 4, she worked only a few more days and did not show up to work after August 8. As a result, IBC did not have the opportunity to conduct its usual exit interview. On November 11, Chaloult met, at his request, with Joseph Cabral; no specific information is provided about this meeting, and there is no evidence that Chaloult told Cabral the allegations she later made. Chaloult also filed an exit comment form, dated November 11, 2005, in which she made the comment: \"Sexual harassment from upper management for an ongoing period with other people ... involved.\" Santos stated that he did not see this exit comment form. He said he first became aware of Chaloult's other allegations after she filed suit.</p>\n<p>On October 10, 2006, more than a year after she left her employment, Chaloult filed suit in federal district court against IBC, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000(e), and the Maine Human Rights Act. She sought general, non-economic, and punitive damages. Chaloult alleged that she was sexually harassed by her superior, Francoeur, from February 5, 2005, when she first reported to Francoeur, to August 2005, when she left the company. For the first time she related a number of very specific complaints about other statements.</p>\n<p>Chaloult's testimony at deposition included the following specific allegations, which she had not mentioned to Santos or in her November 11, 2005 exit comment form.<sup>[3]</sup> One claim of harassment is that Francoeur frequently complained about his wife and his lack of sexual relations with her. At deposition, Chaloult said Francoeur made these comments openly to supervisors and also said he wished he could murder his wife. Chaloult did not report the comments to anyone.</p>\n<p>Further, there were comments about breasts. On several occasions when they were outside on break during the winter, Francoeur asked Chaloult about the distance between her nipples and told her to go home and measure this distance. He also at one point asked if her nipples chafed or stood out like headlights. She walked away and shook her head but did not report the comments to anyone. At <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> some point Chaloult walked into an office where Francoeur was in conversation with another worker named Steve Leclair and, without using her name but looking right at her, Francoeur indicated that Chaloult's breasts were \"melons. Big hooters.\" Chaloult did not report this incident and stated that nothing prevented her from doing so.</p>\n<p>Once, when they were alone in his office Francoeur asked Chaloult to hold her breath and push her chest out. She did not understand why he made the comment. She shook her head and walked off, saying nothing to Francoeur and not reporting the incident. She said she did not report it because she did not \"want any retaliation coming back.\"</p>\n<p>She said statements about her relationship with her boyfriend were harassing. Chaloult had broken up with her boyfriend in January of 2005. She got back together with him in April and they became engaged in May 2005. Francoeur made comments to her to the effect she should not get back together with her boyfriend. The more serious allegation is that toward the end of spring, Francoeur offered to come over to her house and have sex with her; specifically that \"he'd come to my house and show me what fucking was about.\" Chaloult said that Anderson and a few maintenance people were in the area at the time Francoeur made this comment. Chaloult walked away, spurning the offer. Chaloult did not report the incident.</p>\n<p>Another time, Chaloult joined Francoeur and Anderson on a patio for a smoke. Chaloult and Anderson were discussing a motorcycle trip that Chaloult had made with her boyfriend. Francoeur made the statement, \"well, girls who ride motorcycles normally like it from the back side, huh? Is that true, Bonnie[?]\" Chaloult turned and walked off, and shook her head. She did not report Francoeur for that statement; nothing kept her from reporting it.</p>\n<p>In another instance, Chaloult, another supervisor named Dan Lariviere, and Francoeur were sitting in an office and Lariviere was eating an eclair. Francoeur said he wanted to see how far Chaloult could stick the eclair down her throat. Lariviere said he would also like to see that. Then Francoeur said \"[i]f there isn't enough cream in there, ... I have plenty.\" Chaloult said nothing to either of them or to anyone in management above Francoeur about this.<sup>[4]</sup> She \"may have\" told Anderson about the incident.</p>\n<p>At some time in May, Chaloult had picked up a piece of dough off the machinery, and Francoeur made a comment to her that \"if the dough ball wasn't enough for me to play with, he had some balls that I could play with.\" Chaloult stated that a production employee named Amy Ramsell was present when Francoeur made this comment, but she is not sure whether Ramsell heard it. Chaloult walked off and did not report the incident; she stated that nothing prevented her from reporting it.</p>\n<p>In another instance, Chaloult was apparently in a bit of a frenzy in the presence of other workers over having misplaced her key card to get into the building. A female employee in the office, Sue Bisson, said \"it looks like somebody needs to get laid. Kevin [Francoeur] turns around and goes yeah, I guess so. Because I was apparently a little too hyper.\" Chaloult <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> did not complain to either of them or report them and nothing prevented her from doing so.</p>\n<p>Finally, on July 15, as discussed above, Francoeur allegedly walked into an office where Anderson was doing some paperwork and yelled at him, \"so how long have you and Bonnie been fucking?\"</p>\n<p>There were no objectionable statements by Francoeur between July 15 and Chaloult's letter of resignation on August 4.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>IBC had in place anti-sexual-harassment policies which included methods for reporting harassment. The company's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Interstate strictly prohibits sexual harassment.... Examples of the prohibited conduct include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and gender slurs or other offensive, derogatory, or demeaning comments, jokes, graffiti, or other verbal or physical conduct and written or taped materials relating to gender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Any person who believes that the person has been subjected to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation or who knows of possible discrimination, harassment, or retaliation against anyone else should immediately report it to supervision or to Richard W. Morgano, [phone number redacted] or to Rhonda Tracy, [phone number redacted]. Do not wait until a situation is severe or pervasive; report any possible discrimination or harassment or retaliation as soon as you know of it.</i></blockquote>\n<p>Chaloult signed an updated version of this policy on September 16, 2003, indicating that \"I ... have read and understand IBC's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and have participated in <i>`In this Together</i>' Harassment Training.\"</p>\n<p>Chaloult had also signed, when she first began working for the company on June 10, 1999, the company's Sexual Harassment Policy, which included the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote>II. Awareness</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Supervisors must be sensitive to the problem of sexual harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. Employees shall be encouraged to report an incident of sexual harassment to their supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. If a supervisor becomes aware of any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident should be reported immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>D. Supervisors have an affirmative duty to keep their work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.</blockquote>\n<p>Chaloult was also aware that IBC had a confidential toll-free complaint line for employees.</p>\n<p>Chaloult admittedly did not at any time before submitting her letter of resignation make any complaint about Francoeur to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> the Human Resources manager, the plant manager, or to any other person who was superior or equal to Francoeur's level at the company.</p>\n<p>When asked at deposition why she did not come forward sooner with her complaints, Chaloult responded, \"I had talked with Jim Anderson, and Jim Anderson knew about these comments.\" When asked whether she had asked Anderson to report her concerns to management, Chaloult stated that she had not. She asserted that Anderson was present at the time of Francoeur's comment about measuring the distance between nipples, when Francoeur made the comment about girls who ride motorcycles, and when Francoeur told Chaloult that he wanted to come over to her house and have sex with her, and that he told her about Francoeur's comment suggesting that Chaloult and Anderson were having a sexual relationship on July 15.</p>\n<p>Chaloult and Anderson were peers; they, along with one other person, were entry-level supervisors on the overnight shift in the bread department; Francoeur, as the assistant bread production manager in charge of the overnight shift, was their direct supervisor. There were also three other entry-level supervisors in the bread department who worked during a second shift.</p>\n<p>At deposition, Anderson confirmed that it is his understanding that if supervisors receive a complaint of sexual harassment, they are supposed to report it right away. However, when asked whether he was ever aware of behavior which could have violated the company's sexual harassment policy, he said that he was not. When asked whether anyone had ever complained to him about conduct that could have been construed as sexual harassment, Anderson said no.</p>\n<p>Anderson further testified that he was never present when anyone objected to something that Francoeur said, nor did he ever get the impression that something Francoeur said upset someone. Anderson testified that the group of supervisors of whom he and Chaloult were part got along \"pretty good. I mean, we were loosey goosey. We joked around with each other.\"</p>\n<p>As to Chaloult's specific allegations of harassment, Anderson said that one day Francoeur said to other workers during a smoke break that he had heard people on a radio program referring to the distance between nipples as \"spread points,\" and \"we all got a laugh out of it.\" Anderson said that Francoeur asked a group of people, not just Chaloult, to measure their \"spread points.\" More specifically, \"[h]e made a general statement for all of us to go home and do it.... I didn't think nothing of it at the time. I didn't think there was nothing wrong because we all just laughed about it and we left the office.\" When asked whether he thought that Francoeur violated the company's sexual harassment policy when he made comments about \"spread points\" to a group of people that included women, Anderson stated, \"I didn't read nothing into it because we all had a chuckle about it. So, I mean, I don't think any of us read anything into it because we all laughed and went on....\" Chaloult has not called this testimony into question.</p>\n<p>Anderson had a different recollection of the incident involving an eclair. He stated that one day he, Francoeur, Chaloult, and Lariviere were eating a box of eclairs they had brought back from the shipping dock, something that they did fairly often. On this particular occasion: \"Bonnie would take a bite of one and Kevin [Francoeur] made a noise out of his mouth. Then Dan had said, like, how far can it go. And we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> all laughed, and that was the end of that. We finished eating, and we all went back out on the floor.\" Anderson testified that of all the times when they ate eclairs, this was the only occasion when a comment was made about someone putting an eclair in their mouth. He did not consider this to be sexual harassment.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Anderson also testified that Francoeur once in a while talked about his own nipples being chafed or irritated. One time, when Chaloult as well as others, both male and female, were present, Francoeur asked if other people had hard nipples. Anderson said that he heard Francoeur talk about the breasts of female employees \"once or twice,\" but never about Chaloult's in particular, and never in her presence. When asked why he did not report to management Francoeur's comments about breasts, Anderson replied that Francoeur \"was talking to me ¬ó I mean, at that point I felt it was a guy to guy talk. I mean, you just talk; and I didn't really think nothing of it. I mean, it was just me and him in the office or outside.\" Again, Anderson did not consider this to be harassment. Chaloult has not rebutted this testimony.</p>\n<p>With respect to the incident Chaloult referred to in her letter of resignation, Anderson testified that Francoeur did not ask him whether he and Chaloult were having sexual relations. Rather, Francoeur came into the office where Anderson was sitting and asked whether Anderson and Chaloult were \"f[ ]ing with him\" by not answering their radios because Francoeur had unsuccessfully been trying to get a hold of them. Anderson said that he told Chaloult about the episode a few days later: \"[I]t got worked into the conversation.... I was telling her, Kevin came in the office and he was pretty mad that we weren't answering our radios and he asked if we were F-ing, if we were F-ing with him and stuff like that.\" Chaloult also has not called this testimony into question.</p>\n<p>Anderson testified that Chaloult never asked him to do anything with, or about, Francoeur's comments. There is no testimony from Chaloult that she ever used the term \"sexual harassment\" in her conversations with Anderson about Francoeur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that an employer is strictly liable for a hostile environment created by a supervisor when the employer neither knew nor reasonably could have known of the alleged misconduct. <i>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson,</i> 477 U.S. 57, 70-72, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986).</p>\n<p>In <i>Faragher</i> and <i>Ellerth,</i> the Court adopted as an alternative to an automatic liability rule an affirmative \"composite\" defense under which an employer may show, under the first prong, that \"the employer had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur,\" and, under the second prong, that \"the complaining employee had failed to act with like reasonable care to take advantage of the employer's safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have been avoided.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 805, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n<p>We separately evaluate the two prongs, recognizing that there may be a relationship between the two. For example, if the company has not provided information about a complaint procedure, that may affect whether the employee's failure to use the procedure is reasonable, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> vice versa. Reasonable effort is required on both sides. As we said in <i>Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.,</i> 333 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.2003), the Supreme Court \"certainly knew[ ] its regime necessarily requires the employee in normal circumstances to make [the effort to put the company on notice] <i>if the employee wants to impose vicarious liability on the employer and collect damages under Title VII.\" Id.</i> at 35; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Freytes-Torres v. City of Sanford,</i> 270 Fed.Appx. 885, 890-91 (11th Cir.2008); <i>Nurse \"BE\" v. Columbia Palms W. Hosp. Ltd. P'ship,</i> 490 F.3d 1302, 1309-12 (11th Cir.2007); <i>Hardage v. CBS Broad., Inc.,</i> 427 F.3d 1177, 1186 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Plaintiff does not contest that IBC has met the second prong of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense. The district court found that Chaloult had waived any challenge to the company's claim that she had not acted reasonably by failing to report the harassment. We take it as true<sup>[7]</sup> then that Chaloult \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n<p>Chaloult has posed the question as one under the first prong of <i>Faragher-Ellerth,</i> that is, whether the company acted reasonably. We agree that, depending on the facts, there may be instances in which the employee acted unreasonably, but the employer also did not exercise reasonable care. But that is not the case. Chaloult concedes that IBC did have an acceptable sexual harassment policy and complaint process in place, that the company had trained its employees regarding its policies, and that Chaloult knew of these policies. Chaloult thus concedes that the employer has met the initial aspect of the first prong ¬ó that the employer took reasonable care to avoid sexual harassment. She argues that the employer failed to meet the second aspect ¬ó that the employer failed to take reasonable care to eliminate harassment when it might occur.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Chaloult argues that Anderson's putative knowledge of Chaloult's being harassed in the manner described in the lawsuit must be attributed to IBC, and that given the attributed knowledge, IBC failed to take appropriate corrective actions. It is important to note that there is no claim of any actual knowledge on the part of any IBC personnel who were superior to Francoeur, or anyone superior to Chaloult, other than Francoeur. Nor is there a claim the company routinely ignored harassment complaints or that there were prior complaints against others. Moreover, Chaloult does not claim that the company acted unreasonably in responding to a complaint after she submitted her letter of resignation and put it on notice of Francoeur's comments regarding an alleged sexual relationship between Chaloult and Francoeur.</p>\n<p>Chaloult argues that case law requires imputation to a company of a co-worker's knowledge so long as the co-worker had any obligation to report harassment, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> that the scope of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense is defined, as a matter of law, by the company's own sexual harassment policies. Here, because the company voluntarily required all supervisors to report any harassment, as a matter of law the knowledge of anyone bearing the title of supervisor must be attributed to the company for purposes of the company's obligation to eliminate harassment.</p>\n<p>We disagree with the plaintiff's argument. Given the combination of factors from the events in this case, we think that the company was entitled to summary judgment under <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i> Here, the employer had an appropriate policy, it was widely known and disseminated, it was known to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff failed to use the complaint procedures for the matters at issue. It is also clear, as to the second aspect of the first prong, that as to the one matter reported to the employer by plaintiff's August 4 letter, the company did act reasonably in response. The employer promptly interviewed Chaloult, Francoeur, and Anderson and concluded that Chaloult's account of what Francoeur said to Anderson was inaccurate, but that Francoeur should be punished for using inappropriate language. Further, the complaint Chaloult made in her letter of resignation actually had to do with invasion of personal privacy and reasonably could be viewed as not being about sexual harassment. The employer also reasonably viewed the matter as closed since Chaloult had raised no other issues in her letter or in her meeting with Santos. Thus the employer was fully in compliance with the second aspect of the first prong of <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> as to information of which management had actual notice.</p>\n<p>Nor is there knowledge that should be imputed to the company that would render unreasonable its response under the second aspect of the first <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> prong. Chaloult argues that whatever Anderson knew must be attributed to the company and that what Anderson knew was the full range of behavior that Chaloult complains about in her lawsuit. We outline our reasoning for rejecting Chaloult's proposition that the employer here was on adequate notice and failed to take appropriate steps.</p>\n<p>Chaloult's position is not supported by the case law. Chaloult relies on cases which she characterizes as holding that the unreported knowledge of sexual harassment by any employee bearing the title supervisor, even peers with no authority over the harasser, is sufficient itself to attribute knowledge to the employer. As a general proposition this cannot be consistent with the defense outlined by the Supreme Court, which provides incentives for employers to develop sexual harassment reporting policies and to educate employees about and promote compliance with such procedures in order to avoid vicarious liability.</p>\n<p>Chaloult relies heavily on <i>Dees v. Johnson Controls World Services, Inc.,</i> 168 F.3d 417 (11th Cir.1999), a case which is not at all like this. <i>Dees</i> concerned the adequacy of evidence that the harasser's <i>supervisors</i> had knowledge of the harassment and did nothing. In <i>Dees,</i> there was evidence that superiors of the harasser had actual knowledge of harassment prior to plaintiff's complaint. Specifically, a Human Resources employee told plaintiff that the employer was aware of prior sexual harassment in plaintiff's department, and plaintiff's superior informed her on multiple occasions that he had reported the harassment up the ladder \"because he realized that [plaintiff] could not file a complaint herself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 422-23.</p>\n<p>Chaloult's argument about attribution to the company turns on the fact that Anderson's title was supervisor. In fact, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> that was plaintiff's title as well. Anderson was her co-worker, and they both reported to the alleged harasser. This situation is unlike other cases in which people in management at levels above or at the same level as the harasser either observed directly or were told of the harassment. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Arrieta-Colon v. Wal-Mart P.R., Inc.,</i> 434 F.3d 75, 81-82 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Dees,</i> 168 F.3d at 423; <i>Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc.,</i> 164 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.1999); <i>Distasio v. Perkin Elmer Corp.,</i> 157 F.3d 55, 64 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>This raises the question of whether the company's voluntary adoption of a policy requiring all supervisors, regardless of whether they are co-workers, to report sexual harassment increases the scope of the company's legal liability as a matter of law under Title VII. We think not, although one circuit has adopted such an approach. <i>See </i><i>Clark v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 400 F.3d 341, 350 (6th Cir. 2005).<sup>[8]</sup> Adoption of this view would set a legal standard different from the Supreme Court's reasonableness approach in <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i> It would also discourage and penalize voluntary efforts which go beyond what the law requires. And it would be inconsistent with approaches to voluntary efforts in other areas of Title VII law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Walker v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> 286 F.3d 1270, 1279 (11th Cir.2002) (an employer's deviation from a voluntarily adopted affirmative action policy cannot be used as evidence of pretext); <i>Long v. Runyon,</i> No. 92-6078, 1993 WL 264669, at *3 (6th Cir. July 12, 1993) (same).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if all of Anderson's knowledge were imputed to IBC, this would not make IBC's actions unreasonable, since it is clear that Anderson did not consider himself on notice of harassment. Anderson testified that he did hear several comments by Francoeur which Chaloult attributed to Francoeur, but Anderson believed the comments were not harassing, and so there was no basis to report. As to the most suggestive of the alleged comments, i.e., that Francoeur offered to go and have sex with Chaloult, Anderson says he did not hear them. Chaloult did not testify that Anderson did hear them or that he must, of necessity, have heard them.<sup>[10]</sup> Anderson also testified that had he observed or known of any claims by Chaloult of harassment, he would have reported them up the chain.</p>\n<p>The effect of the acceptance of plaintiff's argument would be to undercut the policy judgment the Supreme Court made in <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i> The defendant met the reasonableness standard. This is not an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> instance in which the employer is trying to utilize its sexual harassment reporting chain to immunize itself from knowledge it actually had of the harassment allegations.<sup>[11]</sup><i>Varner v. Nat'l Super Markets, Inc.,</i> 94 F.3d 1209, 1213-14 (8th Cir.1996). Rather, this is a case where the company was deprived of the opportunity to take remedial action because ¬ó with the exception of the one incident Chaloult reported, which Santos promptly investigated and acted on ¬ó Chaloult did not make allegations of sexual harassment until she filed suit over a year after leaving her job at IBC.</p>\n<p>We affirm the entry of summary judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Three propositions underlie the decision of the majority to affirm summary judgment for IBC: (1) the terms of the sexual harassment policy that IBC chose to adopt should not be applied as written, (2) with the policy cast aside, Chaloult's unreasonable failure to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by IBC's sexual harassment policy (the second element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense) becomes the decisive factor in determining that IBC exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly sexually harassing behavior (the first element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense), and (3) there is no genuine issue of material fact about whether Anderson was aware of the sexual harassment of Chaloult.</p>\n<p>I disagree with each of these propositions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>IBC's sexual harassment policy states without qualification:</p>\n<blockquote>If a supervisor becomes aware of any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident should be reported immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager.... Supervisors have an affirmative duty to keep their work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.</blockquote>\n<p>Although the majority acknowledges that Anderson was a supervisor, it insists that his awareness of sexual harassment could not be attributed to IBC because Chaloult also was a supervisor on the same level as Anderson, and both reported to Francoeur, the alleged harasser. The majority also notes that no one in management at Francoeur's level or above had knowledge of the harassment. Therefore, according to the majority, IBC should be entitled to the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>The majority has added its own gloss to the company's clearly stated policy. As drafted, the policy did not qualify Anderson's obligations under the company's sexual harassment policy simply because he and Chaloult were supervisors at the same employment level. Likewise, as drafted, the policy did not qualify Anderson's obligations because the alleged harasser was the immediate supervisor of both Anderson and Chaloult.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that policy demonstrates that IBC knew how to distinguish between a particular category of supervisor and supervisors generally. The \"Awareness\" section of the company's sexual harassment policy reads in its totality as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> II. Awareness</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. <i>Supervisors</i> must be sensitive to the problem of sexual harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. Employees shall be encouraged to report an incident of sexual harassment to <i>their supervisor.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. If <i>a supervisor</i> becomes aware of any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident should be reported immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>D. <i>Supervisors</i> have an affirmative duty to keep <i>their</i> work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphases added).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this policy, employees experiencing harassment are specifically \"encouraged to report an incident of sexual harassment to <i>their</i> supervisor.\" However, supervisors generally \"must be sensitive to the problems of sexual harassment,\" and must \"report immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager\" any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines. They also \"have an affirmative duty to keep <i>their</i> work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.\"</p>\n<p>Anderson understood that these obligations of a supervisor to deal with sexual harassment applied to him. As the majority points out, Anderson confirmed at his deposition that \"it is his understanding that if supervisors receive a complaint of sexual harassment, they are supposed to report it right away.\" Although Chaloult never said to Anderson \"I am being sexually harassed by Francoeur and I want you to help me,\" she alleges that she did complain to Anderson about Francoeur's conduct and she asserts that Anderson was aware of many of her encounters with Francoeur independently of any complaint by her. Yet the majority insists that Anderson had no legal obligation to do anything ¬ó and the company thus could not be found to have acted unreasonably ¬ó because IBC's policy requires more than Title VII demands. The majority simply ignores as improvident or legally irrelevant IBC's policy choice to imbue all supervisors with the responsibility for reporting and preventing sexual harassment.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Other courts have agreed that a company's stated sexual harassment policy is critical to an evaluation of the question posed by the first element of the affirmative defense ¬ó whether \"the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\" <i>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). In <i>Clark v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 400 F.3d 341 (6th Cir. 2005), the court rejected the employer's argument that, as a matter of law, supervisors who \"were not high enough in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> company hierarchy and had no authority to control [the harasser]\" had no duty to convey their knowledge of harassment to higher management. <i>Id.</i> at 350. The court observed that \"[t]his argument might have merit but for the fact that UPS itself has, through its sexual harassment policy, placed a duty on <i>all</i> supervisors and managers to `report[ ] incidents of sexual harassment to the appropriate management people.'\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original); <i>see also </i><i>Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc.,</i> 164 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.1999).<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority justifies its decision not to enforce IBC's policy as written on the ground that to do so would \"set a legal standard different from the Supreme Court's reasonableness approach in <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i>\" According to the majority, allowing knowledge of sexual harassment by \"any employee bearing the title supervisor\" to be sufficient to attribute knowledge to the employer is inconsistent with the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense, which \"provides incentives for employers to develop sexual harassment reporting policies and to educate employees about and promote compliance with such procedures.\"</p>\n<p>The majority misapprehends Title VII's \"basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275. The animating principle of Title VII is \"not to provide redress [for employment discrimination] but to avoid harm.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 806, 118 S.Ct. 2275. By involving supervisors at all levels in the reporting and prevention of sexual harassment, IBC's sexual harassment policy seeks comprehensively to avoid harm. If the failures of a particular supervisor in the reporting of sexual harassment belie the promise of that comprehensive policy, a court should not forgive the failure of the supervisor by declaring the policy too ambitious.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, I can find no other cases in which an employer prevailed on the first element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense because a court thought its sexual harassment policy imposed a broader reporting obligation than the law required. If the majority believes that IBC's policy states the reporting responsibilities of supervisors too broadly to justify vicarious liability, IBC should rewrite that policy, not the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>I agree with the majority that there may be instances in which there is a relationship between the two prongs of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense. That is, facts relevant to an assessment of the unreasonableness of the employee in not taking advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities afforded by a company's sexual harassment policy may also be relevant to an assessment of the reasonable care taken by an employer to prevent and correct promptly sexual harassment. Some of the cases cited by the majority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> present such scenarios. For example, in <i>Nurse \"BE\" v. Columbia Palms W. Hosp. Ltd. P'ship,</i> 490 F.3d 1302 (11th Cir.2007), an employee explicitly \"requested that [her supervisor] not report the incident [of sexual harassment] and premised the complaint on [the supervisor]'s promise of confidentiality.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1310. Similarly, in <i>Hardage v. CBS Broad., Inc.,</i> 427 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir.2005), the employee told the supervisor with whom he had discussed the allegedly harassing behavior that he wanted to \"handle the situation by himself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1186. In <i>Nurse \"BE\"</i> and <i>Hardage,</i> the employee's conduct ¬ó telling the supervisor not to address the harassment ¬ó appropriately affected the court's inquiry into the reasonableness of the measures taken by the employer. However, those cases are inapplicable here because there the employees took affirmative steps to thwart their supervisors' compliance with the reporting requirements. Here, Chaloult merely failed to act. That is often the case in sexual harassment cases for many different reasons. That failure has no relationship to Anderson's responsibilities as a supervisor if he was aware of the harassing conduct by Francoeur.</p>\n<p>The majority sees it differently. With its disregard of IBC's sexual harassment policy, it seeks to minimize the importance of Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's conduct notwithstanding the obligation to report imposed on him by IBC's policy, and it makes Chaloult's failure to use the complaint procedures of the company the decisive factor in deciding that the company acted reasonably. In effect, the majority double counts Chaloult's failure to report sexual harassment to higher management (once in each element of the affirmative defense). It gives little or no weight at all to Anderson's awareness of Chaloult's encounters with Francoeur. For this approach, the majority cites language from <i>Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,</i> 333 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.2003), where we said that the Supreme Court \"certainly knew [ ] its [<i>Faragher-Ellerth</i>] regime necessarily requires the employee in normal circumstances to make [the effort to report sexually offensive conduct] <i>if the employee wants to impose vicarious liability on the employer and collect damages under Title VII.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 35 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>This statement is merely an explanation of why there is a second element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense that focuses on the reporting responsibilities and conduct of the employee. That statement did not mean, because it could not mean, that the unreasonable failure of the employee to report sexual harassment trumps the failure of the employer to exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly sexual harassment in a case where the employer has knowledge of the sexual harassment independently of any reporting by the employee. It is only because of the majority's insistence that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of Chaloult cannot be imputed to IBC under element one of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense that the majority can rule as a matter of law that IBC prevails on that defense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Near the end of its opinion, the majority qualifies its insistence that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of Chaloult cannot be imputed to IBC. The majority says that \"[e]ven if all of Anderson's knowledge were imputed to IBC, this would not make IBC's actions unreasonable, since it is clear that Anderson did not consider himself on notice of harassment.\" I do not understand how the majority can ascribe such dispositive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> significance to Anderson's alleged insensitivity to sexual harassment. Chaloult describes a number of encounters with Francoeur that Anderson admittedly witnessed. She also describes other encounters which she says Anderson was aware of and he denies it. Those encounters are central to my view that we must vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Chaloult ¬ó as we must ¬ó Anderson was aware of a series of episodes that a jury could view as sexual harassment. Even accepting only what Anderson acknowledges he heard and observed, a jury could still find that he should have reported the conduct to IBC and that his failure to do so is properly imputed to the company. The majority looks at those same encounters and sees grounds for affirming summary judgment.</p>\n<p>It does so by the misapplication of the summary judgment standard. That misapplication includes an inappropriate effort to undermine Chaloult's credibility. The majority notes that Chaloult's contemporaneous diary of Francoeur's comments did not include all of the incidents alleged in the complaint; that she conceded in a deposition that her work deteriorated after she was put on notice that her position could be eliminated; and that she acknowledged her displeasure with her job for reasons unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment. Although these details are fair game for a trial, they have no place in the summary judgment analysis, where we are not permitted to draw negative inferences about Chaloult's credibility. That is a job for the jury at trial.</p>\n<p>Then there is the majority's curious treatment of Chaloult's insistence that Anderson knew of some incidents that he does not acknowledge. For example, Chaloult alleges that Anderson and a few maintenance people were in the area when Francoeur told her that he was going to come to her house to show her what \"fucking was about.\" The obvious import of Chaloult's statement is that Anderson overheard the remark. In response, the majority observes that Anderson says that he did not hear those comments. The majority apparently accepts Anderson's denial. In so doing, the majority distorts the summary judgment standard that requires us to take all facts in the light most favorable to Chaloult.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is the majority's odd treatment of undisputed portions of the summary judgment record. It is undisputed that Anderson heard Francoeur: remark that women who rode motorcycles enjoyed sex from the backside after he learned that Chaloult had recently taken a motorcycle trip; make an inappropriate noise while Chaloult ate an eclair and another supervisor \"asked how far can it go\"; state that he had heard a radio program that discussed \"spread points\" between breasts; and ask other employees to measure their \"spread points.\" With respect to this spread points incident, the majority recounts in detail Anderson's version, including his insistence that he \"read nothing into it because we all had a chuckle about it.\" The majority then says that \"Chaloult has not called this testimony into question,\" without explaining how or why Chaloult has to challenge Anderson's statement that he did not view this particular conduct as sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Anderson's dismissal of such conduct as \"guy talk\" and funny incidences that provoked laughter may only mean that he was a company supervisor who did not understand the nature of sexual harassment. Contrary to the inapt observation of the majority that Chaloult never \"used the term `sexual harassment' in her conversations with Anderson about Francoeur,\" Chaloult had no obligation to explain to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> Anderson the significance of what he was seeing. The testimony about those encounters described by Chaloult should have been heard by a jury charged with determining whether Anderson was placed on notice of sexual harassment, which would then be imputable to IBC under the terms of its own sexual harassment policy. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority to terminate this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record shows that Chaloult was having a dispute with an oven operator named Dobre in late July 2005. Sue Bisson wrote a \"To whom it may concern\" letter, dated August 3, noting two incidents: on July 28, Chaloult told Dobre not to call a mechanic regarding a problem with the oven because he was causing the problem, but it turned out that a mechanic was needed and the mistake was not Dobre's. On July 29, Chaloult told Bisson that Dobre was making another mistake involving machinery, which Bisson informed Chaloult was not Dobre's fault, at which point Chaloult \"proceeded to walk out of the office and leave.\" On July 30 or 31, Chaloult wrote a report stating that Dobre had shoved equipment and made a loud noise as she walked by.\n</p>\n<p>The parties have not argued that the tension between Chaloult and Dobre (and apparently Bisson) is related to her problems with Francoeur, but it does suggest that she was unhappy at work for reasons unrelated to Francoeur in the days before she wrote her letter of resignation on August 4.</p>\n<p>[2]  At his deposition, Francoeur confirmed Santos's account of their meeting and of his statement to Anderson. There is no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>[3]  For summary judgment purposes, we use her testimony at deposition. Her testimony is materially different from some allegations in her unverified complaint. For example, Chaloult testified that Francoeur never asked to see her nipples although that was alleged in the complaint. Chaloult's complaint stated that Francoeur would tell her that \"she looked like she needed to get laid,\" but at deposition she said that it was a female co-worker who made that comment.</p>\n<p>[4]  Francoeur also denied making the statements plaintiff attributes to him as evidence of harassment, including the offer to go home with her, but we take plaintiff's version as true for summary judgment purposes. As to the eclair statement, Francoeur said it was made by another supervisor, Dan Lariviere, and that afterwards he told Lariviere that the statement was inappropriate.</p>\n<p>[5]  Chaloult decided to keep a contemporaneous diary of Francoeur's comments. In that diary, she made no mention of Francoeur's comments about coming over to her house to have sex; no mention of the alleged incident involving dough balls; no mention of Francoeur's gestures about melons, which she took to be about her breasts; nothing about Sue Bisson's comments; and nothing about Francoeur's comment about girls who ride motorcycles.\n</p>\n<p>The diary did include references to Francoeur's complaining about his wife, but nothing about comments regarding his sexual relations with his wife. The diary also did refer to Francoeur's comments about the distance between Chaloult's nipples, chafed nipples, and the eclair incident.</p>\n<p>[6]  When asked whether he knew if Lariviere had been disciplined for his comment, Anderson stated that was \"none of [his] business... as far as an entry-level supervisor. Only upper management would know if something like that happened.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Clearly Chaloult's behavior in not complaining was not reasonable. There is absolutely no evidence of Chaloult's having \"more than ordinary fear or embarrassment,\" as <i>Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.,</i> 333 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2003), requires. To the contrary, Chaloult was a supervisor herself who had worked for the company for over five years.\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Reed,</i> this circuit held that a jury question was presented on the second prong regarding whether it was unreasonable for a seventeen-year-old plaintiff to fail to complain about her supervisor's sexual assault when the supervisor was twice her age and told her that they would both be fired if she reported and that his father was good friends with the company's owner. <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>[8]  The case <i>Clark</i> cites in support of this proposition, <i>Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc.,</i> 164 F.3d 1361 (11th Cir.1999), says no such thing. The language from <i>Coates,</i> that a company \"itself answered the question of when it would be deemed to have notice of the harassment,\" was used in the context of whether an employee had sufficiently reported harassment to the company, not whether the company was liable for a co-worker supervisor's knowledge. <i>Id.</i> at 1364.</p>\n<p>[9]  This does not mean that Anderson had no duty to report harassment under IBC's policy. But the existence of any such duty does not, as a matter of law, automatically impute to IBC all of Anderson's knowledge for the purpose of determining the reasonableness of IBC's actions under <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  In an affidavit accompanying her opposition to summary judgment, Chaloult added new information: that after Francoeur made the offer to go to her house and have sex with her, Anderson \"said that Mr. Francoeur's behavior was getting worse, and, it would get him into trouble at some point.\" Since this statement is inconsistent with Chaloult's deposition testimony, we disregard it. <i>Torrech-Hern√°ndez v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 519 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Abreu-Guzman v. Ford,</i> 241 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>[11]  This is also not a case where the employer was aware of prior instances of Francoeur's harassment through complaints made by other people. There is no indication that any complaints were made about Francoeur by anyone else at any time.</p>\n<p>[12]  In footnote 9 of its opinion, the majority states that it is not saying that Anderson had no duty to report harassment under IBC's policy. Rather, the majority insists that Anderson had no duty to report Francoeur's harassment of Chaloult under the circumstances of this case. Those circumstances include two indefensible legal propositions put forth by the majority. First, as explained above, the majority says that Anderson's status as a supervisor under the IBC policy does not matter here because Chaloult was a supervisor at the same level as Anderson and because the harasser, Francoeur, was the supervisor for both of them. Second, as I explain more fully in Parts II and III of the dissent, the majority says that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of Chaloult did not constitute awareness of sexual harassment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>[13]  In <i>Coates,</i> the court held that when an employer's sexual harassment policy designates the people responsible for reporting misconduct, the company \"itself answered the question of when it would be deemed to have notice of the harassment sufficient to obligate it or its agents to take prompt and appropriate remedial measures.\" 164 F.3d at 1364. The majority correctly notes that the court in <i>Coates</i> was considering whether an employee had sufficiently reported harassment to the company and did not address the issue of whether a company was liable for a co-worker supervisor's knowledge. Even with this factual distinction, the central point remains the same ¬ó a company's own harassment policy answers the question of who within the company is responsible for reporting and responding to known incidences of harassment.</p>\n\n</div>",

This case turns on the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>The question here concerns the employer's affirmative defense that it is not vicariously liable because on summary judgment it has established that (i) the employee's own actions were not reasonable (here plaintiff did not herself complain to management); (ii) the employer had reasonably set up and educated employees on appropriate procedures for handling sexual harassment allegations; (iii) the employer did reasonably investigate the original allegation plaintiff made to management at the time of her resignation; (iv) no one at a managerial level equal to or superior to the harasser had notice of the different allegations of harassment made in the lawsuit; and (v) the co-worker who had some notice of some of the different allegations did not consider the conduct he knew of to be harassment and did not call it to the attention of management.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff-employee argued that as a matter of law the knowledge of a co-worker with the title of supervisor, who was in fact a peer of the plaintiff's and who also reported to the harasser, was attributed to the employer under the company's policy and that defeats the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense. The district court rejected the plaintiff's argument.</p>\n<p>Conducting our independent review of the record, we find the employer made out its <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense to vicarious liability. We affirm the entry of summary judgment for the employer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We describe the facts, drawing all inferences in the plaintiff's favor, as we must do in summary judgment. <i>Mellen v.

In July 2004, when an entry-level bread supervisor position opened up, Chaloult applied for and received it, and she began working as a bread supervisor in September 2004. When she first started working as a supervisor, she was in production, then she was moved to wrapping, and then back to production. When she was moved back to production in February 2005, her immediate supervisor became Kevin Francoeur, who was the assistant production manager. At that time, Chaloult's shift was the night shift, from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.</p>\n<p>On June 8, 2005, Chaloult and other supervisors attended a \"WARN meeting,\" under the Worker Adjustment Rehearing Notification Act, at which they were put on notice that their positions could potentially be eliminated in sixty days. This was occasioned by the company's going into bankruptcy. Chaloult understood that this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> could mean she was out of a job as of August 12, 2005. Chaloult conceded at deposition that her attendance at work \"deteriorated\" after this meeting, and other evidence supports this.</p>\n<p>At no time prior to her resignation did Chaloult complain about sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>After an incident with a co-worker,<sup>[1]</sup> on August 4, 2005, Chaloult submitted a letter of resignation. Chaloult was pregnant when she left IBC in August 2005, and was not re-employed until June 30, 2006. The letter of resignation stated, verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote>I respectfully request to give forth my two week notice, in accordance with the companies involuntary leave slip, my last date of work will be 8/19/05.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I would like to take the time to thank you, (Paul) and IBC for the experience I now have under management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>However, when I filled out my application for employment with IBC, it never stated that at any time would my supervisors above me, have the right to question my personal affairs and demand information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This I learned from yet another supervisor being accused of fore-play.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Is this company Policy? I tried to change shifts, told I had day hours for 6-strap production then I was denied. I no longer feel comfortable working for this supervisor.</blockquote>\n<p>The letter did not directly accuse her supervisor of harassing her, but of questioning her personal affairs with another supervisor, a situation she learned about from the supervisor who, she said, was accused of having a sexual relationship with her. The letter did state she no longer felt comfortable working for her own supervisor.</p>\n<p>Chaloult put her letter into the mailbox of her department manager, Paul Santos. Santos met with her the first day he was back at work after receiving the letter. Before meeting with Chaloult, Santos discussed her letter with Joseph Cabral, Assistant Human Resources Manager, and gave a copy of the letter to Human Resources so they could put it on file. Cabral and Santos decided that Santos should ask her what the letter meant, since they did not know to what she was referring.</p>\n<p>At the meeting, Chaloult said she was referring to an incident that had taken place on July 15, in which Francoeur had approached a co-worker, Jim Anderson, and demanded to know whether Anderson and Chaloult were having sexual relations. Chaloult, who had a fianc√© at the time, had not been present during this conversation and said that Anderson had told her about it the following morning.</p>\n<p>When asked why she did not come forward sooner, she told Santos that she was worried about issues \"coming back at me.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> She did not say to Santos that there had been any other incidents of concern involving Francoeur. At deposition she admitted there was nothing that prevented her from reporting other instances to the company.</p>\n<p>Santos told her that he would follow up with both Anderson and Francoeur and report the incident to Human Resources. Santos did what he promised. Immediately after his meeting with Chaloult, Santos called Cabral and briefed him. Santos then called Francoeur into his office; they met for about half an hour. He told Francoeur what Chaloult had said. Francoeur said that was not what happened. Francoeur explained his version of what happened to Santos as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[H]e explained to me that he had been calling for both [Anderson and Chaloult], he had tried calling for her, tried calling for him on the radio, neither one of them were responding on the radio. He was walking from the six strap makeup area going towards the wrap office. He had passed Bonnie in transit or she was going ¬ó he noticed her going one way towards makeup, and he was going towards wrapping. He walked into the wrap office and said, Jim, what, are you and Bonnie fucking with me, screwing with me? And he said that Jim started laughing. He was like, no, we didn't hear the calls on the radio. And that's pretty much it.</blockquote>\n<p>Santos made Francoeur write down his version of events. The document was submitted into evidence and is consistent with Santos's description of the meeting.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Santos then met with Anderson. Anderson told Santos:</p>\n<blockquote>[Francoeur] just came in and was like, what, are you and Bonnie trying to fuck me? I was like, okay. I go, what else was said? He was like, nothing. We just laughed and he wanted some numbers, and I went out on the floor and that was it. He says he was trying to call us. I didn't hear him. Maybe our radios were down, and that was it.</blockquote>\n<p>During the interview Santos also asked Anderson what he said to Chaloult. Santos described his conversation with Anderson as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[I asked] what did Kevin say to you? What do you recall Kevin saying to you? He said, he just came in and he was like, what, are you and Bonnie trying to fuck me? I was like, okay. I go, what else was said? He was like, nothing. We just laughed and he wanted some numbers, and I went out on the floor and that was it. He says he was trying to call us. I didn't hear him. Maybe our radios were down, and that was it. I go, so he didn't come in and ask if you guys were fucking? He said, no. No, he just came in and he wanted to know if we were fucking with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I said, Bonnie is saying that you went to her and told her that Kevin asked you if you and her were having sex. He was like, oh, I don't remember what I told her. I go, well, you just told me that he came in and asked if you two guys were fucking with him and then you turn around and went to Bonnie and told Bonnie that Kevin asked if you and her were fucking. I go, so which one is it? He was like, no, he just came in and he said if we were fucking him. I was like, so then why did you go to Bonnie and tell her something different? And he made a comment about, oh, Bonnie and I were just laughing about it, we were joking about it, and that was it. I was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> like, well, it's not a joking matter because this is where we're at right now.</blockquote>\n<p>When he received Francoeur's statement, Santos discussed the matter with Cabral. They concluded that what Francoeur had said to Anderson was \"are you guys fucking with me?\" As a result, Francoeur was given a letter, dated September 1, 2005, warning about the use of inappropriate language (\"fuck\") and language which could be taken out of context in the workplace. The letter stated: \"While our investigation to date shows that the broad allegations made by the employee may not be 100% confirmed, it is clear that, based on your admission, that your comment was inappropriate and unwarranted.\" It also made clear that \"[a] manager must never discriminate, harass, or retaliate against any employee. If a Manager knowingly condones discrimination, harassment, or retaliation by another, the Manager will be considered to have personally engaged in the conduct.\"</p>\n<p>After Chaloult gave her two week's notice on August 4, she worked only a few more days and did not show up to work after August 8. As a result, IBC did not have the opportunity to conduct its usual exit interview. On November 11, Chaloult met, at his request, with Joseph Cabral; no specific information is provided about this meeting, and there is no evidence that Chaloult told Cabral the allegations she later made. Chaloult also filed an exit comment form, dated November 11, 2005, in which she made the comment: \"Sexual harassment from upper management for an ongoing period with other people ... involved.\" Santos stated that he did not see this exit comment form. He said he first became aware of Chaloult's other allegations after she filed suit.</p>\n<p>On October 10, 2006, more than a year after she left her employment, Chaloult filed suit in federal district court against IBC, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000(e), and the Maine Human Rights Act. She sought general, non-economic, and punitive damages. Chaloult alleged that she was sexually harassed by her superior, Francoeur, from February 5, 2005, when she first reported to Francoeur, to August 2005, when she left the company. For the first time she related a number of very specific complaints about other statements.</p>\n<p>Chaloult's testimony at deposition included the following specific allegations, which she had not mentioned to Santos or in her November 11, 2005 exit comment form.<sup>[3]</sup> One claim of harassment is that Francoeur frequently complained about his wife and his lack of sexual relations with her. At deposition, Chaloult said Francoeur made these comments openly to supervisors and also said he wished he could murder his wife. Chaloult did not report the comments to anyone.</p>\n<p>Further, there were comments about breasts. On several occasions when they were outside on break during the winter, Francoeur asked Chaloult about the distance between her nipples and told her to go home and measure this distance. He also at one point asked if her nipples chafed or stood out like headlights. She walked away and shook her head but did not report the comments to anyone. At <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> some point Chaloult walked into an office where Francoeur was in conversation with another worker named Steve Leclair and, without using her name but looking right at her, Francoeur indicated that Chaloult's breasts were \"melons. Big hooters.\" Chaloult did not report this incident and stated that nothing prevented her from doing so.</p>\n<p>Once, when they were alone in his office Francoeur asked Chaloult to hold her breath and push her chest out. She did not understand why he made the comment. She shook her head and walked off, saying nothing to Francoeur and not reporting the incident. She said she did not report it because she did not \"want any retaliation coming back.\"</p>\n<p>She said statements about her relationship with her boyfriend were harassing. Chaloult had broken up with her boyfriend in January of 2005. She got back together with him in April and they became engaged in May 2005. Francoeur made comments to her to the effect she should not get back together with her boyfriend. The more serious allegation is that toward the end of spring, Francoeur offered to come over to her house and have sex with her; specifically that \"he'd come to my house and show me what fucking was about.\" Chaloult said that Anderson and a few maintenance people were in the area at the time Francoeur made this comment. Chaloult walked away, spurning the offer. Chaloult did not report the incident.</p>\n<p>Another time, Chaloult joined Francoeur and Anderson on a patio for a smoke. Chaloult and Anderson were discussing a motorcycle trip that Chaloult had made with her boyfriend. Francoeur made the statement, \"well, girls who ride motorcycles normally like it from the back side, huh? Is that true, Bonnie[?]\" Chaloult turned and walked off, and shook her head. She did not report Francoeur for that statement; nothing kept her from reporting it.</p>\n<p>In another instance, Chaloult, another supervisor named Dan Lariviere, and Francoeur were sitting in an office and Lariviere was eating an eclair. Francoeur said he wanted to see how far Chaloult could stick the eclair down her throat. Lariviere said he would also like to see that. Then Francoeur said \"[i]f there isn't enough cream in there, ... I have plenty.\" Chaloult said nothing to either of them or to anyone in management above Francoeur about this.<sup>[4]</sup> She \"may have\" told Anderson about the incident.</p>\n<p>At some time in May, Chaloult had picked up a piece of dough off the machinery, and Francoeur made a comment to her that \"if the dough ball wasn't enough for me to play with, he had some balls that I could play with.\" Chaloult stated that a production employee named Amy Ramsell was present when Francoeur made this comment, but she is not sure whether Ramsell heard it. Chaloult walked off and did not report the incident; she stated that nothing prevented her from reporting it.</p>\n<p>In another instance, Chaloult was apparently in a bit of a frenzy in the presence of other workers over having misplaced her key card to get into the building. A female employee in the office, Sue Bisson, said \"it looks like somebody needs to get laid. Kevin [Francoeur] turns around and goes yeah, I guess so. Because I was apparently a little too hyper.\" Chaloult <span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> did not complain to either of them or report them and nothing prevented her from doing so.</p>\n<p>Finally, on July 15, as discussed above, Francoeur allegedly walked into an office where Anderson was doing some paperwork and yelled at him, \"so how long have you and Bonnie been fucking?\"</p>\n<p>There were no objectionable statements by Francoeur between July 15 and Chaloult's letter of resignation on August 4.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>IBC had in place anti-sexual-harassment policies which included methods for reporting harassment. The company's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Interstate strictly prohibits sexual harassment.... Examples of the prohibited conduct include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and gender slurs or other offensive, derogatory, or demeaning comments, jokes, graffiti, or other verbal or physical conduct and written or taped materials relating to gender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>Any person who believes that the person has been subjected to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation or who knows of possible discrimination, harassment, or retaliation against anyone else should immediately report it to supervision or to Richard W. Morgano, [phone number redacted] or to Rhonda Tracy, [phone number redacted]. Do not wait until a situation is severe or pervasive; report any possible discrimination or harassment or retaliation as soon as you know of it.</i></blockquote>\n<p>Chaloult signed an updated version of this policy on September 16, 2003, indicating that \"I ... have read and understand IBC's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and have participated in <i>`In this Together</i>' Harassment Training.\"</p>\n<p>Chaloult had also signed, when she first began working for the company on June 10, 1999, the company's Sexual Harassment Policy, which included the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote>II. Awareness</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Supervisors must be sensitive to the problem of sexual harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. Employees shall be encouraged to report an incident of sexual harassment to their supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. If a supervisor becomes aware of any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident should be reported immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>D. Supervisors have an affirmative duty to keep their work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.</blockquote>\n<p>Chaloult was also aware that IBC had a confidential toll-free complaint line for employees.</p>\n<p>Chaloult admittedly did not at any time before submitting her letter of resignation make any complaint about Francoeur to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> the Human Resources manager, the plant manager, or to any other person who was superior or equal to Francoeur's level at the company.</p>\n<p>When asked at deposition why she did not come forward sooner with her complaints, Chaloult responded, \"I had talked with Jim Anderson, and Jim Anderson knew about these comments.\" When asked whether she had asked Anderson to report her concerns to management, Chaloult stated that she had not. She asserted that Anderson was present at the time of Francoeur's comment about measuring the distance between nipples, when Francoeur made the comment about girls who ride motorcycles, and when Francoeur told Chaloult that he wanted to come over to her house and have sex with her, and that he told her about Francoeur's comment suggesting that Chaloult and Anderson were having a sexual relationship on July 15.</p>\n<p>Chaloult and Anderson were peers; they, along with one other person, were entry-level supervisors on the overnight shift in the bread department; Francoeur, as the assistant bread production manager in charge of the overnight shift, was their direct supervisor. There were also three other entry-level supervisors in the bread department who worked during a second shift.</p>\n<p>At deposition, Anderson confirmed that it is his understanding that if supervisors receive a complaint of sexual harassment, they are supposed to report it right away. However, when asked whether he was ever aware of behavior which could have violated the company's sexual harassment policy, he said that he was not. When asked whether anyone had ever complained to him about conduct that could have been construed as sexual harassment, Anderson said no.</p>\n<p>Anderson further testified that he was never present when anyone objected to something that Francoeur said, nor did he ever get the impression that something Francoeur said upset someone. Anderson testified that the group of supervisors of whom he and Chaloult were part got along \"pretty good. I mean, we were loosey goosey. We joked around with each other.\"</p>\n<p>As to Chaloult's specific allegations of harassment, Anderson said that one day Francoeur said to other workers during a smoke break that he had heard people on a radio program referring to the distance between nipples as \"spread points,\" and \"we all got a laugh out of it.\" Anderson said that Francoeur asked a group of people, not just Chaloult, to measure their \"spread points.\" More specifically, \"[h]e made a general statement for all of us to go home and do it.... I didn't think nothing of it at the time. I didn't think there was nothing wrong because we all just laughed about it and we left the office.\" When asked whether he thought that Francoeur violated the company's sexual harassment policy when he made comments about \"spread points\" to a group of people that included women, Anderson stated, \"I didn't read nothing into it because we all had a chuckle about it. So, I mean, I don't think any of us read anything into it because we all laughed and went on....\" Chaloult has not called this testimony into question.</p>\n<p>Anderson had a different recollection of the incident involving an eclair. He stated that one day he, Francoeur, Chaloult, and Lariviere were eating a box of eclairs they had brought back from the shipping dock, something that they did fairly often. On this particular occasion: \"Bonnie would take a bite of one and Kevin [Francoeur] made a noise out of his mouth. Then Dan had said, like, how far can it go. And we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> all laughed, and that was the end of that. We finished eating, and we all went back out on the floor.\" Anderson testified that of all the times when they ate eclairs, this was the only occasion when a comment was made about someone putting an eclair in their mouth. He did not consider this to be sexual harassment.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Anderson also testified that Francoeur once in a while talked about his own nipples being chafed or irritated. One time, when Chaloult as well as others, both male and female, were present, Francoeur asked if other people had hard nipples. Anderson said that he heard Francoeur talk about the breasts of female employees \"once or twice,\" but never about Chaloult's in particular, and never in her presence. When asked why he did not report to management Francoeur's comments about breasts, Anderson replied that Francoeur \"was talking to me ¬ó I mean, at that point I felt it was a guy to guy talk. I mean, you just talk; and I didn't really think nothing of it. I mean, it was just me and him in the office or outside.\" Again, Anderson did not consider this to be harassment. Chaloult has not rebutted this testimony.</p>\n<p>With respect to the incident Chaloult referred to in her letter of resignation, Anderson testified that Francoeur did not ask him whether he and Chaloult were having sexual relations. Rather, Francoeur came into the office where Anderson was sitting and asked whether Anderson and Chaloult were \"f[ ]ing with him\" by not answering their radios because Francoeur had unsuccessfully been trying to get a hold of them. Anderson said that he told Chaloult about the episode a few days later: \"[I]t got worked into the conversation.... I was telling her, Kevin came in the office and he was pretty mad that we weren't answering our radios and he asked if we were F-ing, if we were F-ing with him and stuff like that.\" Chaloult also has not called this testimony into question.</p>\n<p>Anderson testified that Chaloult never asked him to do anything with, or about, Francoeur's comments. There is no testimony from Chaloult that she ever used the term \"sexual harassment\" in her conversations with Anderson about Francoeur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that an employer is strictly liable for a hostile environment created by a supervisor when the employer neither knew nor reasonably could have known of the alleged misconduct. <i>Meritor Sav.

For example, if the company has not provided information about a complaint procedure, that may affect whether the employee's failure to use the procedure is reasonable, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*74</span> vice versa. Reasonable effort is required on both sides. As we said in <i>Reed v.

The district court found that Chaloult had waived any challenge to the company's claim that she had not acted reasonably by failing to report the harassment. We take it as true<sup>[7]</sup> then that Chaloult \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2275</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Chaloult has posed the question as one under the first prong of <i>Faragher-Ellerth,</i> that is, whether the company acted reasonably. We agree that, depending on the facts, there may be instances in which the employee acted unreasonably, but the employer also did not exercise reasonable care. But that is not the case. Chaloult concedes that IBC did have an acceptable sexual harassment policy and complaint process in place, that the company had trained its employees regarding its policies, and that Chaloult knew of these policies. Chaloult thus concedes that the employer has met the initial aspect of the first prong ¬ó that the employer took reasonable care to avoid sexual harassment. She argues that the employer failed to meet the second aspect ¬ó that the employer failed to take reasonable care to eliminate harassment when it might occur.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Chaloult argues that Anderson's putative knowledge of Chaloult's being harassed in the manner described in the lawsuit must be attributed to IBC, and that given the attributed knowledge, IBC failed to take appropriate corrective actions. It is important to note that there is no claim of any actual knowledge on the part of any IBC personnel who were superior to Francoeur, or anyone superior to Chaloult, other than Francoeur. Nor is there a claim the company routinely ignored harassment complaints or that there were prior complaints against others. Moreover, Chaloult does not claim that the company acted unreasonably in responding to a complaint after she submitted her letter of resignation and put it on notice of Francoeur's comments regarding an alleged sexual relationship between Chaloult and Francoeur.</p>\n<p>Chaloult argues that case law requires imputation to a company of a co-worker's knowledge so long as the co-worker had any obligation to report harassment, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*75</span> that the scope of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> defense is defined, as a matter of law, by the company's own sexual harassment policies. Here, because the company voluntarily required all supervisors to report any harassment, as a matter of law the knowledge of anyone bearing the title of supervisor must be attributed to the company for purposes of the company's obligation to eliminate harassment.</p>\n<p>We disagree with the plaintiff's argument. Given the combination of factors from the events in this case, we think that the company was entitled to summary judgment under <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i> Here, the employer had an appropriate policy, it was widely known and disseminated, it was known to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff failed to use the complaint procedures for the matters at issue. It is also clear, as to the second aspect of the first prong, that as to the one matter reported to the employer by plaintiff's August 4 letter, the company did act reasonably in response. The employer promptly interviewed Chaloult, Francoeur, and Anderson and concluded that Chaloult's account of what Francoeur said to Anderson was inaccurate, but that Francoeur should be punished for using inappropriate language. Further, the complaint Chaloult made in her letter of resignation actually had to do with invasion of personal privacy and reasonably could be viewed as not being about sexual harassment. The employer also reasonably viewed the matter as closed since Chaloult had raised no other issues in her letter or in her meeting with Santos. Thus the employer was fully in compliance with the second aspect of the first prong of <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> as to information of which management had actual notice.</p>\n<p>Nor is there knowledge that should be imputed to the company that would render unreasonable its response under the second aspect of the first <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> prong. Chaloult argues that whatever Anderson knew must be attributed to the company and that what Anderson knew was the full range of behavior that Chaloult complains about in her lawsuit. We outline our reasoning for rejecting Chaloult's proposition that the employer here was on adequate notice and failed to take appropriate steps.</p>\n<p>Chaloult's position is not supported by the case law. Chaloult relies on cases which she characterizes as holding that the unreported knowledge of sexual harassment by any employee bearing the title supervisor, even peers with no authority over the harasser, is sufficient itself to attribute knowledge to the employer. As a general proposition this cannot be consistent with the defense outlined by the Supreme Court, which provides incentives for employers to develop sexual harassment reporting policies and to educate employees about and promote compliance with such procedures in order to avoid vicarious liability.</p>\n<p>Chaloult relies heavily on <i>Dees v. Johnson Controls World Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761824\"><a href=\"/opinion/761824/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1446-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45771-12-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1999), a case which is not at all like this. <i>Dees</i> concerned the adequacy of evidence that the harasser's <i>supervisors</i> had knowledge of the harassment and did nothing. In <i>Dees,</i> there was evidence that superiors of the harasser had actual knowledge of harassment prior to plaintiff's complaint. Specifically, a Human Resources employee told plaintiff that the employer was aware of prior sexual harassment in plaintiff's department, and plaintiff's superior informed her on multiple occasions that he had reported the harassment up the ladder \"because he realized that [plaintiff] could not file a complaint herself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 422-23.</p>\n<p>Chaloult's argument about attribution to the company turns on the fact that Anderson's title was supervisor. In fact, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*76</span> that was plaintiff's title as well. Anderson was her co-worker, and they both reported to the alleged harasser. This situation is unlike other cases in which people in management at levels above or at the same level as the harasser either observed directly or were told of the harassment. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Arrieta-Colon v.

We think not, although one circuit has adopted such an approach. <i>See </i><i>Clark v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789468\"><a href=\"/opinion/789468/sandra-m-clark-rhonda-r-knoop-v-united-parcel-service-inc-eli-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 350 (6th Cir. 2005).<sup>[8]</sup> Adoption of this view would set a legal standard different from the Supreme Court's reasonableness approach in <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i> It would also discourage and penalize voluntary efforts which go beyond what the law requires. And it would be inconsistent with approaches to voluntary efforts in other areas of Title VII law. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Walker v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75763\"><a href=\"/opinion/75763/walker-v-prudential-property/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></a></span>, 1279 (11th Cir.2002) (an employer's deviation from a voluntarily adopted affirmative action policy cannot be used as evidence of pretext); <i>Long v.

Anderson testified that he did hear several comments by Francoeur which Chaloult attributed to Francoeur, but Anderson believed the comments were not harassing, and so there was no basis to report. As to the most suggestive of the alleged comments, i.e., that Francoeur offered to go and have sex with Chaloult, Anderson says he did not hear them. Chaloult did not testify that Anderson did hear them or that he must, of necessity, have heard them.<sup>[10]</sup> Anderson also testified that had he observed or known of any claims by Chaloult of harassment, he would have reported them up the chain.</p>\n<p>The effect of the acceptance of plaintiff's argument would be to undercut the policy judgment the Supreme Court made in <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i> The defendant met the reasonableness standard. This is not an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> instance in which the employer is trying to utilize its sexual harassment reporting chain to immunize itself from knowledge it actually had of the harassment allegations.<sup>[11]</sup><i>Varner v.

Rather, this is a case where the company was deprived of the opportunity to take remedial action because ¬ó with the exception of the one incident Chaloult reported, which Santos promptly investigated and acted on ¬ó Chaloult did not make allegations of sexual harassment until she filed suit over a year after leaving her job at IBC.</p>\n<p>We affirm the entry of summary judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Three propositions underlie the decision of the majority to affirm summary judgment for IBC: (1) the terms of the sexual harassment policy that IBC chose to adopt should not be applied as written, (2) with the policy cast aside, Chaloult's unreasonable failure to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by IBC's sexual harassment policy (the second element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense) becomes the decisive factor in determining that IBC exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly sexually harassing behavior (the first element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense), and (3) there is no genuine issue of material fact about whether Anderson was aware of the sexual harassment of Chaloult.</p>\n<p>I disagree with each of these propositions. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>IBC's sexual harassment policy states without qualification:</p>\n<blockquote>If a supervisor becomes aware of any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident should be reported immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager.... Supervisors have an affirmative duty to keep their work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.</blockquote>\n<p>Although the majority acknowledges that Anderson was a supervisor, it insists that his awareness of sexual harassment could not be attributed to IBC because Chaloult also was a supervisor on the same level as Anderson, and both reported to Francoeur, the alleged harasser. The majority also notes that no one in management at Francoeur's level or above had knowledge of the harassment. Therefore, according to the majority, IBC should be entitled to the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p>The majority has added its own gloss to the company's clearly stated policy. As drafted, the policy did not qualify Anderson's obligations under the company's sexual harassment policy simply because he and Chaloult were supervisors at the same employment level. Likewise, as drafted, the policy did not qualify Anderson's obligations because the alleged harasser was the immediate supervisor of both Anderson and Chaloult.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that policy demonstrates that IBC knew how to distinguish between a particular category of supervisor and supervisors generally. The \"Awareness\" section of the company's sexual harassment policy reads in its totality as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> II. Awareness</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. <i>Supervisors</i> must be sensitive to the problem of sexual harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B. Employees shall be encouraged to report an incident of sexual harassment to <i>their supervisor.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>C. If <i>a supervisor</i> becomes aware of any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines, the incident should be reported immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>D. <i>Supervisors</i> have an affirmative duty to keep <i>their</i> work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.</blockquote>\n<p>(emphases added).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this policy, employees experiencing harassment are specifically \"encouraged to report an incident of sexual harassment to <i>their</i> supervisor.\" However, supervisors generally \"must be sensitive to the problems of sexual harassment,\" and must \"report immediately to the human resources manager or plant general manager\" any violation or possible violation of the EEOC guidelines. They also \"have an affirmative duty to keep <i>their</i> work area free from sexual harassment of any kind and shall take appropriate steps to prevent and eliminate such harassment.\"</p>\n<p>Anderson understood that these obligations of a supervisor to deal with sexual harassment applied to him. As the majority points out, Anderson confirmed at his deposition that \"it is his understanding that if supervisors receive a complaint of sexual harassment, they are supposed to report it right away.\" Although Chaloult never said to Anderson \"I am being sexually harassed by Francoeur and I want you to help me,\" she alleges that she did complain to Anderson about Francoeur's conduct and she asserts that Anderson was aware of many of her encounters with Francoeur independently of any complaint by her. Yet the majority insists that Anderson had no legal obligation to do anything ¬ó and the company thus could not be found to have acted unreasonably ¬ó because IBC's policy requires more than Title VII demands. The majority simply ignores as improvident or legally irrelevant IBC's policy choice to imbue all supervisors with the responsibility for reporting and preventing sexual harassment.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Other courts have agreed that a company's stated sexual harassment policy is critical to an evaluation of the question posed by the first element of the affirmative defense ¬ó whether \"the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\" <i>Faragher v.

The court observed that \"[t]his argument might have merit but for the fact that UPS itself has, through its sexual harassment policy, placed a duty on <i>all</i> supervisors and managers to `report[ ] incidents of sexual harassment to the appropriate management people.'\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original); <i>see also </i><i>Coates v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2275</span></a></span>. By involving supervisors at all levels in the reporting and prevention of sexual harassment, IBC's sexual harassment policy seeks comprehensively to avoid harm. If the failures of a particular supervisor in the reporting of sexual harassment belie the promise of that comprehensive policy, a court should not forgive the failure of the supervisor by declaring the policy too ambitious.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, I can find no other cases in which an employer prevailed on the first element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense because a court thought its sexual harassment policy imposed a broader reporting obligation than the law required. If the majority believes that IBC's policy states the reporting responsibilities of supervisors too broadly to justify vicarious liability, IBC should rewrite that policy, not the court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>I agree with the majority that there may be instances in which there is a relationship between the two prongs of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense. That is, facts relevant to an assessment of the unreasonableness of the employee in not taking advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities afforded by a company's sexual harassment policy may also be relevant to an assessment of the reasonable care taken by an employer to prevent and correct promptly sexual harassment. Some of the cases cited by the majority <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> present such scenarios. For example, in <i>Nurse \"BE\" v. Columbia Palms W. Hosp. Ltd. P'ship,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77756\"><a href=\"/opinion/77756/nurse-be-v-michael-chaparro-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span> (11th Cir.2007), an employee explicitly \"requested that [her supervisor] not report the incident [of sexual harassment] and premised the complaint on [the supervisor]'s promise of confidentiality.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1310. Similarly, in <i>Hardage v. CBS Broad., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792345\"><a href=\"/opinion/792345/hugh-hardage-v-cbs-broadcasting-inc-a-new-york-corporation-viacom/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2005), the employee told the supervisor with whom he had discussed the allegedly harassing behavior that he wanted to \"handle the situation by himself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1186. In <i>Nurse \"BE\"</i> and <i>Hardage,</i> the employee's conduct ¬ó telling the supervisor not to address the harassment ¬ó appropriately affected the court's inquiry into the reasonableness of the measures taken by the employer. However, those cases are inapplicable here because there the employees took affirmative steps to thwart their supervisors' compliance with the reporting requirements. Here, Chaloult merely failed to act. That is often the case in sexual harassment cases for many different reasons. That failure has no relationship to Anderson's responsibilities as a supervisor if he was aware of the harassing conduct by Francoeur.</p>\n<p>The majority sees it differently. With its disregard of IBC's sexual harassment policy, it seeks to minimize the importance of Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's conduct notwithstanding the obligation to report imposed on him by IBC's policy, and it makes Chaloult's failure to use the complaint procedures of the company the decisive factor in deciding that the company acted reasonably. In effect, the majority double counts Chaloult's failure to report sexual harassment to higher management (once in each element of the affirmative defense). It gives little or no weight at all to Anderson's awareness of Chaloult's encounters with Francoeur. For this approach, the majority cites language from <i>Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span> (1st Cir.2003), where we said that the Supreme Court \"certainly knew [ ] its [<i>Faragher-Ellerth</i>] regime necessarily requires the employee in normal circumstances to make [the effort to report sexually offensive conduct] <i>if the employee wants to impose vicarious liability on the employer and collect damages under Title VII.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 35 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>This statement is merely an explanation of why there is a second element of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense that focuses on the reporting responsibilities and conduct of the employee. That statement did not mean, because it could not mean, that the unreasonable failure of the employee to report sexual harassment trumps the failure of the employer to exercise reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly sexual harassment in a case where the employer has knowledge of the sexual harassment independently of any reporting by the employee. It is only because of the majority's insistence that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of Chaloult cannot be imputed to IBC under element one of the <i>Faragher-Ellerth</i> affirmative defense that the majority can rule as a matter of law that IBC prevails on that defense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Near the end of its opinion, the majority qualifies its insistence that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of Chaloult cannot be imputed to IBC. The majority says that \"[e]ven if all of Anderson's knowledge were imputed to IBC, this would not make IBC's actions unreasonable, since it is clear that Anderson did not consider himself on notice of harassment.\" I do not understand how the majority can ascribe such dispositive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> significance to Anderson's alleged insensitivity to sexual harassment. Chaloult describes a number of encounters with Francoeur that Anderson admittedly witnessed. She also describes other encounters which she says Anderson was aware of and he denies it. Those encounters are central to my view that we must vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Chaloult ¬ó as we must ¬ó Anderson was aware of a series of episodes that a jury could view as sexual harassment. Even accepting only what Anderson acknowledges he heard and observed, a jury could still find that he should have reported the conduct to IBC and that his failure to do so is properly imputed to the company. The majority looks at those same encounters and sees grounds for affirming summary judgment.</p>\n<p>It does so by the misapplication of the summary judgment standard. That misapplication includes an inappropriate effort to undermine Chaloult's credibility. The majority notes that Chaloult's contemporaneous diary of Francoeur's comments did not include all of the incidents alleged in the complaint; that she conceded in a deposition that her work deteriorated after she was put on notice that her position could be eliminated; and that she acknowledged her displeasure with her job for reasons unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment. Although these details are fair game for a trial, they have no place in the summary judgment analysis, where we are not permitted to draw negative inferences about Chaloult's credibility. That is a job for the jury at trial.</p>\n<p>Then there is the majority's curious treatment of Chaloult's insistence that Anderson knew of some incidents that he does not acknowledge. For example, Chaloult alleges that Anderson and a few maintenance people were in the area when Francoeur told her that he was going to come to her house to show her what \"fucking was about.\" The obvious import of Chaloult's statement is that Anderson overheard the remark. In response, the majority observes that Anderson says that he did not hear those comments. The majority apparently accepts Anderson's denial. In so doing, the majority distorts the summary judgment standard that requires us to take all facts in the light most favorable to Chaloult.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is the majority's odd treatment of undisputed portions of the summary judgment record. It is undisputed that Anderson heard Francoeur: remark that women who rode motorcycles enjoyed sex from the backside after he learned that Chaloult had recently taken a motorcycle trip; make an inappropriate noise while Chaloult ate an eclair and another supervisor \"asked how far can it go\"; state that he had heard a radio program that discussed \"spread points\" between breasts; and ask other employees to measure their \"spread points.\" With respect to this spread points incident, the majority recounts in detail Anderson's version, including his insistence that he \"read nothing into it because we all had a chuckle about it.\" The majority then says that \"Chaloult has not called this testimony into question,\" without explaining how or why Chaloult has to challenge Anderson's statement that he did not view this particular conduct as sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>Anderson's dismissal of such conduct as \"guy talk\" and funny incidences that provoked laughter may only mean that he was a company supervisor who did not understand the nature of sexual harassment. Contrary to the inapt observation of the majority that Chaloult never \"used the term `sexual harassment' in her conversations with Anderson about Francoeur,\" Chaloult had no obligation to explain to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> Anderson the significance of what he was seeing. The testimony about those encounters described by Chaloult should have been heard by a jury charged with determining whether Anderson was placed on notice of sexual harassment, which would then be imputable to IBC under the terms of its own sexual harassment policy. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority to terminate this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The record shows that Chaloult was having a dispute with an oven operator named Dobre in late July 2005. Sue Bisson wrote a \"To whom it may concern\" letter, dated August 3, noting two incidents: on July 28, Chaloult told Dobre not to call a mechanic regarding a problem with the oven because he was causing the problem, but it turned out that a mechanic was needed and the mistake was not Dobre's. On July 29, Chaloult told Bisson that Dobre was making another mistake involving machinery, which Bisson informed Chaloult was not Dobre's fault, at which point Chaloult \"proceeded to walk out of the office and leave.\" On July 30 or 31, Chaloult wrote a report stating that Dobre had shoved equipment and made a loud noise as she walked by.\n</p>\n<p>The parties have not argued that the tension between Chaloult and Dobre (and apparently Bisson) is related to her problems with Francoeur, but it does suggest that she was unhappy at work for reasons unrelated to Francoeur in the days before she wrote her letter of resignation on August 4.</p>\n<p>[2]  At his deposition, Francoeur confirmed Santos's account of their meeting and of his statement to Anderson. There is no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>[3]  For summary judgment purposes, we use her testimony at deposition. Her testimony is materially different from some allegations in her unverified complaint. For example, Chaloult testified that Francoeur never asked to see her nipples although that was alleged in the complaint. Chaloult's complaint stated that Francoeur would tell her that \"she looked like she needed to get laid,\" but at deposition she said that it was a female co-worker who made that comment.</p>\n<p>[4]  Francoeur also denied making the statements plaintiff attributes to him as evidence of harassment, including the offer to go home with her, but we take plaintiff's version as true for summary judgment purposes. As to the eclair statement, Francoeur said it was made by another supervisor, Dan Lariviere, and that afterwards he told Lariviere that the statement was inappropriate.</p>\n<p>[5]  Chaloult decided to keep a contemporaneous diary of Francoeur's comments. In that diary, she made no mention of Francoeur's comments about coming over to her house to have sex; no mention of the alleged incident involving dough balls; no mention of Francoeur's gestures about melons, which she took to be about her breasts; nothing about Sue Bisson's comments; and nothing about Francoeur's comment about girls who ride motorcycles.\n</p>\n<p>The diary did include references to Francoeur's complaining about his wife, but nothing about comments regarding his sexual relations with his wife. The diary also did refer to Francoeur's comments about the distance between Chaloult's nipples, chafed nipples, and the eclair incident.</p>\n<p>[6]  When asked whether he knew if Lariviere had been disciplined for his comment, Anderson stated that was \"none of [his] business... as far as an entry-level supervisor. Only upper management would know if something like that happened.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Clearly Chaloult's behavior in not complaining was not reasonable. There is absolutely no evidence of Chaloult's having \"more than ordinary fear or embarrassment,\" as <i>Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2003), requires. To the contrary, Chaloult was a supervisor herself who had worked for the company for over five years.\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Reed,</i> this circuit held that a jury question was presented on the second prong regarding whether it was unreasonable for a seventeen-year-old plaintiff to fail to complain about her supervisor's sexual assault when the supervisor was twice her age and told her that they would both be fired if she reported and that his father was good friends with the company's owner. <i>Id.</i> at 37.</p>\n<p>[8]  The case <i>Clark</i> cites in support of this proposition, <i>Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760547\"><a href=\"/opinion/760547/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1553-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45687-12-fla-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1361</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1999), says no such thing. The language from <i>Coates,</i> that a company \"itself answered the question of when it would be deemed to have notice of the harassment,\" was used in the context of whether an employee had sufficiently reported harassment to the company, not whether the company was liable for a co-worker supervisor's knowledge. <i>Id.</i> at 1364.</p>\n<p>[9]  This does not mean that Anderson had no duty to report harassment under IBC's policy. But the existence of any such duty does not, as a matter of law, automatically impute to IBC all of Anderson's knowledge for the purpose of determining the reasonableness of IBC's actions under <i>Faragher-Ellerth.</i></p>\n<p>[10]  In an affidavit accompanying her opposition to summary judgment, Chaloult added new information: that after Francoeur made the offer to go to her house and have sex with her, Anderson \"said that Mr. Francoeur's behavior was getting worse, and, it would get him into trouble at some point.\" Since this statement is inconsistent with Chaloult's deposition testimony, we disregard it. <i>Torrech-Hern√°ndez v. Gen. Elec.

There is no indication that any complaints were made about Francoeur by anyone else at any time.</p>\n<p>[12]  In footnote 9 of its opinion, the majority states that it is not saying that Anderson had no duty to report harassment under IBC's policy. Rather, the majority insists that Anderson had no duty to report Francoeur's harassment of Chaloult under the circumstances of this case. Those circumstances include two indefensible legal propositions put forth by the majority. First, as explained above, the majority says that Anderson's status as a supervisor under the IBC policy does not matter here because Chaloult was a supervisor at the same level as Anderson and because the harasser, Francoeur, was the supervisor for both of them. Second, as I explain more fully in Parts II and III of the dissent, the majority says that Anderson's knowledge of Francoeur's treatment of Chaloult did not constitute awareness of sexual harassment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>[13]  In <i>Coates,</i> the court held that when an employer's sexual harassment policy designates the people responsible for reporting misconduct, the company \"itself answered the question of when it would be deemed to have notice of the harassment sufficient to obligate it or its agents to take prompt and appropriate remedial measures.\" 164 F.3d at 1364. The majority correctly notes that the court in <i>Coates</i> was considering whether an employee had sufficiently reported harassment to the company and did not address the issue of whether a company was liable for a co-worker supervisor's knowledge. Even with this factual distinction, the central point remains the same ¬ó a company's own harassment policy answers the question of who within the company is responsible for reporting and responding to known incidences of harassment.</p>\n\n</div>",
