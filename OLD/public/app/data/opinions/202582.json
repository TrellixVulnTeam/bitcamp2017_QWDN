R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 06-1075\n\n                             UNITED STATES,\n\n                                 Appellee,\n\n                                      v.\n\n                      HENRY A.

Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Robert M. Thomas, Jr., Royston H. Delaney and Thomas &\nAssociates on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney and Rosa Emilia\nRodríguez-Vélez on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                             January 4, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam.          Defendant-appellant Henry Alvarez-Cuevas\n\npled guilty, without a plea agreement, to one count of hostage\n\ntaking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1203(a) (Count I), and one\n\ncount of using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (Count II).             He was originally\n\nsentenced to 109 months' imprisonment on Count I and to the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum of seven years on Count II. This court\n\nvacated his original sentence on the ground that the sentencing\n\ncourt had erred in applying U.S.S.G. § 2A4.1(b)(6) to enhance his\n\nsentence on Count I, and remanded with instructions that in light\n\nof the Court's intervening decision in United States v. Booker, 543\n\nU.S. 220 (2005), \"[t]he entire sentence is . . . subject to\n\nreconsideration, not just the § 2A4.1(b)(6) enhancement.\"                United\n\nStates v. Alvarez-Cuevas, 415 F.3d 121, 122 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nAlvarez appeals from the sentence of 78 months' imprisonment\n\nimposed on Count I on remand.\n\n           Alvarez' sole argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt   erred    in   denying    his   motion   for   preparation   of   a   new\n\npresentence investigation report (PSR) prior to resentencing.                He\n\nmaintains that the court on resentencing should have \"sought\n\nfurther information in a revised, comprehensive pre-sentence report\n\naddressing      the   hitherto    prohibited    or    discouraged   factors.\"\n\nAppellant's Brief, p.8.           The only such factors that appellant\n\nspecifically mentioned (age, education and lack of guidance as a\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fyouth), however, were addressed in the original PSR.                     No specific\n\nmitigating      facts   related      to    those       factors    were   raised     at\n\nresentencing or in appellant's brief.\n\n           At the resentencing hearing, defense counsel asked the\n\ncourt to consider defendant's \"history and characteristics\" under\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).       Specifically, defense counsel raised two\n\nmitigating   facts:     1)   defendant's         IQ    and   2)   defendant's     role\n\nrelative to other participants.                 The court expressly took those\n\nfacts into account in arriving at a sentence in the middle of the\n\nrecalculated guideline range (70 - 87 months).                     Defense counsel\n\nalso asked the court to consider his client's psychological state.\n\nHowever, that factor was addressed at length in the original PSR.\n\n           Neither at the resentencing hearing nor in his brief has\n\nappellant identified any new information not already considered by\n\nthe   sentencing    judge    which    a    new    or    revised    PSR   would    have\n\nprovided. The information in the record, including the information\n\npresented at the resentencing hearing, enabled the district court\n\nto \"meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(i)(A)(ii).                The court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying the motion for preparation of a new PSR.\n\nSee United States v. Triestman, 178 F.3d 624, 633 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n           Appellant's argument that the district court \"simply\n\napplied   the    guidelines    as     presumptively          reasonable\"    is    not\n\nsupported by the record.          The court expressly stated that it was\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\frelying upon the § 3553 factors urged by appellant, based on facts\n\npresented at resentencing regarding defendant's limited mental\n\ncapacity and his responsibility relative to other participants in\n\nthe offense.   Post-Booker, \"a district court should normally begin\n\nwith   a   guideline   calculation,     and   .   .   .   after   considering\n\ndepartures,    the   district   court    should   decide    whether    'other\n\nfactors' (beyond the guidelines) warrant[] an ultimate sentence\n\nabove or below the guideline range.\" United States v. Smith, 445\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).      The record indicates that the district\n\ncourt did just that, and provided a \"plausible explanation and a\n\ndefensible overall result.\" United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 445\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed. See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
