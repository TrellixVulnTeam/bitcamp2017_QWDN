Applying the\n\nthen-mandatory federal Sentencing Guidelines, the district court\n\nimposed a sentence of 27-months imprisonment.                 Reid appeals his\n\nsentence.

He also\n\ncontends, for the first time on appeal, that even if the district\n\ncourt did not err in calculating the applicable Guidelines range,\n\nhe is entitled to a remand for resentencing under United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).             Finding no error in the district\n\ncourt’s Guidelines calculations and no basis for a Booker remand,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                                  I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Facts\n\n       On the evening of December 19, 2002, Reid and several other\n\npeople (the “co-conspirators”) came up with a plan to steal guns\n\nand trade the guns for cocaine.                The target of the planned theft\n\nwas Bart McNeel, the father of one of the co-conspirators.                   At the\n\ntime   the     plan   was   concocted,     the    co-conspirators    were    in   an\n\napartment in Biddeford, Maine.             In order to carry out the plan,\n\nfive of the co-conspirators, including Reid, drove from Biddeford\n\nto McNeel’s home in Westbrook, Maine.                Reid kept watch outside,\n\nwhile two of the group entered the house and stole McNeel’s gun\n\fcabinet; the remaining two occupied themselves by driving around\n\nthe neighborhood. The group of five then returned to the apartment\n\nin Biddeford, where the gun safe was opened and six guns were\n\ndiscovered.\n\n     The next day, December 20, 2002, Reid took the six guns that\n\nhad been in the gun safe and, accompanied by two of the other co-\n\nconspirators, drove to another town to trade the guns for cocaine.\n\nOnce there, Reid alone carried out the trade.   He met with a person\n\nnamed Sam and traded four of the guns for two “rocks” of cocaine.\n\nInitially, Reid kept one rock for himself while giving one rock to\n\none of the people who had made the trip with him.   Ultimately, both\n\nrocks were shared with other co-conspirators who had not made the\n\ntrip.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n     On November 4, 2003, Reid was indicted by a federal grand jury\n\nfor conspiracy to possess stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 371 & 922(j).   A superseding indictment on December 19, 2003,\n\nadded the charge of transferring firearms, knowing they would be\n\nused to commit a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(h).     That same day, pursuant to a plea agreement, Reid\n\npleaded guilty to the first count and the government agreed to\n\ndismiss the second count.\n\n     The Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”) concluded that\n\nthe stolen firearms were possessed “in connection with another\n\n\n                                -4-\n\ffelony offense,” requiring a four-level increase in Reid’s offense\n\nlevel pursuant to section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nAccording to the PSR, Reid’s “other offense” was the possession of\n\ncocaine with the intent to distribute.           Reid objected to this\n\naspect of the PSR, arguing that his sharing of the cocaine he had\n\nacquired in exchange for the guns was not “distribution” because\n\nall of the people with whom he shared the cocaine had jointly\n\nagreed to acquire the firearms, to exchange them for drugs, and to\n\nshare the drugs among themselves. The district court overruled his\n\nobjection, holding that “where one or more individuals purchase or\n\nacquire drugs and then share the drugs with others, there is a\n\ndistribution, notwithstanding the existence of a conspiracy or\n\nagreement among all of the parties involved to acquire and use\n\ndrugs.”    Sentencing Hearing Tr. at 7.       Thus, because “only . . .\n\nReid . . . went inside the drug dealer’s apartment to get the\n\ncocaine,” Reid and the other members of the conspiracy “did not\n\nacquire possession of the drugs simultaneously” and, therefore,\n\n“Reid possessed with the intent to distribute.”        Id.   The district\n\ncourt denied Reid’s motion for reconsideration. Applying the four-\n\nlevel     enhancement   in   section     2K2.1(b)(5)   increased   Reid’s\n\nGuidelines sentencing range from 12-18 months to 24-30 months.\n\n     At the sentencing hearing, the government asked for a 30-month\n\nsentence, the top of the range, arguing that “Mr. Reid did play a\n\nmore culpable role in this offense than the other participants”\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fbecause “he was the connection to the supplier, the person who\n\nalone went into the home and made the transfer of the guns which is\n\nthe most important and significant and serious overt act in this\n\nconspiracy.”   Id. at 20-21. Reid’s counsel asked for a sentence at\n\nthe low end of the range, “[g]iven that [Reid had] the minimum\n\nnumber of points that you can get in Criminal History Category III,\n\ngiven that Mr. Reid did plead guilty, given that he did receive a\n\nthree level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and given\n\nthat his culpability in this case is . . . at a level consistent\n\nwith the other participants.”     Id. at 21.\n\n     The district court imposed a 27-month sentence, the exact\n\nmiddle of the Guidelines range.    The court explained its choice of\n\nsentence as follows:\n\n          Mr. Reid, I’m going to sentence you right in\n          the middle of the range. [Government counsel]\n          made some good arguments as to why I should go\n          to the high end, [defense counsel] made some\n          good arguments why I should go to the low end,\n          but I conclude that you fit the average\n          pattern which should place you in the middle\n          of the range.\n\n     The court then spoke directly to Reid, stating:\n\n          I have a lot of concerns about where you’re\n          headed. You’re a young man, 24 years old, and\n          you’ve already through your criminal history\n          shown that you know how to get in trouble with\n          the law. And you’re now a convicted federal\n          felon going off to federal prison. And if you\n          continue in this pattern, you’ll be back in\n          front of me or some other Judge looking at\n          much more serious time than you’re looking at\n          now.    You could quickly become a career\n          offender and basically you could be spending\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          the rest of your life wearing that kind of a\n          uniform being in prison.    I can’t imagine\n          that’s the life you want.\n\n          . . .\n\n               But that’s where you’re headed in terms\n          of what you’re doing. And so somehow you’ve\n          got to deal with your alcohol and drug abuse\n          which clearly are the root of much of what\n          you’re doing. So I urge you to take advantage\n          of every program that you can get in prison\n          and thereafter because you’re the only one\n          that can make that change.\n\n               People like me can talk at you, but it’s\n          not going to make any difference until you\n          make the decision. When your prison time is\n          over, I’m going to sentence you to a period of\n          supervised release which will carry with it .\n          . . a number of conditions to try to assist\n          you on that.\n\n               And rest assure if you violate those\n          terms, you will be back in front of me looking\n          at revocation and future prison time. But the\n          decision really is in your hands as to whether\n          this is something that you can put behind you\n          or whether it’s just the beginning or a\n          continuation of dealing with Judges and\n          prisons.\n\nId. at 22-24.\n\n     Reid filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                         II.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Application of Sentencing Guidelines Section 2K2.1(b)(5)\n\n     Reid’s first argument on appeal is that the district court\n\nerred in calculating his sentencing range under the Guidelines by\n\napplying the four-level increase in offense level called for by\n\nsection 2K2.1(b)(5).\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f     Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides:\n\n            If the defendant used or possessed any firearm\n            or ammunition in connection with another\n            felony offense; or possessed or transferred\n            any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,\n            intent, or reason to believe that it would be\n            used or possessed in connection with another\n            felony offense, increase by 4 levels. If the\n            resulting offense level is less than level 18,\n            increase to level 18.\n\n     The district court concluded that this enhancement applied\n\nbecause Reid had possessed the stolen firearms in connection with\n\nthe felony offense of possession with intent to distribute.                     Reid\n\nargues on appeal, as he did before the district court, that he did\n\nnot commit the offense of possession with intent to distribute. In\n\nparticular, he argues, relying on the Second Circuit’s decision in\n\nUnited States v. Swiderski, 548 F.2d 445 (2d Cir. 1977), that\n\nproviding    the    cocaine      he   acquired    to   other    members    of    the\n\nconspiracy    was    not    “distribution”        because      he   acquired     and\n\ntransferred the cocaine pursuant to a joint agreement to steal guns\n\nand trade them for cocaine solely for the conspirators’ use.\n\n     In   Swiderski,       the    court    held   that    there     had   been   no\n\n“distribution” where a man and his fiancee, acting in concert the\n\nentire time, jointly acquired and used drugs.               Even assuming that\n\nthe Swiderski rule applies in the First Circuit (which has not been\n\ndefinitively established), we are not persuaded that the facts of\n\nthe present case warrant its application.                Unlike the two people\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy in Swiderski, the co-conspirators in the\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpresent case did not act in concert at all times.   Rather, only two\n\nof the five (not including Reid) actually stole the gun safe, only\n\nReid and one other made the trip to trade the guns for cocaine, and\n\nonly Reid himself was actually present when the trade was made,\n\ngiving him sole possession of the cocaine for a time before it was\n\ntransferred   to   the   other   co-conspirators.      Under   these\n\ncircumstances, we believe that there has been “distribution” and,\n\ntherefore, that the Swiderski rule does not apply.       See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Washington, 41 F.3d 917, 919-20 (4th Cir. 1984).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the district court properly applied the\n\nfour-level enhancement in section 2K2.1(b)(5) for possessing a\n\nfirearm in connection with another felony offense.\n\nB.   United States v. Booker\n\n     Reid also contends that he is entitled to a remand for\n\nresentencing under United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005),\n\nbecause he was sentenced under the mandatory Guidelines system\n\neliminated by Booker.    As the claim of Booker error is raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal, a plain error standard of review applies:\n\nthere must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, (3) that affects\n\nsubstantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.        See\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993); United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 77 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v.\n\nVega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 533 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fGonzález-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir. 2005).         As Reid’s\n\nsentence was imposed under a mandatory system, he satisfies the\n\nfirst two prongs of the plain error test.    See Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 77; see also United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 223\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     The   next    two   requirements,   prejudice   and   fundamental\n\nunfairness, are satisfied if “the appellate panel is convinced by\n\nthe defendant based on the facts of the case that the sentence\n\nwould, with reasonable probability, have been different” were the\n\nlower court not constrained by the Guidelines. Antonakopolous, 399\n\nF.3d at 81.   Reasonable probability is not an “overly demanding”\n\ntest.   Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.   Rather, it exists “where, either\n\nin the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable\n\nindication that the district judge might well have reached a\n\ndifferent result under advisory guidelines.”    Id.; see also United\n\nStates v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2005).       However, the\n\nmere “theoretical possibility” that the district court would impose\n\na more favorable sentence is not enough to satisfy this test.      See\n\nUnited States v. Mercado, No. 04-1656, 2005 WL 1404470, at *9 (1st\n\nCir. Jun. 16, 2005).\n\n     As the Antonakopoulos test was adopted after briefing and\n\nargument in the present case, Reid was given the opportunity to\n\nfile a supplemental brief and/or supplement the record on appeal.\n\nHe did both, filing an affidavit from his mother, Joan Reid,\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdetailing    his   personal   and    family   history,   and   filing   a\n\nsupplemental brief.\n\n     In his supplemental brief, Reid argues that he is entitled to\n\na Booker remand for resentencing because his family history, his\n\npersonal history and his present family circumstances, as set forth\n\nin his mother’s affidavit and in the PSR, are mitigating factors\n\nthat create a “reasonable probability” that the district court\n\nwould have imposed a more favorable sentence under an advisory\n\nregime.   In particular, he emphasizes the following facts:\n\n     (1) Reid’s father left the family when Reid was in first grade\n\nand had no significant further contact with Reid until he was\n\nseventeen;\n\n     (2) after Reid’s mother and father divorced, his mother moved\n\nin with another man, James Reagan, who was an alcoholic;\n\n     (3) Reid was close to Reagan, but also had to defend his\n\nmother when Reagan was abusive to her;\n\n     (4) Reid began drinking at age 10, smoking marijuana at age\n\n12, and using cocaine at age 14;\n\n     (5) Reid left school at age 14;\n\n     (6) at age 16, Reid was diagnosed with Attention Deficit\n\nHyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”), but treated only briefly and\n\nwithout success;\n\n     (7) despite his many years of abusing alcohol and drugs, Reid\n\nhas never been treated for substance abuse;\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f       (8) Reid is the father of a young son (now six years old) and,\n\nalthough he is no longer in a relationship with the mother of his\n\nson, he has been the de facto father of her older child, his son’s\n\nhalf-sister; and\n\n       (9) when able, Reid provides financial support to his son, his\n\nson’s mother, and his son’s half-sister.\n\n       With respect to Booker, it is now established that “[o]ne\n\ncategory of claims that might warrant remand on plain error review\n\nis the one involving arguments that [] mitigating factor[s] existed\n\nbut w[ere] not available for consideration under the mandatory\n\nGuidelines,” if there is a reasonable probability that the district\n\ncourt would impose a more favorable sentence in light of these\n\nfactors.   See United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (internal quotations omitted).             And, as described above,\n\nReid’s proffer on appeal identifies a number of such potentially\n\n“mitigating” factors.       However, we are not convinced that these\n\nmitigating    factors   create   a   reasonable        probability    that   the\n\ndistrict court would have imposed a more favorable sentence under\n\nan advisory regime.\n\n       Almost all of the facts cited by Reid in his supplemental\n\nbrief and in the affidavit of his mother were contained in his PSR\n\nand,    therefore,   were   available       to   the    district     court   for\n\nconsideration at the time of sentencing.           See McLean, 409 F.3d at\n\n505 (noting that the defendant “actually made the mitigating\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\farguments that he now posits before the district court” and that\n\n“[h]e does not elaborate how he could make them more convincingly\n\non remand”); United States v. Brennick, 405 F.3d 96, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (refusing to remand for resentencing to permit the district\n\ncourt to give “more emphasis to mitigating factors that ordinarily\n\nhave little influence under the Guidelines, such as his troubled\n\nchildhood and drug addiction[,]” where those facts were available\n\nto and acknowledged by the district court at sentencing).        Nor are\n\nthe facts identified by Reid, unfortunately, unique or even rare.\n\nCf. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 10 (basing remand for resentencing in\n\npart on the fact that the district court had observed at sentencing\n\nthat the defendant “had the most horrible young life he had seen in\n\n17 years on the bench”); Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224 (remanding for\n\nresentencing where district court indicated that defendant's age\n\nand physical condition were worthy of consideration but did not\n\nwarrant a downward departure under the mandatory Guidelines).           In\n\naddition, the sentence imposed falls in the precise middle of the\n\nGuideline   range,   suggesting,    although   not   proving,   that   the\n\ndistrict court did not feel constrained by the Guidelines.             See\n\nMcLean, 409 F.3d at 505 (stating in denying Booker remand: “We note\n\nthat [the defendant] was sentenced in the middle of the guideline\n\nrange, rather than at the bottom, and so the district court could\n\nhave given him a lower sentence under the old regime. That it did\n\nnot do so speaks volumes.”); see also United States v. Kornegay,\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f410 F.3d 89, 99-100 (1st Cir. 2005) (“That the court sentenced [the\n\ndefendant] at the low end of the applicable Guideline range is not,\n\nby itself, sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a lesser\n\nsentence under the advisory system.”).          And while it is certainly\n\nnot necessary that the district court articulate that it felt\n\nconstrained by the mandatory Guidelines, see Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 81, it is still relevant that the district court here\n\nexpressed no such concern.          Cf. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 10 (basing\n\nremand in part on the fact that “[t]he district judge sentenced\n\n[the   defendant]   to    the   lowest    available      sentence    under   the\n\nGuidelines” and “repeatedly expressed his concern about disparate\n\ntreatment between federal and state court sentences in similar\n\ncases, but stated that the Guidelines did not permit him to take\n\nthat disparity into account”).           Indeed, here the district court\n\nexpressly stated that it was selecting the sentence it imposed as\n\nan appropriate accommodation of both the defendant’s good arguments\n\nfor lenience and the government’s good arguments for a harsher\n\nsentence.\n\n       Taking all of these facts into consideration, we conclude that\n\nthere is not a reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a more lenient sentence under an advisory Guideline system.\n\nAccordingly,    Reid     is   not    entitled   to   a   Booker     remand   for\n\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f                   III.

Finding no error in the district\n\ncourt’s Guidelines calculations and no basis for a Booker remand,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                                  I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Facts\n\n       On the evening of December 19, 2002, Reid and several other\n\npeople (the “co-conspirators”) came up with a plan to steal guns\n\nand trade the guns for cocaine.                The target of the planned theft\n\nwas Bart McNeel, the father of one of the co-conspirators.                   At the\n\ntime   the     plan   was   concocted,     the    co-conspirators    were    in   an\n\napartment in Biddeford, Maine.             In order to carry out the plan,\n\nfive of the co-conspirators, including Reid, drove from Biddeford\n\nto McNeel’s home in Westbrook, Maine.                Reid kept watch outside,\n\nwhile two of the group entered the house and stole McNeel’s gun\n\fcabinet; the remaining two occupied themselves by driving around\n\nthe neighborhood. The group of five then returned to the apartment\n\nin Biddeford, where the gun safe was opened and six guns were\n\ndiscovered.\n\n     The next day, December 20, 2002, Reid took the six guns that\n\nhad been in the gun safe and, accompanied by two of the other co-\n\nconspirators, drove to another town to trade the guns for cocaine.\n\nOnce there, Reid alone carried out the trade.   He met with a person\n\nnamed Sam and traded four of the guns for two “rocks” of cocaine.\n\nInitially, Reid kept one rock for himself while giving one rock to\n\none of the people who had made the trip with him.   Ultimately, both\n\nrocks were shared with other co-conspirators who had not made the\n\ntrip.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n     On November 4, 2003, Reid was indicted by a federal grand jury\n\nfor conspiracy to possess stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 371 & 922(j).   A superseding indictment on December 19, 2003,\n\nadded the charge of transferring firearms, knowing they would be\n\nused to commit a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(h).     That same day, pursuant to a plea agreement, Reid\n\npleaded guilty to the first count and the government agreed to\n\ndismiss the second count.\n\n     The Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”) concluded that\n\nthe stolen firearms were possessed “in connection with another\n\n\n                                -4-\n\ffelony offense,” requiring a four-level increase in Reid’s offense\n\nlevel pursuant to section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nAccording to the PSR, Reid’s “other offense” was the possession of\n\ncocaine with the intent to distribute.           Reid objected to this\n\naspect of the PSR, arguing that his sharing of the cocaine he had\n\nacquired in exchange for the guns was not “distribution” because\n\nall of the people with whom he shared the cocaine had jointly\n\nagreed to acquire the firearms, to exchange them for drugs, and to\n\nshare the drugs among themselves. The district court overruled his\n\nobjection, holding that “where one or more individuals purchase or\n\nacquire drugs and then share the drugs with others, there is a\n\ndistribution, notwithstanding the existence of a conspiracy or\n\nagreement among all of the parties involved to acquire and use\n\ndrugs.”    Sentencing Hearing Tr. at 7.       Thus, because “only . . .\n\nReid . . . went inside the drug dealer’s apartment to get the\n\ncocaine,” Reid and the other members of the conspiracy “did not\n\nacquire possession of the drugs simultaneously” and, therefore,\n\n“Reid possessed with the intent to distribute.”        Id.   The district\n\ncourt denied Reid’s motion for reconsideration. Applying the four-\n\nlevel     enhancement   in   section     2K2.1(b)(5)   increased   Reid’s\n\nGuidelines sentencing range from 12-18 months to 24-30 months.\n\n     At the sentencing hearing, the government asked for a 30-month\n\nsentence, the top of the range, arguing that “Mr. Reid did play a\n\nmore culpable role in this offense than the other participants”\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fbecause “he was the connection to the supplier, the person who\n\nalone went into the home and made the transfer of the guns which is\n\nthe most important and significant and serious overt act in this\n\nconspiracy.”   Id. at 20-21. Reid’s counsel asked for a sentence at\n\nthe low end of the range, “[g]iven that [Reid had] the minimum\n\nnumber of points that you can get in Criminal History Category III,\n\ngiven that Mr. Reid did plead guilty, given that he did receive a\n\nthree level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and given\n\nthat his culpability in this case is . . . at a level consistent\n\nwith the other participants.”     Id. at 21.\n\n     The district court imposed a 27-month sentence, the exact\n\nmiddle of the Guidelines range.    The court explained its choice of\n\nsentence as follows:\n\n          Mr. Reid, I’m going to sentence you right in\n          the middle of the range. [Government counsel]\n          made some good arguments as to why I should go\n          to the high end, [defense counsel] made some\n          good arguments why I should go to the low end,\n          but I conclude that you fit the average\n          pattern which should place you in the middle\n          of the range.\n\n     The court then spoke directly to Reid, stating:\n\n          I have a lot of concerns about where you’re\n          headed. You’re a young man, 24 years old, and\n          you’ve already through your criminal history\n          shown that you know how to get in trouble with\n          the law. And you’re now a convicted federal\n          felon going off to federal prison. And if you\n          continue in this pattern, you’ll be back in\n          front of me or some other Judge looking at\n          much more serious time than you’re looking at\n          now.    You could quickly become a career\n          offender and basically you could be spending\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          the rest of your life wearing that kind of a\n          uniform being in prison.    I can’t imagine\n          that’s the life you want.\n\n          . . .\n\n               But that’s where you’re headed in terms\n          of what you’re doing. And so somehow you’ve\n          got to deal with your alcohol and drug abuse\n          which clearly are the root of much of what\n          you’re doing. So I urge you to take advantage\n          of every program that you can get in prison\n          and thereafter because you’re the only one\n          that can make that change.\n\n               People like me can talk at you, but it’s\n          not going to make any difference until you\n          make the decision. When your prison time is\n          over, I’m going to sentence you to a period of\n          supervised release which will carry with it .\n          . . a number of conditions to try to assist\n          you on that.\n\n               And rest assure if you violate those\n          terms, you will be back in front of me looking\n          at revocation and future prison time. But the\n          decision really is in your hands as to whether\n          this is something that you can put behind you\n          or whether it’s just the beginning or a\n          continuation of dealing with Judges and\n          prisons.\n\nId. at 22-24.\n\n     Reid filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                         II.   DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Application of Sentencing Guidelines Section 2K2.1(b)(5)\n\n     Reid’s first argument on appeal is that the district court\n\nerred in calculating his sentencing range under the Guidelines by\n\napplying the four-level increase in offense level called for by\n\nsection 2K2.1(b)(5).\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f     Section 2K2.1(b)(5) provides:\n\n            If the defendant used or possessed any firearm\n            or ammunition in connection with another\n            felony offense; or possessed or transferred\n            any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,\n            intent, or reason to believe that it would be\n            used or possessed in connection with another\n            felony offense, increase by 4 levels. If the\n            resulting offense level is less than level 18,\n            increase to level 18.\n\n     The district court concluded that this enhancement applied\n\nbecause Reid had possessed the stolen firearms in connection with\n\nthe felony offense of possession with intent to distribute.                     Reid\n\nargues on appeal, as he did before the district court, that he did\n\nnot commit the offense of possession with intent to distribute. In\n\nparticular, he argues, relying on the Second Circuit’s decision in\n\nUnited States v. Swiderski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342426\"><a href=\"/opinion/342426/united-states-v-walter-swiderski-and-maritza-de-los-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1977), that\n\nproviding    the    cocaine      he   acquired    to   other    members    of    the\n\nconspiracy    was    not    “distribution”        because      he   acquired     and\n\ntransferred the cocaine pursuant to a joint agreement to steal guns\n\nand trade them for cocaine solely for the conspirators’ use.\n\n     In   Swiderski,       the    court    held   that    there     had   been   no\n\n“distribution” where a man and his fiancee, acting in concert the\n\nentire time, jointly acquired and used drugs.               Even assuming that\n\nthe Swiderski rule applies in the First Circuit (which has not been\n\ndefinitively established), we are not persuaded that the facts of\n\nthe present case warrant its application.                Unlike the two people\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy in Swiderski, the co-conspirators in the\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fpresent case did not act in concert at all times.   Rather, only two\n\nof the five (not including Reid) actually stole the gun safe, only\n\nReid and one other made the trip to trade the guns for cocaine, and\n\nonly Reid himself was actually present when the trade was made,\n\ngiving him sole possession of the cocaine for a time before it was\n\ntransferred   to   the   other   co-conspirators.      Under   these\n\ncircumstances, we believe that there has been “distribution” and,\n\ntherefore, that the Swiderski rule does not apply.       See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 919-20 (4th Cir. 1984).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the district court properly applied the\n\nfour-level enhancement in section 2K2.1(b)(5) for possessing a\n\nfirearm in connection with another felony offense.\n\nB.   United States v. Booker\n\n     Reid also contends that he is entitled to a remand for\n\nresentencing under United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005),\n\nbecause he was sentenced under the mandatory Guidelines system\n\neliminated by Booker.    As the claim of Booker error is raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal, a plain error standard of review applies:\n\nthere must be (1) an error (2) that is plain, (3) that affects\n\nsubstantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

As Reid’s\n\nsentence was imposed under a mandatory system, he satisfies the\n\nfirst two prongs of the plain error test.    See Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 77; see also United States v. Heldeman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     The   next    two   requirements,   prejudice   and   fundamental\n\nunfairness, are satisfied if “the appellate panel is convinced by\n\nthe defendant based on the facts of the case that the sentence\n\nwould, with reasonable probability, have been different” were the\n\nlower court not constrained by the Guidelines. Antonakopolous, 399\n\nF.3d at 81.   Reasonable probability is not an “overly demanding”\n\ntest.   Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224.   Rather, it exists “where, either\n\nin the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is reasonable\n\nindication that the district judge might well have reached a\n\ndifferent result under advisory guidelines.”    Id.; see also United\n\nStates v. Wilkerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201628\"><a href=\"/opinion/201628/united-states-v-wilkerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir. 2005).       However, the\n\nmere “theoretical possibility” that the district court would impose\n\na more favorable sentence is not enough to satisfy this test.      See\n\nUnited States v. Mercado, No. 04-1656, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1404470</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9 (1st\n\nCir. Jun. 16, 2005).\n\n     As the Antonakopoulos test was adopted after briefing and\n\nargument in the present case, Reid was given the opportunity to\n\nfile a supplemental brief and/or supplement the record on appeal.\n\nHe did both, filing an affidavit from his mother, Joan Reid,\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdetailing    his   personal   and    family   history,   and   filing   a\n\nsupplemental brief.\n\n     In his supplemental brief, Reid argues that he is entitled to\n\na Booker remand for resentencing because his family history, his\n\npersonal history and his present family circumstances, as set forth\n\nin his mother’s affidavit and in the PSR, are mitigating factors\n\nthat create a “reasonable probability” that the district court\n\nwould have imposed a more favorable sentence under an advisory\n\nregime.   In particular, he emphasizes the following facts:\n\n     (1) Reid’s father left the family when Reid was in first grade\n\nand had no significant further contact with Reid until he was\n\nseventeen;\n\n     (2) after Reid’s mother and father divorced, his mother moved\n\nin with another man, James Reagan, who was an alcoholic;\n\n     (3) Reid was close to Reagan, but also had to defend his\n\nmother when Reagan was abusive to her;\n\n     (4) Reid began drinking at age 10, smoking marijuana at age\n\n12, and using cocaine at age 14;\n\n     (5) Reid left school at age 14;\n\n     (6) at age 16, Reid was diagnosed with Attention Deficit\n\nHyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”), but treated only briefly and\n\nwithout success;\n\n     (7) despite his many years of abusing alcohol and drugs, Reid\n\nhas never been treated for substance abuse;\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f       (8) Reid is the father of a young son (now six years old) and,\n\nalthough he is no longer in a relationship with the mother of his\n\nson, he has been the de facto father of her older child, his son’s\n\nhalf-sister; and\n\n       (9) when able, Reid provides financial support to his son, his\n\nson’s mother, and his son’s half-sister.\n\n       With respect to Booker, it is now established that “[o]ne\n\ncategory of claims that might warrant remand on plain error review\n\nis the one involving arguments that [] mitigating factor[s] existed\n\nbut w[ere] not available for consideration under the mandatory\n\nGuidelines,” if there is a reasonable probability that the district\n\ncourt would impose a more favorable sentence in light of these\n\nfactors.   See United States v. McLean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (internal quotations omitted).             And, as described above,\n\nReid’s proffer on appeal identifies a number of such potentially\n\n“mitigating” factors.       However, we are not convinced that these\n\nmitigating    factors   create   a   reasonable        probability    that   the\n\ndistrict court would have imposed a more favorable sentence under\n\nan advisory regime.\n\n       Almost all of the facts cited by Reid in his supplemental\n\nbrief and in the affidavit of his mother were contained in his PSR\n\nand,    therefore,   were   available       to   the    district     court   for\n\nconsideration at the time of sentencing.           See McLean, 409 F.3d at\n\n505 (noting that the defendant “actually made the mitigating\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\farguments that he now posits before the district court” and that\n\n“[h]e does not elaborate how he could make them more convincingly\n\non remand”); United States v. Brennick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201556\"><a href=\"/opinion/201556/united-states-v-brennick/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (refusing to remand for resentencing to permit the district\n\ncourt to give “more emphasis to mitigating factors that ordinarily\n\nhave little influence under the Guidelines, such as his troubled\n\nchildhood and drug addiction[,]” where those facts were available\n\nto and acknowledged by the district court at sentencing).        Nor are\n\nthe facts identified by Reid, unfortunately, unique or even rare.\n\nCf. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 10 (basing remand for resentencing in\n\npart on the fact that the district court had observed at sentencing\n\nthat the defendant “had the most horrible young life he had seen in\n\n17 years on the bench”); Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 224 (remanding for\n\nresentencing where district court indicated that defendant's age\n\nand physical condition were worthy of consideration but did not\n\nwarrant a downward departure under the mandatory Guidelines).           In\n\naddition, the sentence imposed falls in the precise middle of the\n\nGuideline   range,   suggesting,    although   not   proving,   that   the\n\ndistrict court did not feel constrained by the Guidelines.             See\n\nMcLean, 409 F.3d at 505 (stating in denying Booker remand: “We note\n\nthat [the defendant] was sentenced in the middle of the guideline\n\nrange, rather than at the bottom, and so the district court could\n\nhave given him a lower sentence under the old regime. That it did\n\nnot do so speaks volumes.”); see also United States v. Kornegay,\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201633\"><a href=\"/opinion/201633/united-states-v-kornegay/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99-100 (1st Cir. 2005) (“That the court sentenced [the\n\ndefendant] at the low end of the applicable Guideline range is not,\n\nby itself, sufficient to show a reasonable probability of a lesser\n\nsentence under the advisory system.”).          And while it is certainly\n\nnot necessary that the district court articulate that it felt\n\nconstrained by the mandatory Guidelines, see Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d at 81, it is still relevant that the district court here\n\nexpressed no such concern.          Cf. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d at 10 (basing\n\nremand in part on the fact that “[t]he district judge sentenced\n\n[the   defendant]   to    the   lowest    available      sentence    under   the\n\nGuidelines” and “repeatedly expressed his concern about disparate\n\ntreatment between federal and state court sentences in similar\n\ncases, but stated that the Guidelines did not permit him to take\n\nthat disparity into account”).           Indeed, here the district court\n\nexpressly stated that it was selecting the sentence it imposed as\n\nan appropriate accommodation of both the defendant’s good arguments\n\nfor lenience and the government’s good arguments for a harsher\n\nsentence.\n\n       Taking all of these facts into consideration, we conclude that\n\nthere is not a reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a more lenient sentence under an advisory Guideline system.\n\nAccordingly,    Reid     is   not    entitled   to   a   Booker     remand   for\n\nresentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f                   III.   CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                          -15-\n\f</pre>",
