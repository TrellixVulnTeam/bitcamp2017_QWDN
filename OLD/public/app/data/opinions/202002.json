Defendant Ronald Myles Hatch, II\n\nappeals the district court’s denial of his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal for his convictions of five counts of making a false\n\nstatement    to   the   Federal        Aviation    Administration    (“FAA”),   in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.             We affirm.\n\n                                  I.    BACKGROUND\n\n     Hatch    was   hired    as    an     air    traffic    controller   at   Logan\n\nInternational Airport (“Logan”) in 1982. When he started work, the\n\nFAA required that he be medically certified for his position.                   As\n\npart of the certification process, Hatch completed form 8500-8,\n\ntitled   “Medical       Certificate       _____     Class    and   Student    Pilot\n\nCertificate,” (the “8500-8”) each year starting in 1982.                  Question\n\n21 asked the following:           “MEDICAL HISTORY – HAVE YOU EVER HAD OR\n\nHAVE YOU NOW ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:                   (For each ‘yes’ checked,\n\ndescribe conditions in REMARKS).”               The conditions included various\n\nillnesses, “Record of traffic convictions,” and “Record of other\n\nconvictions.”       Hatch checked “yes” to the “Record of traffic\n\nconvictions” query and included in the “REMARKS” box that he had a\n\n1978 conviction in Massachusetts for operating a motor vehicle\n\nunder the influence of alcohol (“OUI”).                This “REMARKS” box also\n\nstated “(If no changes since last report, so state).”\n\n     The 8500-8 changed in 1991 (the “new 8500-8”).                      This form\n\nsimilarly contained a “MEDICAL HISTORY” box, Question 18, which\n\nasked the following:\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      Have you ever had or have you now any of the following?\n      Answer “yes” for every condition you have ever had in\n      your life. In the EXPLANATION box below, you may note\n      “PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, NO CHANGE” only if the explanation\n      of the condition was reported on a prior application for\n      an airman medical certificate and there has been no\n      change in your condition. See Instructions Page.\n\nThe new 8500-8 again listed various illnesses but directed the\n\napplicant to a separate box for convictions.                  This portion was\n\nlabeled    “Conviction        and/or   Administrative      Action    History”   and\n\nprovided as follows:\n\n      History of (1) any conviction(s) involving driving while\n      intoxicated by, while impaired by, or while under the\n      influence of alcohol or a drug; or (2) history of any\n      conviction(s) or administrative action(s) involving an\n      offense(s) which resulted in the denial, suspension,\n      cancellation, or revocation of driving privileges or\n      which resulted in attendance at an educational or a\n      rehabilitation program.\n\nHatch answered “yes” to this question and noted in this box that\n\n“ITEMS E, U AND V [WERE] PREVIOUSLY REPORTED - NO CHANGE.”                      Item\n\n“V” was the OUI question from the original, 1982 8500-8; however,\n\nit   was   now    specifically      addressed   in   the    “Conviction     and/or\n\nAdministrative Action History” section on the new 8500-8. Item “V”\n\nwas still included within the “MEDICAL HISTORY” portion of the new\n\n8500-8.    If Hatch had any concerns, the new 8500-8 advised him of\n\n“Explanations:         See Instructions Page.”          The instructions page\n\nclarified that if Hatch answered “yes” to Item “V,” he had to\n\nprovide a description of his conviction in the “Explanations” box.\n\nThis description must include the specific offense for which he was\n\nconvicted,       the   type    of   administrative      action      involved,   the\n\n                                         -3-\n\fjurisdiction where the conviction occurred, and the date of the\n\nconviction.\n\n     Although Hatch reported his 1978 OUI conviction, he never\n\nreported his subsequent 1983 and 1995 OUI convictions and omitted\n\nthem from the first 8500-8s following his respective convictions\n\nfor those years and all thereafter.           Hatch checked “yes” to\n\nQuestion 18, Item “U,” which directed him to the “Conviction and/or\n\nAdministrative Action History” section. In the “Explanations” box,\n\nhe reiterated his 1978 OUI conviction by including it as Item “V,”\n\n“NO CHANGE.”    He completed five forms from 1999 through 2003 (the\n\nbasis   for   the   indictment)   that   omitted   his   other   two   OUI\n\nconvictions, even though each 8500-8 bore his signature, explained\n\nthat the information must be complete and true, and warned against\n\nmaking any willfully false statements.       In 2003, Dr. Paul Clark,\n\nthe regional flight surgeon for the FAA in New England, learned\n\nthat Hatch had failed to report his most recent OUI convictions.\n\nAs a consequence, Dr. Clark medically restricted Hatch from work.\n\n     Hatch was indicted on five counts of knowingly and willfully\n\nmaking and using a false document containing a false statement by\n\nanswering “no change” to questions regarding OUI convictions on the\n\n8500-8s that he submitted to the FAA, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1001.   When arrested, he admitted that he had not included two OUI\n\nconvictions on subsequent 8500-8s in order to “avoid difficulties”\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fand   “protect   his   livelihood”    because    of   the   certain,   severe\n\nramifications of these disclosures.\n\n      At his trial, at the close of the government’s case and again\n\nafter the defense rested, Hatch moved for a judgment of acquittal\n\non all counts.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).          He argued that the\n\n8500-8 was fundamentally ambiguous and the statement “NO CHANGE”\n\nwas literally true under at least one reasonable interpretation of\n\nthe question.    The district court denied the motion and instructed\n\nthe jury that, in order to convict Hatch, it must find that the\n\ngovernment   proved    that   he    made   the   statement    knowingly   and\n\nwillfully, that he knew it was untrue when he made it, and that his\n\nanswer was false under any reasonable interpretation of the 8500-8\n\nif the jury decided that the question could be interpreted in\n\nseveral different ways.       Thus, it was the jury’s duty to consider\n\nand resolve any ambiguities in the 8500-8.\n\n      Hatch was found guilty on all five counts and was sentenced to\n\ntwo-years’ probation and fined $500.         His motion for a judgment of\n\nacquittal notwithstanding the verdict was denied.                This appeal\n\nfollowed.    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                              II.   DISCUSSION\n\n      “We review de novo a district court’s denial of a motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.”            United States v.\n\nCruzado-Laureano, 404 F.3d 470, 480 (1st Cir. 2005).            “Our task is\n\nto decide whether, after assaying all the evidence in the light\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fmost    amiable    to    the   government,      and   taking    all   reasonable\n\ninferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the\n\nessential elements of the crime.”              Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nand    citations   omitted).       All     credibility   disputes     are   to   be\n\nresolved in the verdict’s favor, and this “court ‘need not believe\n\nthat no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be\n\nreached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds\n\nsupport in a plausible rendition of the record.’”                   Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Gomez, 255 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001)).                   These\n\nare “daunting hurdles.”          See id.\n\n       “To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, the government\n\nmust prove that [Hatch] knowingly and willfully made or used a\n\nfalse writing or document, in relation to a matter within the\n\njurisdiction of the United States government, with knowledge of its\n\nfalsity.”      United States v. McGauley, 279 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n1.    The new 8500-8 was not fundamentally ambiguous.\n\n       Hatch   insists    that    the    new   8500-8    is    so   fundamentally\n\nambiguous that it cannot support his convictions.                   According to\n\nHatch, since he had not included his 1983 and 1995 OUI convictions\n\non the 8500-8 for the respective years of each conviction, his\n\n“PREVIOUSLY REPORTED – NO CHANGE” statement is not false because\n\nthere was no change from the previous respective year’s form.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fBecause there had been no convictions since the 1999 8500-8 was\n\ncompleted and Hatch was only indicted for the years 1999 through\n\n2003, he insists that his statements were literally true in that\n\nhis convictions were not noted on prior 8500-8s.               Further, Hatch\n\nsuggests that because the “Conviction and/or Administrative Action\n\nHistory”   section    asked    whether   he    had   a   “History   of   []    any\n\nconvictions(s)” for OUIs, this “could call for a response to the\n\nfact of the history rather than the contents of the history.                  As to\n\nthe fact of a history, the response ‘no change’ would be literally\n\ntrue.”    In addition, he submits that the division of the “MEDICAL\n\nHISTORY” section into different boxes on the 8500-8, one for “true\n\nmedical conditions” and one for conviction history, raises an\n\nambiguity as to whether the “MEDICAL HISTORY” directive also\n\napplied to his conviction history.\n\n     We    reject    Hatch’s   arguments      because    the   8500-8    is    not\n\nfundamentally ambiguous:        Hatch was required to disclose any and\n\nall OUI convictions.     Any OUI convictions fall expressly under the\n\nheading “Conviction and/or Administrative Action History,” which is\n\nsequentially numbered as part of the “MEDICAL HISTORY” question.\n\nIt is manifest that he realized that the question was unequivocal\n\nbecause he continued to include Items “E” (hay fever or allergy),\n\n“U” (admission to hospital), and “V” (1978 OUI conviction) on\n\nearlier 8500-8s. These remarks are indicative of his understanding\n\nthat his 1978 OUI, and thus two subsequent OUIs, were part of the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f“MEDICAL HISTORY” section and subject to its instructions.                See\n\nUnited States v. Sebaggala, 256 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(Defendant’s arguments that he “misunderstood the question” and\n\n“lacked knowledge that travelers’ checks were included in the\n\ndefinition of ‘monetary instruments’” were belied by the customs\n\nform’s plain language, his accurate answers to other questions on\n\nthe same form, and his understanding that travelers’ checks were\n\n“monetary instruments” on a prior visit to the United States).\n\nBecause an applicant’s history of OUI convictions is marked as Item\n\n“V” on all 8500-8s, Hatch knew he had to include all OUIs on the\n\n8500-8.      The “Instructions Page” even advised that if an applicant\n\nhad been convicted of an OUI, the conviction must be described in\n\ndetail.      See United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47, 69 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (A defendant is not “immune from prosecution for perjury\n\nwhenever some ambiguity can be found by an implausibly strained\n\nreading of the questions he is asked.”).\n\n       This is not a situation where Hatch’s response was “literally\n\ntrue   but    not   responsive   to   the   question   asked   and   arguably\n\nmisleading by negative implication.”             See Bronston v. United\n\nStates, 409 U.S. 352, 353 (1973).           Moreover, Hatch’s reliance on\n\nUnited States v. Manapat, 928 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir. 1991), is\n\nmisplaced.      In Manapat, the defendant behaved exactly as Hatch:\n\nshe omitted three convictions from the 8500-8 and later claimed\n\nthat she was confused by the ambiguous form.             The Manapat court\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fagreed,   acknowledging   that    “[a]lthough   the     single    statements\n\n‘Record of traffic convictions,’ or ‘Record of other convictions’\n\nmay not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing\n\nwhen buried in a list headed ‘Medical History’ and purportedly\n\nconcerned with medical conditions.”        Id. at 1101.\n\n     Manapat is readily distinguishable from the case sub judice.\n\nIt is only persuasive and not binding on this court.          Further, the\n\n8500-8 at issue in Manapat was the original 8500-8 Hatch filled out\n\nin 1982; this appeal concerns the new 8500-8 that Hatch began\n\nfilling out in 1992.\n\n     There is no fundamental ambiguity here.           Hatch’s motions for\n\njudgments of acquittal were rightly denied, and the issue was\n\nproperly submitted to the jury.       See United States v. Finucan, 708\n\nF.2d 838, 848 (1st Cir. 1983) (“[W]here an answer may or may not be\n\nfalse depending upon possible interpretations of an ambiguous\n\nquestion, it is for the jury to decide whether the defendant has\n\ncommitted perjury.”).\n\n2. Hatch’s statement was not literally true and the government\npresented sufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n     Hatch   also   argues    that   because   there    was   a   reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the OUI conviction question under which his\n\nanswer was true, the district court erred in denying his motion for\n\njudgments of acquittal.      See United States v. Rowe, 144 F.3d 15, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (“[I]n a false statement prosecution, an answer to\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fa question is not fraudulent if there is an objectively reasonable\n\ninterpretation of the question under which the answer is not even\n\nfalse.”).    Hatch submits two allegedly reasonable interpretations\n\nof his “NO CHANGE” answer that would make it literally true:            1) it\n\nreferred    to   his   history   of   criminal    conviction   which,   as   a\n\ncondition, had not changed since he had a history before and\n\ncontinued to have a history; 2) in the years in question--1999-\n\n2003--there had been “no change” since the filing of the previous\n\nyear’s form.      Nevertheless, it is evident that Hatch knew his\n\nanswer was false and that his other two OUI convictions must be\n\nincluded on the new 8500-8.       He presented these arguments at trial\n\nand the jury rejected them.           Given the “daunting” standard of\n\nreview, we refuse to impugn the jury’s verdict.\n\n     “The determination as to [Hatch’s] state of mind–-his belief\n\nin the untruthfulness of his statement–-is one which a jury is\n\n‘best equipped’ to perform.”          United States v. Reveron Martinez,\n\n836 F.2d 684, 689 (1st Cir. 1988).            This court must defer to the\n\njury’s verdict.        See United States v. McNatt, 813 F.2d 499, 502\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (“[T]he prosecutor need only produce that quantum\n\nof evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact could find guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt[.]”).              The government proved, and a\n\nrational jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, that the only\n\nsensible reading of Question 18 demanded that Hatch report his\n\nentire OUI history.      See Finucan, 708 F.2d at 848; United States v.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fKehoe, 562 F.2d 65, 68-69 & n.2 (1st Cir. 1977) (jury decides\n\n“whether an answer was or was not literally true”). Hatch’s answer\n\n“ITEMS E, U, V PREVIOUSLY REPORTED NO CHANGE” was false because his\n\nOUI history had changed – there had been two changes – and is\n\nreflected by the continuous inclusion of his 1978 OUI conviction on\n\nthe   annual   8500-8.     See    Sebaggala,     256   F.3d    at   63.     Hatch\n\nunderstood that Item “V” was part of the “MEDICAL HISTORY” section\n\nand knew that all OUIs must be disclosed.              Resultantly, his “NO\n\nCHANGE” answer would only be true if he had disclosed the change in\n\nhis   OUI   conviction    history   on   prior    forms,      pursuant    to   FAA\n\nrequirements.\n\n      The jury was instructed that “[i]f the [8500-8’s] question can\n\nbe interpreted in several ways, then the government has to prove\n\nthat the answer is false under any reasonable interpretation.”\n\nAccordingly,     the     jury    necessarily     concluded       that     Hatch’s\n\ninterpretation was unreasonable. See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S.\n\n200, 211 (1987) (“The rule that juries are presumed to follow their\n\ninstructions is a pragmatic one . . . .”); United States v.\n\nFreeman, 208 F.3d 332, 344 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Jurors are presumed to\n\nfollow the court’s instructions.”).\n\n      Hatch also contends that neither his statements nor his March\n\n13, 2003 letter (in which he attempted to explain his omissions)\n\nwas sufficient for the government to meet its burden of proof,\n\ni.e., that “NO CHANGE” was false under any interpretation of the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fquestion.    As for Hatch’s statements, the jury was free to attach\n\nwhatever significance to the statements it believed was warranted.\n\nAs for the letter, Hatch asserts that the jury could have believed\n\nit   was   either   directed   toward   the   1984   and   1996   8500-8s   or\n\nillustrated his knowledge of the government’s interpretation of the\n\n8500-8.     The jury’s duty is to decide what to believe.               This\n\ncredibility dispute must be resolved in favor of the verdict.               The\n\ndistrict court did not err in denying Hatch’s motion for a judgment\n\nof acquittal.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

All credibility disputes are to be resolved in the verdict's favor, and this \"court `need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2001)). These are \"daunting hurdles.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001, the government must prove that [Hatch] knowingly and willfully made or used a false writing or document, in relation to a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States government, with knowledge of its falsity.\" <i>United States v. McGauley,</i> 279 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The new 8500-8 was not fundamentally ambiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch insists that the new 8500-8 is so fundamentally ambiguous that it cannot support his convictions. According to Hatch, since he had not included his 1983 and 1995 OUI convictions on the 8500-8 for the respective years of each conviction, his \"PREVIOUSLY REPORTED &#8212; NO CHANGE\" statement is not false because there was no change from the previous respective year's form. Because there had been no convictions since the 1999 8500-8 was completed and Hatch was only indicted for the years 1999 through 2003, he insists that his statements were literally true in that his convictions were not noted on prior 8500-8s. Further, Hatch suggests that because the \"Conviction and/or Administrative Action History\" section asked whether he had a \"History of [] any convictions(s)\" for OUIs, this \"could call for a response to the fact of the history rather than the contents of the history. As to the fact of a history, the response `no change' would be literally true.\" In addition, he submits that the division of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" section into different boxes on the 8500-8, one for \"true medical conditions\" and one for conviction history, raises an ambiguity as to whether the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" directive also applied to his conviction history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Hatch's arguments because the 8500-8 is not fundamentally ambiguous: Hatch was required to disclose any and all OUI convictions. Any OUI convictions fall expressly under the heading \"Conviction and/or Administrative Action History,\" which is sequentially numbered as part of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" question. It is manifest that he realized that the question was unequivocal because he continued to include Items \"E\" (hay fever or allergy), \"U\" (admission to hospital), and \"V\" (1978 OUI conviction) on earlier 8500-8s. These remarks are indicative of his understanding that his 1978 OUI, and thus two subsequent OUIs, were part of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" section and subject to its instructions. <i>See United States v. Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir.2001) (Defendant's arguments that he \"misunderstood the question\" and \"lacked knowledge that travelers' checks were included in the definition of `monetary instruments'\" were belied by the customs form's plain language, his accurate answers to other questions on the same form, and his understanding that travelers' checks were \"monetary instruments\" on a prior visit to the United States). Because an applicant's history of OUI convictions is marked as Item \"V\" on all 8500-8s, Hatch knew he had to include all OUIs on the 8500-8. The \"Instructions Page\" even advised that if an applicant had been convicted of an OUI, the conviction must be described in detail. <i>See United States v. Doherty,</i> 867 F.2d 47, 69 (1st Cir.1989) (A defendant is not \"immune from prosecution for perjury whenever some ambiguity can be found by an implausibly strained reading of the questions he is asked.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a situation where Hatch's response was \"literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.\" <i>See Bronston v. United States,</i> 409 U.S. 352, 353, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). Moreover, Hatch's reliance on <i>United States v. Manapat,</i> 928 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1991), is misplaced. In <i>Manapat,</i> the defendant behaved exactly as Hatch: she omitted three convictions from the 8500-8 and later claimed that she was confused by the ambiguous form. The <i>Manapat</i> court agreed, acknowledging that \"[a]lthough the single statements `Record of traffic convictions,' or `Record of other convictions' may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing when buried in a list headed `Medical History' and purportedly concerned with medical conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Manapat</i> is readily distinguishable from the case <i>sub judice.</i> It is only persuasive and not binding on this court. Further, the 8500-8 at issue in <i>Manapat</i> was the original 8500-8 Hatch filled out in 1982; this appeal concerns the new 8500-8 that Hatch began filling out in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no fundamental ambiguity here. Hatch's motions for judgments of acquittal were rightly denied, and the issue was properly submitted to the jury. <i>See United States v. Finucan,</i> 708 F.2d 838, 848 (1st Cir.1983) (\"[W]here an answer may or may not be false depending upon possible interpretations of an ambiguous question, it is for the jury to decide whether the defendant has committed perjury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Hatch's statement was not literally true and the government presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch also argues that because there was a reasonable interpretation of the OUI conviction question under which his answer was true, the district court erred in denying his motion for judgments of acquittal. <i>See United States v. Rowe,</i> 144 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[I]n a false statement prosecution, an answer to a question is not fraudulent if there is an objectively reasonable interpretation of the question under which the answer is not even false.\"). Hatch submits two allegedly reasonable interpretations of his \"NO CHANGE\" answer that would make it literally true: 1) it referred to his history of criminal conviction which, as a condition, had not changed since he had a history before and continued to have a history; 2) in the years in question&#8212;1999-2003&#8212; there had been \"no change\" since the filing of the previous year's form. Nevertheless, it is evident that Hatch knew his answer was false and that his other two OUI convictions must be included on the new 8500-8. He presented these arguments at trial and the jury rejected them. Given the \"daunting\" standard of review, we refuse to impugn the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The determination as to [Hatch's] state of mind&#8212;his belief in the untruthfulness of his statement&#8212;is one which a jury is `best equipped' to perform.\" <i>United States v. Reveron Martinez,</i> 836 F.2d 684, 689 (1st Cir.1988). This court must defer to the jury's verdict. <i>See United States v. McNatt,</i> 813 F.2d 499, 502 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[T]he prosecutor need only produce that quantum of evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact <i>could</i> find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\"). The government proved, and a rational jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, that the only sensible reading of Question 18 demanded that Hatch report his entire OUI history. <i>See Finucan,</i> 708 F.2d at 848; <i>United States v. Kehoe,</i> 562 F.2d 65, 68-69 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1977) (jury decides \"whether an answer was or was not literally true\"). Hatch's answer \"ITEMS E, U, V PREVIOUSLY REPORTED NO CHANGE\" was false because his OUI history had changed &#8212; there had been two changes &#8212; and is reflected by the continuous inclusion of his 1978 OUI conviction on the annual 8500-8. <i>See Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d at 63. Hatch understood that Item \"V\" was part of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" section and knew that all OUIs must be disclosed. Resultantly, his \"NO CHANGE\" answer would <i>only</i> be true if he had disclosed the change in his OUI conviction history on prior forms, pursuant to FAA requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was instructed that \"[i]f the [8500-8's] question can be interpreted in several ways, then the government has to prove that the answer is false under any reasonable interpretation.\" Accordingly, the jury necessarily concluded that Hatch's interpretation was unreasonable. <i>See Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (\"The rule that juries are presumed to follow their instructions is a pragmatic one. . . .\"); <i>United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 344 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch also contends that neither his statements nor his March 13, 2003 letter (in which he attempted to explain his omissions) was sufficient for the government to meet its burden of proof, i.e., that \"NO CHANGE\" was false under any interpretation of the question. As for Hatch's statements, the jury was free to attach whatever significance to the statements it believed was warranted. As for the letter, Hatch asserts that the jury could have believed it was either directed toward the 1984 and 1996 8500-8s or illustrated his knowledge of the government's interpretation of the 8500-8. The jury's duty is to decide what to believe. This credibility dispute must be resolved in favor of the verdict. The district court did not err in denying Hatch's motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

According to Hatch, since he had not included his 1983 and 1995 OUI convictions on the 8500-8 for the respective years of each conviction, his \"PREVIOUSLY REPORTED &#8212; NO CHANGE\" statement is not false because there was no change from the previous respective year's form. Because there had been no convictions since the 1999 8500-8 was completed and Hatch was only indicted for the years 1999 through 2003, he insists that his statements were literally true in that his convictions were not noted on prior 8500-8s. Further, Hatch suggests that because the \"Conviction and/or Administrative Action History\" section asked whether he had a \"History of [] any convictions(s)\" for OUIs, this \"could call for a response to the fact of the history rather than the contents of the history. As to the fact of a history, the response `no change' would be literally true.\" In addition, he submits that the division of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" section into different boxes on the 8500-8, one for \"true medical conditions\" and one for conviction history, raises an ambiguity as to whether the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" directive also applied to his conviction history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Hatch's arguments because the 8500-8 is not fundamentally ambiguous: Hatch was required to disclose any and all OUI convictions. Any OUI convictions fall expressly under the heading \"Conviction and/or Administrative Action History,\" which is sequentially numbered as part of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" question. It is manifest that he realized that the question was unequivocal because he continued to include Items \"E\" (hay fever or allergy), \"U\" (admission to hospital), and \"V\" (1978 OUI conviction) on earlier 8500-8s. These remarks are indicative of his understanding that his 1978 OUI, and thus two subsequent OUIs, were part of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" section and subject to its instructions. <i>See United States v. Sebaggala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199496\"><a href=\"/opinion/199496/united-states-v-sebaggala/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.2001) (Defendant's arguments that he \"misunderstood the question\" and \"lacked knowledge that travelers' checks were included in the definition of `monetary instruments'\" were belied by the customs form's plain language, his accurate answers to other questions on the same form, and his understanding that travelers' checks were \"monetary instruments\" on a prior visit to the United States). Because an applicant's history of OUI convictions is marked as Item \"V\" on all 8500-8s, Hatch knew he had to include all OUIs on the 8500-8. The \"Instructions Page\" even advised that if an applicant had been convicted of an OUI, the conviction must be described in detail. <i>See United States v. Doherty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518089\"><a href=\"/opinion/518089/united-states-v-thomas-k-doherty-united-states-of-america-v-nelson-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.1989) (A defendant is not \"immune from prosecution for perjury whenever some ambiguity can be found by an implausibly strained reading of the questions he is asked.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a situation where Hatch's response was \"literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.\" <i>See Bronston v.

In <i>Manapat,</i> the defendant behaved exactly as Hatch: she omitted three convictions from the 8500-8 and later claimed that she was confused by the ambiguous form. The <i>Manapat</i> court agreed, acknowledging that \"[a]lthough the single statements `Record of traffic convictions,' or `Record of other convictions' may not be ambiguous standing alone, they become quite confusing when buried in a list headed `Medical History' and purportedly concerned with medical conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Manapat</i> is readily distinguishable from the case <i>sub judice.</i> It is only persuasive and not binding on this court. Further, the 8500-8 at issue in <i>Manapat</i> was the original 8500-8 Hatch filled out in 1982; this appeal concerns the new 8500-8 that Hatch began filling out in 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no fundamental ambiguity here. Hatch's motions for judgments of acquittal were rightly denied, and the issue was properly submitted to the jury. <i>See United States v. Finucan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419603\"><a href=\"/opinion/419603/united-states-v-richard-finucan-and-dee-rocca/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span>, 848 (1st Cir.1983) (\"[W]here an answer may or may not be false depending upon possible interpretations of an ambiguous question, it is for the jury to decide whether the defendant has committed perjury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Hatch's statement was not literally true and the government presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hatch also argues that because there was a reasonable interpretation of the OUI conviction question under which his answer was true, the district court erred in denying his motion for judgments of acquittal. <i>See United States v. Rowe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197937\"><a href=\"/opinion/197937/united-states-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[I]n a false statement prosecution, an answer to a question is not fraudulent if there is an objectively reasonable interpretation of the question under which the answer is not even false.\"). Hatch submits two allegedly reasonable interpretations of his \"NO CHANGE\" answer that would make it literally true: 1) it referred to his history of criminal conviction which, as a condition, had not changed since he had a history before and continued to have a history; 2) in the years in question&#8212;1999-2003&#8212; there had been \"no change\" since the filing of the previous year's form. Nevertheless, it is evident that Hatch knew his answer was false and that his other two OUI convictions must be included on the new 8500-8. He presented these arguments at trial and the jury rejected them. Given the \"daunting\" standard of review, we refuse to impugn the jury's verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The determination as to [Hatch's] state of mind&#8212;his belief in the untruthfulness of his statement&#8212;is one which a jury is `best equipped' to perform.\" <i>United States v.

The government proved, and a rational jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, that the only sensible reading of Question 18 demanded that Hatch report his entire OUI history. <i>See Finucan,</i> 708 F.2d at 848; <i>United States v. Kehoe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349213\"><a href=\"/opinion/349213/united-states-v-robert-j-kehoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 68-69 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1977) (jury decides \"whether an answer was or was not literally true\"). Hatch's answer \"ITEMS E, U, V PREVIOUSLY REPORTED NO CHANGE\" was false because his OUI history had changed &#8212; there had been two changes &#8212; and is reflected by the continuous inclusion of his 1978 OUI conviction on the annual 8500-8. <i>See Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d at 63. Hatch understood that Item \"V\" was part of the \"MEDICAL HISTORY\" section and knew that all OUIs must be disclosed. Resultantly, his \"NO CHANGE\" answer would <i>only</i> be true if he had disclosed the change in his OUI conviction history on prior forms, pursuant to FAA requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was instructed that \"[i]f the [8500-8's] question can be interpreted in several ways, then the government has to prove that the answer is false under any reasonable interpretation.\" Accordingly, the jury necessarily concluded that Hatch's interpretation was unreasonable. <i>See Richardson v.

As for Hatch's statements, the jury was free to attach whatever significance to the statements it believed was warranted. As for the letter, Hatch asserts that the jury could have believed it was either directed toward the 1984 and 1996 8500-8s or illustrated his knowledge of the government's interpretation of the 8500-8. The jury's duty is to decide what to believe. This credibility dispute must be resolved in favor of the verdict.
