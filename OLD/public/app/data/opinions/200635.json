Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                and Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Wilma E. Reverón-Collazo for appellant.\n     Anabel Rodríguez with whom Carl Schuster, Rafael Lázaro-Castro\nand Schuster Usera & Aguiló, LLP were on brief for appellee Janssen\nOrtho, LLC.\n\n\n                           September 5, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam. This is an appeal in a gender discrimination\n\ncase brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000-e (2000).    Applying the familiar McDonnell-Douglas\n\nframework, the district court determined that plaintiff Nidia\n\nAcevedo had established a prima facie case of gender discrimination\n\nagainst    her   former   employer,    Johnson   &   Johnson   Janssen\n\nPharmaceutical (\"Janssen\"), based primarily on four occasions when\n\nJanssen promoted or appointed men instead of Acevedo to positions\n\nsought by the latter and for which she was arguably qualified.     See\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).\n\n           However, under McDonnell Douglas all that a prima facie\n\ncase does in the first instance is shift the burden to the employer\n\nto offer legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the challenged\n\nactions.   411 U.S. at 802-03.   Here the district court determined\n\nthat Janssen had offered \"ample evidence\" to fulfill its burden by\n\nproviding plausible non-discriminatory reasons for the company's\n\ndecisions in each of the four instances.     Indeed, according to the\n\ndistrict court, the evidence suggested that the men selected over\n\nAcevedo were actually \"better qualified for the positions\" than she\n\nwas.\n\n           Weighing the company's motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court determined that Acevedo had not provided sufficient\n\nevidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Janssen's\n\narticulated reasons for the controverted decisions were pretextual\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\for that the company acted at least in part with discriminatory\n\nanimus.    See Mulero-Rodríguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 673-74\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).     The district court therefore granted summary\n\njudgment to Janssen.     Acevedo now appeals, and our review is de\n\nnovo.    Gu v. Boston Police Dep't, 312 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            That a qualified woman was passed over four times in\n\nfavor of men is certainly a useful foundation for building a gender\n\ndiscrimination case; but in this instance the company provided\n\nplausible and supported reasons for its conclusions that the men\n\nwere even better qualified. Acevedo could have sought to show that\n\nthe explanations were false or implausible and she might then at\n\nleast have argued that the false explanations and the foundation\n\ntogether comprised enough evidence to get to a jury. But the\n\nexplanations were not effectively countered.\n\n            Or alternatively she could have sought to show that there\n\nwas independent evidence of gender bias associated with one or more\n\nof the decisions.   Yet, though she bore the burden of proof to show\n\nintentional discrimination, Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine,\n\n450 U.S. 248, 253, 256 (1981), she did not persuasively pursue this\n\ncourse either; we have considered the arguments on this point made\n\nin her brief but agree with the district court that a     jury could\n\nnot rationally conclude that gender discrimination was at work.\n\n            The surrounding circumstances also work against Acevedo's\n\nclaim.     The \"all boys club\" of upper-level managers to which\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAcevedo repeatedly refers had at least one high-ranking female\n\nmember,   Juanita   Hawkins.   When   later   in   the    saga   Acevedo's\n\nresponsibilities were significantly pruned to allow her to focus on\n\nher   core   activities--admittedly   well    performed--many      of   the\n\nreallocated tasks were given to another woman.           And when Acevedo\n\nannounced that she was quitting, Janssen managers apparently made\n\nstrenuous efforts to persuade her not to leave.            None of these\n\nelements precludes gender discrimination; but their presence, in\n\nthe absence of any affirmative evidence of gender based animus,\n\nmakes this a very straightforward case.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
