R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                      For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 02-1271\n\n                          UNITED STATES,\n\n                            Appellee,\n\n                                v.\n\n                        ALBERTO SOTO-LARA,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond E. Gillespie on brief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Heidi E.\nBrieger, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 17, 2003\n\f           Per Curiam.     Alberto Soto-Lara pleaded guilty to\n\nparticipating in a cocaine distribution conspiracy.          He now\n\nappeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred\n\nby increasing his offense level on the ground that Soto-Lara\n\nwas a leader or organizer of criminal activity that involved\n\nfive or more participants.       See U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) (Nov.\n\n2001). Soto-Lara concedes that he cannot \"seriously challenge\"\n\nthe district court's finding that five or more participants\n\nwere involved in the criminal activity.       His appeal turns on\n\nwhether the district court's findings and the underlying record\n\nadequately support the conclusion that Soto-Lara acted as a\n\n\"leader or organizer.\"      Factors a court should consider in\n\ndistinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of\n\nmere   management   or   supervision   \"include   the   exercise   of\n\ndecision making authority, the nature of participation in the\n\ncommission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the\n\nclaimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the\n\nnature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of\n\ncontrol and authority exercised over others....\"        See U.S.S.G.\n\n§3B1.1, comment. note 4.\n\n           We review for clear error, see, e.g., United States\n\nv. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 26 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122\n\nS. Ct. 1215 (2002), and find none. Soto-Lara concedes that the\n\nrecord supports the conclusion that he exercised decisionmaking\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f  authority and control with respect to the March 30, 1999\n\n  transaction that resulted in the arrest of one of his couriers\n\n  (Carmona).   In that instance, Soto-Lara provided Carmona with\n\n  a Nissan Pathfinder which concealed one kilogram of cocaine, as\n\n  well as instructions regarding the time, place, and recipient\n\n  of the delivery.   Those of higher rank in drug distribution\n\n  conspiracies frequently use subordinates as go-betweens to\n\n  limit their own apparent involvement.    See United States v.\n\n  Brown, 298 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir.)(affirming 2-level role in\n\n  offense enhancement), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 710 (2002). The\n\n  record supports an inference that Carmona and the three other\n\n  participants that the district court identified were at Soto-\n\n  Lara's \"beck and call\" for just this purpose. And, contrary to\n\n  Soto-Lara's contention on appeal, we think that there is\n\n  sufficient evidence of the other factors listed in § 3B1.1,\n\n  comment. n.4, to support the Leader/Organizer adjustment.1\n\n\n     1\n         Apart from the authority and control that Soto-Lara\nexercised over Carmona with respect to the March 30, 1999\ntransaction, the district court supportably found that the\nconspiracy was \"extensive,\" as it spanned two states and was\noperative for at least three years. There was further evidence\nthat Soto-Lara \"ma[de] all the decisions,\" such as who was allowed\nto sell larger quantities of cocaine for him, and who deserved free\ncocaine as a reward for generating a lot of sales. The record also\nsuggests that Soto-Lara retained a greater share of the profits\nfrom the cocaine sales that he made to Louis Asermely and that he\nsupplied various cars to the conspiracy to enable his couriers to\nevade detection. Although the district court did not refer to all\nof this evidence, we may affirm if \"the reasons for the judge's\nchoice are obvious or if the record as a whole provides an\nexplanation.\" United States v. Medina, 167 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.\n\n                                -3-\n\f             To be sure, it appears that after Soto-Lara's arrest\n\n  his codefendants engaged in drug transactions that did not\n\n  implicate Soto-Lara.       But the fact that these participants\n\n  sometimes functioned independently did not require the district\n\n  court to discredit other evidence to the contrary.             \"[T]he\n\n  evidence   need   not   have   compelled   the   inference   that   was\n\n  ultimately drawn.       All that is required is that the court's\n\n  choice among competing inferences be a plausible one.\"         Brown,\n\n 298 F.3d at 123.          We cannot say that the district court\n\n clearly erred by adding four levels under these circumstances.\n\n See, e.g., United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n  1997)(en banc)(\"when competing inferences plausibly can be\n\n  drawn from a set of facts, the factfinder's choice between them\n\n  cannot be clearly erroneous.\"(citation omitted)).\n\n             The government's motion for summary disposition is\n\n  allowed and the judgment of conviction (and sentence) is\n\n affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n1999).
