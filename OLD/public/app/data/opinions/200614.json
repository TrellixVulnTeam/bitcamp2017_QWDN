In November 1999, a\n\nPuerto Rico grand jury returned a single-count indictment charging\n\nDefendant, Israel Navedo-Concepción, also known as “Gallo,” and\n\nseven other named co-defendants with conspiracy to possess with the\n\nintent to distribute cocaine in amounts which exceed five (5)\n\nkilograms and heroin in amounts which exceed one (1) kilogram, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.   The indictment alleged a four-year\n\nconspiracy between the named defendants and others unknown to the\n\ngrand jury to distribute narcotics in the La Perla section of Old\n\nSan Juan.     All named co-defendants pled guilty pursuant to plea\n\nagreements.    Defendant, however, proceeded to trial.   Following a\n\nseven-day trial, the jury convicted Defendant of the sole count in\n\nthe indictment.     The district court sentenced Defendant to 151\n\nmonths imprisonment.\n\n            Defendant appeals, arguing (1) the district court erred\n\nby failing to sua sponte deliver a limiting instruction on the use\n\nof prior inconsistent statements by a witness; (2) the prosecutor’s\n\nimproper remarks during closing argument warrant a new trial; (3)\n\nthe district court plainly erred by instructing the jury about the\n\ncontent of a witness’ testimony; (4) the district court erred by\n\nnot making an independent relevant conduct finding as to the drug\n\nquantity attributable to Defendant; and (5) the district court\n\nerred by failing to give a reason pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)\n\nfor imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range.       The\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fparties are familiar with the facts of the case, and we will not\n\nrepeat them here except where necessary. We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.          We affirm the district court on\n\nDefendant’s first four issues.        But we remand for resentencing in\n\naccordance with § 3553(c) due to the district court’s failure to\n\nstate in open court reasons for the selected sentence.\n\n                                      A.\n\n          Defendant      first    argues   the   district   court    erred   by\n\nfailing to sua sponte give a limiting instruction on how the jury\n\nshould treat a witness’ prior inconsistent statements.                   Because\n\ndefense counsel did not object, Defendant concedes we review this\n\nissue for plain error.         Under the four-part plain error inquiry,\n\n(1) an error must have been committed; (2) the error must be plain\n\nor obvious; (3) the plain error must affect substantial rights,\n\nwhich generally means that it must have been prejudicial; and (4)\n\nthe error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation     of   judicial     proceedings.      See   United     States   v.\n\nPena-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 29 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33 (1993)).\n\n          On    direct   examination,      defense   witness      Luis   Mojica\n\nBultron (“Bultron”) testified under oath that he did not recognize\n\nDefendant, that he did not sell drugs for Defendant, and that he\n\nhad not seen Defendant selling drugs in La Perla.            This testimony\n\ncontradicted the testimony of the Government’s witness, Catherine\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fRivera Valle (“Valle”), who testified she and Bultron bought drugs\n\nfrom Defendant.     On cross examination, Bultron acknowledged he had\n\nheard of a person nicknamed “Gallo”, but denied that he told FBI\n\nagent Scott Nielson in interviews that “Gallo” sold narcotics or\n\nthat he had personally purchased heroin from Gallo.                   Bultron also\n\ndenied he    told   Sgt.    Pablo    Quiñones      or   other   law    enforcement\n\nofficials that Gallo sold “champagne”1 heroin.              Bultron admitted on\n\ncross examination that he told agents of a meeting that a man known\n\nas    “Sandro”   called    and   that   someone     named   “Gallo”      attended.\n\nBultron also admitted he had seen Defendant in a picture shown to\n\nhim by law enforcement, but stated he was unsure whether the\n\npicture shown to him at trial was the same picture.\n\n            In response to this testimony, the Government called\n\nSergeant Pablo Quiñones in rebuttal.                Quiñones testified that,\n\nduring an interview, he had shown Bultron a photograph of Defendant\n\nand    Bultron   identified      Defendant    as   “Gallo.”      Quiñones     also\n\ntestified that Bultron told him in an interview that Gallo would\n\nmeet with others to form an enterprise and to discuss the drug\n\ntrade in La Perla.        Quiñones also testified that Bultron told him\n\nthat “Gallo” sold champagne heroin.\n\n            Under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A), a declarant’s prior\n\ninconsistent statements are hearsay and inadmissible as substantive\n\n\n       1\n      “Champagne” heroin refers to the color of packaging in which\nthe heroin was wrapped, and champagne heroin apparently was of\nsuperior quality.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fevidence unless they were made “under oath subject to the penalty\n\nof perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or at a\n\ndeposition.”      Fed.   R.   Evid.    801(d)(1)(A);    see    also    Finn   v.\n\nConsolidated Rail Corp., 782 F.2d 13, 16 n.4 (1st Cir. 1986).2\n\nBultron’s statements to Quiñones were not made under oath at a\n\ntrial or   like    proceeding,   but    rather   in   interviews      with    law\n\nenforcement    authorities.           Thus,   Quiñones’       testimony       was\n\ninadmissible for the truth of the matter asserted.                    Defendant\n\nconcedes, however, the testimony was admissible as impeachment\n\nevidence. See United States v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 558 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (concluding a witness’ prior inconsistent statement is\n\nadmissible to attack the witness’ credibility under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n613(b)).   Despite this concession, Defendant argues the district\n\ncourt had a duty to sua sponte deliver a limiting instruction\n\ninforming the jury that they could not consider Bultron’s prior\n\ninconsistent statements for their truth, but only as they bore on\n\nhis credibility.\n\n           We do not find plain error in the trial court’s failure\n\nto sua sponte deliver a limiting instruction in this circumstance.\n\nPursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 105–\n\n\n     2\n      Defendant notes that under Rule 801(d)(1)(C), a prior\nstatement by a witness is not hearsay if it was “one of\nidentification of a person made after perceiving the person.”\nConsequently, Defendant agrees Quiñones’ testimony that Bultron\npreviously identified the person in the photograph as “Gallo” was\nnot hearsay, and thus could be considered substantively by the\njury.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          When evidence which is admissible as to one\n          party or for one purpose but not admissible as\n          to another party or for another purpose is\n          admitted, the court, upon request, shall\n          restrict the evidence to its proper scope and\n          instruct the jury accordingly.\n\nId. (emphasis added).   Based on the Rule’s language, we previously\n\nhave concluded that the failure to request an instruction waives\n\nthe argument on appeal.    United States v. Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d\n\n232, 238 (1st Cir. 1988). Consequently, Defendant’s arguments that\n\nthe district court erred at all, or that the error was plain and\n\nobvious, are questionable.\n\n          But even assuming the district court plainly erred, the\n\nalleged error does not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.      The jury heard both of\n\nBultron’s statements and was able to observe both his demeanor and\n\nQuiñones’ demeanor.     Both witnesses were subject to direct and\n\ncross   examination.      The   offered   testimony   did   not   concern\n\nDefendant’s prior convictions or prior uncharged acts, and was not\n\nhighly inflammatory or so prejudicial that the district court\n\nshould have offered a limiting instruction absent a request from\n\nthe defense. Compare United States v. DeGeratto, 876 F.2d 576, 584\n\n(7th Cir. 1989) (suggesting in dicta that even if cross examination\n\nabout uncharged prior bad acts was properly admitted under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 404(b), district court had a duty to sua sponte offer a\n\nlimiting instruction on highly prejudicial testimony); Dawson v.\n\nCowan, 531 F.2d 1374, 1377 (6th Cir. 1976) (finding plain error in\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe failure to give a limiting instruction regarding evidence of a\n\nprior conviction for attempted rape where the defendant was facing\n\nboth a principal charge of attempted rape and a habitual offender\n\ncharge).    We find no special circumstances in this case that would\n\nrequire    the    district    court    to    sua   sponte   offer    a     limiting\n\ninstruction.      See United States v. Malik, 928 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (finding no plain error where district court did not sua\n\nsponte offer a limiting instruction on law enforcement agent’s\n\ntestimony that defendant made statements to agent inconsistent with\n\ndefendant’s trial testimony).\n\n                                        B.\n\n             Defendant   next    argues      the   prosecutor     made     improper\n\nclosing arguments by misrepresenting the evidence and vouching for\n\na witness.\n\n            1.    Misrepresentation of Evidence\n\n            Defendant first contends that, in closing argument, the\n\nprosecutor misrepresented Bultron’s testimony.                  The prosecutor\n\nstated that although Bultron was evasive and hesitant to answer\n\nquestions, he eventually testified that he knew Gallo, and knew\n\nGallo ran a drug business.             Defense counsel objected to this\n\ncharacterization, to which the district court stated, “Let’s move\n\non.”      The    prosecutor   then    continued    and   stated     that    Bultron\n\ntestified Gallo’s product was champagne.                 The prosecutor also\n\nstated Bultron admitted he knew that Gallo, Sandro, and the rest of\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthe “committee” had Friday meetings in which they organized the La\n\nPerla drug trade.\n\n           “This    Court   has   fashioned      a   three    prong   test   for\n\nexamining whether the prosecution’s misconduct ‘so poisoned the\n\nwell’ that the trial’s outcome was likely affected, thus warranting\n\na new trial.”      United States v. Joyner, 191 F.3d 47, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n1999). “We examine: (1) whether the prosecutor’s conduct was\n\nisolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether the trial court gave a\n\nstrong and explicit cautionary instruction; and (3) whether it is\n\nlikely that any prejudice surviving the judge’s instruction could\n\nhave affected the outcome of the case.”               Id.     Where Defendant\n\ntimely objected, we review de novo the question of whether the\n\ncomment was     improper    and   review   for   abuse   of    discretion    the\n\nquestion whether the misconduct, if any, warrants a new trial.\n\nUnited States v. Hernandez, 218 F.3d 58, 68 (1st Cir. 2000).             Where\n\nthe defendant has not objected, we review for plain error.              Id. at\n\n69.\n\n           The record reveals some of the prosecutor’s statements\n\nabout   Bultron’s    statements    were    not   fully      supported   by   the\n\ntestimony.    Bultron did not testify that he knew “Gallo,” although\n\nhe eventually admitted under cross examination that he previously\n\ntold an FBI agent that he knew someone named Gallo who lived in\n\nWipe Out and operated a store there.        Bultron did not testify about\n\nFriday meetings as stated by the prosecutor, nor did Quiñones\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\ftestify that Bultron previously told agents about Friday committee\n\nmeetings.     Only Valle testified about Friday meetings.                    Bultron\n\nalso did not testify that he observed any committee meetings or\n\nthat Gallo attended those meetings, or that the meetings concerned\n\nrunning the drug trade in La Perla.                 On cross examination, he\n\nadmitted he previously told agents about two meetings Sandro called\n\nwhich “Gallo” attended.            The prosecutor did not inquire into the\n\nsubstance   of    the    meetings,     however.         Thus,   no   testimony    was\n\nproduced that the meetings to which Bultron was referring involved\n\ndiscussions about the rules of the La Perla drug trade as the\n\nprosecutor stated in closing argument.              And Bultron denied that he\n\nknew Gallo sold champagne or heroin or that he personally purchased\n\ndrugs from Gallo, contrary to the prosecutor’s closing statements.\n\nHe further denied that he told agents this information.                           The\n\nprosecutor seemed to discuss Quiñones’ testimony that Bultron made\n\nthese   statements       to   agents   in     earlier    interviews     as   if   the\n\nstatements were Bultron’s live testimony.                 Thus, the prosecutor’s\n\nstatements about Bultron’s testimony misstated the record in some\n\nrespects.\n\n            We agree with Defendant these comments were improper.\n\nBut we do not find sufficient prejudice to warrant a new trial.\n\nDefendant   presented         no   evidence   the   prosecutor’s       conduct    was\n\ndeliberate,      and    the   misstatements      were    isolated     to   this   one\n\nwitness.      The witness’ testimony was less than clear on some\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fpoints, and the witness was impeached by prior statements to\n\ninvestigators.     Thus, the prosecutor may have innocently, albeit\n\nnegligently, confused Bultron’s live testimony and the impeachment\n\ntestimony.      In final instructions, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury as follows:\n\n           The statements that the lawyers made are not\n           to be considered by you either as evidence in\n           the case, which comes only from witnesses and\n           exhibits, or as [] instruct[ions] on the law,\n           which will come only from me.            These\n           statements and arguments are intended to help\n           you understand the issues and the evidence as\n           it comes in, as well as the positions taken by\n           both sides.\n\nAlthough not contemporaneous, the instruction informs the jury that\n\nthe statements of the lawyers are not evidence.            We conclude the\n\nmisstatements were not so egregious, inflammatory, or pervasive\n\nthat they could have affected the outcome of the case.3\n\n           2.    Vouching\n\n           Defendant        also    challenges    comments       during     the\n\nprosecutor’s closing arguments which he alleges constitute improper\n\nvouching for a witness and for the Government’s overall case.\n\nDuring closing argument, defense counsel suggested witness Jose\n\nMercado   Febles    lied    about   a   meeting   among   drug    dealers    on\n\nThanksgiving Day which Defendant allegedly attended.                  Defense\n\n\n\n     3\n      Defendant also asserts the prosecutor misrepresented the\ntestimony of Valle and Quiñones. After reviewing the record, we\nconclude the prosecutor’s description of these witnesses’ testimony\nconstituted reasonable argument based on the actual testimony.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcounsel argued Febles was lying about this meeting because Febles\n\nclaimed another dealer, Papo Aviles, was present at the meeting\n\nwhen Aviles actually was in jail on Thanksgiving Day.          In response\n\nto   this    argument,   the   prosecutor   argued   defense   counsel    was\n\nmisreading and misinterpreting the testimony, and thus Febles “had\n\nnot lied.”     Defendant admits he did not object to the prosecutor’s\n\nstatement in closing argument that Febles “did not lie.”           Thus we\n\nreview this issue for plain error.\n\n              The prosecutor’s choice of words was unfortunate.          What\n\nthe prosecutor meant was that the defense had not shown Febles\n\nlied.    According to the prosecutor’s view of the testimony, Febles\n\ndid not testify that Aviles was at the Thanksgiving Day meeting.\n\nHence his testimony was not contradictory with Aviles being in\n\nprison on Thanksgiving Day.         While we caution prosecutors to be\n\nmore careful in their choice of words, we do not find this comment\n\naffected Defendant’s substantial rights, nor seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nThe comment was isolated to one statement regarding one witness,\n\nand the meaning of the comment was not the usual vouching problem\n\nwhere the prosecutor assures the jury the witness is telling the\n\ntruth.      See United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion, 335 F.3d 28, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (defining the “archetypal example of vouching” as\n\n“a prosecutor’s claim that the witness should be believed because\n\nthe prosecutor–a representative of the government–believes the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwitness . . . .”).    Rather, the prosecutor argued the defense was\n\nmischaracterizing Febles’ testimony.      Instead of stating Febles\n\n“did not lie,” the prosecutor should have said the defense had not\n\ncaught Febles in an obvious lie.\n\n          Defendant also challenges the prosecutor’s comments in\n\nclosing argument that the Government had presented only a “sample”\n\nof the evidence.     Specifically, the prosecutor argued--\n\n          And what my colleague Miss Sulzbach told you\n          in her opening statement is that she would\n          give you a sample, an opportunity to hear from\n          three people who would tell you about the drug\n          trade in La Perla.\n          . . .\n          What you heard from the government ladies and\n          gentlemen was a sample, if you think this week\n          trial was long, if we had brought in every one\n          that knew about drugs in La Perla we would\n          have been here for months.\n          . . .\n          You have to realize that what the government\n          brought you was a sample. It wasn’t a day to\n          day record of everything that went on in La\n          Perla drug world. It was a sample and that is\n          all we are asking you consider, this sample of\n          activity in La Perla drug world involving the\n          defendant and the [other] individuals involved\n          in this committee or this group.\n          . . .\n          And you saw a sample, not only the drug\n          dealings that went on but just a very small\n          portion and the government has proven its case\n          beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn response, defense counsel in closing argued if this was just a\n\n“sample,” the Government should have introduced more compelling\n\nevidence of Defendant’s participation in the drug trade, such as\n\nvideo, photographs, or tape recordings of controlled buys.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f            The prosecutor’s use of the “sample” language constitutes\n\nerror.      A    prosecutor    may    not    suggest   to    the   jury   that   the\n\nGovernment has more evidence establishing a defendant’s guilt than\n\nit has presented to the jury.               See United States v. Balsam, 203\n\nF.3d 72, 88 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[A] prosecutor may not . . . indicate\n\nthat facts outside the jury’s cognizance support the testimony of\n\nthe government’s witnesses.\") (internal quotation and citation\n\nomitted).       Although a close case, we conclude the prosecutor’s ill\n\nadvised statements did not prejudice Defendant, nor seriously\n\neffect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\n\n            Most of the comments suggested the evidence presented was\n\njust a sample of the overall drug scene in La Perla and the\n\noverarching investigation of the drug trade in La Perla, without\n\nspecifying that the Government had more information specifically\n\ngoing to Defendant’s guilt.             In reaching a verdict, the jury\n\nnecessarily       had   to   accept    or    reject    the    testimony    of    the\n\nGovernment’s cooperating witnesses.              The prosecutor’s “sampling”\n\ncomments made in closing argument likely did not weigh heavily in\n\nthis determination.          Either the jury believed the witnesses who\n\ntestified they bought from or sold drugs to Defendant, or they did\n\nnot.     Further, defense counsel was able to effectively use this\n\n“sampling” language in closing argument, further reducing any\n\npotential prejudice.          While we harshly condemn the Government’s\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fcomments in this case, we cannot say on plain error review that the\n\ncomments warrant reversal.\n\n                                       C.\n\n            Defendant next argues the trial court committed plain\n\nerror in instructing the jury when it asserted as fact that witness\n\nBultron testified he viewed a photograph of Defendant shown to him\n\nby law enforcement officers.         Defendant concedes he did not object\n\nto the challenged instruction, and hence we review for plain error.\n\nAt the close of the case, the court instructed the jury–\n\n            No[w], witness Luis Mojica Bult[r]on testified\n            that he viewed a photograph of the defendant\n            Israel Navedo Concepcion which was shown to\n            him by a law enforcement officer. The police\n            collect pictures of many people from many\n            different sources and for many different\n            purposes. The fact that the police or a law\n            enforcement officer had defendant’s picture\n            does not mean that he committed this or any\n            other crime, and it must have no effect on\n            you[r] consideration of this case.\n\nDefendant now claims Bultron did not testify that he had identified\n\nDefendant   from    a   photograph    shown   to    him   by   law   enforcement\n\nofficers, and thus the district court’s instruction erroneously\n\nresolved a contested factual issue.\n\n            The    district   court    did    not   misstate    the    evidence.\n\nBultron did in fact testify that he “viewed a photograph of the\n\ndefendant Israel Navedo Concepcion which was shown to him by a law\n\nenforcement officer.”          Under questioning by defense counsel,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fBultron denied he had seen Defendant in person, but admitted to\n\nseeing him in a photograph:\n\n           Q: Sir, tell the jury when was the first time\n           that you saw this gentleman?\n           A: The first time? Today.\n           Q: And before today?\n           A: Before today I had been shown a photo.\n           Q: Who showed you a photo?\n           . . .\n           A: The photo I saw it for the first time at\n           the C.I.C. in San Augustine.\n           . . .\n           Q: And after that first time, when was the\n           next time if any other time?\n           A: Second time was at the Department of\n           Justice.\n           Q: I ask you if any federal agent has shown\n           you a photo of my client?\n           A: Scott.\n           . . .\n           Q: Where was that, that Scott showed you a\n           photo of my client?\n           A: That was in the office of Domingo Alvarez.\n           . . .\n           Q: On that third occasion, who showed you the\n           photo of my client?\n           A: It was another federal agent, I was\n           brought.\n\nFollowing this colloquy, Bultron testified that the agents asked\n\nwhether he recognized the individual in the photographs, and he\n\ntold the agents he did not.        Thus, Bultron did testify that law\n\nenforcement authorities showed him a photo of Defendant, as the\n\ndistrict   court’s   instruction   indicated.    A   separate   question\n\nexisted about whether Bultron identified the person in that photo\n\nas “Gallo” the drug dealer from La Perla, but the district court’s\n\ninstruction did not speak to that issue.        The district court did\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fnot misstate the evidence or decide a contested fact issue for the\n\njury, and thus did not plainly err.\n\n                                           D.\n\n                Defendant next argues the district court erred by relying\n\non   the    jury    verdict    for   the    amount   of    cocaine    and   heroin\n\nattributable to Defendant as relevant conduct at sentencing.                  In a\n\ndrug conspiracy case, the jury should determine the existence of\n\nthe conspiracy as well as any facts about the conspiracy that will\n\nincrease the possible penalty for the crime of conviction beyond\n\nthe default statutory maximum.             Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d\n\n34, 42 (1st Cir. 2002).              But the judge should determine, at\n\nsentencing, the particulars regarding the involvement of each\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy.             Id. at 43.     “This means that once\n\nthe jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and\n\nquantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the\n\ndefault statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant\n\nguilty of participation in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may\n\ndetermine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and\n\nsentence him accordingly (so long as the sentence falls within the\n\nstatutory maximum made applicable by the jury's conspiracy-wide\n\ndrug quantity determination).”             Id.   Defendant thus contends that\n\nwhile the jury could find the overall conspiracy involved amounts\n\nexceeding those charged in the indictment, the district court\n\nfailed     to    make   an   individualized      determination   of    what   drug\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fquantities were reasonably foreseeable to Defendant specifically,\n\nand thus attributable to him as relevant conduct.\n\n            We disagree.      The district court instructed the jury in\n\nsuch   a   way   that   the   jury   had    to   find   Defendant   personally\n\nresponsible for the amounts charged in the indictment to find\n\nDefendant guilty of the overall conspiracy.             After instructing the\n\njury about the elements of conspiracy, the district charged the\n\njury as follows:\n\n            The crime of conspiracy is complete upon the\n            agreement to commit the underlying crime.\n                   The underlying crime is possession with\n            intent to distribute a controlled substance.\n            Israel Navedo Concepcion is accused of\n            conspiring with others to possess with the\n            intent to distribute to someone else cocaine,\n            in an amount exceeding five kilograms and\n            heroin in an amount exceeding on[e] kilogram\n            from on or about 1995 until the date of the\n            indictment. . . .     For you to find Israel\n            Navedo Concepcion guilty of this crime you\n            must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt:\n                   First, that from on or about 1995 until\n            the date of his indictment, Israel Navedo\n            Concepcion possessed cocaine, in an amount\n            exceeding five kilograms and heroin, in an\n            amount exceeding one kilogram, either actually\n            or constructively.\n                   Second, that he did so with the\n            specific intent to distribute the specified\n            amounts of cocaine and heroin over which he\n            had actual or constructive possession; and\n                   Third, that he did so knowingly and\n            intentionally.\n\n(Emphasis added).       Based on these instructions, the jury had to\n\nfind Defendant personally possessed with intent to distribute over\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine and over one kilogram of heroin.                  By\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\ffinding Defendant guilty, the jury made these factual findings\n\nagainst Defendant.\n\n            Even if the district court were at liberty to attribute\n\na lesser drug quantity to Defendant for sentencing purposes, the\n\ndistrict court expressed its belief that Defendant was personally\n\nresponsible for the drug quantities alleged in the indictment:\n\n            . . . I presided over this trial and I have no\n            question in my mind after viewing all of the\n            evidence and all of the witnesses and the jury\n            having found on this, but I as presiding judge\n            have no qualms or question whatsoever that\n            this defendant should be held accountable for\n            a minimum of the amount [charged] in the\n            indictment. For a minimum.\n\nThus, even were we to conclude the district court must make a\n\nparticularized finding of the drug amount for which Defendant was\n\npersonally responsible, the district court made that finding.            A\n\nremand for the district court to reiterate its finding would be an\n\nempty gesture.\n\n                                  E.\n\n            Finally, Defendant argues the district court erred by\n\nfailing to state its reasons for sentencing Defendant at the top\n\nend of the guideline range.       The district court determined the\n\nguideline range was 121-151 months, and then imposed the maximum\n\nsentence.   Title 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) requires the sentencing court\n\nto explain how it determined the applicable guideline range and, if\n\nthat   range   exceeds   twenty-four    months,   why   it   selected   the\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fparticular   point   it   did    within   that     range.4    The    Government\n\nconcedes the district court did not state any reasons supporting\n\nits   selected   sentence   at    the   top   of   the   guideline    range   as\n\nrequired.     Accordingly,      we   remand   to   the   district    court    for\n\nresentencing in compliance with § 3553(c).               See United States v.\n\nMcDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1012 (1st Cir. 1990) (remanding for\n\nresentencing where district court made no findings pursuant to\n\n§ 3553(c) to support a four level adjustment for organizer/leader\n\nstatus).\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\n\nin all respects except for its failure to state reasons for its\n\nselected sentence.    As to that issue, we REMAND for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       Section 3553(c) provides--\n      (c) Statement of reasons for imposing a sentence. The\n      court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open\n      court the reasons for its imposition of the particular\n      sentence, and, if the sentence--\n      (1) is of the kind, and within the range, described in\n      subsection (a)(4), and that range exceeds 24 months, the\n      reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point\n      within the range; . . . .\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f",

In November 1999, a\n\nPuerto Rico grand jury returned a single-count indictment charging\n\nDefendant, Israel Navedo-Concepción, also known as “Gallo,” and\n\nseven other named co-defendants with conspiracy to possess with the\n\nintent to distribute cocaine in amounts which exceed five (5)\n\nkilograms and heroin in amounts which exceed one (1) kilogram, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.   The indictment alleged a four-year\n\nconspiracy between the named defendants and others unknown to the\n\ngrand jury to distribute narcotics in the La Perla section of Old\n\nSan Juan.     All named co-defendants pled guilty pursuant to plea\n\nagreements.    Defendant, however, proceeded to trial.   Following a\n\nseven-day trial, the jury convicted Defendant of the sole count in\n\nthe indictment.     The district court sentenced Defendant to 151\n\nmonths imprisonment.\n\n            Defendant appeals, arguing (1) the district court erred\n\nby failing to sua sponte deliver a limiting instruction on the use\n\nof prior inconsistent statements by a witness; (2) the prosecutor’s\n\nimproper remarks during closing argument warrant a new trial; (3)\n\nthe district court plainly erred by instructing the jury about the\n\ncontent of a witness’ testimony; (4) the district court erred by\n\nnot making an independent relevant conduct finding as to the drug\n\nquantity attributable to Defendant; and (5) the district court\n\nerred by failing to give a reason pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)\n\nfor imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range.       The\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fparties are familiar with the facts of the case, and we will not\n\nrepeat them here except where necessary. We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.          We affirm the district court on\n\nDefendant’s first four issues.        But we remand for resentencing in\n\naccordance with § 3553(c) due to the district court’s failure to\n\nstate in open court reasons for the selected sentence.\n\n                                      A.\n\n          Defendant      first    argues   the   district   court    erred   by\n\nfailing to sua sponte give a limiting instruction on how the jury\n\nshould treat a witness’ prior inconsistent statements.                   Because\n\ndefense counsel did not object, Defendant concedes we review this\n\nissue for plain error.         Under the four-part plain error inquiry,\n\n(1) an error must have been committed; (2) the error must be plain\n\nor obvious; (3) the plain error must affect substantial rights,\n\nwhich generally means that it must have been prejudicial; and (4)\n\nthe error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation     of   judicial     proceedings.

On cross examination, Bultron acknowledged he had\n\nheard of a person nicknamed “Gallo”, but denied that he told FBI\n\nagent Scott Nielson in interviews that “Gallo” sold narcotics or\n\nthat he had personally purchased heroin from Gallo.                   Bultron also\n\ndenied he    told   Sgt.    Pablo    Quiñones      or   other   law    enforcement\n\nofficials that Gallo sold “champagne”1 heroin.

Quiñones testified that,\n\nduring an interview, he had shown Bultron a photograph of Defendant\n\nand    Bultron   identified      Defendant    as   “Gallo.”      Quiñones     also\n\ntestified that Bultron told him in an interview that Gallo would\n\nmeet with others to form an enterprise and to discuss the drug\n\ntrade in La Perla.

Misrepresentation of Evidence\n\n            Defendant first contends that, in closing argument, the\n\nprosecutor misrepresented Bultron’s testimony.                  The prosecutor\n\nstated that although Bultron was evasive and hesitant to answer\n\nquestions, he eventually testified that he knew Gallo, and knew\n\nGallo ran a drug business.             Defense counsel objected to this\n\ncharacterization, to which the district court stated, “Let’s move\n\non.”      The    prosecutor   then    continued    and   stated     that    Bultron\n\ntestified Gallo’s product was champagne.                 The prosecutor also\n\nstated Bultron admitted he knew that Gallo, Sandro, and the rest of\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthe “committee” had Friday meetings in which they organized the La\n\nPerla drug trade.\n\n           “This    Court   has   fashioned      a   three    prong   test   for\n\nexamining whether the prosecution’s misconduct ‘so poisoned the\n\nwell’ that the trial’s outcome was likely affected, thus warranting\n\na new trial.”      United States v.

Where Defendant\n\ntimely objected, we review de novo the question of whether the\n\ncomment was     improper    and   review   for   abuse   of    discretion    the\n\nquestion whether the misconduct, if any, warrants a new trial.\n\nUnited States v.

Where\n\nthe defendant has not objected, we review for plain error.              Id. at\n\n69.\n\n           The record reveals some of the prosecutor’s statements\n\nabout   Bultron’s    statements    were    not   fully      supported   by   the\n\ntestimony.    Bultron did not testify that he knew “Gallo,” although\n\nhe eventually admitted under cross examination that he previously\n\ntold an FBI agent that he knew someone named Gallo who lived in\n\nWipe Out and operated a store there.        Bultron did not testify about\n\nFriday meetings as stated by the prosecutor, nor did Quiñones\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\ftestify that Bultron previously told agents about Friday committee\n\nmeetings.     Only Valle testified about Friday meetings.                    Bultron\n\nalso did not testify that he observed any committee meetings or\n\nthat Gallo attended those meetings, or that the meetings concerned\n\nrunning the drug trade in La Perla.                 On cross examination, he\n\nadmitted he previously told agents about two meetings Sandro called\n\nwhich “Gallo” attended.            The prosecutor did not inquire into the\n\nsubstance   of    the    meetings,     however.         Thus,   no   testimony    was\n\nproduced that the meetings to which Bultron was referring involved\n\ndiscussions about the rules of the La Perla drug trade as the\n\nprosecutor stated in closing argument.              And Bultron denied that he\n\nknew Gallo sold champagne or heroin or that he personally purchased\n\ndrugs from Gallo, contrary to the prosecutor’s closing statements.\n\nHe further denied that he told agents this information.                           The\n\nprosecutor seemed to discuss Quiñones’ testimony that Bultron made\n\nthese   statements       to   agents   in     earlier    interviews     as   if   the\n\nstatements were Bultron’s live testimony.                 Thus, the prosecutor’s\n\nstatements about Bultron’s testimony misstated the record in some\n\nrespects.\n\n            We agree with Defendant these comments were improper.\n\nBut we do not find sufficient prejudice to warrant a new trial.\n\nDefendant   presented         no   evidence   the   prosecutor’s       conduct    was\n\ndeliberate,      and    the   misstatements      were    isolated     to   this   one\n\nwitness.      The witness’ testimony was less than clear on some\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fpoints, and the witness was impeached by prior statements to\n\ninvestigators.     Thus, the prosecutor may have innocently, albeit\n\nnegligently, confused Bultron’s live testimony and the impeachment\n\ntestimony.      In final instructions, the district court instructed\n\nthe jury as follows:\n\n           The statements that the lawyers made are not\n           to be considered by you either as evidence in\n           the case, which comes only from witnesses and\n           exhibits, or as [] instruct[ions] on the law,\n           which will come only from me.            These\n           statements and arguments are intended to help\n           you understand the issues and the evidence as\n           it comes in, as well as the positions taken by\n           both sides.\n\nAlthough not contemporaneous, the instruction informs the jury that\n\nthe statements of the lawyers are not evidence.            We conclude the\n\nmisstatements were not so egregious, inflammatory, or pervasive\n\nthat they could have affected the outcome of the case.3\n\n           2.    Vouching\n\n           Defendant        also    challenges    comments       during     the\n\nprosecutor’s closing arguments which he alleges constitute improper\n\nvouching for a witness and for the Government’s overall case.\n\nDuring closing argument, defense counsel suggested witness Jose\n\nMercado   Febles    lied    about   a   meeting   among   drug    dealers    on\n\nThanksgiving Day which Defendant allegedly attended.                  Defense\n\n\n\n     3\n      Defendant also asserts the prosecutor misrepresented the\ntestimony of Valle and Quiñones. After reviewing the record, we\nconclude the prosecutor’s description of these witnesses’ testimony\nconstituted reasonable argument based on the actual testimony.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fcounsel argued Febles was lying about this meeting because Febles\n\nclaimed another dealer, Papo Aviles, was present at the meeting\n\nwhen Aviles actually was in jail on Thanksgiving Day.          In response\n\nto   this    argument,   the   prosecutor   argued   defense   counsel    was\n\nmisreading and misinterpreting the testimony, and thus Febles “had\n\nnot lied.”     Defendant admits he did not object to the prosecutor’s\n\nstatement in closing argument that Febles “did not lie.”           Thus we\n\nreview this issue for plain error.\n\n              The prosecutor’s choice of words was unfortunate.          What\n\nthe prosecutor meant was that the defense had not shown Febles\n\nlied.    According to the prosecutor’s view of the testimony, Febles\n\ndid not testify that Aviles was at the Thanksgiving Day meeting.\n\nHence his testimony was not contradictory with Aviles being in\n\nprison on Thanksgiving Day.         While we caution prosecutors to be\n\nmore careful in their choice of words, we do not find this comment\n\naffected Defendant’s substantial rights, nor seriously affects the\n\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nThe comment was isolated to one statement regarding one witness,\n\nand the meaning of the comment was not the usual vouching problem\n\nwhere the prosecutor assures the jury the witness is telling the\n\ntruth.

Figueroa-Encarnacion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782593\"><a href=\"/opinion/782593/united-states-v-ramon-figueroa-encarnacion-us-v-alberto-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (defining the “archetypal example of vouching” as\n\n“a prosecutor’s claim that the witness should be believed because\n\nthe prosecutor–a representative of the government–believes the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwitness . . . .”).    Rather, the prosecutor argued the defense was\n\nmischaracterizing Febles’ testimony.      Instead of stating Febles\n\n“did not lie,” the prosecutor should have said the defense had not\n\ncaught Febles in an obvious lie.\n\n          Defendant also challenges the prosecutor’s comments in\n\nclosing argument that the Government had presented only a “sample”\n\nof the evidence.     Specifically, the prosecutor argued--\n\n          And what my colleague Miss Sulzbach told you\n          in her opening statement is that she would\n          give you a sample, an opportunity to hear from\n          three people who would tell you about the drug\n          trade in La Perla.\n          . . .\n          What you heard from the government ladies and\n          gentlemen was a sample, if you think this week\n          trial was long, if we had brought in every one\n          that knew about drugs in La Perla we would\n          have been here for months.\n          . . .\n          You have to realize that what the government\n          brought you was a sample. It wasn’t a day to\n          day record of everything that went on in La\n          Perla drug world. It was a sample and that is\n          all we are asking you consider, this sample of\n          activity in La Perla drug world involving the\n          defendant and the [other] individuals involved\n          in this committee or this group.\n          . . .\n          And you saw a sample, not only the drug\n          dealings that went on but just a very small\n          portion and the government has proven its case\n          beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn response, defense counsel in closing argued if this was just a\n\n“sample,” the Government should have introduced more compelling\n\nevidence of Defendant’s participation in the drug trade, such as\n\nvideo, photographs, or tape recordings of controlled buys.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f            The prosecutor’s use of the “sample” language constitutes\n\nerror.      A    prosecutor    may    not    suggest   to    the   jury   that   the\n\nGovernment has more evidence establishing a defendant’s guilt than\n\nit has presented to the jury.

Although a close case, we conclude the prosecutor’s ill\n\nadvised statements did not prejudice Defendant, nor seriously\n\neffect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\n\n            Most of the comments suggested the evidence presented was\n\njust a sample of the overall drug scene in La Perla and the\n\noverarching investigation of the drug trade in La Perla, without\n\nspecifying that the Government had more information specifically\n\ngoing to Defendant’s guilt.             In reaching a verdict, the jury\n\nnecessarily       had   to   accept    or    reject    the    testimony    of    the\n\nGovernment’s cooperating witnesses.              The prosecutor’s “sampling”\n\ncomments made in closing argument likely did not weigh heavily in\n\nthis determination.          Either the jury believed the witnesses who\n\ntestified they bought from or sold drugs to Defendant, or they did\n\nnot.     Further, defense counsel was able to effectively use this\n\n“sampling” language in closing argument, further reducing any\n\npotential prejudice.          While we harshly condemn the Government’s\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fcomments in this case, we cannot say on plain error review that the\n\ncomments warrant reversal.\n\n                                       C.\n\n            Defendant next argues the trial court committed plain\n\nerror in instructing the jury when it asserted as fact that witness\n\nBultron testified he viewed a photograph of Defendant shown to him\n\nby law enforcement officers.         Defendant concedes he did not object\n\nto the challenged instruction, and hence we review for plain error.\n\nAt the close of the case, the court instructed the jury–\n\n            No[w], witness Luis Mojica Bult[r]on testified\n            that he viewed a photograph of the defendant\n            Israel Navedo Concepcion which was shown to\n            him by a law enforcement officer. The police\n            collect pictures of many people from many\n            different sources and for many different\n            purposes. The fact that the police or a law\n            enforcement officer had defendant’s picture\n            does not mean that he committed this or any\n            other crime, and it must have no effect on\n            you[r] consideration of this case.\n\nDefendant now claims Bultron did not testify that he had identified\n\nDefendant   from    a   photograph    shown   to    him   by   law   enforcement\n\nofficers, and thus the district court’s instruction erroneously\n\nresolved a contested factual issue.\n\n            The    district   court    did    not   misstate    the    evidence.\n\nBultron did in fact testify that he “viewed a photograph of the\n\ndefendant Israel Navedo Concepcion which was shown to him by a law\n\nenforcement officer.”          Under questioning by defense counsel,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fBultron denied he had seen Defendant in person, but admitted to\n\nseeing him in a photograph:\n\n           Q: Sir, tell the jury when was the first time\n           that you saw this gentleman?\n           A: The first time? Today.\n           Q: And before today?\n           A: Before today I had been shown a photo.\n           Q: Who showed you a photo?\n           . . .\n           A: The photo I saw it for the first time at\n           the C.I.C. in San Augustine.\n           . . .\n           Q: And after that first time, when was the\n           next time if any other time?\n           A: Second time was at the Department of\n           Justice.\n           Q: I ask you if any federal agent has shown\n           you a photo of my client?\n           A: Scott.\n           . . .\n           Q: Where was that, that Scott showed you a\n           photo of my client?\n           A: That was in the office of Domingo Alvarez.\n           . . .\n           Q: On that third occasion, who showed you the\n           photo of my client?\n           A: It was another federal agent, I was\n           brought.\n\nFollowing this colloquy, Bultron testified that the agents asked\n\nwhether he recognized the individual in the photographs, and he\n\ntold the agents he did not.        Thus, Bultron did testify that law\n\nenforcement authorities showed him a photo of Defendant, as the\n\ndistrict   court’s   instruction   indicated.    A   separate   question\n\nexisted about whether Bultron identified the person in that photo\n\nas “Gallo” the drug dealer from La Perla, but the district court’s\n\ninstruction did not speak to that issue.        The district court did\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fnot misstate the evidence or decide a contested fact issue for the\n\njury, and thus did not plainly err.\n\n                                           D.\n\n                Defendant next argues the district court erred by relying\n\non   the    jury    verdict    for   the    amount   of    cocaine    and   heroin\n\nattributable to Defendant as relevant conduct at sentencing.                  In a\n\ndrug conspiracy case, the jury should determine the existence of\n\nthe conspiracy as well as any facts about the conspiracy that will\n\nincrease the possible penalty for the crime of conviction beyond\n\nthe default statutory maximum.

But the judge should determine, at\n\nsentencing, the particulars regarding the involvement of each\n\nparticipant in the conspiracy.             Id. at 43.     “This means that once\n\nthe jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and\n\nquantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the\n\ndefault statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant\n\nguilty of participation in the conspiracy, the judge lawfully may\n\ndetermine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and\n\nsentence him accordingly (so long as the sentence falls within the\n\nstatutory maximum made applicable by the jury's conspiracy-wide\n\ndrug quantity determination).”             Id.   Defendant thus contends that\n\nwhile the jury could find the overall conspiracy involved amounts\n\nexceeding those charged in the indictment, the district court\n\nfailed     to    make   an   individualized      determination   of    what   drug\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fquantities were reasonably foreseeable to Defendant specifically,\n\nand thus attributable to him as relevant conduct.\n\n            We disagree.      The district court instructed the jury in\n\nsuch   a   way   that   the   jury   had    to   find   Defendant   personally\n\nresponsible for the amounts charged in the indictment to find\n\nDefendant guilty of the overall conspiracy.             After instructing the\n\njury about the elements of conspiracy, the district charged the\n\njury as follows:\n\n            The crime of conspiracy is complete upon the\n            agreement to commit the underlying crime.\n                   The underlying crime is possession with\n            intent to distribute a controlled substance.\n            Israel Navedo Concepcion is accused of\n            conspiring with others to possess with the\n            intent to distribute to someone else cocaine,\n            in an amount exceeding five kilograms and\n            heroin in an amount exceeding on[e] kilogram\n            from on or about 1995 until the date of the\n            indictment. . . .     For you to find Israel\n            Navedo Concepcion guilty of this crime you\n            must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt:\n                   First, that from on or about 1995 until\n            the date of his indictment, Israel Navedo\n            Concepcion possessed cocaine, in an amount\n            exceeding five kilograms and heroin, in an\n            amount exceeding one kilogram, either actually\n            or constructively.\n                   Second, that he did so with the\n            specific intent to distribute the specified\n            amounts of cocaine and heroin over which he\n            had actual or constructive possession; and\n                   Third, that he did so knowingly and\n            intentionally.\n\n(Emphasis added).       Based on these instructions, the jury had to\n\nfind Defendant personally possessed with intent to distribute over\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine and over one kilogram of heroin.                  By\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\ffinding Defendant guilty, the jury made these factual findings\n\nagainst Defendant.\n\n            Even if the district court were at liberty to attribute\n\na lesser drug quantity to Defendant for sentencing purposes, the\n\ndistrict court expressed its belief that Defendant was personally\n\nresponsible for the drug quantities alleged in the indictment:\n\n            . . . I presided over this trial and I have no\n            question in my mind after viewing all of the\n            evidence and all of the witnesses and the jury\n            having found on this, but I as presiding judge\n            have no qualms or question whatsoever that\n            this defendant should be held accountable for\n            a minimum of the amount [charged] in the\n            indictment. For a minimum.\n\nThus, even were we to conclude the district court must make a\n\nparticularized finding of the drug amount for which Defendant was\n\npersonally responsible, the district court made that finding.            A\n\nremand for the district court to reiterate its finding would be an\n\nempty gesture.\n\n                                  E.\n\n            Finally, Defendant argues the district court erred by\n\nfailing to state its reasons for sentencing Defendant at the top\n\nend of the guideline range.       The district court determined the\n\nguideline range was 121-151 months, and then imposed the maximum\n\nsentence.   Title 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c) requires the sentencing court\n\nto explain how it determined the applicable guideline range and, if\n\nthat   range   exceeds   twenty-four    months,   why   it   selected   the\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fparticular   point   it   did    within   that     range.4    The    Government\n\nconcedes the district court did not state any reasons supporting\n\nits   selected   sentence   at    the   top   of   the   guideline    range   as\n\nrequired.     Accordingly,      we   remand   to   the   district    court    for\n\nresentencing in compliance with § 3553(c).               See United States v.\n\nMcDowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551473\"><a href=\"/opinion/551473/united-states-v-billy-ray-mcdowell-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1012 (1st Cir. 1990) (remanding for\n\nresentencing where district court made no findings pursuant to\n\n§ 3553(c) to support a four level adjustment for organizer/leader\n\nstatus).\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\n\nin all respects except for its failure to state reasons for its\n\nselected sentence.
