Mendoza Toro, were on brief,\nfor appellees.\n\n\n                               May 27, 2005\n\f             Per   Curiam.        Plaintiff-appellant       Josué     Colón-Ortiz\n\nchallenges the district court's entry of summary judgment against\n\nhim on his claims that the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Company\n\n(plaintiff's employer) and certain of its supervisors unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated against him because of his political beliefs when,\n\napproximately      eight     months     after    the   November     2000    general\n\nelection, they reclassified him from an E-5 to an E-4 career\n\nposition (having concluded that his reclassification from a trust\n\nposition to an E-5 position in the weeks following the election was\n\nitself unlawful).        Judgment was rendered in favor of defendants\n\nafter the statement of uncontested facts submitted in connection\n\nwith their summary judgment motion was deemed admitted pursuant to\n\nthe Puerto Rico district court's local rules, see D.P.R. R. 311.12,\n\nbecause plaintiff failed to oppose defendants' motion.\n\n             Plaintiff     does   not    directly      challenge    the    district\n\ncourt's conclusion that defendants' statement of uncontested facts,\n\nonce admitted, warranted the entry of judgment for defendants. See\n\nTorres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(emphasizing that an unopposed motion for summary judgment should\n\nonly be granted if the movant's statement of uncontested facts and\n\nother evidentiary facts of record show that the party is entitled\n\nto   summary    judgment).        Rather,       he   presents   two   peripheral\n\narguments.     First, he contends that certain materials he submitted\n\nwell more than a month past the date on which his opposition was\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fdue -- materials submitted in connection with (1) a so-called\n\n\"Urgent Motion\" in which he (arguably) sought, inter alia, to\n\nreopen discovery and amend his complaint,1 and (2) a motion to\n\nreconsider the summary judgment ruling -- were sufficient to\n\nforestall the entry of judgment against him.     Second, he argues\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion by failing to mention\n\nhis urgent motion in its memorandum and order and thereby declining\n\nto act favorably on his requests to reopen discovery and to amend\n\nthe complaint.\n\n          Plaintiff's arguments are not convincing.   The materials\n\nthat plaintiff sought to introduce in connection with his urgent\n\nmotion -- materials which tended to establish that certain of\n\nplaintiff's witnesses were being harassed for supporting him -- had\n\nlittle to no bearing on whether the employment actions that are the\n\nsubject of the complaint were themselves unlawful and/or motivated\n\nby unlawful political discrimination.    Thus, even if we were to\n\nassume dubitante that the district court was obliged to consider\n\nthese late-filed materials in connection with its summary judgment\n\nruling, we would not upset the ruling.   And, of course, the court\n\nacted well within its discretion in declining to consider the\n\nmaterials submitted in connection with the motion to reconsider the\n\n\n\n     1\n      Actually, these requests were so buried within plaintiff's\nmotion and so undeveloped that the district court would have acted\nwell within its discretion in regarding them as forfeit.       See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                               -3-\n\fsummary judgment ruling -- especially since plaintiff failed to\n\nexplain why these materials were not timely made part of the\n\nsummary judgment record.    Cf. U.S. Steel v. M. DeMatteo Constr.\n\nCo., 315 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 2002) (discussing   the requirements\n\nfor prevailing on a motion for relief from summary judgment under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) for newly discovered evidence).\n\n          So too with the district court's implicit denials of the\n\nrequests to reopen discovery and/or to amend the complaint imbedded\n\nwithin the urgent motion.    Leaving aside plaintiff's failure to\n\naccount for why he did not timely oppose the summary judgment\n\nmotion, the materials submitted in connection with plaintiff's\n\nurgent motion neither indicated that reopening discovery would lead\n\nto evidence that might tip the summary judgment balance nor gave\n\nindication that plaintiff himself would state a viable new claim\n\nwere he permitted to amend his complaint.   Cf. Hernandez-Santiago\n\nv. Ecolab, Inc., 397 F.3d 30, 34-35 (1st Cir. 1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(motions to extend discovery period under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)\n\nmust explain why the additional material sought is material);\n\nSteir v. Girl Scouts of the USA, 383 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(motions to amend after summary judgment motions are filed must be\n\njustified by \"substantial and convincing evidence\").\n\n          The urgent motion, on its face, did not refer to a new\n\nclaim the plaintiff wished to add to his complaint and was most\n\nreasonably read as seeking a postponement of the trial and remedies\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fto protect witnesses.      The motion thus assumed that the plaintiff\n\nwas entitled to a trial, but he was not, having failed to meet his\n\nburden in opposition to summary judgment.         It was not an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for the trial judge to fail to allow amendment when the\n\nmotion itself did not seek to do so.\n\n             While a more explicit ruling on the urgent motion might\n\nhave been preferable, plaintiff has not come close to establishing\n\nthat   its   implicit    denial,   or   the   denial   of   his   motion   to\n\nreconsider, constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
