This   appeal    arises    out   of   a\n\nmodestly complex commercial dispute resulting in a jury verdict for\n\nthe plaintiffs.     The plaintiffs in the district court were Tómas\n\nColón and R.K. Grace & Company of Puerto Rico (\"Grace Puerto\n\nRico\"); the defendants were R.K. Grace & Company (\"Grace U.S.A.\")\n\nand John Kaweske.     What follows is a bare-bones summary of the\n\nbackground events and trial.\n\n          Grace U.S.A. was a Florida company operating as an\n\ninvestment advisor and a broker-dealer in securities and Kaweske\n\nwas its president and chief executive.               In January 1995, Grace\n\nU.S.A. entered    into    a    written   agreement     with    Colón,    who   had\n\npreviously been a customer representative for other companies\n\n(e.g., Morgan Stanley).        The agreement provided that Colón, acting\n\nas an independent contractor, would handle securities purchases and\n\nsales from his customers through Grace U.S.A. and receive a portion\n\nof the commission on such transactions.\n\n          The   January       1995   agreement     contained   an     arbitration\n\nclause in which Colón and Grace U.S.A. agreed to arbitrate any\n\ndispute between them \"under\" the agreement.                 In June 1995 Colón\n\nalso signed a so-called \"U-4\" form of the National Association of\n\nSecurities Dealers (\"NASD\") agreeing to arbitrate any dispute\n\nbetween him and his firm (Grace U.S.A.), a customer, \"or any other\n\nperson\" for which arbitration is required under NASD rules.                    The\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fmain question briefed on this appeal is whether either or both\n\narbitration agreements embrace the claims that later arose.\n\n          Colón was quite successful and, in January 1997, Kaweske\n\nand Colón formed a new Puerto Rico company--Grace Puerto Rico--in\n\nwhich each partner owned 50% of the shares.     Colón claimed that\n\nthere was an oral understanding between him and Kaweske that this\n\nnew company would provide administrative services for Colón and a\n\nnumber of new Grace U.S.A. representatives in Puerto Rico; that\n\n100% of the commissions would be returned by Grace U.S.A.; and that\n\na small portion of the commissions would be divided between Colón\n\nand Kaweske.\n\n          The new arrangement did not work as allegedly planned.\n\nAccording to Colón, by 1998 Grace U.S.A. was seriously in arrears\n\nin its promised payments because Kaweske was withholding amounts\n\ndue to cover imprudent investments he had made.     Further, Colón\n\nsaid that Grace Puerto Rico was being harmed by this retention\n\nbecause it could not pay its own bills and Colón was being forced\n\nto advance money himself for this purpose.\n\n          In February 2001, Colón and Grace Puerto Rico brought\n\nsuit against Kaweske and Grace U.S.A. in federal district court in\n\nPuerto Rico.   Among the claims, and the only ones ultimately to go\n\nto the jury, were a breach of contract claim by Grace Puerto Rico\n\nagainst Grace U.S.A. and a breach of fiduciary duty claim by Colón\n\nagainst Kaweske.   The defendants asserted that the claims against\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fthem were covered by the two arbitration agreements noted above and\n\nby an alleged third agreement dated January 1997 between Grace\n\nU.S.A. and Colón containing an arbitration clause akin to the one\n\nin the January 1995 agreement.\n\n            Colón responded that neither the January 1995 agreement\n\nnor the 1995 U-4 could bind Grace Puerto Rico, which did not exist\n\nuntil 1997.    As to the January 1997 agreement, Colón denied that he\n\nhad signed it.     When a version purportedly bearing his signature\n\nwas produced by defendants, Colón said (backed by a document\n\nexaminer) that the signature was not his and asked the district\n\ncourt to exclude it from consideration. The district judge who had\n\ninitially     denied   the    arbitration   request   based   on    the   1995\n\nagreements now ruled that he wanted the jury's determination on the\n\nsignature issue before finally deciding whether arbitration was\n\nrequired.\n\n            A jury trial began in November 2002.          Colón testified\n\nthat he thought that the January 1995 agreement had been superceded\n\nby the new arrangements made in 1997 but, in any event, denied\n\nmaking any claims under the January 1995 agreement.           The district\n\njudge then began to curtail defense counsel's efforts to pursue the\n\nJanuary 1995 agreement, saying \"that does away with the claims from\n\nthat first contract.         There is nothing to arbitrate.\"       As for the\n\narbitration clause in the January 1997 agreement, the defense never\n\nsought to offer it as an authenticated contract signed by Colón.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fAt   the      close    of    evidence   the    district   court   rejected   the\n\narbitration defense.\n\n               On the merits, Colón presented testimony on his own\n\nbehalf from an employee of Grace U.S.A., from a margin clerk of\n\nGrace Puerto Rico, and from a public accountant who testified that\n\nGrace U.S.A. owed Grace Puerto Rico $249,000.                  The defense made\n\nsome       headway    in    cross-examining     both   Colón   and   the   public\n\naccountant but rested without presenting any witnesses of its own\n\nfor the defense.           The jury then awarded Grace Puerto Rico $249,245\n\nagainst Grace U.S.A. on the contract claim and Colón $75,000\n\nagainst Kaweske on the fiduciary duty claim.1\n\n               On post-judgment motions by the defendants, the district\n\njudge reaffirmed his denial of arbitration.                He also rejected a\n\nnumber of merits-related arguments by the defense for judgment as\n\na matter of law–a matter to which we will return.                 The defendants\n\nthen appealed to this court, arguing primarily that arbitration of\n\nthe dispute was required.               Plaintiffs say that this claim was\n\nwaived because defendants failed to take an interlocutory appeal\n\nand that in any event arbitration was not required.\n\n               Denials of arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act\n\nare, unlike most interlocutory rulings, immediately appealable.                 9\n\n\n       1\n      The former figure is supported by the accountant's evidence\nif the jury chose to resolve in Colón's favor the discrepancies in\nthe accountant's testimony. The source of the $75,000 figure is\nless clear, but the defendants say nothing about a lack of evidence\non this issue.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fU.S.C. §§ 4, 16(a)(1)(B) (2000).    Nothing in the statute requires\n\nan immediate appeal but three circuits have held that the failure\n\nto promptly appeal such a denial may by estoppel foreclose the\n\ndemanding party's right to arbitration, although this is not\n\nautomatic and depends on a showing of prejudice to the other side.2\n\nThe reason is that it is wasteful to have a full trial and then\n\ndetermine by a post-trial appeal that the whole matter should have\n\nbeen arbitrated and so start again.\n\n             Ordinarily, no forfeit results from the failure to take\n\nan available interlocutory appeal (e.g., denials of qualified\n\nimmunity).     Pearson v. Ramos, 237 F.3d 881, 883 (7th Cir. 2001)\n\n(Posner, J.); 16 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure,\n\n§ 3921 (2d ed. 1996).    But with arbitration denials, the argument\n\nfor forcing an immediate appeal is stronger than usual; not much\n\ncan be said for allowing the party who sought arbitration to\n\nlitigate and later seek arbitration on appeal if the trial goes\n\nbadly instead of appealing immediately.      See Cotton v. Slone, 4\n\nF.3d 176, 180 (2d Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The three are the Second, Fifth and Eighth Circuits. Cargill\nFerrous Int'l v. Sea Phoenix MV, 325 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 2003);\nJohn Morrell & Co. v. United Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union,\n37 F.3d 1302, 1303 n.3 (8th Cir. 1994); Cotton v. Slone, 4 F.3d\n176, 180 (2d Cir. 1993); see also 15B Wright & Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure, § 3914.17 (2d ed. Supp. 2003). The Fourth\nCircuit appears to have rejected this view. See Clark v. Merrill\nLynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 924 F.2d 550, 553 (4th Cir.\n1991).\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           We are sympathetic to the approach of the Second, Fifth\n\nand Eighth Circuits, and it is wise for us to make this clear by\n\ndictum so as to give warning to the bar.       Yet this case is a\n\nperfect example of why one would not employ a mechanical forfeiture\n\nrule. Because in this case the district judge did not definitively\n\ndeny the arbitration request until after trial began--indeed, until\n\nall the evidence was taken--any holding by us that the defendants\n\nhad to appeal the denial immediately so as to avoid an unnecessary\n\ntrial would be ridiculous: the trial had already occurred.\n\n           One might at first wonder why the trial judge delayed in\n\nresolving the question of arbitrability: ordinarily the purposes of\n\narbitration are best served by having the issue decided before\n\ntrial. However, in what may be an over-cautious reaction to Beacon\n\nTheatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959), the arbitration\n\nstatute specifically commands that in non-admiralty cases a jury\n\n(if timely demanded) must be used to decide the validity of the\n\nagreement if it is disputed.      9 U.S.C. § 4 (2000); Doctor's\n\nAssocs., Inc. v. Distajo, 107 F.3d 126, 129-30 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\n           Turning next to the question whether the district court\n\nerred in denying arbitration, the matter is complicated but our\n\ndisposition is made swifter by the way the defense has framed the\n\nissue.   The January 1995 agreement does not by its terms apply to\n\neither of the two claims submitted to the jury: neither involved a\n\nclaim by Colón against Grace U.S.A. and on appeal the defendants'\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fbrief in its argument section refers only to the U-4.         The alleged\n\nJanuary 1997 agreement is out of the case because it was not\n\nauthenticated, a point that the defendants do not dispute.\n\n          Conceivably, more might have been said by the defendants\n\nabout the January 1995 agreement.          For example, one might argue\n\nthat the agreement to arbitrate between Colón and Grace U.S.A.\n\nought to be read to cover claims by Colón against officers of Grace\n\nU.S.A. so far as the latter acted in an official capacity.3              But\n\nhow far such arguments might have force, and whether they apply to\n\nany part of the claims actually made in this case, have not been\n\nbriefed by defendants and will certainly not be pursued by the\n\ncourt sua sponte.      Mass Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar\n\nAss'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          As for the U-4, this was surely a possible basis for\n\narbitration.   Unlike the January 1995 agreement, the U-4 is by its\n\nterms not limited to claims between Grace U.S.A. and Colón; it\n\napplies to any claim that Colón has against anyone that the NASD\n\nrules require to be arbitrated.            The defense says that this\n\nincludes any   claim    by   Colón   against   Kaweske   relating   to   the\n\nsecurities business.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      The district judge said that the January 1995 agreement was\nirrelevant once Colón had said that he made no claims under it; but\nwhether a claim is one \"under\" that agreement could depend more on\nits substance than on Colón's characterization--a point that\ndefense counsel grasped at trial but has not developed on appeal.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           The assertion, although not implausible, is offered in\n\none sentence and without citation.             The U-4 form does not answer\n\nthe question on its face: it refers to claims that NASD rules\n\nrequire   to    be   arbitrated.      Nothing      in   the   defendants'     brief\n\ndiscusses or cites to the internal NASD rules, court precedents or\n\nany other materials that would illuminate the issue of just how far\n\nthe clause extends beyond disputes with the company or customers.\n\nAbsent such information, the defendants' argument based on the U-4\n\nmust fail.\n\n           Defendants also say that the district court mistakenly\n\nallowed Colón to recover based on an alleged oral understanding\n\nbetween   Colón      and   Kaweske   that    modified    the    earlier     written\n\nagreement made in January 1995 as to the share of commissions\n\nintended to accrue to Colón.          As best we can tell, this supposed\n\nmodification was part of the theory on which the plaintiffs'\n\nrecovery rests, and the January 1995 agreement did have a clause\n\nforbidding oral modifications, although Colón has arguments of his\n\nown as to why this does not matter.\n\n           However, once again this terse argument by defendants is\n\nsimply not developed on appeal.         There is a lengthy recitation in\n\nthe fact section of the defense brief as to some of the evidence\n\nbearing on this and other issues.            But it is not this court's role\n\nto   assemble   a    coherent    argument    for   one   side    merely     because\n\nevidentiary     pieces     are   mentioned    somewhere       among   the   factual\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\frecitations and the topic sentence of the argument is supplied in\n\nthe argument section of the brief.          Cf. U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v.\n\nHealthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 599 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          There   are   two   more    short-form   arguments   offered   by\n\ndefendants' brief.      One is their claim, nowhere developed by\n\nargument, that Colón has no authority as a 50% owner to represent\n\nGrace Puerto Rico in litigation.       The other is that the verdict is\n\n\"not supported by the evidence admitted at trial.\"               Both are\n\ninvitations to this court to fill in the blanks by itself, which is\n\nnot our job.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

But with arbitration denials, the argument for forcing an immediate appeal is stronger than usual; not much can be said for allowing the party who sought arbitration to litigate and later seek arbitration on appeal if the trial goes badly instead of appealing immediately. <i>See Cotton v.

Yet this case is a perfect example of why one would not employ a mechanical forfeiture rule. Because in this case the district judge did not definitively deny the arbitration request until after trial began &#8212; indeed, until all the evidence was taken &#8212; any holding by us that the defendants had to appeal the denial immediately so as to avoid an unnecessary trial would be ridiculous: the trial had already occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might at first wonder why the trial judge delayed in resolving the question of arbitrability: ordinarily the purposes of arbitration are best served by having the issue decided before trial.

The January 1995 agreement does not by its terms apply to either of the two claims submitted to the jury: neither involved a claim by Col&#243;n against Grace U.S.A. and on appeal the defendants' brief in its argument section refers only to the U-4. The alleged January 1997 agreement is out of the case because it was not authenticated, a point that the defendants do not dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably, more might have been said by the defendants about the January 1995 agreement. For example, one might argue that the agreement to arbitrate between Col&#243;n and Grace U.S.A. ought to be read to cover claims by Col&#243;n against officers of Grace U.S.A. so far as the latter acted in an official capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> But how far such arguments might have force, and whether they apply to any part of the claims actually made in this case, have not been briefed by defendants and will certainly not be pursued by the court <i>sua sponte.

Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the U-4, this was surely a <i>possible</i> basis for arbitration. Unlike the January 1995 agreement, the U-4 is by its terms not limited to claims between Grace U.S.A. and Col&#243;n; it applies to any claim that Col&#243;n has against anyone that the NASD rules require to be arbitrated. The defense says that this includes any claim by Col&#243;n against Kaweske relating to the securities business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assertion, although not implausible, is offered in one sentence and without citation. The U-4 form does not answer the question on its face: it refers to claims that NASD rules require to be arbitrated. Nothing in the defendants' brief discusses or cites to the internal NASD rules, court precedents or any other materials that would illuminate the issue of just how far the clause extends beyond disputes with the company or customers. Absent such information, the defendants' argument based on the U-4 must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also say that the district court mistakenly allowed Col&#243;n to recover based on an alleged <i>oral</i> understanding between Col&#243;n and Kaweske that modified the earlier written agreement made in January 1995 as to the share of commissions intended to accrue to Col&#243;n. As best we can tell, this supposed modification was part of the theory on which the plaintiffs' recovery rests, and the January 1995 agreement did have a clause forbidding oral modifications, although Col&#243;n has arguments of his own as to why this does not matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, once again this terse argument by defendants is simply not developed on appeal. There is a lengthy recitation in the fact section of the defense brief as to some of the evidence bearing on this and other issues. But it is not this court's role to assemble a coherent argument for one side merely because evidentiary pieces are mentioned somewhere among the factual recitations and the topic sentence of the argument is supplied in the argument section of the brief. <i>Cf.

One is their claim, nowhere developed by argument, that Col&#243;n has no authority as a 50% owner to represent Grace Puerto Rico in litigation. The other is that the verdict is \"not supported by the evidence admitted at trial.\" Both are invitations to this court to fill in the blanks by itself, which is not our job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The former figure is supported by the accountant's evidence if the jury chose to resolve in Col&#243;n's favor the discrepancies in the accountant's testimony.

The plaintiffs in the district court were T&#243;mas Col&#243;n and R.K. Grace &amp; Company of Puerto Rico (\"Grace Puerto Rico\"); the defendants were R.K. Grace &amp; Company (\"Grace U.S.A.\") and John Kaweske. What follows is a bare-bones summary of the background events and trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grace U.S.A. was a Florida company operating as an investment advisor and a broker-dealer in securities and Kaweske was its president and chief executive. In January 1995, Grace U.S.A. entered into a written agreement with Col&#243;n, who had previously been a customer representative for other companies (<i>e.g.,</i> Morgan Stanley). The agreement provided that Col&#243;n, acting as an independent contractor, would handle securities purchases and sales from his customers through Grace U.S.A. and receive a portion of the commission on such transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The January 1995 agreement contained an arbitration clause in which Col&#243;n and Grace U.S.A. agreed to arbitrate any dispute between them \"under\" the agreement. In June 1995 Col&#243;n also signed a so-called \"U-4\" form of the National Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\") agreeing to arbitrate any dispute between him and his firm (Grace U.S.A.), a customer, \"or any other person\" for which arbitration is required under NASD rules. The main question briefed on this appeal is whether either or both arbitration agreements embrace the claims that later arose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n was quite successful and, in January 1997, Kaweske and Col&#243;n formed a new Puerto Rico company &#8212; Grace Puerto Rico &#8212; in which each partner owned 50% of the shares. Col&#243;n claimed that there was an oral understanding between him and Kaweske that this new company would provide administrative services for Col&#243;n and a number of new Grace U.S.A. representatives in Puerto Rico; that 100% of the commissions would be returned by Grace U.S.A.; and that a small portion of the commissions would be divided between Col&#243;n and Kaweske.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new arrangement did not work as allegedly planned. According to Col&#243;n, by 1998 Grace U.S.A. was seriously in arrears in its promised payments because Kaweske was withholding amounts due to cover imprudent investments he had made. Further, Col&#243;n said that Grace Puerto Rico was being harmed by this retention because it could not pay its own bills and Col&#243;n was being forced to advance money himself for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2001, Col&#243;n and Grace Puerto Rico brought suit against Kaweske and Grace U.S.A. in federal district court in Puerto Rico. Among the claims, and the only ones ultimately to go to the jury, were a breach of contract claim by Grace Puerto Rico against Grace U.S.A. and a breach of fiduciary duty claim by Col&#243;n against Kaweske. The defendants asserted that the claims against them were covered by the two arbitration agreements noted above and by an alleged third agreement dated January 1997 between Grace U.S.A. and Col&#243;n containing an arbitration clause akin to the one in the January 1995 agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n responded that neither the January 1995 agreement nor the 1995 U-4 could bind Grace Puerto Rico, which did not exist until 1997. As to the January 1997 agreement, Col&#243;n denied that he had signed it. When a version purportedly bearing his signature was produced by defendants, Col&#243;n said (backed by a document examiner) that the signature was not his and asked the district court to exclude it from consideration. The district judge who had initially denied the arbitration request based on the 1995 agreements now ruled that he wanted the jury's determination on the signature issue before finally deciding whether arbitration was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial began in November 2002. Col&#243;n testified that he thought that the January 1995 agreement had been superceded by the new arrangements made in 1997 but, in any event, denied making any claims under the January 1995 agreement. The district judge then began to curtail defense counsel's efforts to pursue the January 1995 agreement, saying \"that does away with the claims from that first contract. There is nothing to arbitrate.\" As for the arbitration clause in the January 1997 agreement, the defense never sought to offer it as an authenticated contract signed by Col&#243;n. At the close of evidence the district court rejected the arbitration defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, Col&#243;n presented testimony on his own behalf from an employee of Grace U.S.A., from a margin clerk of Grace Puerto Rico, and from a public accountant who testified that Grace U.S.A. owed Grace Puerto Rico $249,000. The defense made some headway in cross-examining both Col&#243;n and the public accountant but rested without presenting any witnesses of its own for the defense. The jury then awarded Grace Puerto Rico $249,245 against Grace U.S.A. on the contract claim and Col&#243;n $75,000 against Kaweske on the fiduciary duty claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On post-judgment motions by the defendants, the district judge reaffirmed his denial of arbitration.

As best we can tell, this supposed modification was part of the theory on which the plaintiffs' recovery rests, and the January 1995 agreement did have a clause forbidding oral modifications, although Col&#243;n has arguments of his own as to why this does not matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, once again this terse argument by defendants is simply not developed on appeal. There is a lengthy recitation in the fact section of the defense brief as to some of the evidence bearing on this and other issues. But it is not this court's role to assemble a coherent argument for one side merely because evidentiary pieces are mentioned somewhere among the factual recitations and the topic sentence of the argument is supplied in the argument section of the brief. <i>Cf.

One is their claim, nowhere developed by argument, that Col&#243;n has no authority as a 50% owner to represent Grace Puerto Rico in litigation. The other is that the verdict is \"not supported by the evidence admitted at trial.\" Both are invitations to this court to fill in the blanks by itself, which is not our job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The former figure is supported by the accountant's evidence if the jury chose to resolve in Col&#243;n's favor the discrepancies in the accountant's testimony.
