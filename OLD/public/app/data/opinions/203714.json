Parker, Michael J. Haungs, Tax Division, Department\nof Justice, and Nathan J. Hochman, Assistant Attorney General, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 9, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.      Pro se appellant Hailu Yohannes Awlachew\n\nappeals from a Tax Court decision, Awlachew v. Commissioner of\n\nInternal Revenue, T.C. Memo, 2007-365, 2007 WL 4322139 (U.S. Tax\n\nCt. 2007), which upheld an Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Notice\n\nof Determination dated November 18, 2005.              In its Determination,\n\nthe IRS concluded that its tax lien based on Awlachew's outstanding\n\ntaxes, penalties, and interest for the 2000 and 2001 tax years was\n\nnecessary    and   should    remain    in    full   force   and   effect      until\n\nsatisfied or unenforceable. After careful review of the record and\n\nthe parties' contentions, we affirm because we agree with the Tax\n\nCourt that there was no abuse of discretion by the agency.\n\n            On   appeal,    Awlachew    primarily     objects     to    the   IRS's\n\ndecision upholding its tax lien on the ground that the tax laws, as\n\napplied to him, were unfair and imposed a unique hardship, but the\n\ngovernment correctly contends that arguments of this kind cannot\n\nsucceed.    See, e.g., Speltz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,\n\n124 T.C. 165, 176 (U.S. Tax Ct. 2005) (\"In many contexts, literal\n\napplication of the [alternative minimum tax] has led to a perceived\n\nhardship, but challenges based on equity have been uniformly\n\nrejected.\")      (citing    numerous   cases).        Furthermore,       although\n\nAwlachew asks this court to abate his penalties and interest and to\n\nuse   his   alternative     minimum    tax   (AMT)   credit     to     reduce   his\n\noutstanding tax obligations, he fails to present any developed\n\nargument showing that such action by this court is warranted or\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpermissible. Hence, we need not consider his claim. United States\n\nv. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 60 (1st Cir. 2008) (noting the well-\n\nsettled appellate rule that perfunctorily raised claims are deemed\n\nwaived).\n\n            In addition, Awlachew alleges that the IRS settlement\n\nofficer who conducted his collection due process hearing inflexibly\n\nused the agency's uniform national and local expense standards in\n\ndetermining his monthly living expenses and unreasonably proposed\n\nthat he make monthly installment payments of $1,250 to satisfy his\n\ntax debt.     In part, Awlachew fails to adequately develop his\n\nargument, thereby waiving appellate consideration, and his argument\n\nis also unpersuasive given his gross monthly income at that time.\n\nFurthermore, the record supports the settlement officer's ultimate\n\nconclusion that Awlachew was \"not interested\" in entering into an\n\ninstallment agreement in order to pay his outstanding tax debt.\n\n            We note that Congress has recently amended the Internal\n\nRevenue Code by adding 26 U.S.C. § 53(f), which abates certain\n\nunpaid AMT liabilities.   See Emergency Economic Stabilization Act\n\nof 2008, Pub. L. 110-343, Div. C, Title I, § 103(a),(b), Oct. 3,\n\n2008, 122 Stat. 3863.     Such relief as is afforded by § 53(f),\n\nhowever, does not affect this appeal. As the parties' stipulations\n\nin the Tax Court confirm, Awlachew's tax liability for the 2000 tax\n\nyear was attributable only \"in part\" to his AMT liability, and his\n\ntax liability for the 2001 tax year was not based on the AMT.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f",
