Defendant-Appellee,\n\nJorge    Cintron-Fernandez,    was    convicted     in     the   United   States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico on his plea of\n\nguilty to charges relating to the adulteration and misbranding of\n\nfrozen food products.     After determining the amount of consumer\n\nloss, the court ruled that Cintron-Fernandez had a total offense\n\nlevel of 12 and a criminal history category of I, which would\n\nrequire a minimum sentence of ten months imprisonment under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.    U.S.S.G. § 5A (Table).           The district court\n\nsentenced    Cintron-Fernandez       to    five   months    imprisonment     but\n\nsubstituted home confinement in lieu of incarceration for that\n\nterm.    The court also imposed three years of supervised release,\n\nfive months of which were to be served in accordance with the Home\n\nConfinement Program.     The government appeals, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court imposed an illegal sentence. We vacate the sentence\n\nand remand for resentencing.\n\n                              I.   BACKGROUND\n\n            \"Because this appeal involves sentencing issues following\n\na guilty plea, we take the background facts from the presentence\n\nreport.\"    United States v. Brady, 168 F.3d 574, 576 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            From August of 1991 until at least December of 1997,\n\nJocel Manufacturing Corporation (\"Jocel\") manufactured and sold\n\nfrozen desserts, including ones labeled \"Caparra Ice Cream\" and\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f\"Rico,\" to restaurants and wholesale and retail customers in Puerto\n\nRico.     During most of that period, Cintron-Fernandez's father,\n\nJorge Cintron-Renta, was the overall manager of Jocel, and Cintron-\n\nFernandez was Jocel's production manager with responsibility for\n\nthe production of food products.\n\n            In   1991   and    1992,    the   United   States   Food   and   Drug\n\nAdministration     (\"the      FDA\")    warned   Cintron-Renta    and    Cintron-\n\nFernandez of the requirement that food labeled as \"ice cream\"\n\ncontain    not   less   than     ten    percent   milkfat.       21    C.F.R.   §\n\n135.110(a)(2).      Notwithstanding this warning, Cintron-Renta and\n\nCintron-Fernandez continued to produce and sell Caparra ice cream\n\nwith less than ten percent milkfat, and they misled the FDA about\n\nthe true content and labeling of the product. Thus, while Cintron-\n\nRenta promised the FDA that Jocel would revise its formula so that\n\nits ice cream would contain at least ten percent milkfat, he and\n\nCintron-Fernandez instructed Jocel's employees to use a mixture of\n\ncoconut oil and milkfat for the \"Caparra Ice Cream\" base that\n\ncontained less than ten percent milkfat.           They packed this product\n\ninto containers with labels that failed to list coconut oil as an\n\ningredient.      Ultimately, Jocel sold \"Caparra Ice Cream\" to the\n\npublic without notifying customers that it contained less than ten\n\npercent milkfat or that it contained coconut oil.                 This conduct\n\noccurred over a period of at least 21 months and is estimated to\n\nhave resulted in a loss to consumers of at least $107,706.40.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            On April 5, 2000, a federal grand jury indicted Cintron-\n\nFernandez, Cintron-Renta, and Jocel Manufacturing Corporation, for\n\nconspiracy, adulteration of food, misbranding of food, and false,\n\nfictitious, and fraudulent claims against the United States. After\n\ndiscovery, Cintron-Fernandez entered into a plea agreement with the\n\nUnited States in which he agreed to plead guilty to Counts One and\n\nSix of the indictment and to adopt the government's version of the\n\nfacts.     Count One charged that he had unlawfully, knowingly,\n\nwilfully, and intentionally combined and confederated with others\n\nto cause, with the intent to defraud or mislead, food labeled as\n\n\"ice cream\" to be adulterated and misbranded while the food was\n\nheld for sale, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), and that he had\n\nknowingly executed a scheme to defraud and obtain money by means of\n\nmaterially       false    and   fraudulent      representations    and   promises\n\nthrough the United States Postal Service, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1341, and all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.             Count Six charged\n\nthat he had, with the intent to defraud and mislead, misbranded\n\n\"ice    cream\"    while    held   for    sale    in   interstate   commerce,   in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(k) and 333(a)(2).\n\n             In   accordance      with   the    agreement,   Cintron-Fernandez\n\nentered a guilty plea. A presentence report was prepared and given\n\nto the parties, which calculated consumer loss to be $107,706.40.\n\nCintron-Fernandez filed an objection to the amount of consumer\n\nloss.    The district court referred the issue to Magistrate Judge\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fGustavo A. Gelphi, who, after an evidentiary hearing, concluded\n\nthat $107,706.40 was an appropriate figure.\n\n             On   November   13,   2002,   the   district    court    held   a\n\nsentencing hearing.     As Cintron-Fernandez had violated two closely\n\nrelated counts, the district court grouped the two counts into a\n\ncombined offense level.      Applying the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines,1\n\nthe court determined that the Count One offenses were governed by\n\n§ 2X1.1, which applies to conspiracies not covered by a specific\n\noffense Guideline.      Rather than providing its own offense level, §\n\n2X1.1(a) states that courts should apply the base offense level\n\nfrom the Guideline for the substantive offense.             Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court determined that both substantive offenses in Count\n\nOne   were   governed   by   §   2F1.1.2   The   district     court   further\n\ndetermined that the Count Two sentences were also governed by §\n\n2F1.1.3\n\n\n      1\n          As both parties agree that the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines\napply here, we apply the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines and, therefore,\nneed not determine whether applying the Guidelines in effect when\nCintron-Fernandez was sentenced would violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11; United States v. Prezioso, 989 F.2d 52,\n53-54 (1st Cir. 1993).\n      2\n          Section 2F.1.1 applies to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1341.\nSection 2N2.1 applies to violations of 21 U.S.C. 331(k), but §\n2N2.1(b) requires courts to apply § 2F1.1 instead of § 2N2.1 if the\noffense involved fraud. Here, Cintron-Fernandez pled guilty to\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 331(k) \"with intent to defraud or mislead,\"\nso § 2F1.1 applies.\n      3\n          Section 2N2.1 applies to 21 U.S.C. §§ 331 and 333(a)(2),\nbut, as mentioned, § 2N2.1(b) requires courts to apply § 2F1.1 to\noffenses involving fraud.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Based on § 2F1.1, the district court concluded that the\n\nbase offense level was six.      Since § 2F1.1 provides for increases\n\nin the offense level according to the amount of loss resulting from\n\na crime if those losses are above $2,000, the district court, using\n\nthe   consumer   loss   figure   of    $107,706.40,   increased    Cintron-\n\nFernandez's total offense level six levels.        U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1b(1).\n\nAccordingly,     it   assessed   Cintron-Fernandez's    total     guideline\n\nsentence at twelve.4      The district court further determined that\n\nCintron-Fernandez had a criminal history category of I.\n\n            Applying this offense level and criminal history to the\n\nsentencing table, the district court then determined that the\n\napplicable guideline imprisonment range was from ten to sixteen\n\nmonths (Zone C) with a fine range of $3,000 to $30,000 plus a term\n\nof supervised release of at least two but not more than three\n\nyears.    U.S.S.G. § 5A (Table).       The district court imposed a fine\n\nof $3,000 for each of the two counts and stated that appellee was\n\nto be:\n\n            committed to the custody of the Bureau of\n            Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of five\n            months and pursuant to guideline [5C1.1(d)(2)]\n            the Court will substitute one day of home\n            confinement for one day of incarceration and\n            said term of imprisonment is to be served\n            concurrently as to counts one and six.      In\n            other words, the Court, although it imposes a\n\n\n      4\n          Thereafter,     the district court added two levels for\nplanning pursuant to §    2F1.1(b)(2)(A), but it later subtracted two\nlevels for acceptance      of responsibility pursuant to § 3E1.1.\nAccordingly, the total    offense level remained at twelve.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            term of imprisonment of five months, which is\n            at the lower end of the guideline range of\n            ten, pursuant to guideline [5C1.1(e)(3)]\n            substitutes one day of home detention for one\n            day of imprisonment. Upon completion of said\n            term of five months he shall be placed on\n            supervisory release for a term of three years\n            as to each count to be served concurrently\n            under the following conditions . . . He shall\n            be placed in home detention and comply with\n            the conditions of the home confinement program\n            for a period of five months.\n\nWhen asked for clarification of the sentence by the government's\n\ncounsel, the district court explained:\n\n            And that is a type of sentence that I impose\n            when I am in Zone C at 12.            You are\n            correct . . . [5C1.1(d)(2)] provides that if\n            the Court must sentence the defendants to\n            imprisonment provided that at least one half\n            of   the  minimum   term   is   satisfied   by\n            imprisonment.    I have imposed a term of\n            imprisonment of five months as to each count\n            concurrently then I move on to [5C1.1(e)(3)]\n            which states that, that is the schedule of\n            substitute punishment and I have substituted\n            one day of home detention for one day of\n            imprisonment so although he has been sentenced\n            to a term of imprisonment as to each count,\n            five months, it is half of the minimum of the\n            guideline, nevertheless the Court substitutes\n            one day of home confinement for one day of\n            imprisonment.\n\nThe government objected, without avail, that the substitution\n\nprovision   of   §   5C1.1(e)   could    not   be   used   to   override   the\n\nGuidelines' minimum sentence requirements.\n\n            On November 20, 2002, the district court entered the\n\nannounced sentence.       The government filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.     Several months later, on April 13, 2003, under the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fjurisdiction of the Probation Office of the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico, Cintron-Fernandez began\n\nserving the five months of home detention associated with his\n\nthree-year   term   of   supervised   release,   wearing   an   electronic\n\nmonitoring device as required.        On September 11, 2003, his home\n\ndetention ended, the electronic monitoring device was removed, and\n\nCintron-Fernandez proceeded with the balance of his three-year term\n\nof supervised release.\n\n                             II.   ANALYSIS\n\n             A.   Jurisdiction\n\n          On appeal, the government argues that the district court,\n\nin imposing a total of ten months of home confinement in lieu of\n\nincarceration, failed to comply with the requirements of § 5C1.1 of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, which requires that at least one-half of\n\nthe minimum term of imprisonment, here ten months, be satisfied by\n\nimprisonment rather than by home detention.5\n\n\n     5\n          There is no dispute that the applicable sentencing range\nin this case was ten to sixteen months, that this sentence falls\nwithin Zone C of the Sentencing Guidelines, and that § 5C1.1 of the\nSentencing Guidelines governs Cintron-Fernandez's sentence.      As\ndiscussed more fully later, the government argues that the district\ncourt's sentence is illegal because it fails to satisfy the minimum\nterm required by § 5C1.1, which, it contends, requires that at\nleast half of a defendant's minimum term be satisfied by actual\nimprisonment rather than home detention. As the applicable minimum\nterm is ten months, the government argues that Cintron-Fernandez's\nsentence must include at least five months of actual imprisonment.\nThe district court's announced sentence here included two\ncomponents: first, an \"imprisonment\" component of five months to\nbe served under the aegis of the Bureau of Prisons which was,\nhowever, reduced to home confinement (still, it appears, under the\n\n                                   -8-\n\f              Cintron-Fernandez argues that we lack jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the government's appeal because the district court --\n\nrather than issuing a final order sentencing Cintron-Fernandez to\n\nhome detention in lieu of imprisonment -- simply gave to the Bureau\n\nof Prisons a non-binding and non-reviewable \"recommendation\" that\n\nCintron-Fernandez's ordered five months imprisonment be served at\n\nhome.    United States v. Melendez, 279 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(per curiam) (mere recommendation not reviewable order), cert.\n\ndenied, 535 U.S. 1120 (2002).       We see no merit to this argument, as\n\nwe   find     the   sentencing   order   to   have   been   both   final   and\n\nreviewable.\n\n              It is clear from the wording of the judgment itself, as\n\nwell as the judge's oral comments, that the judge intended Cintron-\n\nFernandez's specified term of \"imprisonment\" to consist of five\n\nmonths   of    home   confinement   in   lieu   of   incarceration.        This\n\nsubstitution was not stated as a mere recommendation.              Under the\n\nheading \"IMPRISONMENT,\" the written judgment provides,\n\n              The defendant is hereby committed to the\n              custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons\n              to be committed for a total term of five (5)\n              months as to each count, to be served\n              concurrently with each other, pursuant to\n              U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(d)(2) the defendant will be\n              placed in home confinement in lieu of\n\n\nBureau to administer); and, second, an additional five months of\nhome confinement as a condition of three years of supervisory\nrelease. The district court evidently believed these two periods\nof home confinement measured up to the minimum ten months\nGuidelines requirement.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f              incarceration, one day of home confinement for\n              one day of incarceration pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n              § 5C1.1(e)(1)(3).\n\nThe language is mandatory -- \"the defendant will be placed in home\n\nconfinement in lieu of incarceration.\"            Notably, the court did not\n\nutilize   a      space     in     the   sentencing    form     earmarked      for\n\nrecommendations to the Bureau of Prisons.             There was no check by\n\nthe box provided for the court to indicate it was making a\n\nrecommendation, nor was any purported recommendation written in the\n\nrelevant space.\n\n              The above is consistent with the district court's oral\n\ndirections during the sentencing hearing. In none of these did the\n\ncourt suggest that the Bureau of Prisons could incarcerate Cintron-\n\nFernandez in one of its facilities in lieu of the directed home\n\nconfinement.\n\n              As the judge's sentencing directions were unambiguous and\n\nunequivocal, the court's intentions were clear.              See United States\n\nv. Flynn, 49 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"'The intent of the\n\nsentencing court must guide any retrospective inquiry into the term\n\nand nature of a sentence.'\") (quoting United States v. Einspahr,\n\n35 F.3d 505, 506 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1009 (1994)).\n\nRather than a \"recommendation,\" the district court imposed a\n\nsentence of five months home detention in lieu of imprisonment\n\nfollowed by three years of supervised release, five months of which\n\nwere   also    to   be   served   in    home   detention,   together   with   an\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fassessment and fine.      Cf. United States v. Serafini, 233 F.3d 758,\n\n778 (3d Cir. 2000) (concluding that order was non-reviewable\n\nrecommendation which stated, \"The Court recommends that the Bureau\n\nof Prisons designate the Catholic Social Services of Lackawanna\n\nCounty Residential Program, Scranton, Pennsylvania, as the place\n\nfor service of this sentence,\") (emphasis added).\n\n              Cintron-Fernandez argues that since the court placed him\n\nin the Bureau of Prisons' custody, any statement by the court as to\n\nhis   place    of   confinement   could    only   be   read   as   an   implicit\n\nrecommendation because the Bureau of Prisons alone has the power to\n\ndesignate the place of imprisonment.              See 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b)\n\n(stating, \"The Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the\n\nprisoner's imprisonment.\").        But the fact that the district court\n\nmay have exceeded its own authority in ordering the Bureau to\n\nsubstitute home confinement does not turn the district court's\n\norder into a non-reviewable recommendation.            The Bureau of Prisons\n\napparently did not take Cintron-Fernandez into its custody at all\n\nbut rather elected to do nothing pending this appeal.                   Two days\n\nafter the sentence was entered, the Probation Office conducted an\n\ninitial interview with Cintron-Fernandez.               It then waited for\n\napproximately five months, perhaps out of deference to the Bureau\n\nof Prisons should the Bureau have wished to take Cintron-Fernandez\n\ninto its custody. During this period, Cintron-Fernandez telephoned\n\nthe Probation Office each month.           Finally, the Probation Office\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\finstalled, in April, a home monitoring unit in Cintron-Fernandez's\n\nhome, monitored him for five months, and served as his primary\n\ncontact throughout this period of home detention.      This five-month\n\nterm of home detention apparently fulfilled the second portion of\n\nthe district court's order imposing home detention as a condition\n\nof supervised release.     Cintron-Fernandez appears never to have\n\nserved the earlier term of home detention assigned under the label\n\nof \"IMPRISONMENT\" to the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nSee supra at p. 8, n.5.   There is, moreover, no indication that the\n\nBureau of Prisons ever undertook to make a choice of its own\n\nregarding    the   character   of    Cintron-Fernandez's   confinement.\n\nAccording to 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b), the Bureau is supposed to choose\n\na \"penal or correctional facility\" and determine that the facility\n\nmeets enumerated minimum standards of health and habitability.6\n\nRather Cintron-Fernandez was simply left to serve a single five-\n\nmonth term of home confinement as a condition of supervised release\n\nunder the aegis of the Probation Office.\n\n            We conclude that while the district court's sentencing\n\norder was in fact erroneous as hereinafter explained, it was in no\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          For present purposes, we need not reach the issue of\nwhether Cintron-Fernandez's home could ever qualify as a \"penal or\ncorrectional facility\" under 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b). We note that\nhome detention is mentioned in § 5C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines\nas a possible condition of supervised release, and, to our\nknowledge, is nowhere statutorily described as a form of\nimprisonment entrusted to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fway a mere recommendation, and is both final and reviewable on\n\nappeal.\n\n           B.    The Legality of the Sentence\n\n           The government argues that the district court's sentence\n\nis illegal because it fails to satisfy the minimum term required by\n\n§ 5C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.           We agree.    We review de novo\n\nthe   district    court's   legal       interpretations     of    the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.      United States v. Thiongo, 344 F.3d 55, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n           Section 5C1.1 states as follows:\n\n           (d) If the applicable guideline range is in\n           Zone C of the Sentencing Table, the minimum\n           term may be satisfied by --\n           (1) a sentence of imprisonment; or\n           (2) a sentence of imprisonment that includes a\n           term of supervised release with a condition\n           that substitutes community confinement or home\n           detention according to the schedule in\n           subsection (e), provided that at least one-\n           half of the minimum term is satisfied by\n           imprisonment.\n\nAs Cintron-Fernandez's sentence is within Zone C, § 5C1.1(d)\n\napplies.   Accordingly, the minimum term of his sentence -- ten\n\nmonths -- can be satisfied in two ways.             First, a sentence of ten\n\nmonths imprisonment would satisfy the minimum term.                     U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.1(d)(1).        Secondly,       a    sentence    that        substitutes   for\n\nimprisonment home detention according to the substitution schedule\n\nof § 5C1.1(e), provided that at least one-half of the minimum term\n\nis satisfied by imprisonment, would satisfy the minimum term.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(d)(2).              Section 5C1.1(e) allows one day of home\n\ndetention or community confinement to be credited for one day of\n\nimprisonment. Thus, if the court wished to impose the most lenient\n\nlegal minimum sentence against Cintron-Fernandez, it could have\n\nsentenced him to five months imprisonment together with five months\n\nof     home   detention       or     community     confinement.        U.S.S.G.   §§\n\n5C1.1(d)(2) & (e).          Cintron-Fernandez's sentence must include at\n\nleast five months of imprisonment in order to satisfy the minimum\n\nterm.\n\n              Here the court stated that it committed Cintron-Fernandez\n\n\"to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a\n\nterm of       five   months.\"        But    immediately     thereafter    the   court\n\nsubstituted five months of home detention in lieu of incarceration.\n\nIt then added three years of supervised release, five months of\n\nwhich would also be served in home detention.                       Such a sentence\n\nfails to meet the guideline requirement that \"at least one half of\n\nthe minimum term [here ten months] is satisfied by imprisonment.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 5C.1.1(d) & (e).            Rather, it provides for ten months of\n\nhome detention with no \"imprisonment\" at all.\n\n              Cintron-Fernandez argues that the Guideline requirement\n\nthat    at    least    half     of    the     minimum   term   be    \"satisfied    by\n\nimprisonment\" allows the \"imprisonment\" portion making up the half\n\nterm    to    itself   be     also     home    detention.      Under     this   view,\n\n\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\f\"imprisonment\" in § 5C1.1 can mean not only time served in prison\n\nbut time served in home detention or community confinement.\n\n               Cintron-Fernandez's interpretation is without merit.           It\n\nis clear from both the text and commentary of § 5C1.1 that, in the\n\ncontext of § 5C1.1,7 the minimum half term of \"imprisonment\" cannot\n\nbe   satisfied     by    home   detention    or   by   community   confinement.\n\nAccording to §§ 5C1.1(d) & (e), home detention and community\n\nconfinement       are    considered   as     \"Substitute    Punishments\"      for\n\nimprisonment, not merely different forms of imprisonment itself.\n\nSee also United States v. Delloiacono, 900 F.2d 481, 484 n.7 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (stating \"Since November 1, 1989, 'home detention,'\n\nwhich also requires confinement, has been an authorized substitute\n\nfor a term of imprisonment.\").\n\n               Section 5C1.1's commentary states \"at least one half of\n\nthe minimum term specified in the guideline range must be satisfied\n\nby imprisonment, and the remainder of the minimum term specified in\n\nthe guideline range must be satisfied by community confinement or\n\nhome       detention.\"     This   explanation     would    be   meaningless    if\n\n\n\n       7\n          Our interpretation of imprisonment does not necessarily\napply to provisions other than § 5C1.1. The commentary to § 1B1.1,\nwhich governs general application of the Guidelines, states,\n\"Definitions of terms also may appear in other sections.      Such\ndefinitions are not designed for general applicability; therefore,\ntheir applicability to sections other than those expressly\nreferenced must be determined on a case by case basis.\" See also\nUnited States v. Rasco, 963 F.2d 132, 137 (6th Cir. 1992) (stating\nthat the Guidelines caution against attempting to achieve\ndefinitional coherence across numerous provisions).\n\n                                      -15-\n\fimprisonment meant the very same thing as home detention.                         See\n\nUnited States v. Reccko, 151 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating\n\nGuideline commentary is binding unless it violates federal law, is\n\ninconsistent with Guidelines, or is based on plainly erroneous\n\nreading of Guideline provision). That the two terms mean different\n\nthings is also shown by the example given in the commentary \"that\n\nsatisfies    the   minimum   term     of   imprisonment        required    by     the\n\nguideline range.\"       U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1, comment.        (n.4).       The example\n\nspecifies   that   \"where    the    guideline     range   is    8-14    months,     a\n\nsentence    of   four   months     imprisonment    followed      by    a   term    of\n\nsupervised release with a condition requiring four months community\n\nconfinement or home detention would satisfy the minimum term of\n\nimprisonment required by the guideline range.\"                 Id.\n\n            Cintron-Fernandez's proposed interpretation is also at\n\nodds with the case law.          See, e.g., Serafini, 233 F.3d at 778\n\n(stating community confinement cannot constitute imprisonment for\n\npurposes of fulfilling the requirement that one-half of a split\n\nsentence be satisfied by imprisonment under § 5C1.1); United States\n\nv. Adler, 52 F.3d 20, 21 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating, \"We agree with\n\nthe government that the district court's interpretation of Sections\n\n5C2.1(d) and (e) is erroneous.               'Imprisonment' and 'community\n\nconfinement' are not synonyms . . . Moreover, as the Seventh and\n\nNinth Circuits have already concluded, Section 5C1.1(d), the almost\n\nidentically-worded successor to Section 5C2.1(d), clearly makes a\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fdistinction       between    imprisonment    and   community      confinement.\")\n\n(citations omitted); United States v. Jalili, 925 F.2d 889, 892\n\n(6th Cir. 1991) (stating, \"we read Guideline § 5C1.1 . . . to mean\n\nthat community confinement may be included as a condition during\n\nthe term of supervised release.\"). We decline, therefore, to adopt\n\nCintron-Fernandez's interpretation of § 5C1.1.\n\n             It    follows    that   the   district     court's    sentence   was\n\nerroneous insofar as it failed to require at least five months of\n\nimprisonment together with the five months of home detention that\n\nit imposed as a condition of the three year term of supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n             We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand\n\nthe   case   for    resentencing     in    accordance    with   the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines as herein interpreted and resolution of any related\n\nissues.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n            \"Because this appeal involves sentencing issues following\n\na guilty plea, we take the background facts from the presentence\n\nreport.\"    United States v. Brady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198343\"><a href=\"/opinion/198343/united-states-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            From August of 1991 until at least December of 1997,\n\nJocel Manufacturing Corporation (\"Jocel\") manufactured and sold\n\nfrozen desserts, including ones labeled \"Caparra Ice Cream\" and\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f\"Rico,\" to restaurants and wholesale and retail customers in Puerto\n\nRico.     During most of that period, Cintron-Fernandez's father,\n\nJorge Cintron-Renta, was the overall manager of Jocel, and Cintron-\n\nFernandez was Jocel's production manager with responsibility for\n\nthe production of food products.\n\n            In   1991   and    1992,    the   United   States   Food   and   Drug\n\nAdministration     (\"the      FDA\")    warned   Cintron-Renta    and    Cintron-\n\nFernandez of the requirement that food labeled as \"ice cream\"\n\ncontain    not   less   than     ten    percent   milkfat.       21    C.F.R.   §\n\n135.110(a)(2).      Notwithstanding this warning, Cintron-Renta and\n\nCintron-Fernandez continued to produce and sell Caparra ice cream\n\nwith less than ten percent milkfat, and they misled the FDA about\n\nthe true content and labeling of the product. Thus, while Cintron-\n\nRenta promised the FDA that Jocel would revise its formula so that\n\nits ice cream would contain at least ten percent milkfat, he and\n\nCintron-Fernandez instructed Jocel's employees to use a mixture of\n\ncoconut oil and milkfat for the \"Caparra Ice Cream\" base that\n\ncontained less than ten percent milkfat.           They packed this product\n\ninto containers with labels that failed to list coconut oil as an\n\ningredient.      Ultimately, Jocel sold \"Caparra Ice Cream\" to the\n\npublic without notifying customers that it contained less than ten\n\npercent milkfat or that it contained coconut oil.                 This conduct\n\noccurred over a period of at least 21 months and is estimated to\n\nhave resulted in a loss to consumers of at least $107,706.40.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            On April 5, 2000, a federal grand jury indicted Cintron-\n\nFernandez, Cintron-Renta, and Jocel Manufacturing Corporation, for\n\nconspiracy, adulteration of food, misbranding of food, and false,\n\nfictitious, and fraudulent claims against the United States. After\n\ndiscovery, Cintron-Fernandez entered into a plea agreement with the\n\nUnited States in which he agreed to plead guilty to Counts One and\n\nSix of the indictment and to adopt the government's version of the\n\nfacts.     Count One charged that he had unlawfully, knowingly,\n\nwilfully, and intentionally combined and confederated with others\n\nto cause, with the intent to defraud or mislead, food labeled as\n\n\"ice cream\" to be adulterated and misbranded while the food was\n\nheld for sale, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), and that he had\n\nknowingly executed a scheme to defraud and obtain money by means of\n\nmaterially       false    and   fraudulent      representations    and   promises\n\nthrough the United States Postal Service, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1341, and all in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.             Count Six charged\n\nthat he had, with the intent to defraud and mislead, misbranded\n\n\"ice    cream\"    while    held   for    sale    in   interstate   commerce,   in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(k) and 333(a)(2).\n\n             In   accordance      with   the    agreement,   Cintron-Fernandez\n\nentered a guilty plea. A presentence report was prepared and given\n\nto the parties, which calculated consumer loss to be $107,706.40.\n\nCintron-Fernandez filed an objection to the amount of consumer\n\nloss.    The district court referred the issue to Magistrate Judge\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fGustavo A. Gelphi, who, after an evidentiary hearing, concluded\n\nthat $107,706.40 was an appropriate figure.\n\n             On   November   13,   2002,   the   district    court    held   a\n\nsentencing hearing.     As Cintron-Fernandez had violated two closely\n\nrelated counts, the district court grouped the two counts into a\n\ncombined offense level.      Applying the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines,1\n\nthe court determined that the Count One offenses were governed by\n\n§ 2X1.1, which applies to conspiracies not covered by a specific\n\noffense Guideline.      Rather than providing its own offense level, §\n\n2X1.1(a) states that courts should apply the base offense level\n\nfrom the Guideline for the substantive offense.             Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court determined that both substantive offenses in Count\n\nOne   were   governed   by   §   2F1.1.2   The   district     court   further\n\ndetermined that the Count Two sentences were also governed by §\n\n2F1.1.3\n\n\n      1\n          As both parties agree that the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines\napply here, we apply the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines and, therefore,\nneed not determine whether applying the Guidelines in effect when\nCintron-Fernandez was sentenced would violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause.

Here, Cintron-Fernandez pled guilty to\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 331(k) \"with intent to defraud or mislead,\"\nso § 2F1.1 applies.\n      3\n          Section 2N2.1 applies to 21 U.S.C. §§ 331 and 333(a)(2),\nbut, as mentioned, § 2N2.1(b) requires courts to apply § 2F1.1 to\noffenses involving fraud.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           Based on § 2F1.1, the district court concluded that the\n\nbase offense level was six.      Since § 2F1.1 provides for increases\n\nin the offense level according to the amount of loss resulting from\n\na crime if those losses are above $2,000, the district court, using\n\nthe   consumer   loss   figure   of    $107,706.40,   increased    Cintron-\n\nFernandez's total offense level six levels.        U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1b(1).\n\nAccordingly,     it   assessed   Cintron-Fernandez's    total     guideline\n\nsentence at twelve.4      The district court further determined that\n\nCintron-Fernandez had a criminal history category of I.\n\n            Applying this offense level and criminal history to the\n\nsentencing table, the district court then determined that the\n\napplicable guideline imprisonment range was from ten to sixteen\n\nmonths (Zone C) with a fine range of $3,000 to $30,000 plus a term\n\nof supervised release of at least two but not more than three\n\nyears.    U.S.S.G. § 5A (Table).       The district court imposed a fine\n\nof $3,000 for each of the two counts and stated that appellee was\n\nto be:\n\n            committed to the custody of the Bureau of\n            Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of five\n            months and pursuant to guideline [5C1.1(d)(2)]\n            the Court will substitute one day of home\n            confinement for one day of incarceration and\n            said term of imprisonment is to be served\n            concurrently as to counts one and six.      In\n            other words, the Court, although it imposes a\n\n\n      4\n          Thereafter,     the district court added two levels for\nplanning pursuant to §    2F1.1(b)(2)(A), but it later subtracted two\nlevels for acceptance      of responsibility pursuant to § 3E1.1.\nAccordingly, the total    offense level remained at twelve.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            term of imprisonment of five months, which is\n            at the lower end of the guideline range of\n            ten, pursuant to guideline [5C1.1(e)(3)]\n            substitutes one day of home detention for one\n            day of imprisonment.

He shall\n            be placed in home detention and comply with\n            the conditions of the home confinement program\n            for a period of five months.\n\nWhen asked for clarification of the sentence by the government's\n\ncounsel, the district court explained:\n\n            And that is a type of sentence that I impose\n            when I am in Zone C at 12.            You are\n            correct . . . [5C1.1(d)(2)] provides that if\n            the Court must sentence the defendants to\n            imprisonment provided that at least one half\n            of   the  minimum   term   is   satisfied   by\n            imprisonment.    I have imposed a term of\n            imprisonment of five months as to each count\n            concurrently then I move on to [5C1.1(e)(3)]\n            which states that, that is the schedule of\n            substitute punishment and I have substituted\n            one day of home detention for one day of\n            imprisonment so although he has been sentenced\n            to a term of imprisonment as to each count,\n            five months, it is half of the minimum of the\n            guideline, nevertheless the Court substitutes\n            one day of home confinement for one day of\n            imprisonment.\n\nThe government objected, without avail, that the substitution\n\nprovision   of   §   5C1.1(e)   could    not   be   used   to   override   the\n\nGuidelines' minimum sentence requirements.\n\n            On November 20, 2002, the district court entered the\n\nannounced sentence.       The government filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.     Several months later, on April 13, 2003, under the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fjurisdiction of the Probation Office of the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico, Cintron-Fernandez began\n\nserving the five months of home detention associated with his\n\nthree-year   term   of   supervised   release,   wearing   an   electronic\n\nmonitoring device as required.        On September 11, 2003, his home\n\ndetention ended, the electronic monitoring device was removed, and\n\nCintron-Fernandez proceeded with the balance of his three-year term\n\nof supervised release.\n\n                             II.   ANALYSIS\n\n             A.   Jurisdiction\n\n          On appeal, the government argues that the district court,\n\nin imposing a total of ten months of home confinement in lieu of\n\nincarceration, failed to comply with the requirements of § 5C1.1 of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines, which requires that at least one-half of\n\nthe minimum term of imprisonment, here ten months, be satisfied by\n\nimprisonment rather than by home detention.5\n\n\n     5\n          There is no dispute that the applicable sentencing range\nin this case was ten to sixteen months, that this sentence falls\nwithin Zone C of the Sentencing Guidelines, and that § 5C1.1 of the\nSentencing Guidelines governs Cintron-Fernandez's sentence.      As\ndiscussed more fully later, the government argues that the district\ncourt's sentence is illegal because it fails to satisfy the minimum\nterm required by § 5C1.1, which, it contends, requires that at\nleast half of a defendant's minimum term be satisfied by actual\nimprisonment rather than home detention. As the applicable minimum\nterm is ten months, the government argues that Cintron-Fernandez's\nsentence must include at least five months of actual imprisonment.\nThe district court's announced sentence here included two\ncomponents: first, an \"imprisonment\" component of five months to\nbe served under the aegis of the Bureau of Prisons which was,\nhowever, reduced to home confinement (still, it appears, under the\n\n                                   -8-\n\f              Cintron-Fernandez argues that we lack jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the government's appeal because the district court --\n\nrather than issuing a final order sentencing Cintron-Fernandez to\n\nhome detention in lieu of imprisonment -- simply gave to the Bureau\n\nof Prisons a non-binding and non-reviewable \"recommendation\" that\n\nCintron-Fernandez's ordered five months imprisonment be served at\n\nhome.    United States v. Melendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199806\"><a href=\"/opinion/199806/united-states-v-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(per curiam) (mere recommendation not reviewable order), cert.\n\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1120</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).       We see no merit to this argument, as\n\nwe   find     the   sentencing   order   to   have   been   both   final   and\n\nreviewable.\n\n              It is clear from the wording of the judgment itself, as\n\nwell as the judge's oral comments, that the judge intended Cintron-\n\nFernandez's specified term of \"imprisonment\" to consist of five\n\nmonths   of    home   confinement   in   lieu   of   incarceration.        This\n\nsubstitution was not stated as a mere recommendation.              Under the\n\nheading \"IMPRISONMENT,\" the written judgment provides,\n\n              The defendant is hereby committed to the\n              custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons\n              to be committed for a total term of five (5)\n              months as to each count, to be served\n              concurrently with each other, pursuant to\n              U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(d)(2) the defendant will be\n              placed in home confinement in lieu of\n\n\nBureau to administer); and, second, an additional five months of\nhome confinement as a condition of three years of supervisory\nrelease. The district court evidently believed these two periods\nof home confinement measured up to the minimum ten months\nGuidelines requirement.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f              incarceration, one day of home confinement for\n              one day of incarceration pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n              § 5C1.1(e)(1)(3).\n\nThe language is mandatory -- \"the defendant will be placed in home\n\nconfinement in lieu of incarceration.\"            Notably, the court did not\n\nutilize   a      space     in     the   sentencing    form     earmarked      for\n\nrecommendations to the Bureau of Prisons.             There was no check by\n\nthe box provided for the court to indicate it was making a\n\nrecommendation, nor was any purported recommendation written in the\n\nrelevant space.\n\n              The above is consistent with the district court's oral\n\ndirections during the sentencing hearing. In none of these did the\n\ncourt suggest that the Bureau of Prisons could incarcerate Cintron-\n\nFernandez in one of its facilities in lieu of the directed home\n\nconfinement.\n\n              As the judge's sentencing directions were unambiguous and\n\nunequivocal, the court's intentions were clear.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b)\n\n(stating, \"The Bureau of Prisons shall designate the place of the\n\nprisoner's imprisonment.\").        But the fact that the district court\n\nmay have exceeded its own authority in ordering the Bureau to\n\nsubstitute home confinement does not turn the district court's\n\norder into a non-reviewable recommendation.            The Bureau of Prisons\n\napparently did not take Cintron-Fernandez into its custody at all\n\nbut rather elected to do nothing pending this appeal.                   Two days\n\nafter the sentence was entered, the Probation Office conducted an\n\ninitial interview with Cintron-Fernandez.               It then waited for\n\napproximately five months, perhaps out of deference to the Bureau\n\nof Prisons should the Bureau have wished to take Cintron-Fernandez\n\ninto its custody. During this period, Cintron-Fernandez telephoned\n\nthe Probation Office each month.           Finally, the Probation Office\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\finstalled, in April, a home monitoring unit in Cintron-Fernandez's\n\nhome, monitored him for five months, and served as his primary\n\ncontact throughout this period of home detention.      This five-month\n\nterm of home detention apparently fulfilled the second portion of\n\nthe district court's order imposing home detention as a condition\n\nof supervised release.     Cintron-Fernandez appears never to have\n\nserved the earlier term of home detention assigned under the label\n\nof \"IMPRISONMENT\" to the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nSee supra at p. 8, n.5.   There is, moreover, no indication that the\n\nBureau of Prisons ever undertook to make a choice of its own\n\nregarding    the   character   of    Cintron-Fernandez's   confinement.\n\nAccording to 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b), the Bureau is supposed to choose\n\na \"penal or correctional facility\" and determine that the facility\n\nmeets enumerated minimum standards of health and habitability.6\n\nRather Cintron-Fernandez was simply left to serve a single five-\n\nmonth term of home confinement as a condition of supervised release\n\nunder the aegis of the Probation Office.\n\n            We conclude that while the district court's sentencing\n\norder was in fact erroneous as hereinafter explained, it was in no\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          For present purposes, we need not reach the issue of\nwhether Cintron-Fernandez's home could ever qualify as a \"penal or\ncorrectional facility\" under 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b). We note that\nhome detention is mentioned in § 5C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines\nas a possible condition of supervised release, and, to our\nknowledge, is nowhere statutorily described as a form of\nimprisonment entrusted to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fway a mere recommendation, and is both final and reviewable on\n\nappeal.\n\n           B.    The Legality of the Sentence\n\n           The government argues that the district court's sentence\n\nis illegal because it fails to satisfy the minimum term required by\n\n§ 5C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.           We agree.    We review de novo\n\nthe   district    court's   legal       interpretations     of    the   Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.      United States v. Thiongo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200648\"><a href=\"/opinion/200648/united-states-v-thiongo/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n           Section 5C1.1 states as follows:\n\n           (d) If the applicable guideline range is in\n           Zone C of the Sentencing Table, the minimum\n           term may be satisfied by --\n           (1) a sentence of imprisonment; or\n           (2) a sentence of imprisonment that includes a\n           term of supervised release with a condition\n           that substitutes community confinement or home\n           detention according to the schedule in\n           subsection (e), provided that at least one-\n           half of the minimum term is satisfied by\n           imprisonment.\n\nAs Cintron-Fernandez's sentence is within Zone C, § 5C1.1(d)\n\napplies.   Accordingly, the minimum term of his sentence -- ten\n\nmonths -- can be satisfied in two ways.             First, a sentence of ten\n\nmonths imprisonment would satisfy the minimum term.                     U.S.S.G. §\n\n5C1.1(d)(1).        Secondly,       a    sentence    that        substitutes   for\n\nimprisonment home detention according to the substitution schedule\n\nof § 5C1.1(e), provided that at least one-half of the minimum term\n\nis satisfied by imprisonment, would satisfy the minimum term.\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(d)(2).              Section 5C1.1(e) allows one day of home\n\ndetention or community confinement to be credited for one day of\n\nimprisonment. Thus, if the court wished to impose the most lenient\n\nlegal minimum sentence against Cintron-Fernandez, it could have\n\nsentenced him to five months imprisonment together with five months\n\nof     home   detention       or     community     confinement.        U.S.S.G.   §§\n\n5C1.1(d)(2) & (e).          Cintron-Fernandez's sentence must include at\n\nleast five months of imprisonment in order to satisfy the minimum\n\nterm.\n\n              Here the court stated that it committed Cintron-Fernandez\n\n\"to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a\n\nterm of       five   months.\"        But    immediately     thereafter    the   court\n\nsubstituted five months of home detention in lieu of incarceration.\n\nIt then added three years of supervised release, five months of\n\nwhich would also be served in home detention.                       Such a sentence\n\nfails to meet the guideline requirement that \"at least one half of\n\nthe minimum term [here ten months] is satisfied by imprisonment.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 5C.1.1(d) & (e).            Rather, it provides for ten months of\n\nhome detention with no \"imprisonment\" at all.\n\n              Cintron-Fernandez argues that the Guideline requirement\n\nthat    at    least    half     of    the     minimum   term   be    \"satisfied    by\n\nimprisonment\" allows the \"imprisonment\" portion making up the half\n\nterm    to    itself   be     also     home    detention.      Under     this   view,\n\n\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\f\"imprisonment\" in § 5C1.1 can mean not only time served in prison\n\nbut time served in home detention or community confinement.\n\n               Cintron-Fernandez's interpretation is without merit.           It\n\nis clear from both the text and commentary of § 5C1.1 that, in the\n\ncontext of § 5C1.1,7 the minimum half term of \"imprisonment\" cannot\n\nbe   satisfied     by    home   detention    or   by   community   confinement.\n\nAccording to §§ 5C1.1(d) & (e), home detention and community\n\nconfinement       are    considered   as     \"Substitute    Punishments\"      for\n\nimprisonment, not merely different forms of imprisonment itself.\n\nSee also United States v.
