Tenison Clarke, a native of Barbados, was\n\nordered removed from this country by an Immigration Judge on July\n\n23,   2004.      Clarke      was    found    removable    on   the    basis    of   his\n\nconviction       of     an         aggravated      felony,      see      8     U.S.C.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), that is, his February 7, 1986 conviction in\n\nstate court of the crime of rape and abuse of a child, see Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 265, § 23.\n\n              The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the order\n\nof removal on January 30, 2006.               The BIA agreed with the IJ that\n\nClarke was removable as an aggravated felon and that Clarke was\n\nineligible     for    waiver       of   inadmissibility    under     §   212   of   the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Act.               It held there was no error in\n\nthe IJ's denial of Clarke's motion to terminate proceedings to\n\npermit him to pursue a naturalization application (on the grounds\n\nthat he was not prima facie eligible for naturalization and his\n\nlack of good moral character disqualified him as well).\n\n              Clarke had been charged with removability in a Notice to\n\nAppear, served on him on February 2, 2001.               This date subjected him\n\nto the terms of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat.\n\n3009.   See Choeum v.

The respondent appropriately\n\nagrees that this court has jurisdiction over that argument under 8\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), although normally there is a jurisdictional\n\nbar to review of aggravated felony determinations under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(C).\n\n              Clarke concedes that his crime is defined by IIRIRA as an\n\naggravated felony.        He argues1 that this does not show that\n\nCongress intended to render him removable and that such a result\n\nwould    be   unconstitutional   because   he   would   then   be   treated\n\ndifferently from similarly situated felons who were placed into\n\nremoval proceedings before September 30, 1996 and were still\n\neligible for waiver of inadmissibility.\n\n              Clarke's claims are foreclosed by this court's decision\n\nin Sena v.
