George Correia appeals the\n\ndistrict court order which denied his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254, in which he contended that a state\n\ntrial court judge violated due process by vindictively punishing\n\nhim for exercising his right to a jury trial on various criminal\n\ncharges.   We affirm.\n\n                                   I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n           On September 8, 1995, petitioner asked a Boston-area car\n\ndealership salesman for permission to test-drive a 1989 Corvette.\n\nDuring the ensuing drive, Correia absconded with the vehicle. Four\n\ndays later, a Boston police officer saw Correia as he was driving\n\nthe Corvette in the Beacon Hill area.        Unaware that the Corvette\n\nwas stolen, the officer pulled it over after noting that it had\n\nneither a valid license plate nor a current inspection sticker. As\n\nthe officer approached the Corvette on foot, Correia abruptly sped\n\naway from the scene, leading State and Boston police [hereinafter:\n\n“police”] on a prolonged high-speed car chase on downtown Boston\n\nstreets    and   adjacent   freeways.   During    the   chase,   Correia\n\nrecklessly drove the wrong way down one-way streets, crashed into\n\nseveral other police and civilian vehicles, repeatedly refused\n\npolice demands to surrender at gunpoint, attempted to run over\n\nseveral on-foot police officers, and finally managed to strike a\n\npolice officer with the vehicle. This vehicular rampage caused\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fsevere bruises and lacerations to a police officer, as well as\n\nspinal injuries to a civilian automobile driver.\n\n           In due course, Correia was indicted in Suffolk County\n\nSuperior Court on forty-eight counts: speeding (4 counts), driving\n\nto endanger (4), driving with a suspended license (1), assault and\n\nbattery with a vehicle (6), assault with a vehicle (6), receiving\n\nstolen goods (2), leaving the scene after causing personal injury\n\nor vehicular damages (17), driving the wrong way on a one-way\n\nstreet (2), and failing to stop for a police officer (6).\n\n           Prior to the jury trial, Correia informed the presiding\n\nsuperior   court   judge   that    he   might   agree    to   plead   guilty.\n\nWhereupon the judge informed Correia that he probably would impose\n\na 5-to-7 year prison sentence should Correia enter a guilty plea.\n\nHowever, shortly thereafter Correia elected to proceed to trial.\n\nFinally,   disregarding    the    court’s   advice,     Correia   elected   to\n\nrepresent himself at trial.\n\n           Following trial, the jury convicted Correia on twenty-one\n\nof the forty-eight counts:        assault and battery with the Corvette\n\n(1 count); assault with the Corvette (1); receiving stolen goods\n\n(2); leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicle\n\ndamage (11); and failing to stop for a police officer (6).1                 The\n\n\n\n     1\n      The trial court allowed the government's pretrial motion to\ndismiss 20 of the 48 counts, and the jury eventually acquitted\nCorreia on 5 of the 6 counts charging assault and battery with a\nvehicle, and 2 of the 6 counts charging assault with a vehicle.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ftrial judge denied Correia’s ensuing motions for a new trial, and\n\nsentenced him to imprisonment for 12 to 17 years, well within the\n\nsentencing range prescribed by statute.\n\n          The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the convictions\n\nand sentences in an unpublished opinion, and the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt denied the ensuing application for further appellate review.\n\nIn February 2002, Correia submitted the instant habeas corpus\n\npetition to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts, which denied the requested relief and issued its\n\ncertificate   of   appealability.         Correia   now    appeals   from   the\n\ndistrict court order denying the petition for habeas corpus.\n\n                                     II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n          Correia contends that the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nunreasonably applied clearly established United States Supreme\n\nCourt precedent     in   rejecting   his    claim   that    the   trial   court\n\nvindictively punished him for refusing to enter a guilty plea prior\n\nto trial by imposing a 12-to-17 year prison term, rather than the\n\n5-to-7 year term which would have been imposed had Correia entered\n\na guilty plea.     As evidence of the alleged vindictiveness, Correia\n\nrelies upon (i) the large numerical differential between the\n\npretrial and post-trial sentencing ranges; (ii) the jury acquittals\n\non many of the more serious charges in the indictment; and (iii)\n\nthe comments made by the trial judge during trial, suggesting that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthe trial judge himself believed that Correia was guilty and that\n\nthe trial was a waste of judicial resources.\n\n           We review denials of habeas corpus relief de novo,\n\ninquiring whether the state-court decision is “contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an   unreasonable   application   of,   clearly   established\n\n[Supreme Court precedent].”       28 U.S.C. § 2254; see Williams v.\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404-05 (2000).            A state-court decision\n\ncontravenes the “unreasonable application” criterion when, though\n\nit correctly identifies the pertinent United States Supreme Court\n\nrule, its application to the particular facts of the case at bar is\n\nobjectively unreasonable.      Id. at 409-10.\n\n           In affirming the conviction notwithstanding Correia's\n\n\"vindictive sentencing\" claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nrelied upon three grounds :     (1) the trial court cited objective,\n\nnon-vindictive reasons for imposing a higher sentence following\n\ntrial; (2) the trial court neither stated nor implied that Correia\n\nwould receive a higher sentence if he did not plead guilty; and (3)\n\nat no time did the trial court evince a belief that the trial was\n\na waste of judicial resources.\n\n           In the event a criminal defendant successfully appeals\n\nhis conviction and the same trial judge imposes a stiffer sentence\n\nfollowing a retrial, the presumption arises that the harsher\n\nsentence was a product of judicial vindictiveness in response to\n\nthe defendant's rightful recourse to the appellate process; yet\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthis   presumption     is    rebuttable          provided   the       record    contains\n\nobjective    evidence    which       adequately       explains    the       more   severe\n\nsentence.     See United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 373-74\n\n(1982); North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 726 (1969); United\n\nStates v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1037 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            The same presumption may arise when a criminal defendant\n\nrejects a plea agreement – and with it the prospect of a more\n\nlenient     sentence     –     and        elects     instead     to        exercise       his\n\nconstitutional right to a jury trial.                See, e.g., Johnson v. Vose,\n\n927 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir. 1991).                   The two situations differ, of\n\ncourse, in that a higher sentence after a remand and retrial alters\n\na judge’s previously imposed punishment, whereas a higher sentence\n\nafter a failed plea bargain is not a retreat from a previously\n\nimposed sentence, and as here, is likely to reflect additional\n\nevidence adduced at trial and the loss of a discount for pleading\n\nguilty.\n\n            In   any    event,       as    this     presumption       is    designed       to\n\nsafeguard    against     the     risk       of     actual   vindictiveness            –    as\n\ndistinguished from the mere fact that the sentencing court decided\n\nto impose a harsher sentence following a trial or retrial – the\n\npresumption “arises only in circumstances ‘in which there is a\n\n“reasonable likelihood” that the increase in sentence is the\n\nproduct of actual vindictiveness.’”                 Id. (citing Alabama v. Smith,\n\n490 U.S. 794, 799 (1989))             (citations omitted; emphasis added).\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fAbsent    such     a   \"reasonable        likelihood,\"      the     aforementioned\n\npresumption is never triggered, and the defendant must instead\n\nestablish actual vindictiveness.               See id.\n\n               The record in the instant case simply cannot support a\n\ndetermination that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably\n\napplied the pertinent legal principles.                See Williams, 529 U.S. at\n\n405.    First, the mere fact that the post-verdict sentence exceeded\n\nthe    \"plea    bargain\"   sentence       by    some   seven   to    ten   years   is\n\ninsufficient, in and of itself, to indicate a reasonable likelihood\n\nof actual vindictiveness.               For one thing, unlike a verdict of\n\nguilty, an admission of guilt properly warrants the sentencing\n\ncourt’s   consideration        of   a    more   lenient    sentence     than   might\n\notherwise be imposed in appropriate response to the defendant’s\n\ncriminal conduct.       See Smith, 490 U.S. at 802.            Thus, the five-to-\n\nseven year prison sentence proffered to Correia during the plea\n\nbargaining process does not reflect a true assessment of Correia's\n\ncriminal culpability, in that it plainly included a substantial\n\ndiscount for leniency.\n\n               As for the remaining aspect of the differential, normally\n\nthe    sentencing      court   imposes      a    post-verdict       sentence   after\n\nconsidering the evidence presented at trial.                In contrast, a plea-\n\nbargained sentence normally is predicated upon a more rudimentary\n\nrecord of the alleged criminal conduct, such as the description in\n\nthe indictment, and/or a presentence report.                      See id. at 801.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fIndeed, the sentencing judge in this case adverted to this very\n\nconsideration in sentencing Correia, explicitly observing that both\n\nthe government’s graphic trial presentation regarding the sheer\n\nrecklessness of the Correia rampage, and Correia’s apparent lack of\n\nremorse, see id. (“[T]he defendant’s conduct during trial may give\n\nthe judge insights into [the defendant’s] moral character and\n\nsuitability for rehabilitation.”), accounted in substantial part\n\nfor the decision to impose the harsher sentence.2\n\n\n     2\n         At the sentencing hearing, the judge stated:\n\n          For the record, I wish to make a statement because\n     the sentence imposed here is substantially greater than\n     the sentence discussed at the outset of this trial when\n     there was the prospect of a guilty plea.      Since that\n     time, I’ve come to know the details of the crimes\n     involved here and the character of the defendant a lot\n     better than I knew when I would have been content with a\n     much lower sentence. In my wildest imagination I could\n     find it difficult to find a worse possible scenario for\n     the aftermath or the consequences of a stolen motor\n     vehicle. As I reviewed my notes, I counted over twenty\n     vehicles that were damaged, smashed into some way by the\n     operation of that vehicle that morning. It has got to be\n     miraculous that no one was killed as a result of this.\n     There was, however, one man seriously injured and he is\n     still suffering the consequences of the conduct of the\n     defendant that day. The conduct of the defendant on the\n     date in question evidenced an absolutely total disregard\n     for the lives of anyone and the property of everyone. In\n     the conduct of his acts that day he viciously attacked\n     any police officers trying to stop him. He was obviously\n     going to stop at nothing, or for nothing, I should say,\n     and ultimately forced the police to use gunfire to stop\n     him on the corner of Washington and Marginal. During the\n     conduct of the trial, he has demonstrated absolutely no\n     remorse for what has gone on that day. On the contrary,\n     he has converted himself from a perpetrator of serious\n     crimes to a victim of police brutality because of the\n     fact that he forced them to use gunfire to stop him on\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          Compared with the sparse information available to the\n\ntrial judge at the pretrial conference,3 consisting of little more\n\nthan a recitation of the charges set forth in the indictment, see\n\nsupra Section I, the trial record abundantly demonstrates not only\n\nthe gravity of the alleged criminal conduct, but the increased risk\n\nof serious bodily harm to which Correia exposed not only the law\n\nenforcement   officers   involved,   but   any   hapless   civilian   who\n\nhappened to be in his way.    Cf. Pearce, 395 U.S. at 723 (“A trial\n\njudge is not constitutionally precluded, in other words, from\n\nimposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original\n\nsentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first trial that\n\nmay have thrown new light upon the defendant's ‘life, health,\n\nhabits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.’”) (citation\n\n\n\n     that occasion. I see no prospect of rehabilitation for\n     this defendant and consequently have sentenced him as I\n     have.\n     3\n      Correia points solely to the trial judge’s pretrial\nobservation that Correia “practically wiped out half of the Boston\nPolice Department and the state troopers, according to the\ncharges.” (Emphasis added.)      Although the quoted observation\nplainly reflects a measure of hyperbole, it was neither made in the\npresence of the jury nor purported to be a premature assessment of\nCorreia’s level of culpability, as distinguished from a recounting\nof the known and undisputed consequences of Correia's conduct as\nset forth in the indictment. See, e.g., Taylor v. Kincheloe, 920\nF.2d 599, 608 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding trial judge's description of\ncharged offenses, as “execution style slayings,” not evidence of\nvindictiveness, “since it is obvious that a judge may consider the\ncircumstances of the offense in making a sentencing decision, [and]\n[Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 798 (1989)] is founded on the notion\nthat this is exactly what we expect judges to do.”).\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fomitted).   For instance, when a police officer initially approached\n\nthe vehicle Correia was driving – blatantly stolen some four days\n\nearlier in the immediate presence of a car salesman – Correia\n\nsimply sped off onto busy downtown Boston streets, even driving the\n\nwrong way down a one-way street.            When heavy traffic blocked\n\nCorreia’s   escape,   just   as   another   police   officer   approached\n\nCorreia's stationary vehicle on foot, Correia attempted to back the\n\ncar over the officer.   Whereupon the officer’s partner fired shots\n\nas Correia sped away, at times driving directly onto sidewalks\n\noccupied by pedestrians.      Shortly thereafter, Correia drove the\n\nvehicle directly at and struck another police officer attempting to\n\nstop him at an intersection,4 then collided with several other\n\n\n     4\n      Correia further contends that the jury acquittals on seven of\nthe nine counts of assault and/or battery with a vehicle render the\ntrial judge’s post-verdict sentence vindictive. He maintains that\nsince the jury acquitted him of several charges that he assaulted\npolice officers, the trial court improperly considered that “[i[n\nthe conduct of his acts that day he viciously attacked any police\nofficers trying to stop him.”      Correia devotes one conclusory\nparagraph to this contention, and cites no supporting authority.\nSee United States v. Sanchez, 354 F.3d 70, 80 n.4 (1st Cir. 2004)\n(noting that appellate argument raised in perfunctory manner is\nwaived). Although Massachusetts law arguably limits the sentencing\ncourt's authority to consider “acquitted conduct” in imposing\nsentence, see Commonwealth v. Goodwin, 605 N.E.2d 827, 830 (Mass.\n1993); cf. United States v. Reyes-Echeverria, 345 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 2003) (noting that court may sentence for acquitted conduct if\ngovernment proves it by preponderance of evidence), Correia was\nconvicted on two counts of assault and/or battery with the vehicle,\nthree counts of leaving the scene after causing personal injury,\nand six counts of failure to stop for a police officer. Thus, it\nwas in no sense improper for the sentencing judge to point out that\nCorreia had “attacked” police officers. See Goodwin, 605 N.E.2d at\n831 (“In making th[e] [sentencing] assessment, the judge may\nconsider many factors which would not be relevant at trial\n\n                                   -10-\n\fparked cars while attempting to extract himself from this same\n\nencounter.\n\n          When yet another officer stopped him on Storrow Drive,\n\nand approached Correia’s car with revolver drawn, Correia suddenly\n\nreversed his vehicle into a Volvo, causing spinal injuries to its\n\ndriver.   Ignoring the police officer’s orders to stop, Correia\n\npromptly sped off over the center island separating Storrow Drive.\n\nIn so doing, he collided head-on with several vehicles in his path,\n\nand attempted to run over two other policemen patrolling on foot,\n\nwho were forced to respond by firing their revolvers at the vehicle\n\nwhich Correia was driving.    While returning to downtown Boston,\n\nCorreia attempted to evade two police cruisers which were in\n\npursuit, drove into three cruisers positioned to road-block his\n\nvehicle, then backed into a private vehicle, injuring its driver.\n\nThe police officers who converged upon the scene fired their\n\nweapons at the Correia vehicle, wounding him.       Undiscouraged,\n\nCorreia then proceeded to resist arrest.   The police officers were\n\nrequired to extract Correia forcibly from the vehicle in order to\n\neffect the arrest.\n\n             At trial, Correia tendered the defense that (i) he\n\ninitially fled not because he was driving a stolen vehicle, but\n\nbecause he was operating without a license, and (ii) he continued\n\n\n\nincluding hearsay information about the defendant's character,\nbehavior, and background.”).\n\n                               -11-\n\fhis flight in self defense, when the police mistook him for another\n\narmed fugitive and fired shots at him.               However, the record\n\nreflects that this \"other fugitive\" was black; whereas Correia is\n\nwhite.\n\n           In light of the demonstrated discrepancies between the\n\npretrial and post-verdict records, the Massachusetts Appeals Court\n\nconclusion – that the harsher sentence imposed by the trial judge\n\nwas based upon factors other than vindictiveness – did not remotely\n\nconstitute an unreasonable application of United States Supreme\n\nCourt precedent. “[I]f it is reasonably clear that the judge\n\nreshaped   the   impost   merely   as   a   means   of   bringing   original\n\nsentencing intentions to fruition after some new development had\n\nintervened, a need for employing the Pearce presumption never\n\narises.”   United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874 F.2d 9, 13 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).5\n\n\n     5\n      For these same reasons, Correia’s reliance upon decisions\nsuch as In re Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza\nHotel Fire, 56 F.3d 295 (1st Cir. 1995), is unavailing, given that\nsuch decisions involved situations in which the sentencing judges\noffered no rationale for imposing the harsher sentences. See id.\nat 311 (“Though we have great confidence in [the district judge],\nhis silence on this subject leaves the award open to a perception\nthat appellants have been penalized for successfully prosecuting\ntheir previous appeals.”) (emphasis added); United States v.\nMazzaferro, 865 F.2d 450, 458 (1st Cir. 1989) (“In the face of such\nsilence, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sentence was\nimposed in retaliation for [defendant’s] insistence to stand\ntrial.”) (emphasis added).    Also, Mazzaferro involved a direct\nappeal from the conviction, as distinguished from a collateral\nhabeas corpus petition. Finally, in a habeas corpus proceeding,\nfactually similar decisions of the lower federal courts may\n“inform” the habeas inquiry in some instances, but only Supreme\n\n                                   -12-\n\f          Furthermore, as Correia must concede, the sentencing\n\njudge made no comment whatsoever which might even remotely imply\n\nthat he intended to impose a harsher post-verdict sentence in the\n\nevent the defendant did not accept a plea bargain.            Cf., e.g.,\n\nUnited States v.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 8, 1995, petitioner asked a Boston-area car dealership salesman for permission to test-drive a 1989 Corvette. During the ensuing drive, Correia absconded with the vehicle. Four days later, a Boston police officer saw Correia as he was driving the Corvette in the Beacon Hill area. Unaware that the Corvette was stolen, the officer pulled it over after noting that it had neither a valid license plate nor a current inspection sticker. As the officer approached the Corvette on foot, Correia abruptly sped away from the scene, leading State and Boston police [hereinafter: \"police\"] on a prolonged high-speed car chase on downtown Boston streets and adjacent freeways. During the chase, Correia recklessly drove the wrong way down one-way streets, crashed into several other police and civilian vehicles, repeatedly refused police demands to surrender at gunpoint, attempted to run over several on-foot police officers, and finally managed to strike a police officer with the vehicle. This vehicular rampage caused severe bruises and lacerations to a police officer, as well as spinal injuries to a civilian automobile driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Correia was indicted in Suffolk County Superior Court on forty-eight counts: speeding (4 counts), driving to endanger (4), driving with a suspended license (1), assault and battery with a vehicle (6), assault with a vehicle (6), receiving stolen goods (2), leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicular damages (17), driving the wrong way on a one-way street (2), and failing to stop for a police officer (6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the jury trial, Correia informed the presiding superior court judge that he might agree to plead guilty. Whereupon the judge informed Correia that he probably would impose a 5-to-7 year prison sentence should Correia enter a guilty plea. However, shortly thereafter Correia elected to proceed to trial. Finally, disregarding the court's advice, Correia elected to represent himself at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following trial, the jury convicted Correia on twenty-one of the forty-eight counts: assault and battery with the Corvette (1 count); assault with the Corvette (1); receiving stolen goods (2); leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicle damage (11); and failing to stop for a police officer (6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The trial judge denied Correia's ensuing motions for a new trial, and sentenced him to imprisonment for 12 to 17 years, well within the sentencing range prescribed by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the convictions and sentences in an unpublished opinion, and the Supreme Judicial Court denied the ensuing application for further appellate review. In February 2002, Correia submitted the instant habeas corpus petition to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which denied the requested relief and issued its certificate of appealability. Correia now appeals from the district court order denying the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Correia contends that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably applied clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent in rejecting his claim that the trial court vindictively punished him for refusing to enter a guilty plea prior to trial by imposing a 12-to-17 year prison term, rather than the 5-to-7 year term which would have been imposed had Correia entered a guilty plea. As evidence of the alleged vindictiveness, Correia relies upon (i) the large numerical differential between the pretrial and post-trial sentencing ranges; (ii) the jury acquittals on many of the more serious charges in the indictment; and (iii) the comments made by the trial judge during trial, suggesting that the trial judge himself believed that Correia was guilty and that the trial was a waste of judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review denials of habeas corpus relief <i>de novo,</i> inquiring whether the state-court decision is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [Supreme Court precedent].\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254; <i>see Williams v.</i> <i>Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state-court decision contravenes the \"unreasonable application\" criterion when, though it correctly identifies the pertinent United States Supreme Court rule, its application to the particular facts of the case at bar is objectively unreasonable. <i>Id.</i> at 409-10, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the conviction notwithstanding Correia's \"vindictive sentencing\" claim, the Massachusetts Appeals Court relied upon three grounds:(1) the trial court cited objective, non-vindictive reasons for imposing a higher sentence following trial; (2) the trial court neither stated nor implied that Correia would receive a higher sentence if he did not plead guilty; and (3) at no time did the trial court evince a belief that the trial was a waste of judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event a criminal defendant successfully appeals his conviction and the same trial judge imposes a stiffer sentence following a retrial, the presumption arises that the harsher sentence was a product of judicial vindictiveness in response to the defendant's rightful recourse to the appellate process; yet this presumption is rebuttable provided the record contains objective evidence which adequately explains the more severe sentence. <i>See United States v. Goodwin,</i> 457 U.S. 368, 373-74, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982); <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969); <i>United States v. Mena-Robles,</i> 4 F.3d 1026, 1037 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same presumption may arise when a criminal defendant rejects a plea agreement &#8212; and with it the prospect of a more lenient sentence &#8212; and elects instead to exercise his constitutional right to a jury trial. <i>See, e.g., Johnson v. Vose,</i> 927 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir.1991). The two situations differ, of course, in that a higher sentence after a remand and retrial alters a judge's previously imposed punishment, whereas a higher sentence after a failed plea bargain is not a retreat from a previously imposed sentence, and as here, is likely to reflect additional evidence adduced at trial and the loss of a discount for pleading guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, as this presumption is designed to safeguard against the risk of actual vindictiveness &#8212; as distinguished from the mere fact that the sentencing court decided to impose a harsher sentence following a trial or retrial &#8212; the presumption \"arises only in circumstances `in which there is a \"<i>reasonable likelihood</i>\" that the increase in sentence is the product of <i>actual vindictiveness.</i>'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Alabama v. Smith,</i> 490 U.S. 794, 799, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989)) (citations omitted; emphasis added). Absent such a \"reasonable likelihood,\" the aforementioned presumption is never triggered, and the defendant must instead establish <i>actual</i> vindictiveness. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in the instant case simply cannot support a determination that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably applied the pertinent legal principles. <i>See Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495. First, the mere fact that the post-verdict sentence exceeded the \"plea bargain\" sentence by some seven to ten years is insufficient, in and of itself, to indicate a reasonable likelihood of actual vindictiveness. For one thing, unlike a verdict of guilty, an admission of guilt properly warrants the sentencing court's consideration of a more lenient sentence than might otherwise be imposed in appropriate response to the defendant's criminal conduct. <i>See Smith,</i> 490 U.S. at 802, 109 S.Ct. 2201. Thus, the five-to-seven year prison sentence proffered to Correia during the plea bargaining process does not reflect a true assessment of Correia's criminal culpability, in that it plainly included a substantial discount for leniency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the remaining aspect of the differential, normally the sentencing court imposes a post-verdict sentence after considering the evidence presented at trial. In contrast, a plea-bargained sentence normally is predicated upon a more rudimentary record of the alleged criminal conduct, such as the description in the indictment, and/or a presentence report. <i>See id.</i> at 801, 109 S.Ct. 2201. Indeed, the sentencing judge in this case adverted to this very consideration in sentencing Correia, explicitly observing that both the government's graphic trial presentation regarding the sheer recklessness of the Correia rampage, and Correia's apparent lack of remorse, <i>see id.</i> (\"[T]he defendant's conduct during trial may give the judge insights into [the defendant's] moral character and suitability for rehabilitation.\"), accounted in substantial part for the decision to impose the harsher sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compared with the sparse information available to the trial judge at the pretrial conference,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> consisting of little more than a recitation of the charges set forth in the indictment, <i>see supra</i> Section I, the trial record abundantly demonstrates not only the gravity of the alleged criminal conduct, but the increased risk of serious bodily harm to which Correia exposed not only the law enforcement officers involved, but any hapless civilian who happened to be in his way. <i>Cf. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. at 723, 89 S.Ct. 2072 (\"A trial judge is not constitutionally precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence, whether greater or less than the original sentence, in the light of events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant's `life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.'\") (citation omitted). For instance, when a police officer initially approached the vehicle Correia was driving &#8212; blatantly stolen some four days earlier in the immediate presence of a car salesman &#8212; Correia simply sped off onto busy downtown Boston streets, even driving the wrong way down a one-way street. When heavy traffic blocked Correia's escape, just as another police officer approached Correia's stationary vehicle on foot, Correia attempted to back the car over the officer. Whereupon the officer's partner fired shots as Correia sped away, at times driving directly onto sidewalks occupied by pedestrians. Shortly thereafter, Correia drove the vehicle directly at and struck another police officer attempting to stop him at an intersection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> then collided with several other parked cars while attempting to extract himself from this same encounter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When yet another officer stopped him on Storrow Drive, and approached Correia's car with revolver drawn, Correia suddenly reversed his vehicle into a Volvo, causing spinal injuries to its driver. Ignoring the police officer's orders to stop, Correia promptly sped off over the center island separating Storrow Drive. In so doing, he collided head-on with several vehicles in his path, and attempted to run over two other policemen patrolling on foot, who were forced to respond by firing their revolvers at the vehicle which Correia was driving. While returning to downtown Boston, Correia attempted to evade two police cruisers which were in pursuit, drove into three cruisers positioned to road-block his vehicle, then backed into a private vehicle, injuring its driver. The police officers who converged upon the scene fired their weapons at the Correia vehicle, wounding him. Undiscouraged, Correia then proceeded to resist arrest. The police officers were required to extract Correia forcibly from the vehicle in order to effect the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Correia tendered the defense that (i) he initially fled not because he was driving a stolen vehicle, but because he was operating without a license, and (ii) he continued his flight in self defense, when the police mistook him for another armed fugitive and fired shots at him. However, the record reflects that this \"other fugitive\" was black; whereas Correia is white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the demonstrated discrepancies between the pretrial and post-verdict records, the Massachusetts Appeals Court conclusion &#8212; that the harsher sentence imposed by the trial judge was based upon factors other than vindictiveness &#8212; did not remotely constitute an unreasonable application of United States Supreme Court precedent. \"[I]f it is reasonably clear that the judge reshaped the impost merely as a means of bringing original sentencing intentions to fruition after some new development had intervened, a need for employing the <i>Pearce</i> presumption never arises.\" <i>United States v. Pimienta-Redondo,</i> 874 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir.1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, as Correia must concede, the sentencing judge made no comment whatsoever which might even remotely imply that he intended to impose a harsher post-verdict sentence in the event the defendant did not accept a plea bargain. <i>Cf., e.g., United States v. Crocker,</i> 788 F.2d 802, 808 (1st Cir.1986) (finding that presumption arose because sentencing court stated: \"I think imposing upon the time and resources of the Court to try a case which should not be tried is an imposition which deserves consideration when it comes time for me to sentence and I will do so.\"); <i>Longval v. Meachum,</i> 693 F.2d 236, 237 (1st Cir.1982) (same, where judge stated: \"I strongly suggest that you ask your client to consider a plea, because, if the jury returns a verdict of guilty, I might be disposed to impose a substantial sentence.\"). As the instant record contains no explicit or implicit threat of any such impermissible linkage, no presumption of vindictiveness was triggered, <i>see Johnson,</i> 927 F.2d at 12 (noting that such linkage is \"crucial in establishing a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness\"); <i>see also Mena-Robles,</i> 4 F.3d at 1037, and the burden to prove actual vindictiveness resided with Correia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to demonstrate objective evidence of vindictiveness, Correia contends that the trial judge made comments during trial which suggested pique at Correia's decision to demand a jury trial. Quite the contrary, none of the comments even remotely suggested that the court intended to punish Correia for rejecting the plea agreement proffered prior to trial. In excluding Correia's \"necessity\" defense during the course of a motion hearing, the trial judge stated: \"You were a one-man wrecking crew, and somehow this was justified in some way?\" Rather than utilizing this statement to convey his view of Correia's guilt, the trial judge plainly and correctly chose to express the opinion that the far-fetched claim advanced by Correia &#8212; that he simply eluded police in self defense &#8212; was undeserving of credence by any rational factfinder. <i>See United States v.

Rather than suggesting that the trial judge dissuaded Correia from exercising his right to a jury trial, this observation plainly suggests that the trial judge had encouraged Correia to go to trial <i>with representation by counsel.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Massachusetts Appeals Court reasonably could &#8212; and did &#8212; conclude that the sentence imposed upon Correia comported with the principles set forth in <i>Smith, see</i> 529 U.S. at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, the habeas corpus petition was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The trial court allowed the government's pretrial motion to dismiss 20 of the 48 counts, and the jury eventually acquitted Correia on 5 of the 6 counts charging assault and battery with a vehicle, and 2 of the 6 counts charging assault with a vehicle</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> At the sentencing hearing, the judge stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">For the record, I wish to make a statement because the sentence imposed here is substantially greater than the sentence discussed at the outset of this trial when there was the prospect of a guilty plea. Since that time, I've come to know the details of the crimes involved here and the character of the defendant a lot better than I knew when I would have been content with a much lower sentence. In my wildest imagination I could find it difficult to find a worse possible scenario for the aftermath or the consequences of a stolen motor vehicle. As I reviewed my notes, I counted over twenty vehicles that were damaged, smashed into some way by the operation of that vehicle that morning. It has got to be miraculous that no one was killed as a result of this. There was, however, one man seriously injured and he is still suffering the consequences of the conduct of the defendant that day. The conduct of the defendant on the date in question evidenced an absolutely total disregard for the lives of anyone and the property of everyone. In the conduct of his acts that day he viciously attacked any police officers trying to stop him. He was obviously going to stop at nothing, or for nothing, I should say, and ultimately forced the police to use gunfire to stop him on the corner of Washington and Marginal. During the conduct of the trial, he has demonstrated absolutely no remorse for what has gone on that day. On the contrary, he has converted himself from a perpetrator of serious crimes to a victim of police brutality because of the fact that he forced them to use gunfire to stop him on that occasion.

Although the quoted observation plainly reflects a measure of hyperbole, it was neither made in the presence of the jury nor purported to be a premature assessment of Correia's level of culpability, as distinguished from a recounting of the known and undisputed consequences of Correia's conduct as set forth in the indictment. <i>See, e.g., Taylor v. Kincheloe,</i> 920 F.2d 599, 608 (9th Cir.1990) (finding trial judge's description of charged offenses, as \"execution style slayings,\" not evidence of vindictiveness, \"since it is obvious that a judge may consider the circumstances of the offense in making a sentencing decision, [and] [<i>Alabama v. Smith,</i> 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989)] is founded on the notion that this is exactly what we expect judges to do.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Correia further contends that the jury acquittals on seven of the nine counts of assault and/or battery with a vehicle render the trial judge's post-verdict sentence vindictive. He maintains that since the jury acquitted him of several charges that he assaulted police officers, the trial court improperly considered that \"[i]n the conduct of his acts that day he viciously attacked any police officers trying to stop him.\" Correia devotes one conclusory paragraph to this contention, and cites no supporting authority<i>See United States v. Sanchez,</i> 354 F.3d 70, 80 n. 4 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that appellate argument raised in perfunctory manner is waived). Although Massachusetts law arguably limits the sentencing court's authority to consider \"acquitted conduct\" in imposing sentence, <i>see Commonwealth v. Goodwin,</i> 414 Mass. 88, 605 N.E.2d 827, 830 (1993); <i>cf. United States v. Reyes-Echevarria,</i> 345 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that court may sentence for acquitted conduct if government proves it by preponderance of evidence), Correia was convicted on two counts of assault and/or battery with the vehicle, three counts of leaving the scene after causing personal injury, and six counts of failure to stop for a police officer. Thus, it was in no sense improper for the sentencing judge to point out that Correia had \"attacked\" police officers. <i>See Goodwin,</i> 605 N.E.2d at 831 (\"In making th[e] [sentencing] assessment, the judge may consider many factors which would not be relevant at trial including hearsay information about the defendant's character, behavior, and background.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For these same reasons, Correia's reliance upon decisions such as<i>In re Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire,</i> 56 F.3d 295 (1st Cir.1995), is unavailing, given that such decisions involved situations in which the sentencing judges offered <i>no</i> rationale for imposing the harsher sentences. <i>See id.</i> at 311 (\"Though we have great confidence in [the district judge], his <i>silence</i> on this subject leaves the award open to a perception that appellants have been penalized for successfully prosecuting their previous appeals.\") (emphasis added); <i>United States v.

Also, <i>Mazzaferro</i> involved a direct appeal from the conviction, as distinguished from a collateral habeas corpus petition. Finally, in a habeas corpus proceeding, factually similar decisions of the lower federal courts may \"inform\" the habeas inquiry in some instances, but only Supreme Court cases can serve as definitive benchmarks. <i>See Rashad v.

During the ensuing drive, Correia absconded with the vehicle. Four days later, a Boston police officer saw Correia as he was driving the Corvette in the Beacon Hill area. Unaware that the Corvette was stolen, the officer pulled it over after noting that it had neither a valid license plate nor a current inspection sticker. As the officer approached the Corvette on foot, Correia abruptly sped away from the scene, leading State and Boston police [hereinafter: \"police\"] on a prolonged high-speed car chase on downtown Boston streets and adjacent freeways. During the chase, Correia recklessly drove the wrong way down one-way streets, crashed into several other police and civilian vehicles, repeatedly refused police demands to surrender at gunpoint, attempted to run over several on-foot police officers, and finally managed to strike a police officer with the vehicle. This vehicular rampage caused severe bruises and lacerations to a police officer, as well as spinal injuries to a civilian automobile driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Correia was indicted in Suffolk County Superior Court on forty-eight counts: speeding (4 counts), driving to endanger (4), driving with a suspended license (1), assault and battery with a vehicle (6), assault with a vehicle (6), receiving stolen goods (2), leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicular damages (17), driving the wrong way on a one-way street (2), and failing to stop for a police officer (6).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the jury trial, Correia informed the presiding superior court judge that he might agree to plead guilty. Whereupon the judge informed Correia that he probably would impose a 5-to-7 year prison sentence should Correia enter a guilty plea. However, shortly thereafter Correia elected to proceed to trial. Finally, disregarding the court's advice, Correia elected to represent himself at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following trial, the jury convicted Correia on twenty-one of the forty-eight counts: assault and battery with the Corvette (1 count); assault with the Corvette (1); receiving stolen goods (2); leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicle damage (11); and failing to stop for a police officer (6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The trial judge denied Correia's ensuing motions for a new trial, and sentenced him to imprisonment for 12 to 17 years, well within the sentencing range prescribed by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the convictions and sentences in an unpublished opinion, and the Supreme Judicial Court denied the ensuing application for further appellate review. In February 2002, Correia submitted the instant habeas corpus petition to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which denied the requested relief and issued its certificate of appealability. Correia now appeals from the district court order denying the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Correia contends that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably applied clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent in rejecting his claim that the trial court vindictively punished him for refusing to enter a guilty plea prior to trial by imposing a 12-to-17 year prison term, rather than the 5-to-7 year term which would have been imposed had Correia entered a guilty plea. As evidence of the alleged vindictiveness, Correia relies upon (i) the large numerical differential between the pretrial and post-trial sentencing ranges; (ii) the jury acquittals on many of the more serious charges in the indictment; and (iii) the comments made by the trial judge during trial, suggesting that the trial judge himself believed that Correia was guilty and that the trial was a waste of judicial resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review denials of habeas corpus relief <i>de novo,</i> inquiring whether the state-court decision is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [Supreme Court precedent].\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254; <i>see Williams v.</i> <i>Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 404-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The two situations differ, of course, in that a higher sentence after a remand and retrial alters a judge's previously imposed punishment, whereas a higher sentence after a failed plea bargain is not a retreat from a previously imposed sentence, and as here, is likely to reflect additional evidence adduced at trial and the loss of a discount for pleading guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, as this presumption is designed to safeguard against the risk of actual vindictiveness &#8212; as distinguished from the mere fact that the sentencing court decided to impose a harsher sentence following a trial or retrial &#8212; the presumption \"arises only in circumstances `in which there is a \"<i>reasonable likelihood</i>\" that the increase in sentence is the product of <i>actual vindictiveness.</i>'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Alabama v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112276\"><a href=\"/opinion/112276/alabama-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span>, 799, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112276\"><a href=\"/opinion/112276/alabama-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Absent such a \"reasonable likelihood,\" the aforementioned presumption is never triggered, and the defendant must instead establish <i>actual</i> vindictiveness. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in the instant case simply cannot support a determination that the Massachusetts Appeals Court unreasonably applied the pertinent legal principles. <i>See Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>. First, the mere fact that the post-verdict sentence exceeded the \"plea bargain\" sentence by some seven to ten years is insufficient, in and of itself, to indicate a reasonable likelihood of actual vindictiveness. For one thing, unlike a verdict of guilty, an admission of guilt properly warrants the sentencing court's consideration of a more lenient sentence than might otherwise be imposed in appropriate response to the defendant's criminal conduct. <i>See Smith,</i> 490 U.S. at 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112276\"><a href=\"/opinion/112276/alabama-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2201</span></a></span>. Thus, the five-to-seven year prison sentence proffered to Correia during the plea bargaining process does not reflect a true assessment of Correia's criminal culpability, in that it plainly included a substantial discount for leniency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the remaining aspect of the differential, normally the sentencing court imposes a post-verdict sentence after considering the evidence presented at trial. In contrast, a plea-bargained sentence normally is predicated upon a more rudimentary record of the alleged criminal conduct, such as the description in the indictment, and/or a presentence report. <i>See id.</i> at 801, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112276\"><a href=\"/opinion/112276/alabama-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2201</span></a></span>. Indeed, the sentencing judge in this case adverted to this very consideration in sentencing Correia, explicitly observing that both the government's graphic trial presentation regarding the sheer recklessness of the Correia rampage, and Correia's apparent lack of remorse, <i>see id.</i> (\"[T]he defendant's conduct during trial may give the judge insights into [the defendant's] moral character and suitability for rehabilitation.\"), accounted in substantial part for the decision to impose the harsher sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compared with the sparse information available to the trial judge at the pretrial conference,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> consisting of little more than a recitation of the charges set forth in the indictment, <i>see supra</i> Section I, the trial record abundantly demonstrates not only the gravity of the alleged criminal conduct, but the increased risk of serious bodily harm to which Correia exposed not only the law enforcement officers involved, but any hapless civilian who happened to be in his way. <i>Cf. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. at 723, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For instance, when a police officer initially approached the vehicle Correia was driving &#8212; blatantly stolen some four days earlier in the immediate presence of a car salesman &#8212; Correia simply sped off onto busy downtown Boston streets, even driving the wrong way down a one-way street. When heavy traffic blocked Correia's escape, just as another police officer approached Correia's stationary vehicle on foot, Correia attempted to back the car over the officer. Whereupon the officer's partner fired shots as Correia sped away, at times driving directly onto sidewalks occupied by pedestrians. Shortly thereafter, Correia drove the vehicle directly at and struck another police officer attempting to stop him at an intersection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> then collided with several other parked cars while attempting to extract himself from this same encounter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When yet another officer stopped him on Storrow Drive, and approached Correia's car with revolver drawn, Correia suddenly reversed his vehicle into a Volvo, causing spinal injuries to its driver. Ignoring the police officer's orders to stop, Correia promptly sped off over the center island separating Storrow Drive. In so doing, he collided head-on with several vehicles in his path, and attempted to run over two other policemen patrolling on foot, who were forced to respond by firing their revolvers at the vehicle which Correia was driving. While returning to downtown Boston, Correia attempted to evade two police cruisers which were in pursuit, drove into three cruisers positioned to road-block his vehicle, then backed into a private vehicle, injuring its driver. The police officers who converged upon the scene fired their weapons at the Correia vehicle, wounding him. Undiscouraged, Correia then proceeded to resist arrest. The police officers were required to extract Correia forcibly from the vehicle in order to effect the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Correia tendered the defense that (i) he initially fled not because he was driving a stolen vehicle, but because he was operating without a license, and (ii) he continued his flight in self defense, when the police mistook him for another armed fugitive and fired shots at him.

As the instant record contains no explicit or implicit threat of any such impermissible linkage, no presumption of vindictiveness was triggered, <i>see Johnson,</i> 927 F.2d at 12 (noting that such linkage is \"crucial in establishing a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness\"); <i>see also Mena-Robles,</i> 4 F.3d at 1037, and the burden to prove actual vindictiveness resided with Correia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to demonstrate objective evidence of vindictiveness, Correia contends that the trial judge made comments during trial which suggested pique at Correia's decision to demand a jury trial. Quite the contrary, none of the comments even remotely suggested that the court intended to punish Correia for rejecting the plea agreement proffered prior to trial. In excluding Correia's \"necessity\" defense during the course of a motion hearing, the trial judge stated: \"You were a one-man wrecking crew, and somehow this was justified in some way?\" Rather than utilizing this statement to convey his view of Correia's guilt, the trial judge plainly and correctly chose to express the opinion that the far-fetched claim advanced by Correia &#8212; that he simply eluded police in self defense &#8212; was undeserving of credence by any rational factfinder. <i>See United States v.

Since that time, I've come to know the details of the crimes involved here and the character of the defendant a lot better than I knew when I would have been content with a much lower sentence. In my wildest imagination I could find it difficult to find a worse possible scenario for the aftermath or the consequences of a stolen motor vehicle. As I reviewed my notes, I counted over twenty vehicles that were damaged, smashed into some way by the operation of that vehicle that morning. It has got to be miraculous that no one was killed as a result of this. There was, however, one man seriously injured and he is still suffering the consequences of the conduct of the defendant that day. The conduct of the defendant on the date in question evidenced an absolutely total disregard for the lives of anyone and the property of everyone. In the conduct of his acts that day he viciously attacked any police officers trying to stop him. He was obviously going to stop at nothing, or for nothing, I should say, and ultimately forced the police to use gunfire to stop him on the corner of Washington and Marginal. During the conduct of the trial, he has demonstrated absolutely no remorse for what has gone on that day. On the contrary, he has converted himself from a perpetrator of serious crimes to a victim of police brutality because of the fact that he forced them to use gunfire to stop him on that occasion. I see no prospect of rehabilitation for this defendant and consequently have sentenced him as I have.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Correia points solely to the trial judge's pretrial observation that Correia \"practically wiped out half of the Boston Police Department and the state troopers,<i>according to the charges.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) Although the quoted observation plainly reflects a measure of hyperbole, it was neither made in the presence of the jury nor purported to be a premature assessment of Correia's level of culpability, as distinguished from a recounting of the known and undisputed consequences of Correia's conduct as set forth in the indictment. <i>See, e.g., Taylor v.

He maintains that since the jury acquitted him of several charges that he assaulted police officers, the trial court improperly considered that \"[i]n the conduct of his acts that day he viciously attacked any police officers trying to stop him.\" Correia devotes one conclusory paragraph to this contention, and cites no supporting authority<i>See United States v.

Thus, it was in no sense improper for the sentencing judge to point out that Correia had \"attacked\" police officers. <i>See Goodwin,</i> 605 N.E.2d at 831 (\"In making th[e] [sentencing] assessment, the judge may consider many factors which would not be relevant at trial including hearsay information about the defendant's character, behavior, and background.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For these same reasons, Correia's reliance upon decisions such as<i>In re Thirteen Appeals Arising Out of San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697253\"><a href=\"/opinion/697253/in-re-thirteen-appeals-arising-out-of-the-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), is unavailing, given that such decisions involved situations in which the sentencing judges offered <i>no</i> rationale for imposing the harsher sentences. <i>See id.</i> at 311 (\"Though we have great confidence in [the district judge], his <i>silence</i> on this subject leaves the award open to a perception that appellants have been penalized for successfully prosecuting their previous appeals.\") (emphasis added); <i>United States v.

Also, <i>Mazzaferro</i> involved a direct appeal from the conviction, as distinguished from a collateral habeas corpus petition.
