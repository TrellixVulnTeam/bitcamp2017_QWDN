This case arises from an\n\nunfair labor practice charge brought by three unions against an\n\nemployer for unilaterally merging an employee pension plan with\n\nthat of its parent company.          The National Labor Relations Board\n\n(the \"Board\") dismissed the complaint, finding that the employer\n\nhad a sound arguable basis for interpreting the employees' contract\n\nas granting it the authority to merge the pension plan without the\n\nunions' consent.          After careful consideration, we affirm the\n\nBoard's order.\n\n                                         I.\n\nA. The Parties\n\n           Bath    Iron     Works   Corporation      (\"the     Company\")   builds\n\nsurface warships for the United States Navy.                  Three unions have\n\nlong represented the Company's employees covered under the relevant\n\npension   plan:    Local    Lodge   S-6        (\"S-6\")   of   the   International\n\nAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"IAM\"), Local\n\nLodge S-7 (\"S-7\") of the IAM, and the Bath Marine Draftsmen's\n\nAssociation (\"BMDA,\" collectively \"the Unions\").\n\nB. The Pension Plan\n\n           The Company established the Bath Iron Workers Pension\n\nPlan for Hourly Employees (the \"Plan\") in 1963.                      The Plan is\n\ngoverned by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n\n(\"ERISA\").        Article    XII    of    the     Plan   addresses    amendment,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ftermination, and merger.1 Article 12.1 provides that \"[s]ubject to\n\nthe applicable provisions of any collective bargaining agreement,\n\nthe Company shall have the right to amend, modify, or suspend the\n\nPlan.\"   Under Article 12.2, the Company \"reserves the right to\n\nterminate the Plan.\"      Article 12.5 governs the transfer of Plan\n\nassets in the case of merger or consolidation, but does not mention\n\nwho has the authority to merge the Plan.2\n\n           New benefits stopped accruing under the Plan for S-6 and\n\nS-7 members on August 31, 1994, when those employees switched to an\n\nIAM multiemployer pension plan.          Nonetheless, S-6 and S-7 Plan\n\nparticipants are still eligible for certain benefits under the Plan\n\nbased on their prior participation.\n\nC. The Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n           During the relevant time period, March 1998 to March\n\n2001, each union had a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") with\n\nthe   Company.   The   CBAs   between   the   Company   and   S-6   and   S-7\n\n\n1\n   The Company unilaterally amended Articles 12.1 and 12.2 on\nSeptember 13, 1995. The Board noted in its decision below that it\ndid not need to choose between the original and new versions\nbecause both allow the Company to modify the Plan. Bath Iron Works\nCorp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 2 n.2 (Aug. 27, 2005). We will cite\nto the original Plan, as did the parties in their briefs.\n2\n    Article 12.5 provides: \"In the case of any merger or\nconsolidation of the Plan with . . . any other plan of deferred\ncompensation . . ., the assets of the Plan applicable to such\nParticipants shall be transferred to the other plan only if each\nParticipant in the Plan would . . . receive a benefit immediately\nafter the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or\ngreater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive\nimmediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer . . . .\"\n\n                                   -4-\n\frespectively both briefly refer to the Plan.                 Both CBAs also\n\nprovide that the language therein represents only highlights of the\n\nCompany's benefits program, as the terms and conditions of specific\n\nbenefits are governed by separate plan documents.3                  BMDA's CBA\n\ndiscusses the Plan at greater length, providing that the Plan\n\n\"shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the\n\nprovisions thereof.\"\n\nD. The Plan Merger\n\n           General Dynamics Corporation acquired the Company in\n\n1995.     During   its    1998     negotiations    with   BMDA,    the    Company\n\nannounced that it was considering a merger of the Plan, which was\n\nunderfunded,   into      the     General   Dynamics   Pension     Plan.     BMDA\n\nrequested bargaining over the merger of the pension plans, but the\n\nCompany took the position that the merger was too speculative to\n\nwarrant   negotiations.            Shortly    after    concluding        contract\n\nnegotiations   with      BMDA,    the   Company   received   permission     from\n\nGeneral Dynamics and the government to merge the plans.                      The\n\nCompany then discussed the merger with the Unions, but did not gain\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The S-6 CBA states: \"Your Benefits Program consists of Plans\nthat provide you financial security . . . . These Plans are ERISA\nPlans and their terms and conditions are governed by Plan Documents\n. . . .\"    The S-7 CBA states: \"The language contained in this\nAgreement is intended to represent only highlights of the BIW\nEmployee Benefits Program.    All of the terms and conditions in\ntheir entirety are governed by Plan Documents and summarized in a\nSummary Plan Description.\"\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftheir consent.     Finally, in October 1998, the Company unilaterally\n\nmerged the Plan into the General Dynamics Pension Plan.\n\nE. Prior Proceedings\n\n            On October 7, 1998, S-6 and S-7 filed unfair labor\n\npractice charges against the Company based on its merger of the\n\nPlan, and BMDA followed with its charge on November 27, 1998.                       A\n\nconsolidated complaint was issued on July 29, 1999.\n\n            The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") found that the\n\nmerger of the Plan violated Sections 8(a)(1) and (5) and 8(d) of\n\nthe     National   Labor        Relations       Act    (\"NLRA\")     by    materially,\n\nsubstantially, and significantly modifying the terms and conditions\n\nof    employment     of   the    represented          employees.     The    ALJ   also\n\ndetermined    that    the   Unions     had      not     clearly    and   unmistakably\n\nrelinquished their right to bargain over the merger.\n\n            The Board reversed the ALJ and dismissed the complaint on\n\nthe ground that the ALJ had applied the incorrect standard in the\n\ncase.    Bath Iron Works Corp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33 (Aug. 27, 2005).\n\nWhile    acknowledging      that    the     \"clear      and   unmistakable   waiver\"\n\nstandard applies in an 8(a)(5) unilateral change case, the Board\n\nconcluded that \"the General Counsel's sole allegation is the\n\nallegation of unlawful modification of the contracts within the\n\nmeaning of Section 8(d).\" Id. at 3.               In such contract modification\n\ncases, the Board stated, \"the issue is whether the [Company] had a\n\nsound arguable basis for its actions.\"                  Id. at 5.    The Board went\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fon to determine that the Company did have a sound arguable basis\n\nfor its interpretation that the CBA and the Plan documents allowed\n\nthe merger.     Id.     The Board declined to rule on whether the\n\nCompany's interpretation of the contracts was correct, leaving such\n\ndeterminations to arbitrators and the courts.             Id.\n\n            BMDA petitioned for review of the Board's decision on or\n\nabout October 24, 2005, and S-6 and S-7 followed on December 1.\n\nThe Company moved to intervene on December 21.                   The cases were\n\nconsolidated into this appeal on December 23.\n\n            The Unions appeal the Board's dismissal on two grounds:\n\nFirst, the Unions argue that the Board incorrectly applied the\n\n\"sound   arguable     basis\"   standard       rather   than     the   \"clear   and\n\nunmistakable waiver\" standard.          Second, they contend that even if\n\nthe Board applied the correct standard, it erred in finding that\n\nthe CBAs arguably granted the Company the authority to unilaterally\n\nmerge the Plan.     We address each of the Unions' arguments in turn.4\n\n                                        II.\n\nA. Statutory Provisions\n\n            Sections 8(a)(5) and 8(d) define an employer's obligation\n\nto   bargain   collectively      with    its     employees'     representatives\n\nregarding   \"wages,     hours,   and     other    terms   and    conditions    of\n\nemployment.\"    29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5), (d).            An employer generally\n\n\n\n4\n   We acknowledge the able assistance provided by the briefs,\nincluding those filed by the intervenor and amicus curiae.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fmay not institute changes with respect to these mandatory subjects\n\nof collective bargaining until the parties reach a good faith\n\nimpasse in bargaining. Litton Fin. Printing Div. v. NLRB, 501 U.S.\n\n190, 198 (1991) (citing NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S. 736 (1962)).             A\n\nunion may, however, agree to waive its statutory rights and allow\n\nthe employer to make changes with respect to a mandatory subject\n\nwithout further bargaining.       See Metro. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 460\n\nU.S. 693, 705 (1983) (\"This Court long has recognized that a union\n\nmay waive a member's statutorily protected rights . . . .\"); NLRB\n\nv. C & C Plywood, 385 U.S. 421, 564 (1967) (discussing the Board's\n\npower to determine whether a union agreed to give up statutory\n\nsafeguards).\n\n            In order to stabilize collective bargaining agreements,\n\nthe 1947 revision of the NLRA, the Labor Management Relations Act\n\n(LMRA), enacted both the \"provisions in §§ 8(d) and 301(a) to\n\nprohibit unilateral mid-term modifications and terminations of CBAs\n\nand   to   confer   federal   jurisdiction   over   suits   for   contract\n\nviolations.\"    Allied Chem. & Alkali Workers v. Pittsburgh Plate\n\nGlass Co., 404 U.S. 157, 186 (1971).\n\n            Section 8(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\n            [W]here    there     is    in     effect    a\n            collective-bargaining    contract    covering\n            employees in an industry affecting commerce,\n            the duty to bargain collectively shall also\n            mean that no party to such contract shall\n            terminate or modify such contract, unless\n            [certain requirements are met].\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f              . . . [These requirements] shall not be\n              construed as requiring either party to discuss\n              or agree to any modification of the terms and\n              conditions contained in a contract for a fixed\n              period, if such modification is to become\n              effective before such terms and conditions can\n              be reopened under the provisions of the\n              contract.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 158(d).      In enacting § 8(d), \"Congress intended . . . ,\n\nat least in part, to overturn earlier [rulings] that even issues\n\nsquarely covered in a written labor contract were subject to\n\ncontinuing renegotiation during the life of the contract.\"               Gorman\n\n& Finkin, Basic Text on Labor Law 625 (2d ed. 2004).                From the\n\nstart, Board members have approached the interpretation of the\n\nsection with different philosophies. See id. at 624-27 (describing\n\ndivisions among Board members evidenced in Jacobs Mfg. Co., 94\n\nN.L.R.B. 1214      (1951), enforced, 196 F.2d 680 (2d Cir. 1952)).\n\n              The role played by the Board in § 8(d) cases is limited.\n\nThe section applies only to mandatory, not permissive, subjects of\n\nbargaining.     Allied Chem., 404 U.S. at 184.      It is meant to prevent\n\none party from engaging in economic warfare during the term of the\n\ncontract by disrupting the economic relationship. Id. at 187. The\n\nBoard's role is to prevent such economic warfare by prohibiting as\n\nunfair labor practices clear mid-term modifications of a contract\n\nthat disrupt the economic relationship.           In such situations, the\n\nBoard   may    award   remedies   including   a   cease   and   desist   order\n\n(effectively, an order to adhere to the contract); an order for an\n\nemployer to compensate employees for unlawfully reduced wages,\n\n                                     -9-\n\fbenefits,      or   bonuses;      or   an   order    stripping     employees     who\n\nunlawfully      strike      of    their     status    as     employees,      thereby\n\n\"subject[ing]       them    to    immediate      discharge   and   jeopardiz[ing]\n\nforthwith the union's status as bargaining representative.\" Gorman\n\n& Finkin, supra, at 570.\n\n              It is clear that § 8(d) is not meant to confer on the\n\nBoard broad powers to interpret CBAs.               In enacting § 301, Congress\n\ndetermined \"that the Board should not have general jurisdiction\n\nover all alleged violations of collective bargaining agreements and\n\nthat such matters should be placed within the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourts.\"    C & C Plywood, 385 U.S. at 427 (footnote omitted).                  To do\n\notherwise \"would have been a step toward governmental regulation of\n\nthe   terms    of   those    agreements,\"         rather   than    addressing    the\n\nmechanisms by which such agreements could be reached.                  Id.    Thus,\n\n§ 8(d) is commonly understood as being constrained by § 301.\n\n              In turn, § 301(a) gives the courts, not the Board,\n\njurisdiction over certain disputes, providing:\n\n                      Suits  for  violation   of  contracts\n              between an employer and a labor organization\n              representing   employees   in   an   industry\n              affecting commerce as defined in this Act, or\n              between any such labor organizations, may be\n              brought in any district court of the United\n              States having jurisdiction of the parties\n              . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 185(a).              The section was intended to ensure that\n\nvariations in state law of contract and procedure did not frustrate\n\njudicial enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.                    Gorman\n\n                                          -10-\n\f& Finkin, supra, at 736.   To that end, § 301(a) conferred federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction over suits for breach of collective bargaining\n\nagreements.   In the event of such a breach, federal courts may\n\naward damages, and in some cases they may award equitable relief\n\n(essentially an order to comply with the contract).          See Boys\n\nMkts., Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, 398 U.S. 235, 248, 253-55\n\n(1970) (noting the availability of an action for damages, holding\n\nthat injunctive relief is appropriate in some § 301 cases despite\n\nthe anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and\n\ndirecting that such relief be awarded).\n\n           Under C & C Plywood, the Board does have some authority\n\nto construe collective bargaining agreements when raised by the\n\nemployer as a defense to an unfair labor practice charge.    385 U.S.\n\nat 428.   But in Litton, the Supreme Court stressed that\n\n           [a]lthough the Board has occasion to interpret\n           collective-bargaining    agreements    in   the\n           context of unfair labor practice adjudication,\n           the Board is neither the sole nor the primary\n           source   of   authority   in   such    matters.\n           \"Arbitrators   and   courts   are   still   the\n           principal sources of contract interpretation.\"\n           Section 301 of the [LMRA] \"authorizes federal\n           courts to fashion a body of federal law for\n           the enforcement of . . . collective bargaining\n           agreements.\"\n\n501 U.S. at 202 (omission in original) (citations omitted) (quoting\n\nNLRB v. Strong, 393 U.S. 357, 360-361 (1969); Textile Workers v.\n\nLincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U.S. 448, 451 (1957) (emphasis added)).\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fB. Standards of Review\n\n          The duty to bargain thus encompasses both those cases in\n\nwhich the employer unilaterally seeks to change the terms and\n\nconditions of employment without bargaining and those cases in\n\nwhich the employer unilaterally seeks to modify the terms and\n\nconditions of a contract already in place.     The Board generally\n\nrefers to a unilateral change case as a § 8(a)(5) violation and a\n\ncontract modification case as a § 8(d) violation, notwithstanding\n\nthat the latter is technically also a § 8(a)(5) violation. Compare\n\nNLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S. 736, 736 (1962) (unilateral change), with\n\nNLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U.S. 513, 532-33 (1984) (contract\n\nmodification).\n\n          In § 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases, the Board generally\n\napplies the \"clear and unmistakable waiver\" standard, under which\n\nthe Board determines whether the union has clearly and unmistakably\n\nrelinquished its statutory rights to bargain over the mandatory\n\nsubject at issue.   See, e.g., Trojan Yacht, 319 N.L.R.B. 741, 742\n\n(1995).\n\n          In contrast, the Board applies the \"sound arguable basis\"\n\nstandard in § 8(d) contract modification cases. The Board will not\n\nfind an unfair labor practice if (1) the employer's interpretation\n\nof its contractual rights has a sound arguable basis in the\n\ncontract and (2) the employer was not motivated by union animus,\n\nacting in bad faith, or in any way seeking to undermine the union's\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fstatus as a collective bargaining representative.5                See, e.g.,\n\nWestinghouse Elec.

NLRB, 46 F.3d 1126 (4th\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n           The Board articulated the reasons for the sound arguable\n\nbasis standard in Vickers, Inc., stating:\n\n           The Board is not the proper forum for parties\n           seeking    an    interpretation    of    their\n           collective-bargaining agreement.    Where, as\n           here, an employer has a sound arguable basis\n           for ascribing a particular meaning to his\n           contract and his action is in accordance with\n           the terms of the contract as he construes it,\n           and there is \"no showing that the employer in\n           interpreting the contract as he did, was\n           motivated by union animus or was acting in bad\n           faith,\" the Board ordinarily will not exercise\n           its jurisdiction to resolve a dispute between\n           the parties as to whether the employer's\n           interpretation was correct.\n\n153 N.L.R.B. 561, 570 (1965) (footnotes omitted).\n\n           The standard applicable in a given case is often very\n\nclear, depending, as described above, upon whether the union\n\nalleges a unilateral change without bargaining to impasse or a\n\nmodification in violation of an existing contract without union\n\nconsent.   However, the choice of analytical framework is not as\n\nstraightforward when the union alleges a § 8(a)(5) unilateral\n\nchange   and   the   employer   defends   with   a   claim   of   contractual\n\n\n5\n    In addition, the Board will not find a § 8(d) contract\nmodification violation unless it first \"identif[ies] a specific\nterm 'contained in' the contract that the [employer's action]\nmodified.\" Milwaukee Spring Div., 268 N.L.R.B. at 602.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fprivilege to act unilaterally.

Enloe    Med.      Ctr.,    433     F.3d    at    835.         While\n\nacknowledging the Board's prerogative to apply the clear and\n\nunmistakable waiver standard in these cases, the D.C. Circuit\n\nasserts that it owes no deference to the Board's choice of standard\n\nwhen the unfair labor practice turns solely on the interpretation\n\nof a labor contract.          Id. at 837-38 (\"[T]he normal deference we\n\nmust afford the Board's policy choices does not apply in this\n\ncontext because the federal judiciary does not defer to the Board's\n\ninterpretation of a [CBA].\").            Rather, if the contract covers the\n\nsubject matter of the dispute, the D.C. Circuit will construe the\n\ncontract de novo to resolve the unfair labor practice charge,\n\nconsistent with its authority under § 301(a).                    U.S. Postal Serv.,\n\n8 F.3d at 837 (\"Because the courts are charged with developing a\n\nuniform federal law of labor contracts under section 301 . . ., we\n\naccord   no    deference      to   the    Board's       interpretation         of    labor\n\ncontracts.\"); accord BP Amoco Corp., 217 F.3d at 873.\n\n              The D.C. Circuit explains its \"contractual coverage\"\n\napproach in NLRB v. United States Postal Service:\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f            When employer and union bargain about a\n            subject and memorialize that bargain in a\n            [CBA], they create a set of rules governing\n            their future relations.   Unless the parties\n            agree otherwise, there is no continuous duty\n            to bargain during the term of an agreement\n            with respect to a matter covered by the\n            contract.\n\n8 F.3d 832, 836 (D.C. Cir. 1993).       Thus, once a subject is \"covered\n\nby\" a CBA, any dispute regarding that subject is an issue of\n\ncontract interpretation, and the question of whether a union has\n\nwaived its right to bargain over the subject does not come into\n\nplay.   Id. at 836-37.   In summary, the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nconsiders    \"the   'covered   by'    and   'waiver'   inquiries   .   .   .\n\nanalytically distinct: A waiver occurs when a union knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily relinquishes its right to bargain about a matter; but\n\nwhere the matter is covered by the [CBA], the union has exercised\n\nits bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant.\"\n\nId.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            In the case before us, the Board avoided the controversy\n\nsurrounding the applicable standard when a union alleges a § 8(a)\n\n(5) unilateral change and the employer defends with contractual\n\nprivilege by determining sua sponte that the General Counsel\n\nalleged only a § 8(d) contract modification.             Bath Iron Works\n\nCorp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3.            The Unions argue that the\n\nGeneral Counsel alleged both a § 8(d) contract modification and a\n\n§ 8(a)(5) unilateral change, and that the Board therefore erred in\n\n                                     -16-\n\ffailing to apply the clear and unmistakable waiver standard to\n\ntheir unilateral change claim.    Alternatively, the Unions argue\n\nthat the sound arguable basis standard incorporates the clear and\n\nunmistakable waiver standard.\n\nA. The General Counsel's Allegations\n\n          As a preliminary matter, the Board contends that the\n\nUnions are barred under Section 10(e) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 160(e), from arguing that the General Counsel alleged a § 8(a)(5)\n\nunilateral change violation because the Unions did not move for\n\nreconsideration of the Board's sua sponte holding.7   See Woelke &\n\nRomero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 665-66 (1982) (holding\n\nthat the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider whether\n\nthe Board had erred in finding that certain picketing was lawful\n\nbecause no party had raised the issue to the Board, either during\n\nthe initial proceedings or on motion for reconsideration); Int'l\n\nLadies' Garment Workers' Union v. Quality Mfg. Co., 420 U.S. 276,\n\n281 n.3 (1975) (holding that the Court did not have jurisdiction to\n\nconsider an argument not presented to the Board in a motion for\n\nreconsideration).   Section 10(e) does not, however, \"deprive the\n\ncourt of jurisdiction if the Union gave the Board 'adequate notice'\n\n\n\n7\n    In addition, amicus curiae Council on Labor Law Equality\nsupplements that argument by arguing waiver under 29 C.F.R.\n§ 102.46(g) because no exception to the ALJ's treatment of the case\nas involving a § 8(d) claim was ever filed by the General Counsel.\nWe note the General Counsel was the prevailing party before the\nALJ, and it was the Company that filed the exceptions.\n\n                                -17-\n\fof the argument it seeks to advance on review.\"           Am. Postal Workers\n\nUnion v. NLRB, 370 F.3d 25, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see also NLRB v.\n\nSt. Regis Paper Co., 674 F.2d 104, 108 n.4 (1st Cir. 1982)\n\n(refusing to hear an argument that was not presented to the Board\n\n\"either initially or via a motion for reconsideration\").\n\n             It is unfair to say that the Board did not have adequate\n\nnotice of the Unions' position that the General Counsel raised a\n\n§ 8(a)(5) unilateral change claim.          The General Counsel's brief to\n\nthe Board argued the unilateral change claim, the Company's failure\n\nto bargain to impasse, and the Unions' lack of waiver of its\n\nstatutory    right   to   bargain.     According     to    the    Board's   own\n\ndiscussion below, these arguments are relevant only to § 8(a)(5)\n\nclaims, and not to § 8(d) contract modification claims.              Bath Iron\n\nWorks Corp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3 (\"The 'unilateral change'\n\ncase   and   the   'contract   modification'     case     are    fundamentally\n\ndifferent . . . .     The allegation [in a 'unilateral change' case]\n\nis a failure to bargain. . . .       [A] defense to a unilateral change\n\ncan be that the union has waived its right to bargain.\").             It seems\n\nclear, then, that the Board had adequate notice that the General\n\nCounsel and the Unions believed that the § 8(a)(5) unilateral\n\nchange issue was before the Board, and therefore the issue was\n\npreserved for appeal.\n\n             Although the General Counsel's Consolidated Complaint\n\ncould have been clearer, it does in fact allege both a § 8(a)(5)\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\funilateral change violation and a § 8(d) contract modification\n\nviolation.    The Complaint alleges that the Company \"engaged in the\n\nconduct described . . . without [the Unions'] consent.\"                In the\n\nnext subparagraph, the Complaint alternatively alleges that the\n\nCompany \"engaged in the conduct described . . . without affording\n\n[the Unions] an opportunity to bargain with respect to this conduct\n\nand the effects of this conduct.\"          Again, as the Board explained\n\nbelow,    consent   is   only   relevant   to   a   §   8(d)   violation,   and\n\nbargaining is only relevant to a § 8(a)(5) violation.               Thus, the\n\nformer allegation describes a § 8(d) contract modification without\n\nthe Unions' consent, whereas the latter alternative allegation\n\ndescribes a § 8(a)(5) unilateral change without bargaining with the\n\nUnions.\n\nB. Appropriate Standard in a § 8(a)(5) Claim with a Contractual\n   Defense\n\n            The Unions argue that the clear and unmistakable waiver\n\nstandard applies to § 8(a)(5) unilateral change claims, regardless\n\nof the employer's defense.        The Board below agreed that the clear\n\nand unmistakable waiver standard is appropriate to § 8(a)(5)\n\nallegations.    When the employer responds to the unilateral change\n\nallegation with a claim of contractual right to act unilaterally,\n\nhowever, the Board has not been consistent in its choice of\n\nstandard, as explained above.         In such cases, the Board is not\n\nentitled to the normal deference we owe it.                    See Local 777,\n\nDemocratic Union Org. Comm. v. NLRB, 603 F.2d 862, 871-72 (D.C.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fCir. 1978) (\"The vacillation of the NLRB vitiates the deference we\n\nwould otherwise show to its very considerable expertise in strictly\n\nlabor matters.\"); see also Wilcox v. Ives, 864 F.2d 915, 924-25\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (\"The[] general admonitions for judicial review of\n\nagency decisions are even more exacting when the courts are faced\n\nwith inconsistent agency positions . . . .\").\n\n            Rather, we adopt the District of Columbia Circuit's\n\ncontract coverage test to determine whether the Unions have already\n\nexercised their right to bargain.   See U.S. Postal Serv., 8 F.3d at\n\n836.    If so, the waiver standard is meaningless.   See id. at 836-\n\n37.    The unfair labor practice determination depends solely on the\n\ninterpretation of the contract in place, and the appropriate\n\nstandard for the Board to apply is the sound arguable basis\n\nstandard.   See NCR Corp., 271 N.L.R.B. at 1213.   The Board has only\n\nlimited authority to interpret labor contracts and should not act\n\nas an arbitrator in contract interpretation disputes.     See id.\n\n            This framework is consistent with the NLRA and the NCR\n\nCorp. line of Board cases.       It preserves for the courts and\n\narbitrators the authority to interpret labor contracts, while\n\npermitting the Board to find an unfair labor practice when the\n\nemployer has not fulfilled its duty to bargain.\n\n            Moreover, this approach unifies the Board's disparate\n\napproaches to § 8(d) contract modification claims and to § 8(a)(5)\n\nunilateral change claims to which the employer has a legitimate\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fcontractual defense.      Unions can and do allege both, as here, and\n\nthe   unfair    labor   practice   determination    in   both    rests   on   an\n\ninterpretation of the contract.              Yet, the Board traditionally\n\napplies vastly different standards to the two identical situations.\n\nFurther,    the   Board   has   not   clearly    articulated      a   test    for\n\ndistinguishing between the two claims -- and therefore the two\n\napplicable standards -- when both are alleged.             C.f., e.g., St.\n\nVincent Hosp., 320 N.L.R.B. 42 (1995) (affirming the ALJ's § 8(d)\n\ndetermination and thus finding it unnecessary to reach the ALJ's\n\nalternative § 8(a)(5) determination).\n\n            In determining whether a subject is covered by a CBA,\n\nsuch that the sound arguable basis standard is appropriate, we will\n\nconsider whether the parties bargained over the mandatory subject\n\nat issue.      The Board has determined that the identity of an ERISA\n\nplan sponsor is a mandatory subject of bargaining.              Carrier Corp.,\n\n319 N.L.R.B. 184, 196 (1995).         It is apparent from the language of\n\nthe CBAs that the parties bargained over the identity of the Plan\n\nsponsor, and thus that the CBAs cover the subject.              All three CBAs\n\nexplicitly identify the Plan, and the General Counsel admitted in\n\nhis brief to the Board that \"the identity of the pension plan was\n\na part of the collective bargaining agreement.\"                  Furthermore,\n\nalthough it is unclear whether the CBAs authorize a unilateral\n\nchange in the identity of the Plan sponsor, such as occurred when\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fthe Company merged the Plan, these issues can only be resolved by\n\ninterpreting the contract.\n\n          Because the CBAs cover the subject matter of the present\n\ndispute, the sound arguable basis standard applies. Thus the Board\n\ndid not err below by failing to apply the clear and unmistakable\n\nwaiver standard.\n\nC. Appropriate Standard in a § 8(d) Contract Modification Claim\n\n          The Unions also argue that the Board applied the wrong\n\nstandard in analyzing the case as a § 8(d) contract modification\n\nviolation.   They argue that because the Company defended on the\n\nbasis of a contractual provision, the Board should have required\n\nthe Company to show a clear and unmistakable waiver of the Unions'\n\nright to bargain.   The Unions make this argument by analogizing to\n\ncertain § 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases in which the employer\n\ndefended on the basis of a management rights clause in a CBA.   They\n\nargue that even if the sound arguable basis test does apply in\n\n§ 8(d) cases, \"where [a contractual defense] rests on an alleged\n\nwaiver, the 'sound arguable basis' analysis incorporates the 'clear\n\nand unmistakable waiver' standard.\"    We disagree.\n\n          As discussed above, the Board has traditionally chosen to\n\nuse different tests when ruling on § 8(a)(5) unilateral change\n\nclaims and § 8(d) contract modification claims.       Even when the\n\nBoard determines that a § 8(a)(5) unfair labor practice charge\n\nturns solely on the interpretation of a contract, it applies the\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fsound arguable basis standard to the exclusion of the clear and\n\nunmistakable waiver standard.              To our knowledge, the Board has\n\nnever required the showing of a clear and unmistakable waiver of\n\nthe union's right to bargain in order to establish a sound arguable\n\nbasis    for    the   employer's    interpretation       of    a    contract.      As\n\nexplained at length above, the two standards are analytically\n\ndistinct.       NLRB v. U.S. Postal Serv., 8 F.3d 832, 836 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1993).    Thus, the Unions are incorrect to suggest that the sound\n\narguable basis standard incorporates to any extent the clear and\n\nunmistakable waiver standard.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n               Finally, the Unions argue that the Board erred in holding\n\nthat the Plan documents were even arguably incorporated into the S-\n\n6 and S-7 CBAs,8 and that the BMDA CBA cannot reasonably be read to\n\ngrant the Company the authority to alter the Plan sponsor.\n\nA. The Relationship of the Plan Documents to the S-6 and S-7 CBAs\n\n               In   response   to   the    General    Counsel's      unfair     labor\n\npractice charges, the Company stated that in merging the Plan into\n\nthe General Dynamics pension plan it acted pursuant to authority\n\ngranted it in the Plan documents, which it said were incorporated\n\ninto the three Unions' CBAs.              The Board, in applying the sound\n\narguable basis test, did not hold that the Plan documents were\n\n\n\n8\n    The Unions concede that the                 CBA   with    the   BMDA   arguably\nincorporates the Plan documents.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fincorporated into the CBAs. It merely held that the Plan documents\n\n\"are arguably a part of the CBAs,\" and that \"they arguably give the\n\n[Company] the authority to effect the merger.\"              Bath Iron Works\n\nCorp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 5.\n\n             The determination of an unfair labor practice charge may\n\nbecome   more   difficult   when   certain    terms   and    conditions    of\n\nemployment, such as the specific terms of the Plan, are described\n\nin documents other than the CBA itself.           Of course, if the CBA\n\nexpressly states that those other documents are \"incorporated in\n\nthe agreement,\" that suffices to include those documents in the\n\nanalysis.    Mary Thompson Hosp., 296 N.L.R.B. 1245, 1246-47 (1989),\n\nenforced, 943 F.2d 741 (7th Cir. 1991).\n\n             We agree with the Board majority, however, that, at least\n\nunder the sound arguable basis standard, the ALJ and the dissent\n\nfrom   the   Board's   opinion   were   incorrect     to   insist   on   some\n\nparticular incantation of words.9         See Bath Iron Works Corp., 345\n\nN.L.R.B. No. 33, at 5.      The fact that none of the contracts here\n\nuse the term \"incorporate\" does not mean the Plan documents are not\n\nsufficiently part of the contracts to be considered in the sound\n\narguable basis analysis.      To the extent the Board seems to have\n\nadopted a test that the agreements must simply \"refer[] in some way\n\n\n\n\n9\n   We express no opinion about what might be required under the\nclear and unmistakable waiver standard.\n\n                                   -24-\n\fto the Plan documents,\" id. at 2, we disagree.          Mere reference may\n\nwell not be sufficient.\n\n           Here, we are persuaded that the Plan documents are\n\nsufficiently a part of the S-6 and S-7 CBAs, whether they are\n\nexplicitly incorporated or not, to be considered in the sound\n\narguable   basis    test.   We   examine    de   novo   the   terms    of    the\n\nparticular    agreements,   since    this   is   a   matter    of     contract\n\ninterpretation.     See Litton, 501 U.S. at 202.        Neither the S-6 nor\n\nthe S-7 CBA merely refers to the Plan documents.          Rather than mere\n\nreference, the S-6 CBA specifies that employee pension plans \"are\n\nERISA Plans and their terms and conditions are governed by Plan\n\nDocuments.\"    Similarly, the S-7 CBA states with respect to the\n\nPlan, among other benefits, that \"[a]ll of the terms and conditions\n\nin their entirety are governed by Plan documents . . . .\"                   This\n\nlanguage demonstrates that the parties negotiated over and reached\n\na bargain as to what documents governed the terms and conditions of\n\nthe Plan, and those documents were specifically identified in each\n\nof the CBAs.       The Company could thus arguably consider the Plan\n\ndocuments a part of the CBA and rely on the documents as a basis\n\nfor authority to merge the Plan.\n\nB. The Company's Interpretation of the S-6 and S-7 CBAs\n\n           We review de novo the question of whether the Company's\n\ninterpretation of the three CBAs has a sound arguable basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fLitton, 501 U.S. at 202.   We conclude that the sound arguable basis\n\ntest has been met.\n\n          To the extent the Unions argue10 that the Plan documents\n\ncannot arguably be read in conjunction with the S-6 and S-7 CBAs to\n\ngive the Company the authority to alter the Plan sponsor, the\n\nUnions still cannot prevail.\n\n          The argument that the S-6 and S-7 agreements must be read\n\n\"to fix the 'terms and conditions' of the pension plan for the\n\nduration of the agreement[s],\" Bath Iron Works Corp., 345 N.L.R.B.\n\nNo. 33, at 11 (Liebman, Member, dissenting), fails.          To the\n\ncontrary, section 12.1 of the Plan reserves to the Company the\n\nright to \"amend, modify, or suspend the Plan,\" subject to any\n\nlimitations in the CBAs, of which there are none.   The S-6 and S-7\n\nCBAs otherwise explicitly do not exclude that power.   It is a sound\n\nand arguable interpretation of those CBAs that the Company had the\n\nauthority to unilaterally change the Plan sponsor, whether or not\n\nthe argument is correct.   The dissenting Board Member's point that\n\nsuch an interpretation would give the Unions \"less protection\n\nagainst unilateral changes than [they] would have enjoyed if the\n\nagreement[s] had never referred to the [P]lan,\" id. (emphasis\n\n\n\n\n10\n    It is not at all clear that they do.    See United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in\na perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                -26-\n\fomitted),    is   hardly   dispositive.     Parties   routinely   make\n\nconcessions during bargaining.\n\nC. The Company's Interpretation of the CBA with the BMDA\n\n            The CBA between the Company and the BMDA provides that\n\nthe Plan \"shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with\n\nthe provisions thereof, providing, however, that changes thereto\n\nmay be made as provided in Article I of the [P]lan.\"       The Unions\n\nconcede that the CBA arguably incorporates the Plan documents.\n\nArticle I of the Plan permits certain modifications to the Plan for\n\ntax purposes.     Article XII of the Plan states that \"[s]ubject to\n\nthe applicable provisions of any collective bargaining agreement,\n\nthe Company shall have the right to amend, modify, or suspend the\n\nPlan.\"\n\n            The Unions argue that the phrase \"remain in full force\n\nand effect\" requires that the Company maintain the status quo and\n\nmake no changes.    Not so.   There is a sound arguable basis for the\n\nCompany's determination that the agreement gives it the power to\n\namend the Plan and requires bargaining only when it seeks to change\n\nthe benefit structure or the level of benefits conferred, neither\n\nof which occurred here.\n\nD. The Board's Determination of No Bad Faith\n\n            We give deference to the Board's determination, as to all\n\nthree contracts, that the Company did not act in bad faith.       See\n\nNLRB v. Hearst Publ'ns, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 131 (1944) (\"[T]he\n\n\n                                  -27-\n\fBoard's determination . . . is to be accepted if it has 'warrant in\n\nthe record' and a reasonable basis in law.\"), overruled in part on\n\nother grounds by Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318\n\n(1992).     We disagree with the analysis of the dissenting Member of\n\nthe Board that bad faith is necessarily shown because the employer\n\ntook the position, which is certainly arguable, that the contract\n\npermitted it to make this change unilaterally. See Bath Iron Works\n\nCorp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 6, 10 (Liebman, Member, dissenting).\n\n             The Board's conclusion that the Company did not engage in\n\nan unfair labor practice because it acted in good faith pursuant to\n\na   sound   arguable     interpretation   of   the   three   contracts   was\n\nreasonable.     There was no evidence to the contrary.\n\n             The Company urges us to hold that it did not modify the\n\ncontracts because it was given, clearly and unambiguously, the\n\nauthority to change the Plan sponsor.          Like the Board, we decline\n\nto go so far.\n\n                                    V.\n\n             For the reasons stated above, we affirm the Board's\n\ndecision dismissing the complaint below.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                       \"Concurring opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment. I join\n\nin the judgment of the majority opinion.     I do not join Part III.B\n\nor the associated discussions of the topic covered in that Part.\n\nI write to explain my different approach on those issues. Although\n\nthe majority and I agree that this case is properly a § 8(d)\n\ncontract modification case, we disagree as to what that implies\n\nabout any separate § 8(a)(5) unilateral change claim.       We agree\n\nthat the § 8(d) contract modification claim was properly handled by\n\nthe Board.\n\n            The peculiar difficulty created by this case is that the\n\nBoard stated in its opinion that this was a § 8(d) case because the\n\nGeneral Counsel had alleged only \"unlawful modification of the\n\ncontracts within the meaning of Section 8(d).\"       Bath Iron Works\n\nCorp., 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3.      I agree with the majority that\n\nit is not a fair reading of the record to say that the General\n\nCounsel did not also plead a § 8(a)(5) failure to bargain claim.\n\n            Normally, if the Board has not directly addressed an\n\nissue, we would remand to get the Board's determination -- here,\n\nits determination, assuming both claims were raised, on whether\n\nthis was a § 8(d) case or a § 8(a)(5) case.         I agree with the\n\nmajority's implicit conclusion that this would be a fruitless\n\nexercise.    This case is old, as well, and needs resolution.\n\n            The majority handles this problem by deciding on its own\n\nwhat the law is on § 8(a)(5) claims to which an employer raises a\n\n\n                                -29-\n\fcontractual defense.   It justifies its own review of the § 8(a)(5)\n\nissue on the ground that the Board has been inconsistent, and so,\n\nit says, the court is entitled to engage in de novo review.       Of\n\ncourse, the Board may, and often has, changed its positions -- it\n\nis permitted to do so provided it explains itself.   See Nat'l Cable\n\n& Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 125 S. Ct. 2688,\n\n2699-700 (2005) (stating that under Chevron, an agency should have\n\nflexibility to vary its interpretation of a statute over time).   I\n\ndo not think that de novo review can be justified.    I also do not\n\nthink there has been material inconsistency on the part of the\n\nBoard.11   Nor do I think there is any need to get into a discussion\n\n\n11\n    In describing a supposed inconsistency in the Board's treatment\nof § 8(a)(5) unilateral change claims, the majority compares\n§ 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases, in which the Board has applied\nthe clear and unmistakable waiver analysis, with a § 8(d) contract\nmodification case, in which the Board applied the sound arguable\nbasis analysis. NCR Corp., which the majority cites in support of\nthe proposition that \"[a]t times, . . . the Board has determined,\nwithout much explanation, that the dispute was solely one of\ncontract interpretation,\" was a § 8(d) contract modification case,\nidentified as such, not a § 8(a)(5) unilateral change case.\n      In NCR Corp., the union did allege a § 8(a)(5) unilateral\nchange violation, 271 N.L.R.B. 1212, 1213-14, but the ALJ explained\nthat on the facts of the case, the proper claim was a § 8(d)\ncontract modification claim, id. at 1217-18. The ALJ then analyzed\nthe claim as a § 8(d) contract modification claim (without applying\nthe sound arguable basis test), id. at 1218-19, and, finding a\nviolation, awarded remedies applicable to contract modification\nclaims, id. at 1219. The Board reversed the ALJ's decision on the\nmerits, applying the sound arguable basis test and concluding that\nit \"[did] not find that the [employer] failed to comply with\nSection 8(d).\" Id. at 1213. The Board made no mention of the\nALJ's determination that a § 8(d) contract modification claim was\nthe appropriate claim on the facts of the case, and it affirmed the\nALJ's rulings, findings, and conclusions that were consistent with\nits decision. Id.\n\n                                -30-\n\fof § 8(a)(5) cases at all, since this is not one, or into the\n\ndispute between the D.C. Circuit and the Board over the treatment\n\nof certain § 8(a)(5) claims, much less take any position on the\n\nmatter.\n\n           In my opinion, while the Board was wrong to say that no\n\n§ 8(a)(5) claim had ever been pled (if that is in fact what the\n\nBoard meant), that is immaterial.     The Board is not bound by the\n\ntheories pled by the General Counsel. In explaining at some length\n\nthe categorical differences between § 8(d) contract modification\n\ncases and § 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases, the Board gave a\n\nsufficient   justification   for    why   this   case   is   properly\n\ncharacterized only as a § 8(d) case.      See Bath Iron Works Corp.,\n\n345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3.   We are required under Chevron to give\n\ndeference to the policy choices inherent in that decision by the\n\nBoard.    See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).\n\n           The problem posed here is sui generis. It is regrettable\n\nthat the Board did not acknowledge the nature of the claims before\n\nit and posed this dilemma for the courts.\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f",

Three unions have long represented the Company's employees covered under the relevant pension plan: Local Lodge S-6 (\"S-6\") of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"IAM\"), Local Lodge S-7 (\"S-7\") of the IAM, and the Bath Marine Draftsmen's Association (\"BMDA,\" collectively \"the Unions\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Pension Plan</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company established the Bath Iron Workers Pension Plan for Hourly Employees (the \"Plan\") in 1963. The Plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). Article XII of the Plan addresses amendment, termination, and merger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Article 12.1 provides that \"[s]ubject to the applicable provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, the Company shall have the right to amend, modify, or suspend the Plan.\" Under Article 12.2, the Company \"reserves the right to terminate the Plan.\" Article 12.5 governs the transfer of Plan assets in the case of merger or consolidation, but does not mention who has the authority to merge the Plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New benefits stopped accruing under the Plan for S-6 and S-7 members on August 31, 1994, when those employees switched to an IAM multiemployer pension plan.

The Collective Bargaining Agreements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the relevant time period, March 1998 to March 2001, each union had a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") with the Company. The CBAs between the Company and S-6 and S-7 respectively both briefly refer to the Plan. Both CBAs also provide that the language therein represents only highlights of the Company's benefits program, as the terms and conditions of specific benefits are governed by separate plan documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> BMDA's CBA discusses the Plan at greater length, providing that the Plan \"shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the provisions thereof.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

During its 1998 negotiations with BMDA, the Company announced that it was considering a merger of the Plan, which was underfunded, into the General Dynamics Pension Plan. BMDA requested bargaining over the merger of the pension plans, but the Company took the position that the merger was too speculative to warrant negotiations. Shortly after concluding contract negotiations with BMDA, the Company received permission from General Dynamics and the government to merge the plans. The Company then discussed the merger with the Unions, but did not gain their consent. Finally, in October 1998, the Company unilaterally merged the Plan into the General Dynamics Pension Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.

The ALJ also determined that the Unions had not clearly and unmistakably relinquished their right to bargain over the merger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board reversed the ALJ and dismissed the complaint on the ground that the ALJ had applied the incorrect standard in the case. <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, 2005 WL 2115867 (Aug. 27, 2005). While acknowledging that the \"clear and unmistakable waiver\" standard applies in an 8(a)(5) unilateral change case, the Board concluded that \"the General Counsel's sole allegation is the allegation of unlawful modification of the contracts within the meaning of Section 8(d).\" <i>Id.</i> at 3. In such contract modification cases, the Board stated, \"the issue is whether the [Company] had a sound arguable basis for its actions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5. The Board went on to determine that the Company did have a sound arguable basis for its interpretation that the CBA and the Plan documents allowed the merger. <i>Id.</i> The Board declined to rule on whether the Company's interpretation of the contracts was correct, leaving such determinations to arbitrators and the courts. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BMDA petitioned for review of the Board's decision on or about October 24, 2005, and S-6 and S-7 followed on December 1.

The Board's role is to prevent such economic warfare by prohibiting as unfair labor practices clear mid-term modifications of a contract that disrupt the economic relationship. In such situations, the Board may award remedies including a cease and desist order (effectively, an order to adhere to the contract); an order for an employer to compensate employees for unlawfully reduced wages, benefits, or bonuses; or an order stripping employees who unlawfully strike of their status as employees, thereby \"subject[ing] them to immediate discharge and jeopardiz[ing] forthwith the union's status as bargaining representative.\" Gorman &amp; Finkin, <i>supra,</i> at 570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that &#167; 8(d) is not meant to confer on the Board broad powers to interpret CBAs.

Traditionally, the Board applies the clear and unmistakable waiver standard, reviewing the contract to determine whether the union clearly and unmistakably waived its statutory right to bargain with respect to a particular action. <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B.

In summary, the District of Columbia Circuit considers \"the `covered by' and `waiver' inquiries . . . analytically distinct: A waiver occurs when a union knowingly and voluntarily <i>relinquishes</i> its right to bargain about a matter; but where the matter is covered by the [CBA], the union <i>has exercised</i> its bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, the Board avoided the controversy surrounding the applicable standard when a union alleges a &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change and the employer defends with contractual privilege by determining <i>sua sponte</i> that the General Counsel alleged only a &#167; 8(d) contract modification. <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3. The Unions argue that the General Counsel alleged both a &#167; 8(d) contract modification and a &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change, and that the Board therefore erred in failing to apply the clear and unmistakable waiver standard to their unilateral change claim.

The General Counsel's brief to the Board argued the unilateral change claim, the Company's failure to bargain to impasse, and the Unions' lack of waiver of its statutory right to bargain. According to the Board's own discussion below, these arguments are relevant only to &#167; 8(a)(5) claims, and not to &#167; 8(d) contract modification claims. <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3 (\"The `unilateral change' case and the `contract modification' case are fundamentally different. . . . The allegation [in a `unilateral change' case] is a failure to bargain. . . . [A] defense to a unilateral change can be that the union has waived its right to bargain.\"). It seems clear, then, that the Board had adequate notice that the General Counsel and the Unions believed that the &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change issue was before the Board, and therefore the issue was preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the General Counsel's Consolidated Complaint could have been clearer, it does in fact allege both a &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change violation and a &#167; 8(d) contract modification violation. The Complaint alleges that the Company \"engaged in the conduct described . . . without [the Unions'] consent.\" In the next subparagraph, the Complaint alternatively alleges that the Company \"engaged in the conduct described . . . without affording [the Unions] an opportunity to bargain with respect to this conduct and the effects of this conduct.\" Again, as the Board explained below, consent is only relevant to a &#167; 8(d) violation, and bargaining is only relevant to a &#167; 8(a)(5) violation. Thus, the former allegation describes a &#167; 8(d) contract modification without the Unions' consent, whereas the latter alternative allegation describes a &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change without bargaining with the Unions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

The Board below agreed that the clear and unmistakable waiver standard is appropriate to &#167; 8(a)(5) allegations. When the employer responds to the unilateral change allegation with a claim of contractual right to act unilaterally, however, the Board has not been consistent in its choice of standard, as explained above. In such cases, the Board is not entitled to the normal deference we owe it. <i>See Local 777, Democratic Union Org. Comm. v. NLRB,</i> 603 F.2d 862, 871-72 (D.C.Cir.1978) (\"The vacillation of the NLRB vitiates the deference we would otherwise show to its very considerable expertise in strictly labor matters.\"); <i>see also Wilcox v.

If so, the waiver standard is meaningless. See <i>id.</i> at 836-37. The unfair labor practice determination depends solely on the interpretation of the contract in place, and the appropriate standard for the Board to apply is the sound arguable basis standard. <i>See NCR Corp.,</i> 271 N.L.R.B. at 1213. The Board has only limited authority to interpret labor contracts and should not act as an arbitrator in contract interpretation disputes. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This framework is consistent with the NLRA and the <i>NCR Corp.</i> line of Board cases. It preserves for the courts and arbitrators the authority to interpret labor contracts, while permitting the Board to find an unfair labor practice when the employer has not fulfilled its duty to bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, this approach unifies the Board's disparate approaches to &#167; 8(d) contract modification claims and to &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change claims to which the employer has a legitimate contractual defense. Unions can and do allege both, as here, and the unfair labor practice determination in both rests on an interpretation of the contract. Yet, the Board traditionally applies vastly different standards to the two identical situations. Further, the Board has not clearly articulated a test for distinguishing between the two claims &#8212; and therefore the two applicable standards &#8212; when both are alleged. <i>C.f., e.g., St. Vincent Hosp.,</i> 320 N.L.R.B. 42 (1995) (affirming the ALJ's &#167; 8(d) determination and thus finding it unnecessary to reach the ALJ's alternative &#167; 8(a)(5) determination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a subject is covered by a CBA, such that the sound arguable basis standard is appropriate, we will consider whether the parties bargained over the mandatory subject at issue. The Board has determined that the identity of an ERISA plan sponsor is a mandatory subject of bargaining. <i>Carrier Corp.,</i> 319 N.L.R.B. 184, 196 (1995). It is apparent from the language of the CBAs that the parties bargained over the identity of the Plan sponsor, and thus that the CBAs cover the subject. All three CBAs explicitly identify the Plan, and the General Counsel admitted in his brief to the Board that \"the identity of the pension plan was a part of the collective bargaining agreement.\" Furthermore, although it is unclear whether the CBAs authorize a unilateral change in the identity of the Plan sponsor, such as occurred when the Company merged the Plan, these issues can only be resolved by interpreting the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the CBAs cover the subject matter of the present dispute, the sound arguable basis standard applies. Thus the Board did not err below by failing to apply the clear and unmistakable waiver standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

They argue that because the Company defended on the basis of a contractual provision, the Board should have required the Company to show a clear and unmistakable waiver of the Unions' right to bargain. The Unions make this argument by analogizing to certain &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases in which the employer defended on the basis of a management rights clause in a CBA. They argue that even if the sound arguable basis test does apply in &#167; 8(d) cases, \"where [a contractual defense] rests on an alleged waiver, the `sound arguable basis' analysis incorporates the `clear and unmistakable waiver' standard.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, the Board has traditionally chosen to use different tests when ruling on &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change claims and &#167; 8(d) contract modification claims. Even when the Board determines that a &#167; 8(a)(5) unfair labor practice charge turns solely on the interpretation of a contract, it applies the sound arguable basis standard to the exclusion of the clear and unmistakable waiver standard. To our knowledge, the Board has never required the showing of a clear and unmistakable waiver of the union's right to bargain in order to establish a sound arguable basis for the employer's interpretation of a contract. As explained at length above, the two standards are analytically distinct. <i>NLRB v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 8 F.3d 832, 836 (D.C.Cir. 1993). Thus, the Unions are incorrect to suggest that the sound arguable basis standard incorporates to any extent the clear and unmistakable waiver standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Unions argue that the Board erred in holding that the Plan documents were even arguably incorporated into the S-6 and S-7 CBAs,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and that the BMDA CBA cannot reasonably be read to grant the Company the authority to alter the Plan sponsor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The Board, in applying the sound arguable basis test, did not hold that the Plan documents were incorporated into the CBAs. It merely held that the Plan documents \"are arguably a part of the CBAs,\" and that \"they arguably give the [Company] the authority to effect the merger.\" <i>Bath</i> <i>Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B.

Of course, if the CBA expressly states that those other documents are \"incorporated in the agreement,\" that suffices to include those documents in the analysis. <i>Mary Thompson Hosp.,</i> 296 N.L.R.B. 1245, 1246-47 (1989), <i>enforced,</i> 943 F.2d 741 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the Board majority, however, that, at least under the sound arguable basis standard, the ALJ and the dissent from the Board's opinion were incorrect to insist on some particular incantation of words.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B.

The fact that none of the contracts here use the term \"incorporate\" does not mean the Plan documents are not sufficiently part of the contracts to be considered in the sound arguable basis analysis.

Neither the S-6 nor the S-7 CBA merely refers to the Plan documents. Rather than mere reference, the S-6 CBA specifies that employee pension plans \"are ERISA Plans and their terms and conditions are governed by Plan Documents.\" Similarly, the S-7 CBA states with respect to the Plan, among other benefits, that \"[a]ll of the terms and conditions in their entirety are governed by Plan documents. . . .\" This language demonstrates that the parties negotiated over and reached a bargain as to what documents governed the terms and conditions of the Plan, and those documents were specifically identified in each of the CBAs.

To the contrary, section 12.1 of the Plan reserves to the Company the right to \"amend, modify, or suspend the Plan,\" subject to any limitations in the CBAs, of which there are none. The S-6 and S-7 CBAs otherwise explicitly do not exclude that power. It is a sound and arguable interpretation of those CBAs that the Company had the authority to unilaterally change the Plan sponsor, whether or not the argument is correct. The dissenting Board Member's point that such an interpretation would give the Unions \"less protection against unilateral changes than [they] would have enjoyed if the agreement[s] had never referred to the [P]lan,\" <i>id.</i> (emphasis omitted), is hardly dispositive.

Article I of the Plan permits certain modifications to the Plan for tax purposes.

I do not join Part III.B or the associated discussions of the topic covered in that Part. I write to explain my different approach on those issues. Although the majority and I agree that this case is properly a &#167; 8(d) contract modification case, we disagree as to what that implies about any separate &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change claim. We agree that the &#167; 8(d) contract modification claim was properly handled by the Board.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The peculiar difficulty created by this case is that the Board stated in its opinion that this was a &#167; 8(d) case <i>because</i> the General Counsel had alleged only \"unlawful modification of the contracts within the meaning of Section 8(d).\" <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3. I agree with the majority that it is not a fair reading of the record to say that the General Counsel did not also plead a &#167; 8(a)(5) failure to bargain claim.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Normally, if the Board has not directly addressed an issue, we would remand to get the Board's determination &#8212; here, its determination, assuming both claims were raised, on whether this was a &#167; 8(d) case or a &#167; 8(a)(5) case. I agree with the majority's implicit conclusion that this would be a fruitless exercise. This case is old, as well, and needs resolution.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The majority handles this problem by deciding on its own what the law is on &#167; 8(a)(5) claims to which an employer raises a contractual defense. It justifies its own review of the &#167; 8(a)(5) issue on the ground that the Board has been inconsistent, and so, it says, the court is entitled to engage in de novo review. Of course, the Board may, and often has, changed its positions-it is permitted to do so provided it explains itself. <i>See Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 2699-700, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (stating that under <i>Chevron,</i> an agency should have flexibility to vary its interpretation of a statute over time). I do not think that de novo review can be justified. I also do not think there has been material inconsistency on the part of the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Nor do I think there is any need to get into a discussion of &#167; 8(a)(5) cases at all, since this is not one, or into the dispute between the D.C. Circuit and the Board over the treatment of certain &#167; 8(a)(5) claims, much less take any position on the matter.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In my opinion, while the Board was wrong to say that no &#167; 8(a)(5) claim had ever been pled (if that is in fact what the Board meant), that is immaterial. The Board is not bound by the theories pled by the General Counsel. In explaining at some length the categorical differences between &#167; 8(d) contract modification cases and &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases, the Board gave a sufficient justification for why this case is <i>properly</i> characterized <i>only</i> as a &#167; 8(d) case. <i>See Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3. We are required under <i>Chevron</i> to give deference to the policy choices inherent in that decision by the Board. <i>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The problem posed here is sui generis.

The ALJ then analyzed the claim as a &#167; 8(d) contract modification claim (without applying the sound arguable basis test), <i>id.</i> at 1218-19, and, finding a violation, awarded remedies applicable to contract modification claims, <i>id.</i> at 1219.

The CBAs between the Company and S-6 and S-7 respectively both briefly refer to the Plan. Both CBAs also provide that the language therein represents only highlights of the Company's benefits program, as the terms and conditions of specific benefits are governed by separate plan documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> BMDA's CBA discusses the Plan at greater length, providing that the Plan \"shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with the provisions thereof.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

During its 1998 negotiations with BMDA, the Company announced that it was considering a merger of the Plan, which was underfunded, into the General Dynamics Pension Plan. BMDA requested bargaining over the merger of the pension plans, but the Company took the position that the merger was too speculative to warrant negotiations. Shortly after concluding contract negotiations with BMDA, the Company received permission from General Dynamics and the government to merge the plans. The Company then discussed the merger with the Unions, but did not gain their consent. Finally, in October 1998, the Company unilaterally merged the Plan into the General Dynamics Pension Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E.

In such contract modification cases, the Board stated, \"the issue is whether the [Company] had a sound arguable basis for its actions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 5. The Board went on to determine that the Company did have a sound arguable basis for its interpretation that the CBA and the Plan documents allowed the merger. <i>Id.</i> The Board declined to rule on whether the Company's interpretation of the contracts was correct, leaving such determinations to arbitrators and the courts. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BMDA petitioned for review of the Board's decision on or about October 24, 2005, and S-6 and S-7 followed on December 1.

The General Counsel's brief to the Board argued the unilateral change claim, the Company's failure to bargain to impasse, and the Unions' lack of waiver of its statutory right to bargain. According to the Board's own discussion below, these arguments are relevant only to &#167; 8(a)(5) claims, and not to &#167; 8(d) contract modification claims. <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3 (\"The `unilateral change' case and the `contract modification' case are fundamentally different. . . . The allegation [in a `unilateral change' case] is a failure to bargain. . . . [A] defense to a unilateral change can be that the union has waived its right to bargain.\"). It seems clear, then, that the Board had adequate notice that the General Counsel and the Unions believed that the &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change issue was before the Board, and therefore the issue was preserved for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the General Counsel's Consolidated Complaint could have been clearer, it does in fact allege both a &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change violation and a &#167; 8(d) contract modification violation. The Complaint alleges that the Company \"engaged in the conduct described . . . without [the Unions'] consent.\" In the next subparagraph, the Complaint alternatively alleges that the Company \"engaged in the conduct described . . . without affording [the Unions] an opportunity to bargain with respect to this conduct and the effects of this conduct.\" Again, as the Board explained below, consent is only relevant to a &#167; 8(d) violation, and bargaining is only relevant to a &#167; 8(a)(5) violation. Thus, the former allegation describes a &#167; 8(d) contract modification without the Unions' consent, whereas the latter alternative allegation describes a &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change without bargaining with the Unions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

The Board below agreed that the clear and unmistakable waiver standard is appropriate to &#167; 8(a)(5) allegations. When the employer responds to the unilateral change allegation with a claim of contractual right to act unilaterally, however, the Board has not been consistent in its choice of standard, as explained above. In such cases, the Board is not entitled to the normal deference we owe it. <i>See Local 777, Democratic Union Org. Comm. v.

If so, the waiver standard is meaningless. See <i>id.</i> at 836-37. The unfair labor practice determination depends solely on the interpretation of the contract in place, and the appropriate standard for the Board to apply is the sound arguable basis standard. <i>See NCR Corp.,</i> 271 N.L.R.B. at 1213. The Board has only limited authority to interpret labor contracts and should not act as an arbitrator in contract interpretation disputes. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This framework is consistent with the NLRA and the <i>NCR Corp.</i> line of Board cases. It preserves for the courts and arbitrators the authority to interpret labor contracts, while permitting the Board to find an unfair labor practice when the employer has not fulfilled its duty to bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, this approach unifies the Board's disparate approaches to &#167; 8(d) contract modification claims and to &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change claims to which the employer has a legitimate contractual defense. Unions can and do allege both, as here, and the unfair labor practice determination in both rests on an interpretation of the contract. Yet, the Board traditionally applies vastly different standards to the two identical situations. Further, the Board has not clearly articulated a test for distinguishing between the two claims &#8212; and therefore the two applicable standards &#8212; when both are alleged. <i>C.f., e.g., St. Vincent Hosp.,</i> 320 N.L.R.B. 42 (1995) (affirming the ALJ's &#167; 8(d) determination and thus finding it unnecessary to reach the ALJ's alternative &#167; 8(a)(5) determination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a subject is covered by a CBA, such that the sound arguable basis standard is appropriate, we will consider whether the parties bargained over the mandatory subject at issue. The Board has determined that the identity of an ERISA plan sponsor is a mandatory subject of bargaining. <i>Carrier Corp.,</i> 319 N.L.R.B. 184, 196 (1995). It is apparent from the language of the CBAs that the parties bargained over the identity of the Plan sponsor, and thus that the CBAs cover the subject. All three CBAs explicitly identify the Plan, and the General Counsel admitted in his brief to the Board that \"the identity of the pension plan was a part of the collective bargaining agreement.\" Furthermore, although it is unclear whether the CBAs authorize a unilateral change in the identity of the Plan sponsor, such as occurred when the Company merged the Plan, these issues can only be resolved by interpreting the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the CBAs cover the subject matter of the present dispute, the sound arguable basis standard applies. Thus the Board did not err below by failing to apply the clear and unmistakable waiver standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

They argue that because the Company defended on the basis of a contractual provision, the Board should have required the Company to show a clear and unmistakable waiver of the Unions' right to bargain. The Unions make this argument by analogizing to certain &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases in which the employer defended on the basis of a management rights clause in a CBA. They argue that even if the sound arguable basis test does apply in &#167; 8(d) cases, \"where [a contractual defense] rests on an alleged waiver, the `sound arguable basis' analysis incorporates the `clear and unmistakable waiver' standard.\" We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, the Board has traditionally chosen to use different tests when ruling on &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change claims and &#167; 8(d) contract modification claims. Even when the Board determines that a &#167; 8(a)(5) unfair labor practice charge turns solely on the interpretation of a contract, it applies the sound arguable basis standard to the exclusion of the clear and unmistakable waiver standard. To our knowledge, the Board has never required the showing of a clear and unmistakable waiver of the union's right to bargain in order to establish a sound arguable basis for the employer's interpretation of a contract. As explained at length above, the two standards are analytically distinct. <i>NLRB v.

I do not join Part III.B or the associated discussions of the topic covered in that Part. I write to explain my different approach on those issues. Although the majority and I agree that this case is properly a &#167; 8(d) contract modification case, we disagree as to what that implies about any separate &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change claim. We agree that the &#167; 8(d) contract modification claim was properly handled by the Board.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The peculiar difficulty created by this case is that the Board stated in its opinion that this was a &#167; 8(d) case <i>because</i> the General Counsel had alleged only \"unlawful modification of the contracts within the meaning of Section 8(d).\" <i>Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3. I agree with the majority that it is not a fair reading of the record to say that the General Counsel did not also plead a &#167; 8(a)(5) failure to bargain claim.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Normally, if the Board has not directly addressed an issue, we would remand to get the Board's determination &#8212; here, its determination, assuming both claims were raised, on whether this was a &#167; 8(d) case or a &#167; 8(a)(5) case. I agree with the majority's implicit conclusion that this would be a fruitless exercise. This case is old, as well, and needs resolution.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The majority handles this problem by deciding on its own what the law is on &#167; 8(a)(5) claims to which an employer raises a contractual defense. It justifies its own review of the &#167; 8(a)(5) issue on the ground that the Board has been inconsistent, and so, it says, the court is entitled to engage in de novo review. Of course, the Board may, and often has, changed its positions-it is permitted to do so provided it explains itself. <i>See Nat'l Cable &amp; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-internet-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-internet-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I do not think that de novo review can be justified. I also do not think there has been material inconsistency on the part of the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Nor do I think there is any need to get into a discussion of &#167; 8(a)(5) cases at all, since this is not one, or into the dispute between the D.C. Circuit and the Board over the treatment of certain &#167; 8(a)(5) claims, much less take any position on the matter.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In my opinion, while the Board was wrong to say that no &#167; 8(a)(5) claim had ever been pled (if that is in fact what the Board meant), that is immaterial. The Board is not bound by the theories pled by the General Counsel. In explaining at some length the categorical differences between &#167; 8(d) contract modification cases and &#167; 8(a)(5) unilateral change cases, the Board gave a sufficient justification for why this case is <i>properly</i> characterized <i>only</i> as a &#167; 8(d) case. <i>See Bath Iron Works Corp.,</i> 345 N.L.R.B. No. 33, at 3. We are required under <i>Chevron</i> to give deference to the policy choices inherent in that decision by the Board. <i>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.

The ALJ then analyzed the claim as a &#167; 8(d) contract modification claim (without applying the sound arguable basis test), <i>id.</i> at 1218-19, and, finding a violation, awarded remedies applicable to contract modification claims, <i>id.</i> at 1219. The Board reversed the ALJ's decision on the merits, applying the sound arguable basis test and concluding that it \"[did] not find that the [employer] failed to comply with Section 8(d).\" <i>Id.</i> at 1213. The Board made no mention of the ALJ's determination that a &#167; 8(d) contract modification claim was the appropriate claim on the facts of the case, and it affirmed the ALJ's rulings, findings, and conclusions that were consistent with its decision. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
