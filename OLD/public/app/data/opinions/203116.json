Pandeli and Dimitrulla Jorgji,\n\nwho are husband and wife, and their son Angjello Jorgji are\n\ncitizens of Albania.       All entered the United States on tourist\n\nvisas (Pandeli in 2000 and Dimitrulla and Angjello in 2001) which\n\nthey then overstayed.          Pandeli and Dimitrulla each applied for\n\nasylum--Dimitrulla in March 2002 and Pandeli in November 2002--and\n\neach   claimed   the   other    spouse   and   their   son   as   derivatively\n\nentitled to asylum.       8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A) (2000); 8 C.F.R.\n\n208.3(a) (2007).\n\n           In June 2002 the responsible agency--then the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (\"INS\")--began removal proceedings, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).        Thereafter, successive hearings were held\n\nat which the Jorgjis conceded removability, as they had overstayed\n\ntheir visas, but requested asylum on the ground that they had\n\npreviously suffered persecution in Albania and reasonably feared\n\npersecution should they return.\n\n           In hearings before an Immigration Judge, the Jorgjis, of\n\nGreek ethnicity and Christian Orthodox religion, sought to show\n\nthat both Dimitrulla's and Pandeli's families were persecuted in\n\nthe past for their beliefs--Pandeli's family members largely for\n\ntheir political beliefs and Dimitrulla's mainly for their faith.\n\nAlso Dimitrulla and Pandeli each said that they observed the\n\nkilling of villagers who attempted to cross the border from Albania\n\ninto Greece.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          On August 22, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the\n\nJorgjis' asylum applications, finding that the applications were\n\nuntimely under a statutory requirement that asylum applications be\n\nfiled within one year of the applicant's entry into the United\n\nStates.   8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(2)(A).\n\nAlternatively, the IJ found that Dimitrulla and Pandeli had not\n\nshown a well-founded fear of persecution as required by the statute\n\nand regulations.    8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).\n\nThe IJ also denied the Jorgjis' requests for withholding of removal\n\nand protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n          The Jorgjis sought review before the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\"), which, on March 23, 2007, issued a\n\nbrief affirmance.   The BIA said that even if the Jorgjis were found\n\nto have timely filed their applications for asylum, their childhood\n\nexperiences and the persecution of their parents and grandparents\n\n\"are too remote in time to constitute persecution.\"     The BIA did\n\nnot further consider the Jorgjis' withholding of removal and CAT\n\nclaims, which were not properly raised before it.\n\n          On review in this court, the Jorgjis argue that at least\n\nDimitrulla's application was timely;1 they further claim that the\n\n\n\n     1\n      Pandeli's application was filed in November 2002, well over\na year after his arrival. He blames the delay on the dishonesty or\nincompetence of his then-counsel but he did not follow the\nprocedure mandated by the regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5)(iii),\nfor making such claims and has relied in this court on his wife's\napplication.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fImmigration Judge and the Board erred in their assessment of the\n\nmerits of her persecution claim (and, in the case of the IJ, in the\n\nconduct   of   the    proceeding).      They   have   not    pursued     their\n\nwithholding and torture convention claims.            We begin with the\n\ntimeliness issue and then turn to the merits and due process\n\nissues.\n\n           Under the Immigration and Nationality Act an alien must\n\nshow by clear and convincing evidence that the asylum application\n\nwas filed with the agency within one year of arriving in the United\n\nStates, or that the applicant qualifies for an exception to the\n\none-year deadline.       8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).          The BIA has the\n\nauthority to make regulations governing asylum applications.                 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)(B).\n\n           Under the pertinent regulations (set forth in an addendum\n\nto this decision), the one-year period is calculated from the date\n\nof the alien's arrival in the United States; but \"[w]hen the last\n\nday of the period so computed falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal\n\nholiday, the period shall run until the end of the next day that is\n\nnot   a   Saturday,    Sunday,   or    legal   holiday.\"       8   C.F.R.    §\n\n208.4(a)(2)(ii).      Dimitrulla entered the United States on March 4,\n\n2001; she mailed her application on Monday, March 4, 2002, and the\n\ngovernment received it on March 6, 2002.\n\n           Because     the   agency     must   ordinarily      receive      the\n\napplication within the one-year period, Dimitrulla's application\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmight appear to be out of time.           But when the application has not\n\nbeen received \"within 1 year from the applicant's date of entry .\n\n. . but the applicant provides clear and convincing documentary\n\nevidence of mailing the application within the 1-year period, the\n\nmailing date shall be considered the filing date.\"                   8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.4(a)(2)(ii).         Dimitrulla's application would thus be timely if\n\nthe two regulations can both be applied to a mailed application.\n\n             Although the INS attorney did not dispute the timeliness\n\nof Dimitrulla's application during the administrative hearing, the\n\nIJ concluded that under the regulations, Dimitrulla had to file her\n\napplication \"within one year\"; that the filing period ran until\n\nSunday, March 3, 2002, which is one year after entry; and that\n\nDimitrulla had failed to mail her application within the one-year\n\nperiod.     The Jorgjis say that this reading is at odds with the\n\nlanguage     of    the    regulations   excluding    Saturdays,     Sundays     and\n\nholidays.2\n\n             Remarkably,      the    government   argues   that     we   have   no\n\nauthority     to    review    this   timeliness     determination    \"because,\"\n\naccording     to    the    government's    brief,    \"it   rests    on   factual\n\nfindings.\"        Under current law, review of factual findings as to\n\n\n     2\n      The Jorgjis also argue that since the INS attorney did not\ndispute timeliness, the IJ's finding to the contrary is a violation\nof due process rights. But the IJ is not bound by the parties'\ntimeliness determination; the BIA's regulations authorize only\nasylum officers, immigration judges, or the BIA itself to make\ndeterminations regarding the timeliness of an application or\nwhether the pertinent exceptions apply. 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(1).\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftimeliness    is   barred       but   review       of    legal   and       constitutional\n\nquestions is not, as the government brief admits.                             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(3)    (bar   on   review       of    findings);        id.     §   1252(a)(2)(D)\n\n(exception for constitutional and legal issues); see also Pan v.\n\nGonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Thus, if there were a dispute about when in fact the\n\napplications were mailed or received, the IJ decision would be\n\nconclusive.    But here the facts are undisputed; and whether the\n\napplication was timely filed depends solely on how the regulations\n\nare   read--obviously       a    question         of    law.     The   government,    an\n\ninstitutional litigant with a stake in consistent administration of\n\nthe statute, ought to have more sense than to make such an\n\nargument.\n\n            The legal issue is perhaps a difficult one.                       It is quite\n\npossible that the drafters of the two provisions did not think\n\nabout whether they apply cumulatively in a situation like this one.\n\nAnd, if they did think about it, they might have preferred that\n\nonly one or the other apply, depending on whether the application\n\nwas filed in person or by mail.                   The exclusion of weekends and\n\nholidays makes good sense as to applications that are filed by hand\n\nbecause most government offices are closed on those days; but\n\nnothing prevents anyone from putting a letter in a mail box on a\n\nweekend or holiday.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f            Conversely, the mailing exception treats an application\n\nas filed when mailed where the applicant provides \"evidence of\n\nmailing   the      application     within     the    1-year     period\"     and--read\n\nindependently of the weekend and holiday provision--Dimitrulla\n\nplainly did not mail the application within one year of her arrival\n\nbut instead mailed it on the following day.                     But the regulation\n\nexcluding weekends and holidays does not say that it operates only\n\nas to applications filed by hand and on a literal reading appears\n\nto apply to all applications.\n\n            These regulations are addressed to the public--indeed,\n\nasylum seekers who may lack counsel when filing--and the literal\n\nlanguage supports Dimitrulla's reading, even if a sophisticated\n\nreading based on policy might support another outcome.                         Further,\n\nthere is no agency precedent for the reading offered by the\n\ngovernment's brief and precious little argument in the brief beyond\n\nassertion.      Indeed, the possible policy argument in favor of the\n\ngovernment is not made in the government brief.\n\n            Ordinarily, the agency receives deference in construing\n\nits own regulations.        Sidell v. Comm'r, 225 F.3d 103, 109 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). But whether we have an agency interpretation, as opposed to\n\na   litigating     position   by     counsel,       is   open   to    doubt:    the   IJ\n\naddressed    the    issue   in   a   few    sentences      with      no   citation    to\n\nprecedent, and the Board bypassed the issue and went directly to\n\nthe merits.     Under these circumstances, we will follow the literal\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\flanguage, adding that the government would be well advised formally\n\nto clarify the regulation language if it prefers its counsel's\n\nposition to govern in the future.\n\n            We turn now to the merits.       To be entitled to asylum, the\n\nJorgjis had to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\non   one   or   more   of   five   enumerated   grounds   (race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, and political\n\nopinion).       8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b); see\n\nalso Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005).               A\n\nshowing of past persecution gives rise to a presumption of future\n\npersecution unless rebutted. 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); see also\n\nZarouite v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Remarkably, the government's brief addresses with care\n\nthe claim that the hearing was procedurally unfair but scarcely\n\naddresses at all the substance of the persecution claim beyond\n\nreciting (in the statement of facts) the IJ's own analysis.            This\n\nmay be partly explained, but not excused, by the Jorgjis' brief,\n\nwhich only modestly discusses the merits of the persecution issue,\n\nconcentrating primarily on a claim of alleged unfairness in the\n\nIJ's conduct of the hearings.\n\n            Nevertheless, the IJ's analysis is quite detailed; the\n\nBoard's statement is succinct but coherent; and it is up to the\n\napplicants to show error.          Review of legal rulings is de novo but\n\nis deferential as to findings of fact and the determination as to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwhether the facts support a claim of persecution.                  Segran v.\n\nMukasey,         F.3d       , 2007 WL 4171217, at *2 (1st Cir. 2007);\n\nToloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 159 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nGiven the standard of review, we think the IJ and Board must be\n\nsustained as to the persecution rulings, reserving for later\n\ndiscussion the question of procedural fairness.\n\n            \"To qualify as persecution, a person's experience must\n\nrise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\"\n\nNelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).               Further, the\n\nstate    must   be   the   source   of   or   at   least   acquiesce   in   the\n\npersecution; specifically, the persecution must either be the\n\ndirect result of government action or government-supported action,\n\nor there must be some showing that the persecution is due to the\n\ngovernment's unwillingness or inability to control the conduct of\n\nprivate actors.       Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     The persecution need not be personal to the asylum seeker\n\nif it reasonably creates a well-founded fear of persecution in that\n\nperson.3\n\n            Albania, which shares a border in its southeast with\n\nGreece, was from 1944 to around 1990 a repressive one-party state,\n\n\n\n     3\n      See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir. 1992)\n(citing Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, 937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.\n1991) (violence against a petitioner's family may establish a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution if a close link to the\npetitioner is shown)); see also Zhang v. Ashcroft, 388 F.3d 713,\n718 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fharshly Stalinist in ideology.             However, following uprisings,\n\nAlbania has since the early '90s been governed through democratic\n\nelections, despite periods of economic and political turmoil.               The\n\ncountry is quite poor with much emigration; it is predominantly\n\nMuslim but a sizable portion of the population are Roman Catholic\n\nor members of the Albanian Orthodox Church.4\n\n              Dimitrulla's fear of persecution was based primarily on\n\ntwo different sets of incidents.       One was the imprisonment of her\n\nhusband's father and grandfather for their religious and political\n\nopinions, primarily their support for the Orthodox Church.            The IJ\n\nsaid that Dimitrulla's testimony was generally credible as to\n\nspecific facts but pointed out that such persecution had occurred\n\nover thirty-five years ago and that Dimitrulla \"has failed to show\n\na   pattern    of   persecution   closely    tied   to   herself   simply   by\n\ntestifying that her future husband's father and grandfather were\n\nimprisoned for political involvement before she was even born.\"\n\n              In addition to testifying to the difficult \"situation and\n\nthe state of affairs\" during her childhood in Albania, Dimitrulla\n\ndescribed instances of religious discrimination: the churches in\n\n\n\n      4\n      These facts are set forth in the 2004 country report prepared\nby the State Department and contained in the record. Such reports\nare the common source of background information in asylum\nproceedings. See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 36\n(1st Cir. 2005) (\"The State Department has widely acknowledged\nexpertise in discerning the conditions that prevail in foreign\nlands. Thus, State Department reports are generally probative of\ncountry conditions.\" (internal citation omitted)).\n\n                                    -10-\n\fher town were destroyed by members of the Communist party, and her\n\nfamily was forced to conduct baptisms and other religious practices\n\nsecretly in their homes.      But the Stalinist regime, which was\n\nprofessedly hostile to religion and a self-proclaimed \"atheist\n\nstate\" has not been in power for over fifteen years.\n\n          Dimitrulla   also    testified   that   on   three   separate\n\noccasions in her childhood she had seen people who were killed for\n\nattempting the cross the Albanian border and dragged around the\n\nvillage as a warning to others who might flee.    But, the IJ pointed\n\nout, these incidents had occurred over twenty years ago (when the\n\nStalinist regime was still in power); and in 1991 freedom of travel\n\nwas restored and \"[Dimitrulla] and her husband testified that they\n\nhave safely and legally crossed the Albanian-Greek border numerous\n\ntimes.\"\n\n          Pandeli, confirming the persecution of his father and\n\ngrandfather, also said that he had in 1985 witnessed the killing of\n\na youth who tried to cross the border and that he was twice robbed\n\nand attacked while crossing the border in 1994 and 1995 by Muslims\n\nwho harassed him because he was Orthodox Christian.        The country\n\nreport agrees that crime remains a serious problem in Albania, but\n\nit also says that religious toleration is widespread, that ethnic\n\nGreeks serve in the government, and that the Christian minority\n\nfreely practice their faith.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            In her application for asylum, Dimitrulla said that\n\nAlbania is dangerous for Greek women because their homes are raided\n\nand they are raped; but at the hearing she did not testify at all\n\nabout any such raids nor describe any personal threats to herself.\n\nFurther, the IJ noted, she and her husband left and returned to\n\nAlbania on a number of occasions \"and they did not offer any\n\nevidence or testimony indicating that their family members [on both\n\nsides who still reside in Albania] are currently experiencing harm\n\nor persecution in Albania.\"\n\n            We accept that the murders at border crossings that\n\nDimitrulla    witnessed       in   her   youth       may    well       have    caused   her\n\npermanent trauma and she may well have genuine fears about living\n\nin Albania.    But it would be difficult to sustain on this record a\n\nfinding that Dimitrulla has an objectively reasonable fear of\n\nfuture   persecution     as    specified        by   the        statute,      8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A), and in any event no basis exists for finding a lack\n\nof substantial evidence to support the IJ's decision that no such\n\nreasonable fear has been shown.\n\n            The petitioners' brief scarcely attempts to counter the\n\nIJ's explanations for discounting their claims that the past\n\nincidents     show   a   well-grounded          fear       of    future       persecution.\n\nInstead, their brief, after reciting some of the testimony, says\n\ntersely that the IJ failed to consider cumulatively \"all the\n\npersecution     suffered      and    further         failed       to     consider       that\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\f[Dimitrulla] was denied the right to practice her religion.\"\n\nNeither of these charges appears to be well founded.\n\n           All of the main incidents specifically described by\n\npetitioners lay well in the past and the regime that fostered them\n\nhas long since been supplanted.      So, insofar as future persecution\n\nhad to be reasonably feared, the incidents provided no support,\n\nwhether taken singly or together.      Nor did the IJ ignore the claims\n\nthat the regime had been hostile to religion; the problem was that\n\nthere was no persecution by the present regime, no claims that\n\nDimitrulla would now be prevented from worshiping freely, and a\n\ncountry   report   describing   a    condition   of   general   religious\n\ntoleration.\n\n           Finally, the Jorgjis complain that the IJ compromised the\n\nfairness of the hearing and violated their due process rights by\n\noperating as a \"hostile adversary\" by interrupting testimony and\n\ndirecting lines of inquiry from the attorneys.        This, the Jorgjis\n\nsay, reflected an impermissible bias on the part of the IJ and\n\nprevented them from developing a complete and detailed evidentiary\n\nrecord.   We review de novo the question of whether an IJ's conduct\n\nviolated a party's due process rights.       Ibe v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d\n\n142, 144 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           After reading the hearing transcripts, we conclude that\n\nno infirmity exists.     An immigration judge, like all judicial\n\nofficers, possesses broad but not unfettered discretion over the\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fconduct of evidentiary proceedings.          See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999); 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(1) (authorizing\n\nthe IJ to \"receive evidence, interrogate, examine, and cross-\n\nexamine the alien or witnesses\").           The IJ in this case appears to\n\nhave permissibly used that discretion and to have provided the\n\nJorgjis with a sufficient opportunity to present their case.             In\n\nfact, she credited Dimitrulla's specific testimony but disagreed\n\nlargely as to whether the incidents met the standards for a well-\n\ngrounded fear of future persecution.\n\n             To be sure, the IJ at times interrupted the petitioners'\n\ntestimony and their counsel's questioning, but seemingly did so to\n\nmove   the    case   along   by   preventing    repetitive   testimony   and\n\nencouraging the Jorgjis' counsel to focus on especially important\n\nissues.      There is no indication of unreasonable restrictions or a\n\nfailure to allow witnesses to present their full story. Indeed, an\n\nIJ who plays an active role in keeping the focus of the evidentiary\n\nhearing sharp \"is to be commended, not condemned.\"           Aguilar-Solis,\n\n168 F.3d at 569.\n\n             The Jorgjis' petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f                               ADDENDUM\n\n\n\n          The pertinent regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(2), reads\n\nas follows:\n\n          One-year filing deadline.       (i) For purposes of section\n\n208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, an applicant has the burden of proving:\n\n          (A)     By   clear   and   convincing   evidence   that   the\n\napplication has been filed within 1 year of the date of the alien's\n\narrival in the United States, or\n\n          (B)    To the satisfaction of the asylum officer, the\n\nimmigration judge, or the Board that he or she qualifies for an\n\nexception to the 1-year deadline.\n\n          (ii) The 1-year period shall be calculated from the date\n\nof the alien's last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997,\n\nwhichever is later.    When the last day of the period so computed\n\nfalls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period shall run\n\nuntil the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or\n\nlegal holiday.    For the purpose of making determinations under\n\nsection 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act only, and application is considered\n\nto have been filed on the date it is received by the Service,\n\npursuant to § 103.2(a)(7) of this chapter.     In a case in which the\n\napplication has not been received by the Service within 1 year from\n\nthe applicant's date of entry into the United States, but the\n\napplicant provides clear and convincing documentary evidence of\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fmailing the application within the 1-year period, the mailing date\n\nshall   be   considered    the   filing   date.     For   cases    before   the\n\nImmigration Court in accordance with § 3.13 of this chapter, the\n\napplication is considered to have been filed on the date it is\n\nreceived by the Immigration Court.           For cases before the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, the application is considered to have been\n\nfiled on the date it is received by the Board.            In the case of an\n\napplication that appears to have been filed more than a year after\n\nthe applicant arrived in the United States, the asylum officer, the\n\nimmigration    judge,     or   the   Board   will   determine     whether   the\n\napplicant qualifies for an exception to the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

Pandeli and Dimitrulla Jorgji,\n\nwho are husband and wife, and their son Angjello Jorgji are\n\ncitizens of Albania.       All entered the United States on tourist\n\nvisas (Pandeli in 2000 and Dimitrulla and Angjello in 2001) which\n\nthey then overstayed.          Pandeli and Dimitrulla each applied for\n\nasylum--Dimitrulla in March 2002 and Pandeli in November 2002--and\n\neach   claimed   the   other    spouse   and   their   son   as   derivatively\n\nentitled to asylum.       8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A) (2000); 8 C.F.R.\n\n208.3(a) (2007).\n\n           In June 2002 the responsible agency--then the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service (\"INS\")--began removal proceedings, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).        Thereafter, successive hearings were held\n\nat which the Jorgjis conceded removability, as they had overstayed\n\ntheir visas, but requested asylum on the ground that they had\n\npreviously suffered persecution in Albania and reasonably feared\n\npersecution should they return.\n\n           In hearings before an Immigration Judge, the Jorgjis, of\n\nGreek ethnicity and Christian Orthodox religion, sought to show\n\nthat both Dimitrulla's and Pandeli's families were persecuted in\n\nthe past for their beliefs--Pandeli's family members largely for\n\ntheir political beliefs and Dimitrulla's mainly for their faith.\n\nAlso Dimitrulla and Pandeli each said that they observed the\n\nkilling of villagers who attempted to cross the border from Albania\n\ninto Greece.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          On August 22, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the\n\nJorgjis' asylum applications, finding that the applications were\n\nuntimely under a statutory requirement that asylum applications be\n\nfiled within one year of the applicant's entry into the United\n\nStates.   8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(2)(A).\n\nAlternatively, the IJ found that Dimitrulla and Pandeli had not\n\nshown a well-founded fear of persecution as required by the statute\n\nand regulations.    8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b).\n\nThe IJ also denied the Jorgjis' requests for withholding of removal\n\nand protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n          The Jorgjis sought review before the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\"), which, on March 23, 2007, issued a\n\nbrief affirmance.   The BIA said that even if the Jorgjis were found\n\nto have timely filed their applications for asylum, their childhood\n\nexperiences and the persecution of their parents and grandparents\n\n\"are too remote in time to constitute persecution.\"     The BIA did\n\nnot further consider the Jorgjis' withholding of removal and CAT\n\nclaims, which were not properly raised before it.\n\n          On review in this court, the Jorgjis argue that at least\n\nDimitrulla's application was timely;1 they further claim that the\n\n\n\n     1\n      Pandeli's application was filed in November 2002, well over\na year after his arrival. He blames the delay on the dishonesty or\nincompetence of his then-counsel but he did not follow the\nprocedure mandated by the regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5)(iii),\nfor making such claims and has relied in this court on his wife's\napplication.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fImmigration Judge and the Board erred in their assessment of the\n\nmerits of her persecution claim (and, in the case of the IJ, in the\n\nconduct   of   the    proceeding).      They   have   not    pursued     their\n\nwithholding and torture convention claims.            We begin with the\n\ntimeliness issue and then turn to the merits and due process\n\nissues.\n\n           Under the Immigration and Nationality Act an alien must\n\nshow by clear and convincing evidence that the asylum application\n\nwas filed with the agency within one year of arriving in the United\n\nStates, or that the applicant qualifies for an exception to the\n\none-year deadline.       8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).          The BIA has the\n\nauthority to make regulations governing asylum applications.                 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)(B).\n\n           Under the pertinent regulations (set forth in an addendum\n\nto this decision), the one-year period is calculated from the date\n\nof the alien's arrival in the United States; but \"[w]hen the last\n\nday of the period so computed falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal\n\nholiday, the period shall run until the end of the next day that is\n\nnot   a   Saturday,    Sunday,   or    legal   holiday.\"       8   C.F.R.    §\n\n208.4(a)(2)(ii).      Dimitrulla entered the United States on March 4,\n\n2001; she mailed her application on Monday, March 4, 2002, and the\n\ngovernment received it on March 6, 2002.\n\n           Because     the   agency     must   ordinarily      receive      the\n\napplication within the one-year period, Dimitrulla's application\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmight appear to be out of time.           But when the application has not\n\nbeen received \"within 1 year from the applicant's date of entry .\n\n. . but the applicant provides clear and convincing documentary\n\nevidence of mailing the application within the 1-year period, the\n\nmailing date shall be considered the filing date.\"                   8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.4(a)(2)(ii).         Dimitrulla's application would thus be timely if\n\nthe two regulations can both be applied to a mailed application.\n\n             Although the INS attorney did not dispute the timeliness\n\nof Dimitrulla's application during the administrative hearing, the\n\nIJ concluded that under the regulations, Dimitrulla had to file her\n\napplication \"within one year\"; that the filing period ran until\n\nSunday, March 3, 2002, which is one year after entry; and that\n\nDimitrulla had failed to mail her application within the one-year\n\nperiod.     The Jorgjis say that this reading is at odds with the\n\nlanguage     of    the    regulations   excluding    Saturdays,     Sundays     and\n\nholidays.2\n\n             Remarkably,      the    government   argues   that     we   have   no\n\nauthority     to    review    this   timeliness     determination    \"because,\"\n\naccording     to    the    government's    brief,    \"it   rests    on   factual\n\nfindings.\"        Under current law, review of factual findings as to\n\n\n     2\n      The Jorgjis also argue that since the INS attorney did not\ndispute timeliness, the IJ's finding to the contrary is a violation\nof due process rights. But the IJ is not bound by the parties'\ntimeliness determination; the BIA's regulations authorize only\nasylum officers, immigration judges, or the BIA itself to make\ndeterminations regarding the timeliness of an application or\nwhether the pertinent exceptions apply. 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(1).\n\n                                        -5-\n\ftimeliness    is   barred       but   review       of    legal   and       constitutional\n\nquestions is not, as the government brief admits.                             8 U.S.C. §\n\n1158(a)(3)    (bar   on   review       of    findings);        id.     §   1252(a)(2)(D)\n\n(exception for constitutional and legal issues); see also Pan v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            Thus, if there were a dispute about when in fact the\n\napplications were mailed or received, the IJ decision would be\n\nconclusive.    But here the facts are undisputed; and whether the\n\napplication was timely filed depends solely on how the regulations\n\nare   read--obviously       a    question         of    law.     The   government,    an\n\ninstitutional litigant with a stake in consistent administration of\n\nthe statute, ought to have more sense than to make such an\n\nargument.\n\n            The legal issue is perhaps a difficult one.                       It is quite\n\npossible that the drafters of the two provisions did not think\n\nabout whether they apply cumulatively in a situation like this one.\n\nAnd, if they did think about it, they might have preferred that\n\nonly one or the other apply, depending on whether the application\n\nwas filed in person or by mail.                   The exclusion of weekends and\n\nholidays makes good sense as to applications that are filed by hand\n\nbecause most government offices are closed on those days; but\n\nnothing prevents anyone from putting a letter in a mail box on a\n\nweekend or holiday.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f            Conversely, the mailing exception treats an application\n\nas filed when mailed where the applicant provides \"evidence of\n\nmailing   the      application     within     the    1-year     period\"     and--read\n\nindependently of the weekend and holiday provision--Dimitrulla\n\nplainly did not mail the application within one year of her arrival\n\nbut instead mailed it on the following day.                     But the regulation\n\nexcluding weekends and holidays does not say that it operates only\n\nas to applications filed by hand and on a literal reading appears\n\nto apply to all applications.\n\n            These regulations are addressed to the public--indeed,\n\nasylum seekers who may lack counsel when filing--and the literal\n\nlanguage supports Dimitrulla's reading, even if a sophisticated\n\nreading based on policy might support another outcome.                         Further,\n\nthere is no agency precedent for the reading offered by the\n\ngovernment's brief and precious little argument in the brief beyond\n\nassertion.      Indeed, the possible policy argument in favor of the\n\ngovernment is not made in the government brief.\n\n            Ordinarily, the agency receives deference in construing\n\nits own regulations.

But whether we have an agency interpretation, as opposed to\n\na   litigating     position   by     counsel,       is   open   to    doubt:    the   IJ\n\naddressed    the    issue   in   a   few    sentences      with      no   citation    to\n\nprecedent, and the Board bypassed the issue and went directly to\n\nthe merits.     Under these circumstances, we will follow the literal\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\flanguage, adding that the government would be well advised formally\n\nto clarify the regulation language if it prefers its counsel's\n\nposition to govern in the future.\n\n            We turn now to the merits.       To be entitled to asylum, the\n\nJorgjis had to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\non   one   or   more   of   five   enumerated   grounds   (race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, and political\n\nopinion).       8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b); see\n\nalso Bocova v.

This\n\nmay be partly explained, but not excused, by the Jorgjis' brief,\n\nwhich only modestly discusses the merits of the persecution issue,\n\nconcentrating primarily on a claim of alleged unfairness in the\n\nIJ's conduct of the hearings.\n\n            Nevertheless, the IJ's analysis is quite detailed; the\n\nBoard's statement is succinct but coherent; and it is up to the\n\napplicants to show error.

One was the imprisonment of her\n\nhusband's father and grandfather for their religious and political\n\nopinions, primarily their support for the Orthodox Church.            The IJ\n\nsaid that Dimitrulla's testimony was generally credible as to\n\nspecific facts but pointed out that such persecution had occurred\n\nover thirty-five years ago and that Dimitrulla \"has failed to show\n\na   pattern    of   persecution   closely    tied   to   herself   simply   by\n\ntestifying that her future husband's father and grandfather were\n\nimprisoned for political involvement before she was even born.\"\n\n              In addition to testifying to the difficult \"situation and\n\nthe state of affairs\" during her childhood in Albania, Dimitrulla\n\ndescribed instances of religious discrimination: the churches in\n\n\n\n      4\n      These facts are set forth in the 2004 country report prepared\nby the State Department and contained in the record.

But the Stalinist regime, which was\n\nprofessedly hostile to religion and a self-proclaimed \"atheist\n\nstate\" has not been in power for over fifteen years.\n\n          Dimitrulla   also    testified   that   on   three   separate\n\noccasions in her childhood she had seen people who were killed for\n\nattempting the cross the Albanian border and dragged around the\n\nvillage as a warning to others who might flee.    But, the IJ pointed\n\nout, these incidents had occurred over twenty years ago (when the\n\nStalinist regime was still in power); and in 1991 freedom of travel\n\nwas restored and \"[Dimitrulla] and her husband testified that they\n\nhave safely and legally crossed the Albanian-Greek border numerous\n\ntimes.\"\n\n          Pandeli, confirming the persecution of his father and\n\ngrandfather, also said that he had in 1985 witnessed the killing of\n\na youth who tried to cross the border and that he was twice robbed\n\nand attacked while crossing the border in 1994 and 1995 by Muslims\n\nwho harassed him because he was Orthodox Christian.        The country\n\nreport agrees that crime remains a serious problem in Albania, but\n\nit also says that religious toleration is widespread, that ethnic\n\nGreeks serve in the government, and that the Christian minority\n\nfreely practice their faith.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            In her application for asylum, Dimitrulla said that\n\nAlbania is dangerous for Greek women because their homes are raided\n\nand they are raped; but at the hearing she did not testify at all\n\nabout any such raids nor describe any personal threats to herself.\n\nFurther, the IJ noted, she and her husband left and returned to\n\nAlbania on a number of occasions \"and they did not offer any\n\nevidence or testimony indicating that their family members [on both\n\nsides who still reside in Albania] are currently experiencing harm\n\nor persecution in Albania.\"\n\n            We accept that the murders at border crossings that\n\nDimitrulla    witnessed       in   her   youth       may    well       have    caused   her\n\npermanent trauma and she may well have genuine fears about living\n\nin Albania.    But it would be difficult to sustain on this record a\n\nfinding that Dimitrulla has an objectively reasonable fear of\n\nfuture   persecution     as    specified        by   the        statute,      8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A), and in any event no basis exists for finding a lack\n\nof substantial evidence to support the IJ's decision that no such\n\nreasonable fear has been shown.\n\n            The petitioners' brief scarcely attempts to counter the\n\nIJ's explanations for discounting their claims that the past\n\nincidents     show   a   well-grounded          fear       of    future       persecution.\n\nInstead, their brief, after reciting some of the testimony, says\n\ntersely that the IJ failed to consider cumulatively \"all the\n\npersecution     suffered      and    further         failed       to     consider       that\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\f[Dimitrulla] was denied the right to practice her religion.\"\n\nNeither of these charges appears to be well founded.\n\n           All of the main incidents specifically described by\n\npetitioners lay well in the past and the regime that fostered them\n\nhas long since been supplanted.      So, insofar as future persecution\n\nhad to be reasonably feared, the incidents provided no support,\n\nwhether taken singly or together.      Nor did the IJ ignore the claims\n\nthat the regime had been hostile to religion; the problem was that\n\nthere was no persecution by the present regime, no claims that\n\nDimitrulla would now be prevented from worshiping freely, and a\n\ncountry   report   describing   a    condition   of   general   religious\n\ntoleration.\n\n           Finally, the Jorgjis complain that the IJ compromised the\n\nfairness of the hearing and violated their due process rights by\n\noperating as a \"hostile adversary\" by interrupting testimony and\n\ndirecting lines of inquiry from the attorneys.        This, the Jorgjis\n\nsay, reflected an impermissible bias on the part of the IJ and\n\nprevented them from developing a complete and detailed evidentiary\n\nrecord.   We review de novo the question of whether an IJ's conduct\n\nviolated a party's due process rights.       Ibe v.

An immigration judge, like all judicial\n\nofficers, possesses broad but not unfettered discretion over the\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fconduct of evidentiary proceedings.

The IJ in this case appears to\n\nhave permissibly used that discretion and to have provided the\n\nJorgjis with a sufficient opportunity to present their case.             In\n\nfact, she credited Dimitrulla's specific testimony but disagreed\n\nlargely as to whether the incidents met the standards for a well-\n\ngrounded fear of future persecution.\n\n             To be sure, the IJ at times interrupted the petitioners'\n\ntestimony and their counsel's questioning, but seemingly did so to\n\nmove   the    case   along   by   preventing    repetitive   testimony   and\n\nencouraging the Jorgjis' counsel to focus on especially important\n\nissues.

(i) For purposes of section\n\n208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, an applicant has the burden of proving:\n\n          (A)     By   clear   and   convincing   evidence   that   the\n\napplication has been filed within 1 year of the date of the alien's\n\narrival in the United States, or\n\n          (B)    To the satisfaction of the asylum officer, the\n\nimmigration judge, or the Board that he or she qualifies for an\n\nexception to the 1-year deadline.\n\n          (ii) The 1-year period shall be calculated from the date\n\nof the alien's last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997,\n\nwhichever is later.    When the last day of the period so computed\n\nfalls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period shall run\n\nuntil the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or\n\nlegal holiday.    For the purpose of making determinations under\n\nsection 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act only, and application is considered\n\nto have been filed on the date it is received by the Service,\n\npursuant to § 103.2(a)(7) of this chapter.     In a case in which the\n\napplication has not been received by the Service within 1 year from\n\nthe applicant's date of entry into the United States, but the\n\napplicant provides clear and convincing documentary evidence of\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fmailing the application within the 1-year period, the mailing date\n\nshall   be   considered    the   filing   date.     For   cases    before   the\n\nImmigration Court in accordance with § 3.13 of this chapter, the\n\napplication is considered to have been filed on the date it is\n\nreceived by the Immigration Court.           For cases before the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals, the application is considered to have been\n\nfiled on the date it is received by the Board.            In the case of an\n\napplication that appears to have been filed more than a year after\n\nthe applicant arrived in the United States, the asylum officer, the\n\nimmigration    judge,     or   the   Board   will   determine     whether   the\n\napplicant qualifies for an exception to the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f</pre>",
