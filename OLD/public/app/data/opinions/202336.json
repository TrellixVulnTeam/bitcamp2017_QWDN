RUMIERZ,\n\n                           Petitioner,\n\n                                v.\n\n   ALBERTO R.

Minick, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nU.S. Department of Justice, with whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, and Linda S. Werney, Assistant Director, were on\nbrief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          August 3, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.          The BIA held here that an alien,\n\nwho is already under a final order of removal for committing crimes\n\nof moral turpitude, bears the burden of proving that he has met the\n\nstandards under In re Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621 (BIA 2003),\n\nfor vacating an order of removal presented in a belated motion and\n\npremised    on   the    post-final-order-of-removal       vacating    of   the\n\nunderlying state court conviction.            In the circumstances of this\n\ncase, the BIA held that the alien had not met that burden.            Because\n\nwe cannot say that either the facts before it or the law compelled\n\nthe BIA to reach the opposite result, we affirm the BIA and deny\n\nthe petition for review.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            Antoni A. Rumierz, a Polish citizen who entered this\n\ncountry as an immigrant in 1980, was ordered removed from the\n\nUnited States by the BIA on August 18, 2000, on the basis that he\n\nhad been convicted twice in state courts of receiving stolen\n\nproperty,    which     are   crimes   of    moral   turpitude   for   federal\n\nimmigration purposes.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).\n\n            Before that, in 1999, the BIA had found Rumierz removable\n\non the same basis, but had remanded to the Immigration Judge (IJ)\n\nto determine whether Rumierz nonetheless should be granted a waiver\n\nof relief under former § 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994) (repealed 1996).                 The IJ\n\ndenied § 212(c) relief as a matter of discretion on December 10,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f1999; this decision was affirmed in the BIA's August 2000 order.\n\nDeportation proceedings had initially commenced in March 1994.\n\n           In its August 2000 order, the BIA expressly found that\n\nthe government had met its burden to show that the two prior\n\nconvictions were sufficient to establish Rumierz's deportability;\n\nit also noted that the two convictions had not been vacated.   There\n\nis no doubt the criminal convictions, one of which was a January\n\n1994 Vermont conviction, were qualifying crimes of moral turpitude.\n\nRumierz did not petition for review of the BIA's August 2000 order,\n\nnor did he file a motion with the BIA to reopen.\n\n           In February 2001, Rumierz filed a pro se writ of habeas\n\ncorpus, which was heard in the U.S. District Court for the District\n\nof New Jersey.1   No doubt he did this because the ninety-day filing\n\ndeadline to bring new evidence to the BIA under either a motion to\n\nreopen or a motion to reconsider had long since expired.   8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 3.2(c)(2) (1999) (recodified at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2)).\n\n           Thereafter, in 2002, two years after the BIA had entered\n\nits final order of removal and the time for reopening had passed,\n\nRumierz sought to vacate the January 1994 predicate conviction in\n\nVermont.   On application by Rumierz, a Vermont court entered, on\n\nAugust 23, 2002, an \"Agreement and Stipulation,\" which struck the\n\nconviction for possession of stolen property and amended it to\n\n\n     1\n       According to the government, Rumierz initially filed his\nhabeas petition in Rhode Island, but the petition was transferred\nto the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fnegligent operation of a motor vehicle.                Negligent operation of a\n\nmotor   vehicle      is     not   a   crime   of    moral   turpitude    under   the\n\nimmigration laws.           Rumierz brought the vacating of the conviction\n\nto the attention of the district court.                The government responded\n\nwith an affidavit from a Vermont Deputy State's Attorney, which\n\nstated that Rumierz had petitioned for post-conviction relief on\n\nthe   basis    of    allegations       of   \"certain    errors     in   his   earlier\n\nconviction.\"         The affidavit also stated that \"[t]he merits of\n\nPetitioner's claim were not addressed or adjudicated in connection\n\nwith the 'Agreement and Stipulation.'\"\n\n              The district court on September 25, 2003, at Rumierz's\n\nrequest, directed the BIA \"to reconsider its [August 18, 2000]\n\ndecision      in    light    of   subsequent       developments,    including    the\n\nAgreement and Stipulation, dated August 23, 2002 from the Superior\n\nCourt, Windsor County, Vermont.\"              The district court order did not\n\nitself vacate the order of removal or order the BIA either directly\n\nor indirectly to vacate the order of removal.                It also did not hold\n\nthat Rumierz had met the standard used by the BIA to determine\n\nwhether to reopen proceedings.\n\n              The BIA, as instructed, reconsidered based on the record\n\nsent to it by the district court, and denied relief, saying:\n\n                     Upon   further    consideration,  the\n              respondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\n              The   August   23,   2002,   \"Agreement  and\n              Stipulation\" from the Vermont court states\n              only   that   [Rumierz's]    conviction  for\n              possession of stolen property \"shall be\n\n                                            -4-\n\f          stricken and amended to negligent operation of\n          a motor vehicle.\"    There is nothing in the\n          record to indicate that this conviction was\n          stricken based on any defect in the original\n          conviction.    An affidavit from a Vermont\n          Deputy State's Attorney states that, \"the\n          merits   of   Petitioner's  claim   were   not\n          addressed or adjudicated\" in connection with\n          the Agreement and Stipulation.\n\n                  In [In re Pickering], we held that\n          where a court order quashing a conviction, and\n          the documents supporting the request to quash,\n          did not identify a basis for questioning the\n          integrity    of   the   underlying    criminal\n          proceeding or conviction, the conviction\n          remained valid for immigration purposes. In\n          that case, the alien's affidavit stated that\n          the conviction was a bar to his lawful\n          permanent resident status in the United\n          States.\n\n                 We find that, particularly this late in\n          the proceedings (where the conviction in\n          question was entered in January of 1994, and\n          where deportation proceedings began in March\n          of 1994), [Rumierz] must present evidence to\n          show that the Vermont court's action in\n          striking the stolen property conviction was\n          tied to a defect in that conviction, rather\n          than   related    in   part   to   immigration\n          proceedings. Here, there is no representation\n          in the record regarding any kind of defect in\n          the merits of the respondent's Vermont\n          conviction, and, as noted above, the state's\n          attorney has stated that in striking the\n          conviction, the judge did not address or\n          adjudicate the merits of [Rumierz's] claim.\n          Under these circumstances, the respondent has\n          not shown that the Vermont conviction for\n          possession of stolen property is not still\n          valid for immigration purposes. We therefore\n          find that the respondent remains deportable as\n          charged.\n\n          The BIA order had two major components.          First, it\n\nutilized the substantive standard the BIA had established in In re\n\n                               -5-\n\fPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621, under which a vacated conviction is\n\nno longer a \"conviction\" within the meaning of the immigration laws\n\nonly \"if a court with jurisdiction vacates [the] conviction based\n\non a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\"2   Id. at 624.\n\nUnder Herrera-Inirio v. Gonzales, 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nwhich pre-dates and is independent of Pickering, the rule is the\n\nsame:\n\n          The emphasis that Congress placed on the\n          original admission of guilt plainly indicates\n          that a subsequent dismissal of charges, based\n          solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the\n          merits of the charge or on a defect in the\n          underlying criminal proceedings, does not\n          vitiate that original admission.\n\nId. at 306.   Second, the BIA held in the circumstances of this case\n\nthe alien bore the burden of demonstrating that the striking of the\n\nstate conviction \"was tied to a defect in that conviction.\"\n\n          Thereafter, Rumierz renewed his habeas petition in the\n\nU.S. District Court in New Jersey.     The case was transferred to\n\nthis court on petition for review under section 106(c) of the REAL\n\nID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 302, 311\n\n(codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252 note).\n\n\n\n     2\n       In Pickering's actual case, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the\nBIA's rule about vacated convictions, but reversed the BIA's order\nof removal on the grounds that the government had not met its\nburden under the specific facts of that case.        Pickering v.\nGonzales, -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 1976043 (6th Cir. July 17, 2006).\nThe dicta in Pickering that the court would have come to the same\nresult had the burden been on the defendant is immaterial, as the\ncase is factually distinguishable from this case.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                                   II.\n\n          Rumierz   makes   four    arguments   attacking   the   BIA's\n\nconclusions.   We quote from his brief:\n\n          First, the BIA incorrectly placed the burden\n          of proving deportability on Mr. Rumierz and\n          not on the government where he has been\n          charged with deportability.       Second, the\n          stipulated order is entitled to full faith and\n          credit by the BIA without regard to the\n          Vermont Court's reasons for effecting the\n          modification or reduction.3 Third, even if the\n          BIA can look behind the stipulated order, the\n          government has not met its burden of proving\n          deportability by clear and convincing evidence\n          or that Mr. Rumierz's case runs afoul of [In\n          re Pickering] in that no reliable evidence has\n          been submitted showing that the criminal\n          conviction   was   vacated   solely   due   to\n          immigration    or   rehabilitative    reasons.\n          Finally, as a matter of procedural due process\n          the BIA should have terminated proceedings\n          with prejudice after one remand to amend the\n          [order to show cause]. (citations omitted).\n\nA.        Burden of Demonstrating Predicate Conviction\n\n          The initial question presented by Rumierz's arguments is\n\nwhether the BIA's allocation of the burden on the alien, in these\n\ncircumstances, to demonstrate that the Pickering standard has been\n\nmet is either contrary to the relevant statute or an impermissible\n\nconstruction of the statute.   See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The second argument has already been rejected by Herrera-\nInirio, 208 F.3d at 307 (holding that federal definition of\nconviction under the immigration laws \"does not infract applicable\nprinciples of full faith and credit\").\n\n                                   -7-\n\f           The odd procedural posture in which this case came to the\n\nBIA -- through a district court order that the BIA reconsider in\n\nlight of the vacated conviction -- makes no difference to the\n\nstandard of review we use to determine whether we can reverse the\n\nchoice of the BIA to place the burden on the petitioner on these\n\nfacts.   Nor does it make a difference to our standard of review of\n\nthe BIA's ruling that Rumierz had not met his burden.\n\n           Rumierz argues that the BIA's allocation of burdens is\n\ninconsistent with the statute.        He says that under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1101(a)(48)(A) and 1229a(c)(3)(A), the government must always\n\nbear the burden of proof on showing a conviction of a crime of\n\nmoral turpitude, regardless of whether the issue arises in the\n\ncontext of the alien having vacated the conviction after a final\n\norder of removal.   He also argues that the placing of the burden on\n\nhim is inconsistent with two Board rulings: Pickering and In re\n\nOrtiz Herrera, A30-772-905, 2005 WL 3016102 (BIA Aug. 2, 2005)\n\n(unpublished decision). However, Ortiz Herrera has no precedential\n\nvalue,4 and Pickering does not address the issue of burdens.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Ortiz Herrera is also plainly distinguishable.      The BIA\nthere found that where a predicate conviction was vacated after\nremoval proceedings had begun, but before a final order of removal\nhas been issued, the government \"retain[ed] the burden of going\nforward to establish removability\" and of establishing that the\nconviction was not vacated due to a defect in the underlying\nproceedings. Ortiz Herrera, 2005 WL 3016102. Here, by contrast,\nRumierz's conviction was vacated by the Vermont court two years\nafter the final order of removability had entered.\n\n                                -8-\n\f           The   first   prong   of   the   Chevron   test   asks   \"whether\n\nCongress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\"\n\n467 U.S. at 842-43.      Rumierz relies heavily on the INA section\n\ndefining the term \"conviction\":\n\n           The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to\n           an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the\n           alien entered by a court or, if adjudication\n           of guilt has been withheld, where --\n\n           (i)   a judge or jury has found the alien\n           guilty or the alien has entered a plea of\n           guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted\n           sufficient facts to warrant a finding of\n           guilt, and\n\n           (ii) the judge has ordered some form of\n           punishment, penalty, or restraint on the\n           alien's liberty to be imposed.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A).        This section itself does not assign\n\nburdens.\n\n           But 8 U.S.C. § 1229a provides that the burden of proof is\n\non the DHS of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that,\n\nin the case of an alien who has been lawfully admitted to the\n\nUnited States, the alien is deportable.\n\n           In the proceeding, the [DHS] has the burden of\n           establishing by clear and convincing evidence\n           that, in the case of an alien who has been\n           admitted to the United States, the alien is\n           deportable.    No decision on deportability\n           shall be valid unless it is based upon\n           reasonable,    substantial,   and    probative\n           evidence.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A).       The BIA found, in both its August 2000\n\norder and its February 2004 order after reconsideration, that the\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fgovernment had met its burden in the proceedings leading to the\n\nAugust 2000 removal order.   Rumierz does not contest that.\n\n           Both statutes, however, are silent on who has the burden\n\nof showing the effect of convictions which are vacated or modified\n\nafter final orders of removal have entered. See Pinho v. Gonzales,\n\n432 F.3d 193, 206 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that \"[n]othing in the\n\nstatute specifically addresses vacated convictions\" and turning to\n\na Chevron analysis). Thus, Congress has not spoken directly to the\n\nissue, and the BIA's position cannot be said to be contrary to the\n\nstatute.\n\n           Turning to the second prong of the Chevron analysis,\n\n\"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction\n\nof the statute,\" 467 U.S. at 842-43, a court must uphold the BIA's\n\ninterpretation of a silent or ambiguous statute so long as it is\n\nreasonable and consistent with the statute.      See INS v. Cardoza-\n\nFonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 445 n.29, 447-48 (1987); Estrada Canales v.\n\nGonzales, 437 F.3d 208, 214-15 (1st Cir. 2006).       Further, as we\n\nnoted in Herrera-Inirio, \"[b]ecause agency officials acting in the\n\nimmigration   context   'exercise   especially   sensitive   political\n\nfunctions that implicate questions of foreign relations,' deference\n\nto administrative expertise is particularly appropriate.\" 208 F.3d\n\nat 304 (internal citation omitted) (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S.\n\n94, 110 (1988)).\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f          Placing the burden on the alien in these circumstances is\n\nconsistent with BIA regulations.      This allocation of burdens\n\naccords with the usual BIA rules that the burden is on the alien\n\nshow that there is a reason to reopen or to reconsider the case.5\n\nEven if a prima facie case for relief is shown, the BIA \"has\n\ndiscretion to deny a motion to reopen.\"   8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see\n\nalso Maryam v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Most importantly, the placing of the burden on the alien\n\nin these circumstances serves the interest of finality.       That\n\ninterest in finality is already reflected in the statutes and the\n\nBIA's rules, which both set time limits for motions to reopen and\n\nplace the burden on the alien seeking to reopen.6   Abudu, 485 U.S.\n\nat 107-08.   As the Supreme Court has noted:\n\n          Motions   for  reopening   of   immigration\n          proceedings are disfavored for the same\n          reasons as are petitions for rehearing and\n\n\n     5\n        Under the BIA regulations, a petitioner seeking to reopen\nproceedings must \"state the new facts that will be proven at a\nhearing to be held if the motion is granted\" and demonstrate \"that\nevidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and\ncould not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\"\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen on\nthe grounds that \"the movant has not established a prima facie case\nfor the underlying substantive relief sought.\" Abudu, 485 U.S. at\n104.\n     6\n       The BIA was entitled to consider the time limits under its\nrules for seeking to vacate final orders of removal. \"[A] party\nmay file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion\nproceedings (whether before the [BIA] or the [IJ]),\" and the motion\nto reopen \"must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on\nwhich the final administrative decision was rendered.\" 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n                               -11-\n\f            motions for a new trial on the basis of newly\n            discovered evidence. This is especially true\n            in a deportation proceeding, where, as a\n            general matter, every delay works to the\n            advantage of the deportable alien who wishes\n            merely to remain in the United States.\n\nINS   v.   Doherty,   502   U.S.   314,   323   (1992)   (internal   citation\n\nomitted) (citing Abudu, 485 U.S. at 107-08).\n\n            The placement of burdens is also consistent with an\n\nearlier BIA decision, albeit one the BIA did not cite in the\n\nopinion.7    See In re Beckford, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (en\n\nbanc).     The BIA, in In re Beckford, held that when an alien files\n\na motion to reopen (purporting to attack a predicate conviction\n\nunderlying a removal order), the burden is on the alien to show\n\nthat the conditions for reopening have been met, even though the\n\n\n      7\n         There is no requirement that the BIA, or even a court,\nexplain its reasoning on a motion to reopen or reconsider. See\nLasprilla v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"We have\nfound nothing in the regulations that requires the BIA to explain\nits reasons when deciding a motion to reconsider.\"); FDIC v. Ogden\nCorp., 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Although a lower court's\nelucidation of its reasoning invariably eases the appellate task,\nmotions often are decided summarily. . . . [W]e are aware of no\nauthority that would allow us automatically to vary the standard of\nreview depending on whether a district court has taken the time to\nexplain its rationale.\"). In any event, whether or not the BIA\nrelied on Beckford is not the point. Its placement of the burdens\nis rational.\n           Further, no court has ruled against this allocation of\nburdens.    In Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir.\n2005), the court noted its view that where a state court conviction\nhad been modified, the burden was on the government of showing the\nnecessary predicate conviction for removal purposes (that is, an\naggravated felony, under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)). See id.\nat 1130. But the court did so where the conviction was apparently\nvacated before there was a final order of removal.      See id. at\n1127-28.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fburden had been on the government initially to show that the alien\n\nwas removable.    Id. at 1218.     Where the motion to reopen is\n\nuntimely, for example, where the state conviction is not vacated\n\nuntil after the time period for filing motions to reopen has\n\nexpired, then the burden is also on the alien to establish that the\n\nmotion presents an exceptional situation warranting further review.\n\nId.   As Beckford said:\n\n           The current posture of this case is critical\n           to our decision. Were this case now before us\n           on direct appeal, we might be inclined to\n           remand for a further hearing.     However, the\n           fact   that   this  is   an  untimely   motion\n           necessarily changes our point of view.       A\n           criminal    defendant    is   initially    the\n           beneficiary of the rule that the government\n           must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable\n           doubt.     However, once having been found\n           guilty, the defendant bears the burden of\n           proof if he wishes to attack that finding.\n           Similarly, the Service initially bears the\n           burden of proof in a removal proceeding, but\n           once an alien is found removable (and that\n           finding is upheld on appeal, if an appeal is\n           taken), the burden shifts to the alien who\n           wishes to attack that finding. We note that,\n           even where a motion to reopen is not untimely,\n           the motion will not be granted unless there is\n           a reasonable likelihood of success upon\n           reopening. This is particularly so when the\n           motion seeking further review of the finding\n           is untimely.\n\nId. (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted) (citing Taylor v.\n\nIllinois, 484 U.S. 400, 414 (1988); INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314\n\n(1992); Abudu, 485 U.S. 94).\n\n           Here, the BIA explicitly noted that the vacating of the\n\nconviction was \"late in the proceedings\" and that \"the conviction\n\n                                 -13-\n\fin question was entered in January 1994, and . . . the deportation\n\nproceedings began in March of 1994.\"   Further, the BIA noted that\n\nRumierz could easily have sought to vacate the January 1994 Vermont\n\nconviction and have presented the vacated conviction to the BIA in\n\nthe six years before the BIA's 2000 order.8    For this reason, as\n\nwell, the BIA's order is rational.9\n\n          We outline several other reasons that placing the burden\n\non Rumierz is rational.   A shift of burden from the government to\n\nthe individual when there is a collateral attack on a final\n\njudgment, as here, is quite common in the criminal law.        For\n\ninstance, the Court has placed the burden of proof on federal\n\nhabeas petitioners who, under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, seek to vacate an\n\nalready-imposed federal sentence on the basis that predicate state\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       The fact that Rumierz was proceeding pro se before the BIA\nby this time makes no difference. The Vermont conviction had been\nentered in 1994. Rumierz had counsel from at least June 1995, when\nhis case was first heard by the IJ, until sometime in 1999. This\ngave him nearly four years during which he was represented by\ncounsel to challenge the Vermont conviction. Indeed, during this\ntime period -- in September 1995 -- Rumierz was able to obtain a\nstate vacatur of another predicate conviction, from Massachusetts\n(which the DHS then substituted with a different Massachusetts\npredicate conviction).\n     9\n       The dissent incorrectly says that the only argument the\ngovernment made in its initial brief supporting the BIA's\nallocation of the burden was that the alien was in a better\nposition to establish the circumstances of the vacatur; the dissent\nconcludes that all other arguments were waived. That is neither\naccurate nor relevant.    Our obligation is to review the BIA's\ndecision itself.\n\n                               -14-\n\foffenses had been vacated.10 See Daniels v. United States, 532 U.S.\n\n374, 382 (2001); Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 496-97\n\n(1994); cf. Taylor, 484 U.S. at 414 (holding that there is a\n\npresumption that new evidence, discovered by criminal defendant\n\nafter trial is over, would not change outcome of trial).\n\n          As to this case, in which there are concerns that the\n\nalien has not acted with due diligence, the BIA order is also\n\nrational by analogy to Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S. 295\n\n(2005), which held that the defendant's failure to act with due\n\ndiligence in overturning a predicate state conviction underlying\n\nsentencing enhancement precluded resort to a renewed limitations\n\nperiod under the federal habeas statute.   See id. at 310-11.\n\n          We reject the challenge to the BIA's decision to place to\n\nburden of proof on Rumierz.\n\nB.        Whether the BIA Was Compelled to Hold that Rumierz Had\n          Met Pickering Standard\n\n          Our standard of review of the substance of the BIA's\n\ndecision that Rumierz did not meet his burden is quite narrow.   The\n\nBIA's \"decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the\n\nUnited States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.\"    8\n\n\n     10\n        Another analogy is to United States v. Hartsock, 347 F.3d\n1 (1st Cir. 2003), which held that where, for purposes of a federal\nstatute criminalizing the possession firearms by those convicted of\ndomestic violence offenses, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), the statute\nprovided an affirmative defense that a prior conviction would not\nbe considered if there was an unknowing waiver of counsel, the\nburden of proof for the affirmative defense would be placed on the\ndefendant. See Hartsock, 347 F.3d at 9.\n\n                               -15-\n\fU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(C).           Furthermore, the BIA's \"administrative\n\nfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould     be     compelled   to     conclude     to   the   contrary.\"         Id.\n\n§ 1252(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added).              \"This standard of review as to\n\nfactual questions is commonly known as the 'substantial evidence\n\ntest,' and substantial evidence exists where the decision is\n\n'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.'\"             Estrada-Canales, 437 F.3d at\n\n215 (quoting Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 463, 466 (1st Cir.\n\n2005)).\n\n               The topic of how to handle vacated state court decisions\n\nwhich are used as predicate convictions for purposes of removal has\n\noften come before the BIA and the reviewing courts of appeals.                  It\n\nis   well      accepted   that    not   every   vacating    of   a   state   court\n\nconviction makes the conviction invalid for purposes of immigration\n\nlaw.    As this court held in Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d 299:\n\n               The emphasis that Congress placed on the\n               original admission of guilt plainly indicates\n               that a subsequent dismissal of charges, based\n               solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the\n               merits of the charge or on a defect in the\n               underlying criminal proceedings, does not\n               vitiate that original admission.\n\nId. at 306; see also Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, 322 F.3d 804, 812\n\n(5th Cir. 2002); United States v. Campbell, 167 F.3d 94, 98 (2d\n\nCir. 1999); Beltran-Leon v. INS, 134 F.3d 1379, 1380-81 (9th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f1998).      The rule in this circuit under Herrera-Inirio exists\n\nindependently of the BIA's Pickering case.\n\n            The generic issue arises under a number of sections of\n\nthe INA.    See, e.g., Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 303 (dealing with\n\nchallenge to conviction of predicate crime of domestic violence);\n\nsee also 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).        This case involves only\n\nremovals based on the commission of multiple crimes of moral\n\nturpitude under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).\n\n            The BIA has relevant precedent.      Under the Pickering\n\nstandard:\n\n            [T]here is a significant distinction between\n            convictions vacated on the basis of a\n            procedural or substantive defect in the\n            underlying proceedings and those vacated\n            because of post-conviction events, such as\n            rehabilitation    or    immigration   hardships.\n            Thus, if a court with jurisdiction vacates a\n            conviction based on a defect in the underlying\n            criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer\n            has a \"conviction\" within the meaning of [INA]\n            section 101(a)(48)(A). If, however, a court\n            vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to\n            the   merits   of    the   underlying   criminal\n            proceedings,      the     respondent     remains\n            \"convicted\" for immigration purposes.\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec at 624.          Pickering itself did not\n\naddress the burden of proof.\n\n            The Attorney General, in an 2005 opinion pursuant to 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.1(h)(1)(2) (authorizing BIA certification for review\n\nby the Attorney General), emphasized that for a vacated conviction\n\nto not be a \"conviction\" within the meaning of the immigration\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\flaws, the relief provided by the state must \"reflect a judgment\n\nabout the merits of the underlying adjudication of guilt.\"                 In re\n\nMarroquin-Garcia, 23 I. & N. Dec. 705, 713-17 (A.G. 2005).                      In\n\naddition, the Attorney General noted:\n\n           State laws that authorize the subsequent\n           expungement of a conviction typically do so\n           for reasons that are entirely unrelated to the\n           legal propriety of the underlying judgment of\n           conviction -- reasons, in other words, that\n           are unrelated to concerns about the factual\n           basis for, or the procedural validity of, the\n           conviction.    These state expungement laws\n           authorize a conviction to be expunged in order\n           to serve rehabilitative ends and without\n           reference to the merits of the underlying\n           adjudication   of   guilt.     Such   expunged\n           convictions   would   appear,  therefore,   to\n           survive as formal adjudications of guilt\n           entered by a court.\n\nId. at 713 (citations omitted).\n\n           We outlined Rumierz's four arguments earlier.                They are\n\nalmost entirely dependent on his argument, which we have rejected,\n\nthat the burden was on the government.\n\n           Applying, as we must, the rule in Herrera-Inirio, it is\n\nclear   that   the   mere   fact   that      the    state   court    vacated   the\n\nconviction does not require the BIA to vacate the order of removal,\n\ncontrary to Rumierz's argument.         Also applying Herrera-Inirio and\n\nPickering, it was Rumierz's burden to show that the vacating of the\n\nVermont   conviction    was   based    on    a     procedural   or   substantive\n\ninvalidity as defined by Pickering.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f             Rumierz's criticisms11 of the BIA decision, in any event,\n\ndo not convince us that the BIA was compelled to reach a different\n\nconclusion.     To support his argument, Rumierz points first to the\n\nVermont     state   court   order   (the    \"Agreement   and   Stipulation\")\n\nitself.12\n\n\n     11\n        Rumierz, relying on In re Cota-Vargas, 23 I. & N. Dec. 849\n(BIA 2005), argues to us (but had not argued to the BIA) that \"the\nBIA should be precluded from even inquiring into the reasons for\nthe modification of the court's order in this case.\"       This is\nflatly contrary to both Pickering and Herrera-Inirio, and mixes\napples and oranges.    The question in Cota-Vargas was whether a\nstate sentencing modification nunc pro tunc meant that the \"term of\nimprisonment\" within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(B) was\nnow less than that required to allow a conviction to constitute a\npredicate offense.   See 23 I. & N. Dec. at 852.      Our issue is\ndifferent, whether a \"conviction\" exists within the meaning of 8\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A).       Indeed, the BIA in Cota-Vargas\ndistinguished Pickering on the grounds that it involved\nsubparagraph (A) rather than (B).   See 23 I. & N. Dec. at 851-52.\nFurther, it is well settled that \"a state court expungement of a\nconviction is qualitatively different from a state court order to\nclassify an offense or modify a sentence.\"         Garcia-Lopez v.\nAshcroft, 334 F.3d 840, 847 (9th Cir. 2003).\n     12\n         Rumierz raises two other arguments for the first time in\nhis reply brief that were not raised to the BIA: First he argues\nthat the BIA was required to follow a lock-step analysis, where it\nlooks first to the order vacating the conviction and, if the order\nis silent, to the record of post-conviction relief, and if there\nwas any claim of error made, it must treat the conviction as\nvacated for immigration law purposes. Second, Rumierz argues that\nthe BIA could not review new evidence itself, but was required to\nremand to the IJ to hear evidence and to engage in fact-finding as\nto his reasons for seeking reversal. Both arguments are barred by\nexhaustion doctrine, and are waived in this court. See Boakai v.\nGonzales, 447 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2006); Diva's Inc. v. City of\nBangor, 411 F.3d 30, 39 (1st Cir. 2005). Further, for the BIA to\nremand the matter to the IJ would have been fruitless. There was\nno dispute before the BIA as to the content of the state court\nrecord, and Rumierz already had ample opportunity to provide the\nexact reasons he gave to the Vermont court for vacating the\nconviction and had utterly failed to do so.\n\n                                     -19-\n\f               The BIA's inquiry started with this Vermont court order,\n\nwhich is consistent with how the BIA approached the issue in\n\nPickering.       As the BIA noted, all that was docketed in state court\n\nwas an \"Agreement and Stipulation\" stating that the conviction for\n\npossession for stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to\n\nnegligent operation of a motor vehicle.\"                On its face, the order\n\nfails to show, as required by Pickering, that the prior conviction\n\nwas    vacated     because   of   \"a   defect    in   the   underlying   criminal\n\nproceedings.\"        23 I. & N. Dec at 624.           All that the state court\n\norder says is that the court had accepted an agreement of the\n\nparties to vacate the conviction.               The BIA opinion, we note, did\n\nnot say that it would never terminate an order of removal based on\n\na conviction which had been vacated by stipulation.               Nor did it say\n\nthat the sole factor on which it found Rumierz had not met his\n\nburden was that the vacating was based on a stipulation.\n\n               To support his claim that the stipulation here was\n\nsufficient to invalidate the conviction within the meaning of the\n\nimmigration laws, Rumierz points to Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d\n\n193.        Pinho does not help him.13      The question is not whether an\n\n\n       13\n       Pinho is legally and factually distinguishable on several\nother fronts.   Importantly, the Pinho court, relying on a full\nrecord of the state court proceedings, including hearing\ntranscripts, 432 F.3d at 196-97, expressly relied on the fact that\nPinho had raised a valid claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, a clear \"defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\"\nId. at 211.    Here, by contrast, the BIA had a sparse record\nconsisting only of the state court order and an affidavit from the\nstate attorney, neither of which demonstrate that Rumierz had\n\n                                        -20-\n\fagreement or stipulation vacating a conviction can ever serve as a\n\nbasis for vacating an order of removal, but whether the BIA was\n\ncompelled to accept the stipulation here.   Pinho does not say that\n\nthe BIA must accept every stipulation which leads to vacating a\n\nconviction, whatever the circumstances.\n\n          Rumierz argues that the record, in fact, does show that\n\nhe had raised a valid claim of a defect in the underlying criminal\n\nproceedings, as required by Pickering. Rumierz points to the state\n\nattorney's affidavit, which states that Rumierz alleged \"certain\n\nerrors in his earlier conviction.\"14   The BIA considered the state\n\nattorney's affidavit, but concluded that it was insufficient to\n\nmeet Rumierz's burden of showing that the conviction was vacated\n\n\nraised a valid claim of any defect. Also, in Pinho there was no\nstatement from a state's attorney that the merits of the\npetitioner's claim had not been addressed or adjudicated.\nFurthermore, the alien in Pinho had vacated his state convictions\nwell before the INS had considered the alien's application for\nadjustment of status (the government in Pinho argued that his state\nconviction had made the alien ineligible for adjustment of status).\nId. at 198. Here, the conviction was vacated after a final order\nof removal had entered.\n     14\n        This case does not raise the Shepard-type sentencing\nguidelines issue of what evidence the BIA may look at in\ndetermining whether a vacated conviction remains valid for\nimmigration law purposes. See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S.\n13 (2005). The BIA and the courts are free to consider the reasons\nstated in the stipulated order to amend the state court conviction.\nSee, e.g., Ali v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 722, 729 (7th Cir. 2005). And\nRumierz does not challenge the BIA's consideration of the state\nattorney's affidavit; indeed, he relies on it. In the absence of\na statutory directive, such as that which exists under the U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines, it seems to us that the issue of what the\nBIA considers, and in what order, is one for the BIA in the first\ninstance, to be tested, if necessary, only under Chevron.\n\n                               -21-\n\fbased on a defect in the underlying proceedings, especially since\n\nthe affidavit stated that \"the merits of [Rumierz's] claim were not\n\naddressed or adjudicated in connection with the 'Agreement or\n\nStipulation.'\"    The BIA concluded that \"there is no representation\n\nin the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the\n\nrespondent's conviction\" and that \"[u]nder these circumstances,\n\n[Rumierz] has not shown that the Vermont conviction . . . is not\n\nstill valid for immigration purposes.\"             Again, a court does not\n\nreview   this   conclusion   de    novo,   but     asks   only   whether     any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would compelled to conclude to the contrary.\n\n             Going beyond the arguments presented by Rumierz, the\n\ndissent's position is that the BIA was compelled to conclude that\n\nthe vacated conviction in this case -- which had been vacated not\n\nafter adjudication of the merits of Rumierz's motion to vacate, but\n\npursuant to an agreement and stipulation between the defendant and\n\nthe state's attorney -- meets the Pickering standard, simply by\n\ndint of the fact that Rumierz had claimed \"certain errors\" through\n\na motion for post-conviction relief in state court.\n\n             The BIA was not obligated, as a matter of law, to accept\n\nthat   the   stipulation   and    agreement   --    vacating     a   state   law\n\nconviction for unstated reasons, entered into long after the state\n\npunishment had ceased and after a final order of removal -- was\n\nsufficient to render the state conviction invalid within the\n\nmeaning of Pickering based on evidence that \"certain errors\" were\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\falleged.   There is nothing in the federal immigration laws that\n\nrequires such a result.15\n\n           First, the BIA is not required to conclude that the mere\n\nfiling of a petition for post-conviction relief claiming \"certain\n\nerrors\" which results in a stipulation means that the petitioner\n\nhas   raised   valid    claims   of    defects     in    the     state   criminal\n\nproceedings.\n\n           Second, under Pickering, it is not enough to show that\n\nthere was an allegation of a cognizable defect in the state\n\nproceedings; instead the alien must also show that \"a court with\n\njurisdiction vacate[d] the conviction based on a defect in the\n\nunderlying criminal proceedings.\"            23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.        Here,\n\neven beyond the fact that Rumierz can point to nothing more than\n\nthe   allegation   of   \"certain   errors,\"      he     cannot   show    that   the\n\n\n      15\n       If Rumierz's position were correct, all it would take for\nan alien to avoid or delay deportation on the basis of old\npredicate state convictions is to wait until the final order of\nremoval had been entered, make invalid claims for post-conviction\nrelief in state court, find a state attorney who has more pressing\nmatters than defending an old conviction, have the conviction\nvacated by agreement without having the merits of his claim\naddressed or adjudicated, and return to the BIA to reopen the case\nclaiming that he had alleged \"certain errors,\" without describing\nwhat those errors actually were or providing a record of the state\nproceedings. This would either force the government to find a new\nground for deportation and start the proceedings over again, or,\neven worse, allow the alien (who had already been found deportable\nfor having two or more convictions for crimes of moral turpitude)\nto remain in the country, even though the alien had never\ndemonstrated to anyone that there was even the suggestion of a\ndefect in the state criminal proceedings. The immigration system\nwas simply not designed to allow this sort of gamesmanship by\ncriminal aliens.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fstipulation was \"based on\" those errors.                  A state's attorney,\n\nrather   than   challenging     the   petition,     may    have   agreed    to   a\n\nstipulated motion to vacate the conviction for any number of\n\nreasons other than the strength and validity of those claims.\n\n           We address another argument, which Rumierz did not make\n\nbefore the agency (or the district court) or to this court, and so,\n\nwe hold, is precluded by the exhaustion doctrine and waived.                 See\n\nBoakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).             Nonetheless, we\n\ncomment on it because it is heavily relied on by the dissent.\n\nNothing in the record of the state court proceedings that was\n\nbefore the BIA -- the \"Agreement and Stipulation\" or the state\n\nattorney's affidavit -- refers to a particular state statute\n\ndefining the post-conviction procedure used by Rumierz.                      The\n\ndissent nonetheless assumes that Rumierz used the procedure set\n\nforth in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, § 7131, and that this means the\n\ngrounds stated by Rumierz for relief from the state convictions are\n\nnecessarily     all   grounds   eligible     for   Pickering      relief.    The\n\nargument is based on certain assumptions, which Rumierz could have\n\neasily supported with evidence, had the assumptions been true. But\n\nRumierz chose not to give the BIA such evidence.             By its own terms\n\nthe Vermont statute, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, § 7131, only applies\n\nto \"[a] prisoner who is in custody under sentence of a court and\n\nclaims the right to be released\" because of a defect in the\n\nconviction.     Id.    Rumierz was not in custody in Vermont and had\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fserved his time.16 The fact that Rumierz may have used a particular\n\npost-conviction relief statute does not mean that the BIA was\n\nrequired to hold that Rumierz had, in fact, raised valid claims of\n\ndefects in the underlying criminal proceedings or that the state's\n\nattorney agreed to vacate the conviction because of the strength or\n\nvalidity of those claims.\n\n                                 III.\n\n                         Remaining Claims\n\n          Rumierz raises a number of other claims which were never\n\nraised to the BIA and are barred by exhaustion doctrine.       Rumierz\n\nargues the BIA was obligated to tell him he was eligible for\n\nnaturalization and so the order or removal should be vacated. Even\n\nif the claim had been exhausted, Rumierz was not eligible because\n\nhe was already in deportation proceedings and so was precluded from\n\nnaturalization.     8   U.S.C.   §   1429    (\"[N]o   application   for\n\nnaturalization shall be considered by the Attorney General if there\n\nis pending against the applicant a removal proceeding . . . .\").\n\nAs the DHS notes, there is no inequity.     Rumierz entered the United\n\nStates as an immigrant in 1980; he had a number of years before the\n\n\n\n\n     16\n        The dissent asserts that Vermont courts have broadly\ninterpreted its post-conviction relief statute to cover Rumierz's\nsituation. Whether this is true or not, these were not arguments\nraised by Rumierz before the BIA or before us. The BIA was not\nrequired to find a state statute that Rumierz may have used to\nchallenge his state conviction, and to conduct its own research\ninto how Vermont courts interpret that statute.\n\n                                 -25-\n\fstart of his deportation proceedings to seek naturalization but\n\nnever once did so.\n\n          Rumierz also argues that the IJ who initially heard his\n\ncase was biased.       The claim is defaulted because it was never\n\npresented to the BIA.          We lack jurisdiction.         See   Ishak v.\n\nGonzales, 422 F.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Rumierz also argues that because he has spent the last\n\ndecade in DHS detention, as a general equitable matter he should be\n\nreleased now and permitted to remain in the country.                For any\n\nnumber of doctrinal reasons, the argument is not cognizable, but a\n\nfew words are in order.\n\n          At base Rumierz's claim is that when the alien has\n\ncommitted,   as   he   has,   more   than   two   crimes   involving   moral\n\nturpitude, all of these crimes should be charged by the DHS in the\n\ninitial deportation hearings. Here, part of the reason for the ten\n\nyears of detention is that the government initially relied on a\n\n1989 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering (as well as\n\nthe Vermont conviction) and the IJ found Rumierz deportable. While\n\nthat decision was on appeal to the BIA, Rumierz succeeded in\n\nvacating the Massachusetts conviction.        The BIA permitted the DHS,\n\non remand to the IJ, to add a different Massachusetts conviction in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f1995 for receiving stolen property.       The IJ again found him\n\ndeportable in 1996.17\n\n           Rumierz allowed the various proceedings to run their\n\ncourse and only after the August 2000 BIA final order of removal\n\ndid he seek to vacate his Vermont conviction in 2002.   The delay is\n\nentirely caused by Rumierz.   His case has been ably handled by his\n\ncounsel.   There is, now, no basis for him to continue to avoid\n\nremoval.\n\n           We deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n                    Dissenting Opinion Follows.\n\n\n\n\n     17\n       Under a 1998 decision of this court, Goncalves v. Reno, 144\nF.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998), the BIA gave Rumierz an opportunity to\nhave his claim for § 212(c) relief adjudicated. That claim was\ndenied by the IJ on December 10, 1999, and the denial was affirmed\nby the BIA in its August 18, 2000 order.\n\n                               -27-\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.      The majority holds\n\nthat the BIA properly placed the burden of contesting removability\n\non Rumierz and correctly concluded that he has not met his burden.\n\nThe majority emphasizes that there is no evidence of the validity\n\nof Rumierz's claim of errors in his underlying conviction; that the\n\nstipulated vacatur was not the result of an adjudication on the\n\nmerits of Rumierz's claim of errors; and that there is no evidence\n\nthat the state's attorney agreed to the stipulated vacatur because\n\nof the claim of errors.     I disagree that Rumierz has failed to meet\n\nthe burden assigned to him by the BIA.     Because I conclude that he\n\nmet that burden, I would not reach the more difficult issue of\n\nwhether the BIA properly placed the burden on the petitioner in\n\nthis case.   Indeed, there is good reason to question whether the\n\nmajority's analysis of the issue comports with the procedural\n\nposture of this case or with the arguments invoked by the BIA and\n\nthe government in support of the allocation of the burden.        For\n\nthese reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\nA.   Allocation of Burden\n\n           Although the majority acknowledges the \"odd procedural\n\nposture\" of this case, ante at 8, it does not acknowledge that this\n\nprocedural posture undermines its analysis of the allocation of the\n\nburden.   In concluding that the BIA properly placed the burden of\n\ncontesting removability on Rumierz, the majority treats the BIA's\n\ndecision as the equivalent of a denial of a motion to reopen.     See\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\fante at 11-13. This is an inaccurate characterization of the BIA's\n\nactions.      Here,   a   federal   district      court   remanded    the   case\n\n(initially    brought     through   a    habeas   petition)   to   the   BIA    to\n\n\"reconsider its last decision in light of subsequent developments,\n\nincluding the Agreement and Stipulation, dated August 23, 2002,\n\nfrom the Superior Court, Windsor County, Vermont.\"18               This was not\n\na directive from the court to the BIA to decide whether it should\n\nreopen its last decision (which would be the threshold decision\n\nthat the BIA would have to make if presented with a motion to\n\nreopen).     Nor did the BIA treat the remand as such.                   We have\n\nexplained that \"[t]he filing of a motion to reopen with the BIA is\n\nnot a vehicle for trying an issue, but is merely a request for the\n\nopportunity to try it.\"      DaCosta v. Gonzales,         449 F.3d 45, 50 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     If the BIA here had denied an untimely motion to\n\nreopen, it would have framed its decision in an entirely different\n\nmanner, citing the regulations for motions to reopen and explaining\n\nwhy it would not reopen Rumierz's case.           Instead, the BIA began its\n\nanalysis   by   stating    that,    \"[u]pon    further    consideration,       the\n\nrespondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\"               It considered the\n\nquestion of removability in light of the vacatur and then concluded\n\n\n\n     18\n       While the district court used the term \"reconsider,\" the\nmore apt term under BIA regulations is \"reopen\" because the remand\nwas based on new evidence, i.e., the Agreement and Stipulation and\nthe state's attorney's affidavit. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The\ngovernment at oral argument acknowledged that \"reopen\" was the\napplicable term.\n\n                                        -29-\n\fthat Rumierz's conviction was still valid for removal purposes and\n\n\"therefore . . . the respondent remains deportable as charged.\n\nAccordingly, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\"\n\nThis language demonstrates that the BIA, as instructed, reopened\n\nRumierz's administrative proceedings but concluded that Rumierz was\n\nnonetheless removable.\n\n          This distinction is important because the BIA's reopening\n\nof a case vacates the final order of removal and reopens the\n\nadministrative removal proceedings. See id. During administrative\n\nremoval proceedings, the government has the burden of proving by\n\n\"clear and convincing evidence\" that the petitioner is subject to\n\nremoval   on    the   basis    of    his   convictions.        8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(3)(A); see also Pickering v. Gonzales, -- F.3d --, 2006\n\nWL 1976043, *4 (6th Cir. July 17, 2006) (concluding that, once the\n\npetitioner produces evidence that his conviction has been vacated,\n\n\"the [p]etitioner is deportable only if the government can show,\n\nwith   clear,   convincing    and    unequivocal   evidence,   that   the\n\nconviction was vacated solely for immigration reasons\"); Cruz-\n\nGarcia v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1125, 1130 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding\n\nthat, in a case where the petitioner obtained post-conviction\n\nrelief reducing his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, \"the\n\nevidence of record is legally insufficient to satisfy the INS's\n\nstringent burden of proof and, thus, . . . the order for removal\n\nmust be reversed\"); Sandoval v. INS, 240 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir.\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\f2001) (\"In order to show that Sandoval's original conviction for\n\npossessing more than thirty grams of marijuana remained in effect,\n\nthe INS could have shown 1) that the Illinois judge exceeded his\n\nauthority    under     state   law,   thus   rendering   the   modification\n\nineffective, or 2) that the sentence modification was legal but not\n\neffective for purposes of federal immigration law.             We find that\n\nthe INS did not establish either of these factual situations by\n\nclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\").19         If, as I believe\n\nthe record establishes, the BIA actually reopened Rumierz's case in\n\nresponse    to   the   district   court's    order,   rather   than   simply\n\nadjudicating the case as a request for reopening, the BIA erred in\n\nits allocation of the burden of proof.\n\n            It would therefore be improper to defer to the agency's\n\nerror under Chevron.       The majority observes that the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act (\"INA\") is \"silent on who has the burden of\n\nshowing the effect of convictions which are vacated or modified\n\nafter final orders of removal have entered.\" Ante at 10.20 That may\n\n\n     19\n       In an unpublished decision, the BIA itself has stated that\n\"even where a conviction is vacated after the DHS initiates\nproceedings and makes a prima facie case with respect to the\nconviction, the DHS retains the burden of going forward to\nestablish removability.\"    In re Roberto Ortiz-Herrera, 2005 WL\n3016102 (BIA Aug. 2, 2005) (affirming IJ's decision that the\ngovernment failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that vacatur\nof   noncitizen's   state   court  conviction   was   merely   for\nrehabilitative purposes).\n     20\n       In support of this proposition, the majority cites Pinho v.\nGonzales, 432 F.3d 193, 206 (3rd Cir. 2005). However, Pinho did\nnot deal with the BIA's interpretation of the statutory allocation\n\n                                      -31-\n\fbe true, but if the proceedings were reopened in this case (thus\n\nvacating the final order of removal), that observation misses the\n\npoint.         The    applicable      statutory   provision,     8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(3)(A), is not silent on who has the burden of showing\n\nthe effect of a conviction, vacated or not, during administrative\n\nremoval proceedings.       As the plain language of the statute states,\n\nand as the aforementioned cases explain, the government has the\n\nburden of establishing removability during removal proceedings.\n\nThus,    if   the    BIA   reopened   Rumierz's   administrative     removal\n\nproceedings but denied his appeal, it misapplied the allocation of\n\nburden under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A) and there is no basis for\n\napplying Chevron deference to its shifting of the burden to the\n\npetitioner.\n\n              The regulation, cases, and analogies relied upon by the\n\nmajority to support its contrary view of the case only further\n\nundermine its conclusion.          None of these regulations, cases, or\n\nanalogies -- applicable to motions to reopen -- were mentioned in\n\nthe BIA decision or by the government in its briefs.           The BIA never\n\ncited 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, the regulation governing motions to\n\nreopen, ante at 11, or In re Beckford, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1216 (BIA\n\n2000), a case in which the BIA rejected an untimely motion to\n\n\nof burden issue in the Chevron context at all.      It applied a\nChevron analysis to determine whether the BIA's definition of\n\"conviction\" in Pickering was entitled to deference, an issue we\nhave already addressed in a previous decision. See Herrera-Inirio\nv. INS, 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                      -32-\n\freopen where the petitioner conceded removability, see ante at 12-\n\n13.   For its part, the government also said nothing of motions to\n\nreopen or the standards governing them until oral argument, where\n\nit raised for the first time the argument that the BIA treated this\n\ncase as a motion to reopen.              In its brief, the only argument the\n\ngovernment raised in support of the BIA's allocation of the burden\n\nin this case was that \"an alien who obtains a [vacatur] of a state\n\ncourt        conviction   is   clearly    in   a   better   position   tha[n]   DHS\n\npersonnel        to   have     access     to     documentation   regarding      the\n\ncircumstances of the vacatur.\"             The weakness of this argument as a\n\njustification for burden shifting is readily apparent,21 which is\n\nperhaps why the majority opinion does not even mention it.                 In any\n\nevent, the arguments upon which the majority relies are not the\n\narguments expressed in the BIA decision nor arguments raised in the\n\ngovernment's brief.\n\n                We have said many times that \"[w]e must judge the action\n\nof an administrative agency based only on the reasoning provided by\n\nthe agency, not based on substitute grounds we construct ourselves\n\nto salvage the agency's action.\"               Ymeri v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 12,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 2004).            Furthermore, \"[w]e have consistently held\n\nthat, except in extraordinary circumstances, arguments not raised\n\n        21\n        Such reasoning would hold whenever a person obtains a\nvacatur of his criminal conviction, regardless of the timing of the\nvacatur. Yet, at least during removal proceedings, the government\nstill retains the burden of establishing removability even when a\npetitioner obtained a vacatur of an underlying conviction after\nproceedings have commenced. See supra Part A.\n\n                                          -33-\n\fin a party's initial brief and instead raised for the first time at\n\noral argument are considered waived.\"         United States v. Pizarro-\n\nBerrios, 448 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006); see also       United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in\n\na perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived.\").          Here, the majority both\n\nconstructs new grounds to salvage the BIA's action and, in so\n\ndoing, relies on arguments not raised in the government's brief.\n\n          This   unorthodox   approach   is    apparently   necessary   to\n\ndefend a BIA decision that cannot be defended on its own terms.22\n\n     22\n        Because of the procedural oddity of this case -- on remand\nfrom the district court -- Rumierz may have received a renewed\nreview of his administrative appeal that the BIA might not\notherwise have been inclined to grant him. Certainly, if Rumierz\nhad not obtained a remand from the district court on habeas, he\ncould have instead filed a motion to reopen directly with the BIA,\nwhich, though untimely, the BIA could have granted sua sponte. See\n8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). But, as the majority points out, the BIA\ngrants such motions only in extraordinary cases. Therefore, it was\nbeneficial for Rumierz that the district court remanded this case\nto the BIA.\n     This procedural oddity only underscores why this case is a\npoor vehicle for announcing the majority's broad rule on the\nreallocation of the burden of proof when a petitioner seeks to\nreopen his case on the basis of a vacated conviction. Perhaps the\nBIA in this case should have sought clarification from the district\ncourt on the scope of the remand.     Perhaps the BIA should have\ntreated the remanded case as an untimely motion to reopen and\nproceeding accordingly.     But it did neither of those things.\nInstead, as explained in its description of its decision, it\nreopened the administrative proceedings, considered the new\nevidence, decided the question of removability, and then dismissed\nRumierz's administrative appeal.        While it may have been\npreferable, in the majority's view, for the BIA to have treated\nthis case differently, it is not appropriate for the majority to\nwrite a decision that it wishes the BIA had written or to make\narguments that it wishes the government had presented in defending\nthe agency's action.\n\n                                 -34-\n\fFrom my reading of the BIA's decision, the BIA reopened but\n\nultimately denied Rumierz's administrative appeal.                   In so doing,\n\nthe BIA erred in allocating the burden to Rumierz under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(3)(A). In any event, the majority's decision to reframe\n\nthe BIA's decision and supply new reasoning aside, we did not have\n\nto reach this difficult issue here.                 As I describe in further\n\ndetail below, I conclude that Rumierz has met the burden allocated\n\nto him by the BIA.\n\nB.   Rumierz's Vacatur\n\n               The BIA stated that Rumierz \"must present evidence to\n\nshow    that    the   Vermont   court's    action    in   striking    the   stolen\n\nproperty conviction was tied to a defect in that conviction, rather\n\nthan related in part to immigration proceedings.\"                    Although the\n\nrecord evidence here is sparse,23 it includes (1) an \"Agreement and\n\nStipulation\" that the conviction for possession of stolen property\n\n\"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor\n\nvehicle\" and (2) an affidavit of Deputy State's Attorney Matthew\n\nHuntington regarding the Agreement and Stipulation that states that\n\nRumierz     raised    \"errors   in   his   earlier    conviction      in    Windsor\n\nDistrict Court, Vermont\" through a \"Petition for Post-Conviction\n\nRelief.\"        Without   acknowledging      the    affidavit's   reference     to\n\nRumierz's claims of errors in his conviction, the BIA stated that\n\n\n\n       23\n       Rumierz, who has been detained since 1994, was pro se at the\ntime of the BIA's consideration of his vacatur.\n\n                                      -35-\n\f\"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of\n\ndefect in the merits of the respondent's Vermont conviction, and .\n\n.   .    the    state's     attorney   has   stated    that     in   striking    the\n\nconviction, the judge did not address or adjudicate the merits of\n\nthe     respondent's      claim.\"      For   these    reasons    alone,    the   BIA\n\nconcluded that Rumierz failed to meet his burden.\n\n               In affirming the BIA's decision, the majority again bases\n\nits reasoning on grounds not relied upon by the BIA or raised in\n\nthe     brief    of   the    government.       Specifically,         the   majority\n\nacknowledges the affidavit's reference to Rumierz's claims of\n\nerrors in his conviction, but asserts that there is no evidence\n\nthat Rumierz raised \"valid claims of defects\" in his criminal\n\nproceedings and that the state's attorney, in agreeing to the\n\nstipulated motion, may have done so \"for any number of reasons\n\nother than the strength and validity of those claims,\" ante at 23-\n\n24.     For these reasons, the majority holds that the record does not\n\ncompel the BIA to conclude that Rumierz has failed to meet his\n\nburden.\n\n               The majority's decision reflects the erroneous notion\n\nthat a vacatur must follow an adjudication on the merits of claimed\n\nlegal errors or some further inquiry regarding the validity of the\n\nclaims and any hidden reasons behind the government's agreement to\n\nthe stipulation.          Such requirements are a misapplication of In re\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. 621 (BIA 2003).              The proper approach in\n\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fthis case is to examine whether Rumierz has provided evidence that\n\nthe   stipulated    order    was   based    on     defects     in   his   underlying\n\nconviction, rather than grounds proscribed by Pickering. Following\n\nthis approach, I conclude that the BIA was compelled to find that\n\nRumierz met the burden allocated to him.\n\n            1.    Vacatur by stipulation\n\n            In Pickering, the BIA explained that \"if a court with\n\njurisdiction     vacates     a   conviction      based    on    a   defect   in    the\n\nunderlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a\n\n'conviction' [for immigration purposes].                  If, however, a court\n\nvacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the\n\nunderlying criminal proceedings, the respondent remains 'convicted'\n\nfor immigration purposes.\"           23 I. & N. Dec. at 624; see also\n\nHerrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299, 306 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[A]\n\nsubsequent dismissal of charges, based solely on rehabilitative\n\ngoals and not on the merits of the charge or on a defect in the\n\nunderlying criminal proceedings, does not vitiate that original\n\nadmission   [of    guilt].\").        Nothing       in    Pickering    precludes      a\n\nstipulated vacatur from invalidating a conviction as a ground for\n\nremoval or for other immigration purposes, provided that the\n\nvacatur is still based on a defect in the underlying conviction\n\nrather than rehabilitative or otherwise proscribed grounds.                        See\n\nPinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193 (3rd Cir. 2005) (holding that the\n\npetitioner's      vacatur,       obtained     by     settlement       rather      than\n\n\n                                      -37-\n\fadjudication, meets the Pickering standard because the petitioner\n\nclaimed a defect in his underlying conviction); Cruz-Garcia v.\n\nAshcroft, 396 F.3d at 1131 (explaining that if \"a substantive\n\nchallenge to and/or showing of the inappropriateness of the felony\n\nconviction prodded the State into stipulating to a vacatur of the\n\nconviction and its replacement by a misdemeanor,\" then \"[o]n this\n\nscenario, petitioner's vacated felony conviction would not satisfy\n\nthe test for removal\").\n\n          The majority acknowledges that some stipulated vacaturs\n\nmight suffice to meet the Pickering standard and that, in this\n\ncase, the BIA did not deny Rumierz's appeal based solely on the\n\nfact that his vacatur was obtained by stipulation.         Yet, in\n\naffirming the decision of the BIA, the majority emphasizes several\n\nfactors that are characteristic of stipulations -- i.e., that the\n\nmerits of Rumierz's claims of error had not been addressed or\n\nadjudicated by the judge in ordering the stipulated vacatur; that\n\none cannot assume that Rumierz raised \"valid\" claims of defect; and\n\nthat the state's attorney may have agreed to the stipulation for a\n\nvariety of reasons not indicated on the record.   Ante at 20 n.13,\n\n23-24. In holding that Rumierz's vacatur cannot meet the Pickering\n\nstandard based on these factors, the majority effectively creates\n\na bar that applies to many vacaturs obtained by stipulation or\n\nsettlement.   As the Third Circuit's recent decision in Pinho\n\nexplains, such a bar would be inappropriate, and the factors relied\n\n\n\n                               -38-\n\fupon by the majority here are simply not dispositive in a proper\n\nPickering analysis.\n\n            Pinho, like the case here, involved a petitioner who had\n\nsought and obtained a vacatur of an earlier conviction through a\n\nsettlement with the government rather than a trial.               Specifically,\n\nthe petitioner in Pinho had pled guilty to a drug crime, and later\n\napplied for post-conviction relief based on his claim that he had\n\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his\n\nrejection from a special alternative sentencing program (termed\n\n\"PTI placement\") that would have allowed him to earn a dismissal of\n\ncharges without having to plead guilty.              See Pinho, 432 F.3d at\n\n196.    The government settled, and an order was issued dismissing\n\nthe    charges    against   him   and,   according    to    the    parties,   his\n\nconviction was vacated.       See id.     at 196-97.       Pinho later applied\n\nfor adjustment of his immigration status, but was denied on the\n\nbasis of his old drug conviction.         See id. at 197.         In response to\n\nhis filing of a complaint in district court, the court held that\n\nhis vacated conviction was still a conviction for immigration\n\npurposes.    See id. at 199.\n\n            The    Third    Circuit   reversed.        It    found   the   BIA's\n\nlongstanding distinction between \"rehabilitative vacaturs\"(vacating\n\na conviction for rehabilitative or immigration-related purposes)\n\nand \"substantive vacaturs\" (vacating a conviction on the basis of\n\na legal defect in the proceedings) to be reasonable.                 See id. at\n\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\f209-10.      However,   the    Third     Circuit   concluded   that,   under\n\nPickering, a vacatur need not follow a formal adjudication on the\n\nmerits in order to be a substantive vacatur:\n\n            The fact that the parties agreed to settle\n            rather   than   proceed    to    trial    on  the\n            ineffective assistance claim should not be\n            dispositive.    Indeed, it may be that the\n            likelihood that the prosecution will agree to\n            a settlement such as PTI placement will\n            increase proportionally with the strength of\n            the alien's constitutional claim. If the BIA\n            in   Pickering   had   meant    to    require  an\n            adjudication of the merits of aliens' claims\n            of substantive defects in the original\n            conviction in order to make out an adequate\n            \"basis,\" it could have said so. But it did\n            not. It has instead drawn its line between\n            vacaturs \"based on\" underlying defects and\n            vacaturs granted \"for reasons\" not related to\n            underlying defects, and it is readily apparent\n            that the set of vacaturs \"based on\" underlying\n            defects is not necessarily coextensive with\n            the set of vacaturs based on adjudications of\n            underlying defects. We must therefore inquire\n            as to the reasons underlying the vacatur\n            order, and it would obviously be begging the\n            question simply to invoke the PTI acceptance\n            yet again. The prosecutor's offer of PTI\n            placement did not spring into being ex nihilo;\n            rather, it was by way of settlement of Pinho's\n            collateral   attack   on    the    constitutional\n            validity of his conviction. The relevant\n            \"reason,\" then, for our Pickering analysis, is\n            plainly   the   reason   for    the    settlement\n            agreement.\n\nId.   at   211.    In   so    holding,    the   court   also   rejected   the\n\ngovernment's argument that it should look beyond the record to\n\nconsider any hidden reasons the state's attorney might have for\n\nagreeing to the stipulated vacatur:\n\n\n\n                                    -40-\n\f          At oral argument the government contended that\n          the motives of state prosecutors and judges\n          might change over time and might not be\n          reflected in the record. Perhaps a new\n          prosecutor, reviewing old cases, might decide\n          that some of his predecessor's policies had\n          been unduly harsh. Perhaps such a prosecutor,\n          when presented with a post-conviction relief\n          claim brought by a defendant who had been\n          denied entry into a pre-trial diversion\n          program years earlier because of a now-\n          discredited policy, might decide to \"do the\n          right thing,\" and help that defendant avoid\n          the immigration consequences of his guilty\n          plea. Perhaps a state judge, looking at the\n          case, would see a hard-working family man\n          threatened with deportation based on a\n          relatively minor crime committed a decade\n          earlier, and decide to help that hard-working\n          family man get around the federal immigration\n          laws. Perhaps, perhaps. We present this\n          hypothetical to highlight the fact that it is\n          precisely that: a hypothetical proposed by the\n          government about possible motives of state\n          actors nowhere found in the record. . . . We\n          cannot   endorse   a   test   which   requires\n          speculation about, or scrutiny of, the reasons\n          for judges' actions other than those reasons\n          that appear on the record.\n\nPinho, 432 F.3d at 211.   Thus, the only relevant question under\n\nPickering is whether the record itself establishes that the reason\n\nfor the stipulated order was based on a defect in the conviction,\n\nand not rehabilitative or immigration-related grounds.     See id.\n\nApplying this inquiry to the record in Pinho, the Third Circuit\n\nnoted that Pinho \"raised only one claim: ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel . . . .   The only basis for the vacatur appearing in the\n\norder or the pleadings is Pinho's ineffective assistance claim. .\n\n. . [T]herefore, Pinho's conviction was vacated 'based on a defect\n\n\n\n                              -41-\n\fin the underlying criminal proceedings' and Pinho accordingly 'no\n\nlonger has a 'conviction' within the meaning of [the INA].'\"              Id.\n\nat 215.\n\n            The persuasive analysis of the Third Circuit in Pinho\n\nundermines each of the factors relied upon by the majority in\n\nexplaining why Rumierz's vacatur could not meet the Pickering test.\n\nIndeed, the majority's attempt to distinguish Pinho, ante at 20\n\nn.13, only further illustrates why Pinho supports Rumierz's case.\n\nFirst, the majority asserts that the Pinho court had the benefit of\n\nfull state court transcripts that demonstrated that Pinho raised a\n\n\"valid\" claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Yet nowhere in\n\nthe Pinho decision did the Third Circuit state that its holding was\n\nbased on a finding that his underlying claim of error was valid or\n\nmeritorious.     Nor would it have been appropriate for the court to\n\nmake such a judgement of validity.            The concern in Pickering is\n\nsolely whether the claims serving as the basis of a vacatur are\n\nrelated to defects in the conviction, rather than requests for\n\nequitable or rehabilitative relief.           Nothing in Pickering permits\n\nthe BIA or a reviewing court to re-assess the validity or strength\n\nof the claims that led to a vacatur.            Cf. Pickering, 23 I. & N.\n\nDec. at 624 (explaining that the BIA will \"not look behind the\n\nstate court judgment to ascertain whether the court acted in\n\naccordance with its own law in vacating the conviction\"); see also\n\nPinho,    432   F.3d   at   211   (refusing   to   scrutinize   further   the\n\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\fdecisions of prosecutors or judges when the only basis for the\n\nvacatur stated in the record was a claim of a defect in the\n\nconviction). Thus, while the Pinho court certainly had the benefit\n\nof a more extensive record than we have here, the decision in Pinho\n\nrested on the court's assessment of the type of claim raised by the\n\npetitioner, not its validity.   See Pinho, 432 F.3d at 215.    Here,\n\nas in Pinho, the record shows that Rumierz's petition for post-\n\nconviction relief was based on errors in his conviction, not\n\nPickering-proscribed grounds.\n\n          Second, the majority distinguishes Pinho by noting that\n\nhere we have a statement from the State's Attorney that Rumierz's\n\nclaims were not addressed or adjudicated by the state court.    This\n\ndistinction is a non-starter.   The Pinho decision also noted that\n\nthe state court in that case never reached the merits of Pinho's\n\nclaim of error in his state court conviction and that requiring an\n\nadjudication of those claims would be contrary to Pickering.    See\n\nid. at 211 (\"If the BIA in Pickering had meant to require an\n\nadjudication of the merits of aliens' claims of substantive defects\n\nin the original conviction in order to make out an adequate\n\n'basis,' it could have said so.   But it did not.\").   Thus, there\n\nis no difference between the stipulation here and the settlement in\n\nPinho in terms of whether the state court addressed and adjudicated\n\nthe underlying claims of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                -43-\n\f            Third, the majority notes that Pinho obtained a vacatur\n\nof his conviction before the agency had to take action in his case,\n\nwhereas Rumierz obtained a vacatur after a final order of removal\n\nwas reached in his case.        This distinction is inapposite for two\n\nreasons.     First, as I have explained above, the BIA effectively\n\nreopened Rumierz's case, thus vacating the final order of removal.\n\nSecond, even assuming that the final order of removal remained in\n\nplace, the fact that Rumierz obtained a vacatur after the order\n\ntells us nothing about whether the record evidence shows that the\n\nvacatur meets the Pickering standard. This argument relates to the\n\nmajority's burden allocation analysis, not the Pickering analysis.\n\nHere, as in Pinho, the record evidence shows that the stipulated\n\nvacatur meets the Pickering standard, even assuming arguendo that\n\nRumierz has the burden.\n\n            Thus,    as   the   Third      Circuit's    reasoning    in   Pinho\n\ndemonstrates, the factors relied upon by the majority here -- the\n\nlack   of   an   adjudication   on   the    merits,    uncertainty   over   the\n\nvalidity of the petitioner's claims of error in his conviction, and\n\nthe possibility that the State's Attorney was motivated by factors\n\nnot disclosed on the record -- are all inappropriate grounds for\n\ndeciding that the BIA was not compelled to conclude that the\n\nvacatur presented by Rumierz met the Pickering standard.              Pursuant\n\nto a proper analysis, the record compels a finding that Rumierz has\n\nmet the burden allocated to him by the BIA.\n\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\f          2.   Whether the vacatur meets the Pickering standard\n\n          In order to determine whether a vacatur is tied to a\n\ndefect in the underlying conviction, rather than rehabilitative or\n\nimmigration-related purposes, the BIA starts by examining the order\n\nitself.   See Pickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.        Often, the\n\nstatutory basis for the order will resolve whether the underlying\n\nconviction remains valid for immigration purposes.   Compare Matter\n\nof Adamiak, 23 I. & N. Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (holding that a\n\nconviction vacated under Ohio Revised Code § 2943.031 for the trial\n\ncourt's failure to advise the alien defendant of the possible\n\nimmigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid\n\nconviction for immigration purposes) and Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz,\n\n22 I. & N. Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000) (holding that a conviction\n\nvacated pursuant to Article 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure\n\nLaw, which is neither an expungement statute nor a rehabilitative\n\nstatute, did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes)\n\nwith Matter of Roldan, 22 I. & N. Dec. 512 (BIA 1999) (holding that\n\na conviction vacated by operation of a state rehabilitative statute\n\nstill constitutes a conviction for immigration purposes).\n\n          Where the order does not specify its statutory basis, the\n\nBIA will consider the grounds presented to the court by the\n\npetitioner in his or her motion to vacate the conviction.         See\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624 (\"The resolution of this case .\n\n. . turns on whether the conviction was quashed on the basis of a\n\n\n                               -45-\n\fdefect in the underlying criminal proceedings.            In making this\n\ndetermination, we look to the law under which the [] court issued\n\nits order and the terms of the order itself, as well as the reasons\n\npresented by the respondent in requesting that the court vacate the\n\nconviction.\" (footnote omitted)); see also Pinho, 432 F.3d at 215\n\n(\"To determine the basis for a vacatur order, the agency must look\n\nfirst to the order itself.        If the order explains the court's\n\nreasons for vacating the conviction, the agency's inquiry must end\n\nthere.   If the order does not give a clear statement of reasons,\n\nthe agency may look to the record before the court when the order\n\nwas issued.   No other evidence of reasons may be considered.\").\n\n          As mentioned above, the BIA will \"not look behind the\n\nstate court judgment to ascertain whether the court acted in\n\naccordance    with   its   own   law   in   vacating    the   conviction.\"\n\nPickering, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624.        Thus, if the record shows that\n\na state court vacated a conviction through a statutory mechanism\n\nfor addressing defects in the underlying conviction, the BIA will\n\nnot consider any suggestions by the government that the state court\n\nwas actually motivated by a desire to ameliorate the deportation\n\nconsequences rather than correct the defect.           See id.; Matter of\n\nRodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000);         see also\n\nPickering, -- F.3d at --; 2006 WL 1976043, at *4 n.3 (\"When a court\n\nacts pursuant to a law that allows it to act based only on the\n\nmerits of the underlying position, it is presumed not to have acted\n\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\fcontrary to that law, solely to enable the [p]etitioner to avoid\n\nadverse immigration consequences.\").\n\n            In Rumierz's case, the order striking and amending his\n\nconviction does not specify the statutory basis for the vacatur or\n\nthe nature of his claims for relief.        However, the Deputy State's\n\nAttorney's affidavit does explain that Rumierz filed a \"Petition\n\nfor Post-Conviction Relief\" in which he \"alleged certain errors in\n\nhis earlier conviction in Windsor District Court, Vermont.\"              The\n\naffidavit does not state that Rumierz sought expungement through a\n\nrehabilitative statute or that he claimed relief on immigration-\n\nrelated grounds.       The only reference in the affidavit is to errors\n\nin his conviction, alleged in his motion for post-conviction\n\nrelief.    While there is no statutory citation specified in the\n\naffidavit, Vermont's post-conviction relief statute specifies that\n\nrelief is only available through that statutory mechanism on \"the\n\nground    that   the    sentence   was   imposed   in   violation   of   the\n\nconstitution or laws of the United States, or of the state of\n\nVermont, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose the\n\nsentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum\n\nauthorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\"\n\n13 V.S.A. § 7131.24\n\n     24\n       The majority suggests that Rumierz might not have been able\nto avail himself of Vermont's post-conviction relief because he was\nno longer in custody in Vermont and had served his time for his\nconviction.    The notion that Rumierz, detained for ten years\npending removal due in part to this conviction for possession of\nstolen property, could not properly file a motion for post-\n\n                                    -47-\n\f          The BIA did not refer to these aspects of the affidavit,\n\nstating instead that \"there is no representation in the record\n\nregarding any kind of defects\" in Rumierz's conviction. Given that\n\nthe only representation in the record is that Rumierz sought and\n\nobtained a vacatur after alleging errors in his conviction, the\n\nBIA's reasoning is patently erroneous. The record here compels the\n\nconclusion that the vacatur in this case meets the Pickering\n\nstandard.25 By contrast, there is simply no indication that Rumierz\n\nsought or could have been granted post-conviction relief based on\n\nthe grounds proscribed by the BIA in Pickering.26        For these\n\n\nconviction relief under the Vermont statute is plainly contrary to\nVermont law. See In re Stewart, 438 A.2d 1106 (Vt. 1981).\n     25\n        While I appreciate the majority's concern that some\npetitioners may seek to avoid or delay deportation by taking\nadvantage of overburdened state attorneys, ante at 23 n.15, I\ndisagree that these policy concerns are implicated here. Rumierz,\npro-se at the time of the BIA proceedings, is relying not on his\nown unsubstantiated claims that he alleged errors in his\nconviction, but on the sworn statement of the State's Attorney in\nhis case.   To be sure, this case would have been much easier if\nRumierz had supplied the BIA with his post-conviction relief\npetition, but given the State's Attorney's acknowledgment that his\npetition was based on \"errors in his earlier conviction,\" I would\nnot characterize these actions as \"gamesmanship\" on his part.\n     26\n        The Sixth Circuit's recent decision in Pickering is\nparticularly on point here. See Pickering, -- F.3d --; 2006 WL\n1976043. In that case, the court vacated the decision of the BIA,\nnoting that its \"conclusion that [the court that vacated\nPickering's conviction] acted solely for immigration reasons can\nonly be reached by inference\" and that inference was contrary to\nthe record. Id. at *5. Although the Sixth Circuit held that the\ngovernment had the burden of establishing removability, it noted\nthat even if the burden were with the petitioner, he met it. Id.\nat * 4 n.3.    Specifically, the court observed that \"[t]he only\nlegal authority cited anywhere in the record of [the court that\nvacated his conviction] allows it to act only to redress violations\n\n                               -48-\n\freasons,   I   would      vacate   the   BIA's   decision   and    remand    for\n\ntermination    of   the    removal   proceedings,    without      reaching   the\n\nquestion of whether the allocation of the burden in this case was\n\nproper.\n\n\n\n\nof the [p]etitioner's rights.\" Id. Thus, in order to have found\nthat the petitioner was removable on this record, the BIA must have\n\"assumed that [the court] ignored the legal basis the Petitioner\narticulated for seeking to have his conviction quashed.\" Id. at *3.\nThe Sixth Circuit thus vacated the decision, holding that the\nrecord compelled the BIA to conclude that the petitioner's\nconviction was not vacated solely for rehabilitative or\nimmigration-related reasons.    Id. at *5.    Here, too, the only\nreferences in the record regarding the basis of Rumierz's vacatur\nare to his claims of \"errors in his earlier conviction\" and his\n\"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.\"        The inference that\nRumierz's conviction was vacated by stipulation for rehabilitative\nor immigration-related purposes is flatly contrary to the record.\n\n                                     -49-\n\f",

Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), for vacating an order of removal presented in a belated motion and premised on the post-final-order-of-removal vacating of the underlying state court conviction. In the circumstances of this case, the BIA held that the alien had not met that burden. Because we cannot say that either the facts before it or the law compelled the BIA to reach the opposite result, we affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antoni A. Rumierz, a Polish citizen who entered this country as an immigrant in 1980, was ordered removed from the United States by the BIA on August 18, 2000, on the basis that he had been convicted twice in state courts of receiving stolen property, which are crimes of moral turpitude for federal immigration purposes. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before that, in 1999, the BIA had found Rumierz removable on the same basis, but had remanded to the Immigration Judge (IJ) to determine whether Rumierz nonetheless should be granted a waiver of relief under former &#167; 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1994) (repealed 1996). The IJ denied &#167; 212(c) relief as a matter of discretion on December 10, 1999; this decision was affirmed in the BIA's August 2000 order. Deportation proceedings had initially commenced in March 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its August 2000 order, the BIA expressly found that the government had met its burden to show that the two prior convictions were sufficient to establish Rumierz's deportability; it also noted that the two convictions had not been vacated. There is no doubt the criminal convictions, one of which was a January 1994 Vermont conviction, were qualifying crimes of moral turpitude. Rumierz did not petition for review of the BIA's August 2000 order, nor did he file a motion with the BIA to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2001, Rumierz filed a pro se writ of habeas corpus, which was heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> No doubt he did this because the ninety-day filing deadline to bring new evidence to the BIA under either a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider had long since expired. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c)(2) (1999) (recodified at 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in 2002, two years after the BIA had entered its final order of removal and the time for reopening had passed, Rumierz sought to vacate the January 1994 predicate conviction in Vermont. On application by Rumierz, a Vermont court entered, on August 23, 2002, an \"Agreement and Stipulation,\" which struck the conviction for possession of stolen property and amended it to negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Negligent operation of a motor vehicle is not a crime of moral turpitude under the immigration laws. Rumierz brought the vacating of the conviction to the attention of the district court. The government responded with an affidavit from a Vermont Deputy State's Attorney, which stated that Rumierz had petitioned for post-conviction relief on the basis of allegations of \"certain errors in his earlier conviction.\" The affidavit also stated that \"[t]he merits of Petitioner's claim were not addressed or adjudicated in connection with the `Agreement and Stipulation.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court on September 25, 2003, at Rumierz's request, directed the BIA \"to reconsider its [August 18, 2000] decision in light of subsequent developments, including the Agreement and Stipulation, dated August 23, 2002 from the Superior Court, Windsor County, Vermont.\" The district court order did not itself vacate the order of removal or order the BIA either directly or indirectly to vacate the order of removal. It also did not hold that Rumierz had met the standard used by the BIA to determine whether to reopen proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, as instructed, reconsidered based on the record sent to it by the district court, and denied relief, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon further consideration, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed. The August 23, 2002, \"Agreement and Stipulation\" from the Vermont court states only that [Rumierz's] conviction for possession of stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor vehicle.\" There is nothing in the record to indicate that this conviction was stricken based on any defect in the original conviction. An affidavit from a Vermont Deputy State's Attorney states that, \"the merits of Petitioner's claim were not addressed or adjudicated\" in connection with the Agreement and Stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In [<i>In re Pickering</i>], we held that where a court order quashing a conviction, and the documents supporting the request to quash, did not identify a basis for questioning the integrity of the underlying criminal proceeding or conviction, the conviction remained valid for immigration purposes. In that case, the alien's affidavit stated that the conviction was a bar to his lawful permanent resident status in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that, particularly this late in the proceedings (where the conviction in question was entered in January of 1994, and where deportation proceedings began in March of 1994), [Rumierz] must present evidence to show that the Vermont court's action in striking the stolen property conviction was tied to a defect in that conviction, rather than related in part to immigration proceedings. Here, there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the respondent's Vermont conviction, and, as noted above, the state's attorney has stated that in striking the conviction, the judge did not address or adjudicate the merits of [Rumierz's] claim. Under these circumstances, the respondent has not shown that the Vermont conviction for possession of stolen property is not still valid for immigration purposes. We therefore find that the respondent remains deportable as charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA order had two major components. First, it utilized the substantive standard the BIA had established in <i>In re Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 621, under which a vacated conviction is no longer a \"conviction\" within the meaning of the immigration laws only \"if a court with jurisdiction vacates [the] conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> at 624. Under <i>Herrera-Inirio v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir.2000), which pre-dates and is independent of <i>Pickering,</i> the rule is the same:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The emphasis that Congress placed on the original admission of guilt plainly indicates that a subsequent dismissal of charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the merits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, does not vitiate that original admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 306. Second, the BIA held in the circumstances of this case the alien bore the burden of demonstrating that the striking of the state conviction \"was tied to a defect in that conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Rumierz renewed his habeas petition in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. The case was transferred to this court on petition for review under section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 302, 311 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252 note).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz makes four arguments attacking the BIA's conclusions. We quote from his brief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the BIA incorrectly placed the burden of proving deportability on Mr. Rumierz and not on the government where he has been charged with deportability. Second, the stipulated order is entitled to full faith and credit by the BIA without regard to the Vermont Court's reasons for effecting the modification or reduction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Third, even if the BIA can look behind the stipulated order, the <i>government has not met its burden</i> of proving deportability by clear and convincing evidence or that Mr. Rumierz's case runs afoul of [<i>In re Pickering</i>] in that no reliable evidence has been submitted showing that the criminal conviction was vacated solely due to immigration or rehabilitative reasons. Finally, as a matter of procedural due process the BIA should have terminated proceedings with prejudice after one remand to amend the [order to show cause]. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Burden of Demonstrating Predicate Conviction</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial question presented by Rumierz's arguments is whether the BIA's allocation of the burden on the alien, in these circumstances, to demonstrate that the <i>Pickering</i> standard has been met is either contrary to the relevant statute or an impermissible construction of the statute. <i>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The odd procedural posture in which this case came to the BIA&#8212;through a district court order that the BIA reconsider in light of the vacated conviction &#8212; makes no difference to the standard of review we use to determine whether we can reverse the choice of the BIA to place the burden on the petitioner on these facts. Nor does it make a difference to our standard of review of the BIA's ruling that Rumierz had not met his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz argues that the BIA's allocation of burdens is inconsistent with the statute. He says that under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101(a)(48)(A) and 1229a(c)(3)(A), the government must always bear the burden of proof on showing a conviction of a crime of moral turpitude, regardless of whether the issue arises in the context of the alien having vacated the conviction after a final order of removal. He also argues that the placing of the burden on him is inconsistent with two Board rulings: <i>Pickering</i> and <i>In re Ortiz-Herrera,</i> Ark-xvm-ewb, 2005 WL 3016102 (BIA Aug. 2, 2005) (unpublished decision). However, <i>Ortiz-Herrera</i> has no precedential value,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and <i>Pickering</i> does not address the issue of burdens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first prong of the <i>Chevron</i> test asks \"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Rumierz relies heavily on the INA section defining the term \"conviction\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty to be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(A). This section itself does not assign burdens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a provides that the burden of proof is on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that, in the case of an alien who has been lawfully admitted to the United States, the alien is deportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the proceeding, the [DHS] has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that, in the case of an alien who has been admitted to the United States, the alien is deportable. No decision on deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A). The BIA found, in both its August 2000 order and its February 2004 order after reconsideration, that the government had met its burden in the proceedings leading to the August 2000 removal order. Rumierz does not contest that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both statutes, however, are silent on who has the burden of showing the effect of convictions which are vacated or modified after final orders of removal have entered. <i>See Pinho v. Gonzales,</i> 432 F.3d 193, 206 (3d Cir.2005) (noting that \"[n]othing in the statute specifically addresses vacated convictions\" and turning to a <i>Chevron</i> analysis). Thus, Congress has not spoken directly to the issue, and the BIA's position cannot be said to be contrary to the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the second prong of the <i>Chevron</i> analysis, \"whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,\" 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, a court must uphold the BIA's interpretation of a silent or ambiguous statute so long as it is reasonable and consistent with the statute. <i>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 445 n. 29, 447-48, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <i>Estrada-Canales v. Gonzales,</i> 437 F.3d 208, 214-15 (1st Cir.2006). Further, as we noted in <i>Herrera-Inirio,</i> \"[b]ecause agency officials acting in the immigration context `exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,' deference to administrative expertise is particularly appropriate.\" 208 F.3d at 304 (internal citation omitted) (quoting <i>INS v. Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placing the burden on the alien in these circumstances is consistent with BIA regulations. This allocation of burdens accords with the usual BIA rules that the burden is on the alien to show that there is a reason to reopen or to reconsider the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Even if a prima facie case for relief is shown, the BIA \"has discretion to deny a motion to reopen.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(a); <i>see also Maryam v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the placing of the burden on the alien in these circumstances serves the interest of finality. That interest in finality is already reflected in the statutes and the BIA's rules, which both set time limits for motions to reopen and place the burden on the alien seeking to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Abudu,</i> 485 U.S. at 107-08, 108 S.Ct. 904. As the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Motions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored for the same reasons as are petitions for rehearing and motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. This is especially true in a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>INS v.

Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (en banc). The BIA, in <i>In re Beckford,</i> held that when an alien files a motion to reopen (purporting to attack a predicate conviction underlying a removal order), the burden is on the alien to show that the conditions for reopening have been met, even though the burden had been on the government initially to show that the alien was removable. <i>Id.</i> at 1218. Where the motion to reopen is untimely, for example, where the state conviction is not vacated until after the time period for filing motions to reopen has expired, then the burden is also on the alien to establish that the motion presents an exceptional situation warranting further review. <i>Id.</i> As <i>Beckford</i> said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current posture of this case is critical to our decision. Were this case now before us on direct appeal, we might be inclined to remand for a further hearing. However, the fact that this is an untimely motion necessarily changes our point of view. A criminal defendant is initially the beneficiary of the rule that the government must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, once having been found guilty, the defendant bears the burden of proof if he wishes to attack that finding. Similarly, the Service initially bears the burden of proof in a removal proceeding, <i>but once an alien is found removable (and that finding is upheld on appeal, if an appeal is taken), the burden shifts to the alien who wishes to attack that finding.</i> We note that, even where a motion to reopen is not untimely, the motion will not be granted unless there is a reasonable likelihood of success upon reopening. This is particularly so when the motion seeking further review of the finding is untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted) (citing <i>Taylor v.

A shift of burden from the government to the individual when there is a collateral attack on a final judgment, as here, is quite common in the criminal law. For instance, the Court has placed the burden of proof on federal habeas petitioners who, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, seek to vacate an already-imposed federal sentence on the basis that predicate state offenses had been vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See Daniels v. United States,</i> 532 U.S. 374, 382, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001); <i>Custis v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 485, 496-97, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994); <i>cf.

United States,</i> 544 U.S. 295, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005), which held that the defendant's failure to act with due diligence in overturning a predicate state conviction underlying sentencing enhancement precluded resort to a renewed limitations period under the federal habeas statute. <i>See id.</i> at 310-11, 125 S.Ct. 1571.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the challenge to the BIA's decision to place the burden of proof on Rumierz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Whether the BIA Was Compelled to Hold that Rumierz Had Met Pickering Standard</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review of the substance of the BIA's decision that Rumierz did not meet his burden is quite narrow. The BIA's \"decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(C). Furthermore, the BIA's \"administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be <i>compelled</i> to conclude to the contrary.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added). \"This standard of review as to factual questions is commonly known as the `substantial evidence test,' and substantial evidence exists where the decision is `supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>Estrada-Canales,</i> 437 F.3d at 215 (quoting <i>Katebi v.

It is well accepted that not every vacating of a state court conviction makes the conviction invalid for purposes of immigration law. As this court held in <i>Herrera-Inirio,</i> 208 F.3d 299:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The emphasis that Congress placed on the <i>original</i> admission of guilt plainly indicates that a subsequent dismissal of charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the merits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, does not vitiate that original admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 306; <i>see also Renteria-Gonzalez v.

Thus, if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction <i>based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings,</i> the respondent no longer has a \"conviction\" within the meaning of [INA] section 101(a)(48)(A).

In addition, the Attorney General noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State laws that authorize the subsequent expungement of a conviction typically do so for reasons that are entirely unrelated to the legal propriety of the underlying judgment of conviction&#8212;reasons, in other words, that are unrelated to concerns about the factual basis for, or the procedural validity of, the conviction. These state expungement laws authorize a conviction to be expunged in order to serve rehabilitative ends and without reference to the merits of the underlying adjudication of guilt. Such expunged convictions would appear, therefore, to survive as formal adjudications of guilt entered by a court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 713 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We outlined Rumierz's four arguments earlier. They are almost entirely dependent on his argument, which we have rejected, that the burden was on the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying, as we must, the rule in <i>Herrera-Inirio,</i> it is clear that the mere fact that the state court vacated the conviction does not require the BIA to vacate the order of removal, contrary to Rumierz's argument. Also applying <i>Herrera-Inirio</i> and <i>Pickering,</i> it was Rumierz's burden to show that the vacating of the Vermont conviction was based on a procedural or substantive invalidity as defined by <i>Pickering.</i> Rumierz's criticisms<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> of the BIA decision, in any event, do not convince us that the BIA was compelled to reach a different conclusion. To support his argument, Rumierz points first to the Vermont state court order (the \"Agreement and Stipulation\") itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's inquiry started with this Vermont court order, which is consistent with how the BIA approached the issue in <i>Pickering.</i> As the BIA noted, all that was docketed in state court was an \"Agreement and Stipulation\" stating that the conviction for possession for stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor vehicle.\" On its face, the order fails to show, as required by <i>Pickering,</i> that the prior conviction was vacated because of \"a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\" 23 I. &amp; N. Dec at 624. All that the state court order says is that the court had accepted an agreement of the parties to vacate the conviction. The BIA opinion, we note, did not say that it would never terminate an order of removal based on a conviction which had been vacated by stipulation. Nor did it say that the sole factor on which it found Rumierz had not met his burden was that the vacating was based on a stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his claim that the stipulation here was sufficient to invalidate the conviction within the meaning of the immigration laws, Rumierz points to <i>Pinho v. Gonzales,</i> 432 F.3d 193. <i>Pinho</i> does not help him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The question is not whether an agreement or stipulation vacating a conviction can ever serve as a basis for vacating an order of removal, but whether the BIA was compelled to accept the stipulation here. <i>Pinho</i> does not say that the BIA must accept every stipulation which leads to vacating a conviction, whatever the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz argues that the record, in fact, does show that he had raised a valid claim of a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, as required by <i>Pickering.</i> Rumierz points to the state attorney's affidavit, which states that Rumierz alleged \"certain errors in his earlier conviction.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The BIA considered the state attorney's affidavit, but concluded that it was insufficient to meet Rumierz's burden of showing that the conviction was vacated based on a defect in the underlying proceedings, especially since the affidavit stated that \"the merits of [Rumierz's] claim were not addressed or adjudicated in connection with the `Agreement or Stipulation.'\" The BIA concluded that \"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the respondent's conviction\" and that \"[u]nder these circumstances, [Rumierz] has not shown that the Vermont conviction . . . is not still valid for immigration purposes.\" Again, a court does not review this conclusion de novo, but asks only whether any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Going beyond the arguments presented by Rumierz, the dissent's position is that the BIA was <i>compelled</i> to conclude that the vacated conviction in this case&#8212;which had been vacated not after adjudication of the merits of Rumierz's motion to vacate, but pursuant to an agreement and stipulation between the defendant and the state's attorney&#8212;meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard, simply by dint of the fact that Rumierz had claimed \"certain errors\" through a motion for post-conviction relief in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA was not <i>obligated,</i> as a matter of law, to accept that the stipulation and agreement&#8212;vacating a state law conviction for unstated reasons, entered into long after the state punishment had ceased and after a final order of removal&#8212;was sufficient to render the state conviction invalid within the meaning of <i>Pickering</i> based on evidence that \"certain errors\" were alleged. There is nothing in the federal immigration laws that requires such a result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the BIA is not required to conclude that the mere filing of a petition for post-conviction relief claiming \"certain errors\" which results in a stipulation means that the petitioner has raised <i>valid</i> claims of defects in the state criminal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, under <i>Pickering,</i> it is not enough to show that there was an allegation of a cognizable defect in the state proceedings; instead the alien must also show that \"a court with jurisdiction vacate[d] the conviction <i>based on</i> a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\" 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624. Here, even beyond the fact that Rumierz can point to nothing more than the allegation of \"certain errors,\" he cannot show that the stipulation was \"based on\" those errors. A state's attorney, rather than challenging the petition, may have agreed to a stipulated motion to vacate the conviction for any number of reasons other than the strength and validity of those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address another argument, which Rumierz did not make before the agency (or the district court) or to this court, and so, we hold, is precluded by the exhaustion doctrine and waived. <i>See Boakai v. Gonzales,</i> 447 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2006). Nonetheless, we comment on it because it is heavily relied on by the dissent. Nothing in the record of the state court proceedings that was before the BIA&#8212;the \"Agreement and Stipulation\" or the state attorney's affidavit&#8212;refers to a particular state statute defining the post-conviction procedure used by Rumierz. The dissent nonetheless assumes that Rumierz used the procedure set forth in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &#167; 7131, and that this means the grounds stated by Rumierz for relief from the state convictions are necessarily all grounds eligible for <i>Pickering</i> relief. The argument is based on certain assumptions, which Rumierz could have easily supported with evidence, had the assumptions been true. But Rumierz chose not to give the BIA such evidence. By its own terms the Vermont statute, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &#167; 7131, only applies to \"[a] prisoner who is in custody under sentence of a court and claims the right to be released\" because of a defect in the conviction. <i>Id.</i> Rumierz was not in custody in Vermont and had served his time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The fact that Rumierz may have used a particular post-conviction relief statute does not mean that the BIA was required to hold that Rumierz had, in fact, raised valid claims of defects in the underlying criminal proceedings or that the state's attorney agreed to vacate the conviction because of the strength or validity of those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Remaining Claims</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz raises a number of other claims which were never raised to the BIA and are barred by the exhaustion doctrine. Rumierz argues the BIA was obligated to tell him he was eligible for naturalization and so the order of removal should be vacated. Even if the claim had been exhausted, Rumierz was not eligible because he was already in deportation proceedings and so was precluded from naturalization. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1429 (\"[N]o application for naturalization shall be considered by the Attorney General if there is pending against the applicant a removal proceeding. . . .\"). As the DHS notes, there is no inequity. Rumierz entered the United States as an immigrant in 1980; he had a number of years before the start of his deportation proceedings to seek naturalization but never once did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz also argues that the IJ who initially heard his case was biased. The claim is defaulted because it was never presented to the BIA. We lack jurisdiction. <i>See Ishak v. Gonzales,</i> 422 F.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz also argues that because he has spent the last decade in DHS detention, as a general equitable matter he should be released now and permitted to remain in the country. For any number of doctrinal reasons, the argument is not cognizable, but a few words are in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At base Rumierz's claim is that when the alien has committed, as he has, more than two crimes involving moral turpitude, all of these crimes should be charged by the DHS in the initial deportation hearings. Here, part of the reason for the ten years of detention is that the government initially relied on a 1989 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering (as well as the Vermont conviction) and the IJ found Rumierz deportable. While that decision was on appeal to the BIA, Rumierz succeeded in vacating the Massachusetts conviction. The BIA permitted the DHS, on remand to the IJ, to add a different Massachusetts conviction in 1995 for receiving stolen property. The IJ again found him deportable in 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz allowed the various proceedings to run their course and only after the August 2000 BIA final order of removal did he seek to vacate his Vermont conviction in 2002. The delay is entirely caused by Rumierz. His case has been ably handled by his counsel. There is, now, no basis for him to continue to avoid removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>deny</i> the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to the government, Rumierz initially filed his habeas petition in Rhode Island, but the petition was transferred to the U.S. District Court in New Jersey</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Pickering's actual case, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the BIA's rule about vacated convictions, but reversed the BIA's order of removal on the grounds that the government had not met its burden under the specific facts of that case<i>Pickering v.

The BIA there found that where a predicate conviction was vacated after removal proceedings had begun, but before a final order of removal has been issued, the government \"retain[ed] the burden of going forward to establish removability\" and of establishing that the conviction was not vacated due to a defect in the underlying proceedings. <i>Ortiz-Herrera,</i> 2005 WL 3016102.

In any event, whether or not the BIA relied on <i>Beckford</i> is not the point. Its placement of the burdens is rational.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Further, no court has ruled against this allocation of burdens. In <i>Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir.2005), the court noted its view that where a state court conviction had been modified, the burden was on the government of showing the necessary predicate conviction for removal purposes (that is, an aggravated felony, under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)). <i>See id.</i> at 1130.

The Vermont conviction had been entered in 1994. Rumierz had counsel from at least June 1995, when his case was first heard by the IJ, until sometime in 1999. This gave him nearly four years during which he was represented by counsel to challenge the Vermont conviction. Indeed, during this time period&#8212;in September 1995&#8212;Rumierz was able to obtain a state vacatur of another predicate conviction, from Massachusetts (which the DHS then substituted with a different Massachusetts predicate conviction)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The dissent incorrectly says that the only argument the government made in its initial brief supporting the BIA's allocation of the burden was that the alien was in a better position to establish the circumstances of the vacatur; the dissent concludes that all other arguments were waived.

Dec. 849 (BIA 2005), argues to us (but had not argued to the BIA) that \"the BIA should be precluded from even inquiring into the reasons for the modification of the court's order in this case.\" This is flatly contrary to both <i>Pickering</i> and <i>Herrera-Inirio,</i> and mixes apples and oranges. The question in <i>Cota-Vargas</i> was whether a state sentencing modification <i>nunc pro tunc</i> meant that the <i>\"term of imprisonment</i>\" within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(<i>B</i>) was now less than that required to allow a conviction to constitute a predicate offense. <i>See</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 852. Our issue is different, whether a <i>\"conviction\"</i> exists within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(<i>A</i>). Indeed, the BIA in <i>Cota-Vargas</i> distinguished <i>Pickering</i> on the grounds that it involved subparagraph (A) rather than (B). <i>See</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 851-52. Further, it is well settled that \"a state court expungement of a conviction is qualitatively different from a state court order to classify an offense or modify a sentence.\" <i>Garcia-Lopez v. Ashcroft,</i> 334 F.3d 840, 846 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Rumierz raises two other arguments for the first time in his reply brief that were not raised to the BIA: First he argues that the BIA was required to follow a lock-step analysis, where it looks first to the order vacating the conviction and, if the order is silent, to the record of post-conviction relief, and if there was any claim of error made, it must treat the conviction as vacated for immigration law purposes. Second, Rumierz argues that the BIA could not review new evidence itself, but was required to remand to the IJ to hear evidence and to engage in fact-finding as to his reasons for seeking reversal. Both arguments are barred by exhaustion doctrine, and are waived in this court<i>See Boakai v. Gonzales,</i> 447 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Diva's Inc. v. City of Bangor,</i> 411 F.3d 30, 39 (1st Cir.2005). Further, for the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ would have been fruitless. There was no dispute before the BIA as to the content of the state court record, and Rumierz already had ample opportunity to provide the exact reasons he gave to the Vermont court for vacating the conviction and had utterly failed to do so.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> <i>Pinho</i> is legally and factually distinguishable on several other fronts. Importantly, the <i>Pinho</i> court, relying on a full record of the state court proceedings, including hearing transcripts, 432 F.3d at 196-97, expressly relied on the fact that Pinho had raised a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a clear \"defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 211. Here, by contrast, the BIA had a sparse record consisting only of the state court order and an affidavit from the state attorney, neither of which demonstrate that Rumierz had raised a valid claim of any defect. Also, in <i>Pinho</i> there was no statement from a state's attorney that the merits of the petitioner's claim had not been addressed or adjudicated. Furthermore, the alien in <i>Pinho</i> had vacated his state convictions well before the INS had considered the alien's application for adjustment of status (the government in <i>Pinho</i> argued that his state conviction had made the alien ineligible for adjustment of status). <i>Id.</i> at 198. Here, the conviction was vacated after a final order of removal had entered.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> This case does not raise the<i>Shepard</i>-type sentencing guidelines issue of what evidence the BIA may look at in determining whether a vacated conviction remains valid for immigration law purposes. <i>See Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The BIA and the courts are free to consider the reasons stated in the stipulated order to amend the state court conviction. <i>See, e.g., Ali v. Ashcroft,</i> 395 F.3d 722, 729 (7th Cir.2005). And Rumierz does not challenge the BIA's consideration of the state attorney's affidavit; indeed, he relies on it. In the absence of a statutory directive, such as that which exists under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, it seems to us that the issue of what the BIA considers, and in what order, is one for the BIA in the first instance, to be tested, if necessary, only under <i>Chevron.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> If Rumierz's position were correct, all it would take for an alien to avoid or delay deportation on the basis of old predicate state convictions is to wait until the final order of removal had been entered, make invalid claims for post-conviction relief in state court, find a state attorney who has more pressing matters than defending an old conviction, have the conviction vacated by agreement without having the merits of his claim addressed or adjudicated, and return to the BIA to reopen the case claiming that he had alleged \"certain errors,\" without describing what those errors actually were or providing a record of the state proceedings. This would either force the government to find a new ground for deportation and start the proceedings over again, or, even worse, allow the alien (who had already been found deportable for having two or more convictions for crimes of moral turpitude) to remain in the country, even though the alien had never demonstrated to anyone that there was even the suggestion of a defect in the state criminal proceedings. The immigration system was simply not designed to allow this sort of gamesmanship by criminal aliens</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The dissent asserts that Vermont courts have broadly interpreted its post-conviction relief statute to cover Rumierz's situation.

The majority emphasizes that there is no evidence of the validity of Rumierz's claim of errors in his underlying conviction; that the stipulated vacatur was not the result of an adjudication on the merits of Rumierz's claim of errors; and that there is no evidence that the state's attorney agreed to the stipulated vacatur because of the claim of errors. I disagree that Rumierz has failed to meet the burden assigned to him by the BIA. Because I conclude that he met that burden, I would not reach the more difficult issue of whether the BIA properly placed the burden on the petitioner in this case. Indeed, there is good reason to question whether the majority's analysis of the issue comports with the procedural posture of this case or with the arguments invoked by the BIA and the government in support of the allocation of the burden. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Allocation of Burden</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the majority acknowledges the \"odd procedural posture\" of this case, <i>ante</i> at 36, it does not acknowledge that this procedural posture undermines its analysis of the allocation of the burden. In concluding that the BIA properly placed the burden of contesting removability on Rumierz, the majority treats the BIA's decision as the equivalent of a denial of a motion to reopen. <i>See ante</i> at 37-38. This is an inaccurate characterization of the BIA's actions. Here, a federal district court remanded the case (initially brought through a habeas petition) to the BIA to \"reconsider its last decision in light of subsequent developments, including the Agreement and Stipulation, dated August 23, 2002, from the Superior Court, Windsor County, Vermont.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> This was not a directive from the court to the BIA to decide <i>whether</i> it should reopen its last decision (which would be the threshold decision that the BIA would have to make if presented with a motion to reopen). Nor did the BIA treat the remand as such. We have explained that \"[t]he filing of a motion to reopen with the BIA is not a vehicle for trying an issue, but is merely a request for the opportunity to try it.\" <i>Dacosta v. Gonzales,</i> 449 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir.2006). If the BIA here had denied an untimely motion to reopen, it would have framed its decision in an entirely different manner, citing the regulations for motions to reopen and explaining why it would not reopen Rumierz's case. Instead, the BIA began its analysis by stating that, \"[u]pon further consideration, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\" It considered the question of removability in light of the vacatur and then concluded that Rumierz's conviction was still valid for removal purposes and \"therefore . . . the respondent remains deportable as charged. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\" This language demonstrates that the BIA, as instructed, reopened Rumierz's administrative proceedings but concluded that Rumierz was nonetheless removable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distinction is important because the BIA's reopening of a case vacates the final order of removal and reopens the administrative removal proceedings. <i>See id.</i> During administrative removal proceedings, the government has the burden of proving by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the petitioner is subject to removal on the basis of his convictions. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A); <i>see also Pickering v. Gonzales,</i> 454 F.3d 525, 527 (6th Cir.2006) (concluding that, once the petitioner produces evidence that his conviction has been vacated, \"the [p]etitioner is deportable only if the government can show, with clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence, that the conviction was vacated solely for immigration reasons\"); <i>Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d 1125, 1130 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that, in a case where the petitioner obtained post-conviction relief reducing his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, \"the evidence of record is legally insufficient to satisfy the INS's stringent burden of proof and, thus, . . . the order for removal must be reversed\"); <i>Sandoval v. INS,</i> 240 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir.2001) (\"In order to show that Sandoval's original conviction for possessing more than thirty grams of marijuana remained in effect, the INS could have shown 1) that the Illinois judge exceeded his authority under state law, thus rendering the modification ineffective, or 2) that the sentence modification was legal but not effective for purposes of federal immigration law. We find that the INS did not establish either of these factual situations by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> If, as I believe the record establishes, the BIA actually reopened Rumierz's case in response to the district court's order, rather than simply adjudicating the case as a request for reopening, the BIA erred in its allocation of the burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would therefore be improper to defer to the agency's error under <i>Chevron.</i> The majority observes that the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") is \"silent on who has the burden of showing the effect of convictions which are vacated or modified after final orders of removal have entered.\" <i>Ante</i> at 36.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> That may be true, but if the proceedings were reopened in this case (thus vacating the final order of removal), that observation misses the point. The applicable statutory provision, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A), is <i>not</i> silent on who has the burden of showing the effect of a conviction, vacated or not, <i>during</i> administrative removal proceedings. As the plain language of the statute states, and as the aforementioned cases explain, the government has the burden of establishing removability during removal proceedings. Thus, if the BIA reopened Rumierz's administrative removal proceedings but denied his appeal, it misapplied the allocation of burden under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A) and there is no basis for applying <i>Chevron</i> deference to its shifting of the burden to the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulation, cases, and analogies relied upon by the majority to support its contrary view of the case only further undermine its conclusion. None of these regulations, cases, or analogies&#8212;applicable to motions to reopen&#8212;were mentioned in the BIA decision or by the government in its briefs. The BIA never cited 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2, the regulation governing motions to reopen, <i>ante</i> at 37, or <i>In re Beckford,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000), a case in which the BIA rejected an untimely motion to reopen where the petitioner conceded removability, <i>see ante</i> at 37-38. For its part, the government also said nothing of motions to reopen or the standards governing them until oral argument, where it raised for the first time the argument that the BIA treated this case as a motion to reopen. In its brief, the only argument the government raised in support of the BIA's allocation of the burden in this case was that \"an alien who obtains a [vacatur] of a state court conviction is clearly in a better position tha[n] DHS personnel to have access to documentation regarding the circumstances of the vacatur.\" The weakness of this argument as a justification for burden shifting is readily apparent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> which is perhaps why the majority opinion does not even mention it. In any event, the arguments upon which the majority relies are not the arguments expressed in the BIA decision nor arguments raised in the government's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said many times that \"[w]e must judge the action of an administrative agency based only on the reasoning provided by the agency, not based on substitute grounds we construct ourselves to salvage the agency's action.\" <i>Ymeri v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2004). Furthermore, \"[w]e have consistently held that, except in extraordinary circumstances, arguments not raised in a party's initial brief and instead raised for the first time at oral argument are considered waived.\" <i>United States v.

Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Here, the majority both constructs new grounds to salvage the BIA's action and, in so doing, relies on arguments not raised in the government's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This unorthodox approach is apparently necessary to defend a BIA decision that cannot be defended on its own terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> From my reading of the BIA's decision, the BIA reopened but ultimately denied Rumierz's administrative appeal. In so doing, the BIA erred in allocating the burden to Rumierz under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A). In any event, the majority's decision to reframe the BIA's decision and supply new reasoning aside, we did not have to reach this difficult issue here. As I describe in further detail below, I conclude that Rumierz has met the burden allocated to him by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rumierz's Vacatur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA stated that Rumierz \"must present evidence to show that the Vermont court's action in striking the stolen property conviction was tied to a defect in that conviction, rather than related in part to immigration proceedings.\" Although the record evidence here is sparse,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> it includes (1) an \"Agreement and Stipulation\" that the conviction for possession of stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor vehicle\" and (2) an affidavit of Deputy State's Attorney Matthew Huntington regarding the Agreement and Stipulation that states that Rumierz raised \"errors in his earlier conviction in Windsor District Court, Vermont\" through a \"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.\" Without acknowledging the affidavit's reference to Rumierz's claims of errors in his conviction, the BIA stated that \"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the respondent's Vermont conviction, and . . . the state's attorney has stated that in striking the conviction, the judge did not address or adjudicate the merits of the respondent's claim.\" For these reasons alone, the BIA concluded that Rumierz failed to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the BIA's decision, the majority again bases its reasoning on grounds not relied upon by the BIA or raised in the brief of the government. Specifically, the majority acknowledges the affidavit's reference to Rumierz's claims of errors in his conviction, but asserts that there is no evidence that Rumierz raised \"<i>valid</i> claims of defects\" in his criminal proceedings and that the state's attorney, in agreeing to the stipulated motion, may have done so \"for any number of reasons other than the strength and validity of those claims,\" <i>ante</i> at 42-43. For these reasons, the majority holds that the record does not compel the BIA to conclude that Rumierz has failed to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's decision reflects the erroneous notion that a vacatur must follow an adjudication on the merits of claimed legal errors or some further inquiry regarding the validity of the claims and any hidden reasons behind the government's agreement to the stipulation. Such requirements are a misapplication of <i>In re Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). The proper approach in this case is to examine whether Rumierz has provided evidence that the stipulated order was based on defects in his underlying conviction, rather than grounds proscribed by <i>Pickering.</i> Following this approach, I conclude that the BIA was compelled to find that Rumierz met the burden allocated to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Vacatur by stipulation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Pickering,</i> the BIA explained that \"if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a `conviction' [for immigration purposes]. If, however, a court vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent remains `convicted' for immigration purposes.\" 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624; <i>see also Herrera-Inirio v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 299, 306 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[A] subsequent dismissal of charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the merits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, does not vitiate that original admission [of guilt].\"). Nothing in <i>Pickering</i> precludes a stipulated vacatur from invalidating a conviction as a ground for removal or for other immigration purposes, provided that the vacatur is still based on a defect in the underlying conviction rather than rehabilitative or otherwise proscribed grounds. <i>See Pinho v. Gonzales,</i> 432 F.3d 193 (3rd Cir.2005) (holding that the petitioner's vacatur, obtained by settlement rather than adjudication, meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard because the petitioner claimed a defect in his underlying conviction); <i>Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d at 1131 (explaining that if \"a substantive challenge to and/or showing of the inappropriateness of the felony conviction prodded the State into stipulating to a vacatur of the conviction and its replacement by a misdemeanor,\" then \"[o]n this scenario, petitioner's vacated felony conviction would not satisfy the test for removal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority acknowledges that some stipulated vacaturs might suffice to meet the <i>Pickering</i> standard and that, in this case, the BIA did not deny Rumierz's appeal based solely on the fact that his vacatur was obtained by stipulation. Yet, in affirming the decision of the BIA, the majority emphasizes several factors that are characteristic of stipulations&#8212;i.e., that the merits of Rumierz's claims of error had not been addressed or adjudicated by the judge in ordering the stipulated vacatur; that one cannot assume that Rumierz raised \"valid\" claims of defect; and that the state's attorney may have agreed to the stipulation for a variety of reasons not indicated on the record. <i>Ante</i> at 41-42 n. 13, 42-43. In holding that Rumierz's vacatur cannot meet the <i>Pickering</i> standard based on these factors, the majority effectively creates a bar that applies to many vacaturs obtained by stipulation or settlement. As the Third Circuit's recent decision in <i>Pinho</i> explains, such a bar would be inappropriate, and the factors relied upon by the majority here are simply not dispositive in a proper <i>Pickering</i> analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pinho,</i> like the case here, involved a petitioner who had sought and obtained a vacatur of an earlier conviction through a settlement with the government rather than a trial. Specifically, the petitioner in <i>Pinho</i> had pled guilty to a drug crime, and later applied for post-conviction relief based on his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his rejection from a special alternative sentencing program (termed \"PTI placement\") that would have allowed him to earn a dismissal of charges without having to plead guilty. <i>See Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 196. The government settled, and an order was issued dismissing the charges against him and, according to the parties, his conviction was vacated. <i>See id.</i> at 196-97. Pinho later applied for adjustment of his immigration status, but was denied on the basis of his old drug conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 197. In response to his filing of a complaint in district court, the court held that his vacated conviction was still a conviction for immigration purposes. <i>See id.</i> at 199.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit reversed. It found the BIA's longstanding distinction between \"rehabilitative vacaturs\" (vacating a conviction for rehabilitative or immigration-related purposes) and \"substantive vacaturs\" (vacating a conviction on the basis of a legal defect in the proceedings) to be reasonable. <i>See id.</i> at 209-10. However, the Third Circuit concluded that, under <i>Pickering,</i> a vacatur need <i>not</i> follow a formal adjudication on the merits in order to be a substantive vacatur:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the parties agreed to settle rather than proceed to trial on the ineffective assistance claim should not be dispositive. Indeed, it may be that the likelihood that the prosecution will agree to a settlement such as PTI placement will increase proportionally with the strength of the alien's constitutional claim. If the BIA in <i>Pickering</i> had meant to require an adjudication of the merits of aliens' claims of substantive defects in the original conviction in order to make out an adequate \"basis,\" it could have said so. But it did not. It has instead drawn its line between vacaturs \"based on\" underlying defects and vacaturs granted \"for reasons\" not related to underlying defects, and it is readily apparent that the set of vacaturs \"based on\" underlying defects is not necessarily coextensive with the set of vacaturs based on adjudications of underlying defects. We must therefore inquire as to the reasons underlying the vacatur order, and it would obviously be begging the question simply to invoke the PTI acceptance yet again. The prosecutor's offer of PTI placement did not spring into being <i>ex nihilo;</i> rather, it was by way of settlement of Pinho's collateral attack on the constitutional validity of his conviction. The relevant \"reason,\" then, for our <i>Pickering</i> analysis, is plainly the reason for the settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 211. In so holding, the court also rejected the government's argument that it should look beyond the record to consider any hidden reasons the state's attorney might have for agreeing to the stipulated vacatur:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument the government contended that the motives of state prosecutors and judges might change over time and might not be reflected in the record. Perhaps a new prosecutor, reviewing old cases, might decide that some of his predecessor's policies had been unduly harsh. Perhaps such a prosecutor, when presented with a post-conviction relief claim brought by a defendant who had been denied entry into a pre-trial diversion program years earlier because of a now-discredited policy, might decide to \"do the right thing,\" and help that defendant avoid the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Perhaps a state judge, looking at the case, would see a hard-working family man threatened with deportation based on a relatively minor crime committed a decade earlier, and decide to help that hard-working family man get around the federal immigration laws. Perhaps, perhaps. We present this hypothetical to highlight the fact that it is precisely that: a hypothetical proposed by the government about possible motives of state actors nowhere found in the record. . . . We cannot endorse a test which requires speculation about, or scrutiny of, the reasons for judges' actions other than those reasons that appear on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 211. Thus, the only relevant question under <i>Pickering</i> is whether the record itself establishes that the reason for the stipulated order was based on a defect in the conviction, and not rehabilitative or immigration-related grounds. <i>See id.</i> Applying this inquiry to the record in <i>Pinho,</i> the Third Circuit noted that Pinho \"raised only one claim: ineffective assistance of counsel. . . . The only basis for the vacatur appearing in the order or the pleadings is Pinho's ineffective assistance claim. . . . [T]herefore, Pinho's conviction was vacated `based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings' and Pinho accordingly `no longer has a `conviction' within the meaning of [the INA].'\" <i>Id.</i> at 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persuasive analysis of the Third Circuit in <i>Pinho</i> undermines each of the factors relied upon by the majority in explaining why Rumierz's vacatur could not meet the <i>Pickering</i> test. Indeed, the majority's attempt to distinguish <i>Pinho, ante</i> at 41-42 n. 13, only further illustrates why <i>Pinho</i> supports Rumierz's case. First, the majority asserts that the <i>Pinho</i> court had the benefit of full state court transcripts that demonstrated that Pinho raised a \"valid\" claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Yet nowhere in the <i>Pinho</i> decision did the Third Circuit state that its holding was based on a finding that his underlying claim of error was valid or meritorious. Nor would it have been appropriate for the court to make such a judgement of validity. The concern in <i>Pickering</i> is solely whether the claims serving as the basis of a vacatur are related to defects in the conviction, rather than requests for equitable or rehabilitative relief. Nothing in <i>Pickering</i> permits the BIA or a reviewing court to re-assess the validity or strength of the claims that led to a vacatur. <i>Cf. Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624 (explaining that the BIA will \"not look behind the state court judgment to ascertain whether the court acted in accordance with its own law in vacating the conviction\"); <i>see also Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 211 (refusing to scrutinize further the decisions of prosecutors or judges when the only basis for the vacatur stated in the record was a claim of a defect in the conviction). Thus, while the <i>Pinho</i> court certainly had the benefit of a more extensive record than we have here, the decision in <i>Pinho</i> rested on the court's assessment of the type of claim raised by the petitioner, not its validity. <i>See Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 215. Here, as in <i>Pinho,</i> the record shows that Rumierz's petition for post-conviction relief was based on errors in his conviction, not <i>Pickering</i>-proscribed grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the majority distinguishes <i>Pinho</i> by noting that here we have a statement from the State's Attorney that Rumierz's claims were not addressed or adjudicated by the state court. This distinction is a non-starter. The <i>Pinho</i> decision also noted that the state court in that case never reached the merits of Pinho's claim of error in his state court conviction and that requiring an adjudication of those claims would be contrary to <i>Pickering. See id.</i> at 211 (\"If the BIA in <i>Pickering</i> had meant to require an adjudication of the merits of aliens' claims of substantive defects in the original conviction in order to make out an adequate `basis,' it could have said so. But it did not.\"). Thus, there is no difference between the stipulation here and the settlement in <i>Pinho</i> in terms of whether the state court addressed and adjudicated the underlying claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the majority notes that Pinho obtained a vacatur of his conviction before the agency had to take action in his case, whereas Rumierz obtained a vacatur after a final order of removal was reached in his case. This distinction is inapposite for two reasons. First, as I have explained above, the BIA effectively reopened Rumierz's case, thus vacating the final order of removal. Second, even assuming that the final order of removal remained in place, the fact that Rumierz obtained a vacatur after the order tells us nothing about whether the record evidence shows that the vacatur meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard. This argument relates to the majority's burden allocation analysis, not the <i>Pickering</i> analysis. Here, as in <i>Pinho,</i> the record evidence shows that the stipulated vacatur meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Rumierz has the burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as the Third Circuit's reasoning in <i>Pinho</i> demonstrates, the factors relied upon by the majority here&#8212;the lack of an adjudication on the merits, uncertainty over the validity of the petitioner's claims of error in his conviction, and the possibility that the State's Attorney was motivated by factors not disclosed on the record&#8212;are all inappropriate grounds for deciding that the BIA was not compelled to conclude that the vacatur presented by Rumierz met the <i>Pickering</i> standard. Pursuant to a proper analysis, the record compels a finding that Rumierz has met the burden allocated to him by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Dec. at 624. Often, the statutory basis for the order will resolve whether the underlying conviction remains valid for immigration purposes. <i>Compare Matter of Adamiak,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (holding that a conviction vacated under Ohio Revised Code &#167; 2943.031 for the trial court's failure to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes) <i>and Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000) (holding that a conviction vacated pursuant to Article 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law, which is neither an expungement statute nor a rehabilitative statute, did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes) <i>with Matter of Roldan-Santoyo,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 512 (BIA 1999) (holding that a conviction vacated by operation of a state rehabilitative statute still constitutes a conviction for immigration purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the order does not specify its statutory basis, the BIA will consider the grounds presented to the court by the petitioner in his or her motion to vacate the conviction. <i>See Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624 (\"The resolution of this case . . . turns on whether the conviction was quashed on the basis of a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings. In making this determination, we look to the law under which the [] court issued its order and the terms of the order itself, as well as the reasons presented by the respondent in requesting that the court vacate the conviction.\" (footnote omitted)); <i>see also Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 215 (\"To determine the basis for a vacatur order, the agency must look first to the order itself. If the order explains the court's reasons for vacating the conviction, the agency's inquiry must end there. If the order does not give a clear statement of reasons, the agency may look to the record before the court when the order was issued. No other evidence of reasons may be considered.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, the BIA will \"not look behind the state court judgment to ascertain whether the court acted in accordance with its own law in vacating the conviction.\" <i>Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624. Thus, if the record shows that a state court vacated a conviction through a statutory mechanism for addressing defects in the underlying conviction, the BIA will not consider any suggestions by the government that the state court was actually motivated by a desire to ameliorate the deportation consequences rather than correct the defect. <i>See id.; Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000); <i>see also Pickering,</i> 454 F.3d at 525, 530 n. 3, 2006 WL 1976043, at *4 n. 3 (\"When a court acts pursuant to a law that allows it to act based only on the merits of the underlying position, it is presumed not to have acted contrary to that law, solely to enable the [p]etitioner to avoid adverse immigration consequences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rumierz's case, the order striking and amending his conviction does not specify the statutory basis for the vacatur or the nature of his claims for relief. However, the Deputy State's Attorney's affidavit does explain that Rumierz filed a \"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief\" in which he \"alleged certain errors in his earlier conviction in Windsor District Court, Vermont.\" The affidavit does <i>not</i> state that Rumierz sought expungement through a rehabilitative statute or that he claimed relief on immigration-related grounds. The only reference in the affidavit is to <i>errors</i> in his conviction, alleged in his motion for post-conviction relief. While there is no statutory citation specified in the affidavit, Vermont's post-conviction relief statute specifies that relief is only available through that statutory mechanism on \"the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the United States, or of the state of Vermont, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\" 13 V.S.A. &#167; 7131.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA did not refer to these aspects of the affidavit, stating instead that \"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defects\" in Rumierz's conviction. Given that the <i>only</i> representation in the record is that Rumierz sought and obtained a vacatur after alleging errors in his conviction, the BIA's reasoning is patently erroneous. The record here compels the conclusion that the vacatur in this case meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> By contrast, there is simply no indication that Rumierz sought or could have been granted post-conviction relief based on the grounds proscribed by the BIA in <i>Pickering.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> For these reasons, I would vacate the BIA's decision and remand for termination of the removal proceedings, without reaching the question of whether the allocation of the burden in this case was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> While the district court used the term \"reconsider,\" the more apt term under BIA regulations is \"reopen\" because the remand was based on new evidence, i.e., the Agreement and Stipulation and the state's attorney's affidavit<i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c). The government at oral argument acknowledged that \"reopen\" was the applicable term.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> In an unpublished decision, the BIA itself has stated that \"even where a conviction is vacated after the DHS initiates proceedings and makes a prima facie case with respect to the conviction, the DHS retains the burden of going forward to establish removability.\"<i>In re Roberto Ortiz-Herrera,</i> 2005 WL 3016102 (BIA Aug. 2, 2005) (affirming IJ's decision that the government failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that vacatur of noncitizen's state court conviction was merely for rehabilitative purposes).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> In support of this proposition, the majority cites<i>Pinho v. Gonzales,</i> 432 F.3d 193, 206 (3rd Cir.2005). However, <i>Pinho</i> did not deal with the BIA's interpretation of the statutory allocation of burden issue in the <i>Chevron</i> context at all. It applied a <i>Chevron</i> analysis to determine whether the BIA's definition of \"conviction\" in <i>Pickering</i> was entitled to deference, an issue we have already addressed in a previous decision. <i>See Herrera-Inirio v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Such reasoning would hold whenever a person obtains a vacatur of his criminal conviction, regardless of the timing of the vacatur. Yet, at least during removal proceedings, the government still retains the burden of establishing removability even when a petitioner obtained a vacatur of an underlying conviction after proceedings have commenced<i>See supra</i> Part A.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Because of the procedural oddity of this case&#8212;on remand from the district court &#8212; Rumierz may have received a renewed review of his administrative appeal that the BIA might not otherwise have been inclined to grant him. Certainly, if Rumierz had not obtained a remand from the district court on habeas, he could have instead filed a motion to reopen directly with the BIA, which, though untimely, the BIA could have granted sua sponte<i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(a). But, as the majority points out, the BIA grants such motions only in extraordinary cases. Therefore, it was beneficial for Rumierz that the district court remanded this case to the BIA.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This procedural oddity only underscores why this case is a poor vehicle for announcing the majority's broad rule on the reallocation of the burden of proof when a petitioner seeks to reopen his case on the basis of a vacated conviction. Perhaps the BIA in this case should have sought clarification from the district court on the scope of the remand. Perhaps the BIA should have treated the remanded case as an untimely motion to reopen and proceeding accordingly. But it did neither of those things. Instead, as explained in its description of its decision, it reopened the administrative proceedings, considered the new evidence, decided the question of removability, and then dismissed Rumierz's administrative appeal. While it may have been preferable, in the majority's view, for the BIA to have treated this case differently, it is not appropriate for the majority to write a decision that it wishes the BIA had written or to make arguments that it wishes the government had presented in defending the agency's action.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Rumierz, who has been detained since 1994, was<i>pro se</i> at the time of the BIA's consideration of his vacatur.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The majority suggests that Rumierz might not have been able to avail himself of Vermont's post-conviction relief because he was no longer in custody in Vermont and had served his time for his conviction. The notion that Rumierz, detained for ten years pending removal due in part to this conviction for possession of stolen property, could not properly file a motion for post-conviction relief under the Vermont statute is plainly contrary to Vermont law<i>See In re Stewart,</i> 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> While I appreciate the majority's concern that some petitioners may seek to avoid or delay deportation by taking advantage of overburdened state attorneys,<i>ante</i> at 42-43 n. 15, I disagree that these policy concerns are implicated here. Rumierz, pro-se at the time of the BIA proceedings, is relying not on his own unsubstantiated claims that he alleged errors in his conviction, but on the sworn statement of the State's Attorney in his case. To be sure, this case would have been much easier if Rumierz had supplied the BIA with his post-conviction relief petition, but given the State's Attorney's acknowledgment that his petition was based on \"errors in his earlier conviction,\" I would not characterize these actions as \"gamesmanship\" on his part.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> The Sixth Circuit's recent decision in<i>Pickering</i> is particularly on point here. <i>See Pickering,</i> 454 F.3d 525, 2006 WL 1976043. In that case, the court vacated the decision of the BIA, noting that its \"conclusion that [the court that vacated Pickering's conviction] acted solely for immigration reasons can only be reached by inference\" and that inference was contrary to the record. <i>Id.</i> at *5, 531. Although the Sixth Circuit held that the government had the burden of establishing removability, it noted that even if the burden were with the petitioner, he met it. <i>Id.</i> at *4, 530 n. 3. Specifically, the court observed that \"[t]he only legal authority cited anywhere in the record of [the court that vacated his conviction] allows it to act only to redress violations of the [p]etitioner's rights.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, in order to have found that the petitioner was removable on this record, the BIA must have \"assumed that [the court] ignored the legal basis the Petitioner articulated for seeking to have his conviction quashed.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3, 529. The Sixth Circuit thus vacated the decision, holding that the record compelled the BIA to conclude that the petitioner's conviction was not vacated solely for rehabilitative or immigration-related reasons. <i>Id.</i> at *5, 531. Here, too, the only references in the record regarding the basis of Rumierz's vacatur are to his claims of \"errors in his earlier conviction\" and his \"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.\" The inference that Rumierz's conviction was vacated by stipulation for rehabilitative or immigration-related purposes is flatly contrary to the record.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), for vacating an order of removal presented in a belated motion and premised on the post-final-order-of-removal vacating of the underlying state court conviction. In the circumstances of this case, the BIA held that the alien had not met that burden. Because we cannot say that either the facts before it or the law compelled the BIA to reach the opposite result, we affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Antoni A. Rumierz, a Polish citizen who entered this country as an immigrant in 1980, was ordered removed from the United States by the BIA on August 18, 2000, on the basis that he had been convicted twice in state courts of receiving stolen property, which are crimes of moral turpitude for federal immigration purposes. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before that, in 1999, the BIA had found Rumierz removable on the same basis, but had remanded to the Immigration Judge (IJ) to determine whether Rumierz nonetheless should be granted a waiver of relief under former &#167; 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1994) (repealed 1996). The IJ denied &#167; 212(c) relief as a matter of discretion on December 10, 1999; this decision was affirmed in the BIA's August 2000 order. Deportation proceedings had initially commenced in March 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its August 2000 order, the BIA expressly found that the government had met its burden to show that the two prior convictions were sufficient to establish Rumierz's deportability; it also noted that the two convictions had not been vacated. There is no doubt the criminal convictions, one of which was a January 1994 Vermont conviction, were qualifying crimes of moral turpitude. Rumierz did not petition for review of the BIA's August 2000 order, nor did he file a motion with the BIA to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2001, Rumierz filed a pro se writ of habeas corpus, which was heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> No doubt he did this because the ninety-day filing deadline to bring new evidence to the BIA under either a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider had long since expired. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c)(2) (1999) (recodified at 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(2)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in 2002, two years after the BIA had entered its final order of removal and the time for reopening had passed, Rumierz sought to vacate the January 1994 predicate conviction in Vermont. On application by Rumierz, a Vermont court entered, on August 23, 2002, an \"Agreement and Stipulation,\" which struck the conviction for possession of stolen property and amended it to negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Negligent operation of a motor vehicle is not a crime of moral turpitude under the immigration laws. Rumierz brought the vacating of the conviction to the attention of the district court. The government responded with an affidavit from a Vermont Deputy State's Attorney, which stated that Rumierz had petitioned for post-conviction relief on the basis of allegations of \"certain errors in his earlier conviction.\" The affidavit also stated that \"[t]he merits of Petitioner's claim were not addressed or adjudicated in connection with the `Agreement and Stipulation.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court on September 25, 2003, at Rumierz's request, directed the BIA \"to reconsider its [August 18, 2000] decision in light of subsequent developments, including the Agreement and Stipulation, dated August 23, 2002 from the Superior Court, Windsor County, Vermont.\" The district court order did not itself vacate the order of removal or order the BIA either directly or indirectly to vacate the order of removal. It also did not hold that Rumierz had met the standard used by the BIA to determine whether to reopen proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, as instructed, reconsidered based on the record sent to it by the district court, and denied relief, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon further consideration, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed. The August 23, 2002, \"Agreement and Stipulation\" from the Vermont court states only that [Rumierz's] conviction for possession of stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor vehicle.\" There is nothing in the record to indicate that this conviction was stricken based on any defect in the original conviction. An affidavit from a Vermont Deputy State's Attorney states that, \"the merits of Petitioner's claim were not addressed or adjudicated\" in connection with the Agreement and Stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In [<i>In re Pickering</i>], we held that where a court order quashing a conviction, and the documents supporting the request to quash, did not identify a basis for questioning the integrity of the underlying criminal proceeding or conviction, the conviction remained valid for immigration purposes.

Here, there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the respondent's Vermont conviction, and, as noted above, the state's attorney has stated that in striking the conviction, the judge did not address or adjudicate the merits of [Rumierz's] claim. Under these circumstances, the respondent has not shown that the Vermont conviction for possession of stolen property is not still valid for immigration purposes.

Where the motion to reopen is untimely, for example, where the state conviction is not vacated until after the time period for filing motions to reopen has expired, then the burden is also on the alien to establish that the motion presents an exceptional situation warranting further review. <i>Id.</i> As <i>Beckford</i> said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current posture of this case is critical to our decision.

However, once having been found guilty, the defendant bears the burden of proof if he wishes to attack that finding. Similarly, the Service initially bears the burden of proof in a removal proceeding, <i>but once an alien is found removable (and that finding is upheld on appeal, if an appeal is taken), the burden shifts to the alien who wishes to attack that finding.</i> We note that, even where a motion to reopen is not untimely, the motion will not be granted unless there is a reasonable likelihood of success upon reopening.

These state expungement laws authorize a conviction to be expunged in order to serve rehabilitative ends and without reference to the merits of the underlying adjudication of guilt. Such expunged convictions would appear, therefore, to survive as formal adjudications of guilt entered by a court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 713 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We outlined Rumierz's four arguments earlier.

Also applying <i>Herrera-Inirio</i> and <i>Pickering,</i> it was Rumierz's burden to show that the vacating of the Vermont conviction was based on a procedural or substantive invalidity as defined by <i>Pickering.</i> Rumierz's criticisms<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> of the BIA decision, in any event, do not convince us that the BIA was compelled to reach a different conclusion. To support his argument, Rumierz points first to the Vermont state court order (the \"Agreement and Stipulation\") itself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's inquiry started with this Vermont court order, which is consistent with how the BIA approached the issue in <i>Pickering.</i> As the BIA noted, all that was docketed in state court was an \"Agreement and Stipulation\" stating that the conviction for possession for stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor vehicle.\" On its face, the order fails to show, as required by <i>Pickering,</i> that the prior conviction was vacated because of \"a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\" 23 I. &amp; N. Dec at 624. All that the state court order says is that the court had accepted an agreement of the parties to vacate the conviction. The BIA opinion, we note, did not say that it would never terminate an order of removal based on a conviction which had been vacated by stipulation. Nor did it say that the sole factor on which it found Rumierz had not met his burden was that the vacating was based on a stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his claim that the stipulation here was sufficient to invalidate the conviction within the meaning of the immigration laws, Rumierz points to <i>Pinho v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span>. <i>Pinho</i> does not help him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The question is not whether an agreement or stipulation vacating a conviction can ever serve as a basis for vacating an order of removal, but whether the BIA was compelled to accept the stipulation here. <i>Pinho</i> does not say that the BIA must accept every stipulation which leads to vacating a conviction, whatever the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz argues that the record, in fact, does show that he had raised a valid claim of a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, as required by <i>Pickering.</i> Rumierz points to the state attorney's affidavit, which states that Rumierz alleged \"certain errors in his earlier conviction.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> The BIA considered the state attorney's affidavit, but concluded that it was insufficient to meet Rumierz's burden of showing that the conviction was vacated based on a defect in the underlying proceedings, especially since the affidavit stated that \"the merits of [Rumierz's] claim were not addressed or adjudicated in connection with the `Agreement or Stipulation.'\" The BIA concluded that \"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the respondent's conviction\" and that \"[u]nder these circumstances, [Rumierz] has not shown that the Vermont conviction . . . is not still valid for immigration purposes.\" Again, a court does not review this conclusion de novo, but asks only whether any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Going beyond the arguments presented by Rumierz, the dissent's position is that the BIA was <i>compelled</i> to conclude that the vacated conviction in this case&#8212;which had been vacated not after adjudication of the merits of Rumierz's motion to vacate, but pursuant to an agreement and stipulation between the defendant and the state's attorney&#8212;meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard, simply by dint of the fact that Rumierz had claimed \"certain errors\" through a motion for post-conviction relief in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA was not <i>obligated,</i> as a matter of law, to accept that the stipulation and agreement&#8212;vacating a state law conviction for unstated reasons, entered into long after the state punishment had ceased and after a final order of removal&#8212;was sufficient to render the state conviction invalid within the meaning of <i>Pickering</i> based on evidence that \"certain errors\" were alleged. There is nothing in the federal immigration laws that requires such a result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the BIA is not required to conclude that the mere filing of a petition for post-conviction relief claiming \"certain errors\" which results in a stipulation means that the petitioner has raised <i>valid</i> claims of defects in the state criminal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, under <i>Pickering,</i> it is not enough to show that there was an allegation of a cognizable defect in the state proceedings; instead the alien must also show that \"a court with jurisdiction vacate[d] the conviction <i>based on</i> a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.\" 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624. Here, even beyond the fact that Rumierz can point to nothing more than the allegation of \"certain errors,\" he cannot show that the stipulation was \"based on\" those errors. A state's attorney, rather than challenging the petition, may have agreed to a stipulated motion to vacate the conviction for any number of reasons other than the strength and validity of those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address another argument, which Rumierz did not make before the agency (or the district court) or to this court, and so, we hold, is precluded by the exhaustion doctrine and waived. <i>See Boakai v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202182\"><a href=\"/opinion/202182/boakai-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2006). Nonetheless, we comment on it because it is heavily relied on by the dissent. Nothing in the record of the state court proceedings that was before the BIA&#8212;the \"Agreement and Stipulation\" or the state attorney's affidavit&#8212;refers to a particular state statute defining the post-conviction procedure used by Rumierz. The dissent nonetheless assumes that Rumierz used the procedure set forth in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &#167; 7131, and that this means the grounds stated by Rumierz for relief from the state convictions are necessarily all grounds eligible for <i>Pickering</i> relief. The argument is based on certain assumptions, which Rumierz could have easily supported with evidence, had the assumptions been true. But Rumierz chose not to give the BIA such evidence. By its own terms the Vermont statute, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &#167; 7131, only applies to \"[a] prisoner who is in custody under sentence of a court and claims the right to be released\" because of a defect in the conviction. <i>Id.</i> Rumierz was not in custody in Vermont and had served his time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> The fact that Rumierz may have used a particular post-conviction relief statute does not mean that the BIA was required to hold that Rumierz had, in fact, raised valid claims of defects in the underlying criminal proceedings or that the state's attorney agreed to vacate the conviction because of the strength or validity of those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Remaining Claims</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz raises a number of other claims which were never raised to the BIA and are barred by the exhaustion doctrine. Rumierz argues the BIA was obligated to tell him he was eligible for naturalization and so the order of removal should be vacated. Even if the claim had been exhausted, Rumierz was not eligible because he was already in deportation proceedings and so was precluded from naturalization. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1429 (\"[N]o application for naturalization shall be considered by the Attorney General if there is pending against the applicant a removal proceeding. . . .\"). As the DHS notes, there is no inequity. Rumierz entered the United States as an immigrant in 1980; he had a number of years before the start of his deportation proceedings to seek naturalization but never once did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz also argues that the IJ who initially heard his case was biased. The claim is defaulted because it was never presented to the BIA. We lack jurisdiction. <i>See Ishak v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791773\"><a href=\"/opinion/791773/tito-ibrahim-barsoum-ishak-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general-tito/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz also argues that because he has spent the last decade in DHS detention, as a general equitable matter he should be released now and permitted to remain in the country. For any number of doctrinal reasons, the argument is not cognizable, but a few words are in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At base Rumierz's claim is that when the alien has committed, as he has, more than two crimes involving moral turpitude, all of these crimes should be charged by the DHS in the initial deportation hearings. Here, part of the reason for the ten years of detention is that the government initially relied on a 1989 Massachusetts conviction for breaking and entering (as well as the Vermont conviction) and the IJ found Rumierz deportable. While that decision was on appeal to the BIA, Rumierz succeeded in vacating the Massachusetts conviction. The BIA permitted the DHS, on remand to the IJ, to add a different Massachusetts conviction in 1995 for receiving stolen property. The IJ again found him deportable in 1996.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rumierz allowed the various proceedings to run their course and only after the August 2000 BIA final order of removal did he seek to vacate his Vermont conviction in 2002. The delay is entirely caused by Rumierz. His case has been ably handled by his counsel. There is, now, no basis for him to continue to avoid removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>deny</i> the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> According to the government, Rumierz initially filed his habeas petition in Rhode Island, but the petition was transferred to the U.S. District Court in New Jersey</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Pickering's actual case, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the BIA's rule about vacated convictions, but reversed the BIA's order of removal on the grounds that the government had not met its burden under the specific facts of that case<i>Pickering v.

This gave him nearly four years during which he was represented by counsel to challenge the Vermont conviction. Indeed, during this time period&#8212;in September 1995&#8212;Rumierz was able to obtain a state vacatur of another predicate conviction, from Massachusetts (which the DHS then substituted with a different Massachusetts predicate conviction)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The dissent incorrectly says that the only argument the government made in its initial brief supporting the BIA's allocation of the burden was that the alien was in a better position to establish the circumstances of the vacatur; the dissent concludes that all other arguments were waived.

The question in <i>Cota-Vargas</i> was whether a state sentencing modification <i>nunc pro tunc</i> meant that the <i>\"term of imprisonment</i>\" within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(<i>B</i>) was now less than that required to allow a conviction to constitute a predicate offense. <i>See</i> 23 I. &amp; N.

Second, Rumierz argues that the BIA could not review new evidence itself, but was required to remand to the IJ to hear evidence and to engage in fact-finding as to his reasons for seeking reversal.

Further, for the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ would have been fruitless.

Here, by contrast, the BIA had a sparse record consisting only of the state court order and an affidavit from the state attorney, neither of which demonstrate that Rumierz had raised a valid claim of any defect. Also, in <i>Pinho</i> there was no statement from a state's attorney that the merits of the petitioner's claim had not been addressed or adjudicated. Furthermore, the alien in <i>Pinho</i> had vacated his state convictions well before the INS had considered the alien's application for adjustment of status (the government in <i>Pinho</i> argued that his state conviction had made the alien ineligible for adjustment of status). <i>Id.</i> at 198.

And Rumierz does not challenge the BIA's consideration of the state attorney's affidavit; indeed, he relies on it. In the absence of a statutory directive, such as that which exists under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, it seems to us that the issue of what the BIA considers, and in what order, is one for the BIA in the first instance, to be tested, if necessary, only under <i>Chevron.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> If Rumierz's position were correct, all it would take for an alien to avoid or delay deportation on the basis of old predicate state convictions is to wait until the final order of removal had been entered, make invalid claims for post-conviction relief in state court, find a state attorney who has more pressing matters than defending an old conviction, have the conviction vacated by agreement without having the merits of his claim addressed or adjudicated, and return to the BIA to reopen the case claiming that he had alleged \"certain errors,\" without describing what those errors actually were or providing a record of the state proceedings. This would either force the government to find a new ground for deportation and start the proceedings over again, or, even worse, allow the alien (who had already been found deportable for having two or more convictions for crimes of moral turpitude) to remain in the country, even though the alien had never demonstrated to anyone that there was even the suggestion of a defect in the state criminal proceedings.

The majority emphasizes that there is no evidence of the validity of Rumierz's claim of errors in his underlying conviction; that the stipulated vacatur was not the result of an adjudication on the merits of Rumierz's claim of errors; and that there is no evidence that the state's attorney agreed to the stipulated vacatur because of the claim of errors. I disagree that Rumierz has failed to meet the burden assigned to him by the BIA. Because I conclude that he met that burden, I would not reach the more difficult issue of whether the BIA properly placed the burden on the petitioner in this case. Indeed, there is good reason to question whether the majority's analysis of the issue comports with the procedural posture of this case or with the arguments invoked by the BIA and the government in support of the allocation of the burden. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

In concluding that the BIA properly placed the burden of contesting removability on Rumierz, the majority treats the BIA's decision as the equivalent of a denial of a motion to reopen. <i>See ante</i> at 37-38. This is an inaccurate characterization of the BIA's actions. Here, a federal district court remanded the case (initially brought through a habeas petition) to the BIA to \"reconsider its last decision in light of subsequent developments, including the Agreement and Stipulation, dated August 23, 2002, from the Superior Court, Windsor County, Vermont.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> This was not a directive from the court to the BIA to decide <i>whether</i> it should reopen its last decision (which would be the threshold decision that the BIA would have to make if presented with a motion to reopen). Nor did the BIA treat the remand as such. We have explained that \"[t]he filing of a motion to reopen with the BIA is not a vehicle for trying an issue, but is merely a request for the opportunity to try it.\" <i>Dacosta v.

If the BIA here had denied an untimely motion to reopen, it would have framed its decision in an entirely different manner, citing the regulations for motions to reopen and explaining why it would not reopen Rumierz's case. Instead, the BIA began its analysis by stating that, \"[u]pon further consideration, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\" It considered the question of removability in light of the vacatur and then concluded that Rumierz's conviction was still valid for removal purposes and \"therefore . . . the respondent remains deportable as charged. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will again be dismissed.\" This language demonstrates that the BIA, as instructed, reopened Rumierz's administrative proceedings but concluded that Rumierz was nonetheless removable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distinction is important because the BIA's reopening of a case vacates the final order of removal and reopens the administrative removal proceedings. <i>See id.</i> During administrative removal proceedings, the government has the burden of proving by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the petitioner is subject to removal on the basis of his convictions. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A); <i>see also Pickering v.

We find that the INS did not establish either of these factual situations by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> If, as I believe the record establishes, the BIA actually reopened Rumierz's case in response to the district court's order, rather than simply adjudicating the case as a request for reopening, the BIA erred in its allocation of the burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would therefore be improper to defer to the agency's error under <i>Chevron.</i> The majority observes that the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") is \"silent on who has the burden of showing the effect of convictions which are vacated or modified after final orders of removal have entered.\" <i>Ante</i> at 36.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> That may be true, but if the proceedings were reopened in this case (thus vacating the final order of removal), that observation misses the point. The applicable statutory provision, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A), is <i>not</i> silent on who has the burden of showing the effect of a conviction, vacated or not, <i>during</i> administrative removal proceedings. As the plain language of the statute states, and as the aforementioned cases explain, the government has the burden of establishing removability during removal proceedings. Thus, if the BIA reopened Rumierz's administrative removal proceedings but denied his appeal, it misapplied the allocation of burden under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A) and there is no basis for applying <i>Chevron</i> deference to its shifting of the burden to the petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulation, cases, and analogies relied upon by the majority to support its contrary view of the case only further undermine its conclusion.

The BIA never cited 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2, the regulation governing motions to reopen, <i>ante</i> at 37, or <i>In re Beckford,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000), a case in which the BIA rejected an untimely motion to reopen where the petitioner conceded removability, <i>see ante</i> at 37-38. For its part, the government also said nothing of motions to reopen or the standards governing them until oral argument, where it raised for the first time the argument that the BIA treated this case as a motion to reopen. In its brief, the only argument the government raised in support of the BIA's allocation of the burden in this case was that \"an alien who obtains a [vacatur] of a state court conviction is clearly in a better position tha[n] DHS personnel to have access to documentation regarding the circumstances of the vacatur.\" The weakness of this argument as a justification for burden shifting is readily apparent,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> which is perhaps why the majority opinion does not even mention it.

In so doing, the BIA erred in allocating the burden to Rumierz under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(3)(A). In any event, the majority's decision to reframe the BIA's decision and supply new reasoning aside, we did not have to reach this difficult issue here. As I describe in further detail below, I conclude that Rumierz has met the burden allocated to him by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Rumierz's Vacatur</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA stated that Rumierz \"must present evidence to show that the Vermont court's action in striking the stolen property conviction was tied to a defect in that conviction, rather than related in part to immigration proceedings.\" Although the record evidence here is sparse,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> it includes (1) an \"Agreement and Stipulation\" that the conviction for possession of stolen property \"shall be stricken and amended to negligent operation of a motor vehicle\" and (2) an affidavit of Deputy State's Attorney Matthew Huntington regarding the Agreement and Stipulation that states that Rumierz raised \"errors in his earlier conviction in Windsor District Court, Vermont\" through a \"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.\" Without acknowledging the affidavit's reference to Rumierz's claims of errors in his conviction, the BIA stated that \"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defect in the merits of the respondent's Vermont conviction, and . . . the state's attorney has stated that in striking the conviction, the judge did not address or adjudicate the merits of the respondent's claim.\" For these reasons alone, the BIA concluded that Rumierz failed to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In affirming the BIA's decision, the majority again bases its reasoning on grounds not relied upon by the BIA or raised in the brief of the government. Specifically, the majority acknowledges the affidavit's reference to Rumierz's claims of errors in his conviction, but asserts that there is no evidence that Rumierz raised \"<i>valid</i> claims of defects\" in his criminal proceedings and that the state's attorney, in agreeing to the stipulated motion, may have done so \"for any number of reasons other than the strength and validity of those claims,\" <i>ante</i> at 42-43. For these reasons, the majority holds that the record does not compel the BIA to conclude that Rumierz has failed to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's decision reflects the erroneous notion that a vacatur must follow an adjudication on the merits of claimed legal errors or some further inquiry regarding the validity of the claims and any hidden reasons behind the government's agreement to the stipulation. Such requirements are a misapplication of <i>In re Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). The proper approach in this case is to examine whether Rumierz has provided evidence that the stipulated order was based on defects in his underlying conviction, rather than grounds proscribed by <i>Pickering.</i> Following this approach, I conclude that the BIA was compelled to find that Rumierz met the burden allocated to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Vacatur by stipulation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Pickering,</i> the BIA explained that \"if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a `conviction' [for immigration purposes]. If, however, a court vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent remains `convicted' for immigration purposes.\" 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624; <i>see also Herrera-Inirio v.

Nothing in <i>Pickering</i> precludes a stipulated vacatur from invalidating a conviction as a ground for removal or for other immigration purposes, provided that the vacatur is still based on a defect in the underlying conviction rather than rehabilitative or otherwise proscribed grounds. <i>See Pinho v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span> (3rd Cir.2005) (holding that the petitioner's vacatur, obtained by settlement rather than adjudication, meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard because the petitioner claimed a defect in his underlying conviction); <i>Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d at 1131 (explaining that if \"a substantive challenge to and/or showing of the inappropriateness of the felony conviction prodded the State into stipulating to a vacatur of the conviction and its replacement by a misdemeanor,\" then \"[o]n this scenario, petitioner's vacated felony conviction would not satisfy the test for removal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority acknowledges that some stipulated vacaturs might suffice to meet the <i>Pickering</i> standard and that, in this case, the BIA did not deny Rumierz's appeal based solely on the fact that his vacatur was obtained by stipulation. Yet, in affirming the decision of the BIA, the majority emphasizes several factors that are characteristic of stipulations&#8212;i.e., that the merits of Rumierz's claims of error had not been addressed or adjudicated by the judge in ordering the stipulated vacatur; that one cannot assume that Rumierz raised \"valid\" claims of defect; and that the state's attorney may have agreed to the stipulation for a variety of reasons not indicated on the record. <i>Ante</i> at 41-42 n. 13, 42-43. In holding that Rumierz's vacatur cannot meet the <i>Pickering</i> standard based on these factors, the majority effectively creates a bar that applies to many vacaturs obtained by stipulation or settlement. As the Third Circuit's recent decision in <i>Pinho</i> explains, such a bar would be inappropriate, and the factors relied upon by the majority here are simply not dispositive in a proper <i>Pickering</i> analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pinho,</i> like the case here, involved a petitioner who had sought and obtained a vacatur of an earlier conviction through a settlement with the government rather than a trial. Specifically, the petitioner in <i>Pinho</i> had pled guilty to a drug crime, and later applied for post-conviction relief based on his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his rejection from a special alternative sentencing program (termed \"PTI placement\") that would have allowed him to earn a dismissal of charges without having to plead guilty. <i>See Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 196. The government settled, and an order was issued dismissing the charges against him and, according to the parties, his conviction was vacated. <i>See id.</i> at 196-97. Pinho later applied for adjustment of his immigration status, but was denied on the basis of his old drug conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 197. In response to his filing of a complaint in district court, the court held that his vacated conviction was still a conviction for immigration purposes. <i>See id.</i> at 199.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit reversed. It found the BIA's longstanding distinction between \"rehabilitative vacaturs\" (vacating a conviction for rehabilitative or immigration-related purposes) and \"substantive vacaturs\" (vacating a conviction on the basis of a legal defect in the proceedings) to be reasonable. <i>See id.</i> at 209-10. However, the Third Circuit concluded that, under <i>Pickering,</i> a vacatur need <i>not</i> follow a formal adjudication on the merits in order to be a substantive vacatur:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the parties agreed to settle rather than proceed to trial on the ineffective assistance claim should not be dispositive. Indeed, it may be that the likelihood that the prosecution will agree to a settlement such as PTI placement will increase proportionally with the strength of the alien's constitutional claim. If the BIA in <i>Pickering</i> had meant to require an adjudication of the merits of aliens' claims of substantive defects in the original conviction in order to make out an adequate \"basis,\" it could have said so. But it did not. It has instead drawn its line between vacaturs \"based on\" underlying defects and vacaturs granted \"for reasons\" not related to underlying defects, and it is readily apparent that the set of vacaturs \"based on\" underlying defects is not necessarily coextensive with the set of vacaturs based on adjudications of underlying defects. We must therefore inquire as to the reasons underlying the vacatur order, and it would obviously be begging the question simply to invoke the PTI acceptance yet again. The prosecutor's offer of PTI placement did not spring into being <i>ex nihilo;</i> rather, it was by way of settlement of Pinho's collateral attack on the constitutional validity of his conviction. The relevant \"reason,\" then, for our <i>Pickering</i> analysis, is plainly the reason for the settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 211. In so holding, the court also rejected the government's argument that it should look beyond the record to consider any hidden reasons the state's attorney might have for agreeing to the stipulated vacatur:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument the government contended that the motives of state prosecutors and judges might change over time and might not be reflected in the record. Perhaps a new prosecutor, reviewing old cases, might decide that some of his predecessor's policies had been unduly harsh. Perhaps such a prosecutor, when presented with a post-conviction relief claim brought by a defendant who had been denied entry into a pre-trial diversion program years earlier because of a now-discredited policy, might decide to \"do the right thing,\" and help that defendant avoid the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Perhaps a state judge, looking at the case, would see a hard-working family man threatened with deportation based on a relatively minor crime committed a decade earlier, and decide to help that hard-working family man get around the federal immigration laws. Perhaps, perhaps. We present this hypothetical to highlight the fact that it is precisely that: a hypothetical proposed by the government about possible motives of state actors nowhere found in the record. . . . We cannot endorse a test which requires speculation about, or scrutiny of, the reasons for judges' actions other than those reasons that appear on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 211. Thus, the only relevant question under <i>Pickering</i> is whether the record itself establishes that the reason for the stipulated order was based on a defect in the conviction, and not rehabilitative or immigration-related grounds. <i>See id.</i> Applying this inquiry to the record in <i>Pinho,</i> the Third Circuit noted that Pinho \"raised only one claim: ineffective assistance of counsel. . . . The only basis for the vacatur appearing in the order or the pleadings is Pinho's ineffective assistance claim. . . . [T]herefore, Pinho's conviction was vacated `based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings' and Pinho accordingly `no longer has a `conviction' within the meaning of [the INA].'\" <i>Id.</i> at 215.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persuasive analysis of the Third Circuit in <i>Pinho</i> undermines each of the factors relied upon by the majority in explaining why Rumierz's vacatur could not meet the <i>Pickering</i> test. Indeed, the majority's attempt to distinguish <i>Pinho, ante</i> at 41-42 n. 13, only further illustrates why <i>Pinho</i> supports Rumierz's case. First, the majority asserts that the <i>Pinho</i> court had the benefit of full state court transcripts that demonstrated that Pinho raised a \"valid\" claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Yet nowhere in the <i>Pinho</i> decision did the Third Circuit state that its holding was based on a finding that his underlying claim of error was valid or meritorious. Nor would it have been appropriate for the court to make such a judgement of validity. The concern in <i>Pickering</i> is solely whether the claims serving as the basis of a vacatur are related to defects in the conviction, rather than requests for equitable or rehabilitative relief. Nothing in <i>Pickering</i> permits the BIA or a reviewing court to re-assess the validity or strength of the claims that led to a vacatur. <i>Cf. Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624 (explaining that the BIA will \"not look behind the state court judgment to ascertain whether the court acted in accordance with its own law in vacating the conviction\"); <i>see also Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 211 (refusing to scrutinize further the decisions of prosecutors or judges when the only basis for the vacatur stated in the record was a claim of a defect in the conviction). Thus, while the <i>Pinho</i> court certainly had the benefit of a more extensive record than we have here, the decision in <i>Pinho</i> rested on the court's assessment of the type of claim raised by the petitioner, not its validity. <i>See Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 215. Here, as in <i>Pinho,</i> the record shows that Rumierz's petition for post-conviction relief was based on errors in his conviction, not <i>Pickering</i>-proscribed grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the majority distinguishes <i>Pinho</i> by noting that here we have a statement from the State's Attorney that Rumierz's claims were not addressed or adjudicated by the state court. This distinction is a non-starter. The <i>Pinho</i> decision also noted that the state court in that case never reached the merits of Pinho's claim of error in his state court conviction and that requiring an adjudication of those claims would be contrary to <i>Pickering. See id.</i> at 211 (\"If the BIA in <i>Pickering</i> had meant to require an adjudication of the merits of aliens' claims of substantive defects in the original conviction in order to make out an adequate `basis,' it could have said so. But it did not.\"). Thus, there is no difference between the stipulation here and the settlement in <i>Pinho</i> in terms of whether the state court addressed and adjudicated the underlying claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the majority notes that Pinho obtained a vacatur of his conviction before the agency had to take action in his case, whereas Rumierz obtained a vacatur after a final order of removal was reached in his case. This distinction is inapposite for two reasons. First, as I have explained above, the BIA effectively reopened Rumierz's case, thus vacating the final order of removal. Second, even assuming that the final order of removal remained in place, the fact that Rumierz obtained a vacatur after the order tells us nothing about whether the record evidence shows that the vacatur meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard. This argument relates to the majority's burden allocation analysis, not the <i>Pickering</i> analysis. Here, as in <i>Pinho,</i> the record evidence shows that the stipulated vacatur meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Rumierz has the burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, as the Third Circuit's reasoning in <i>Pinho</i> demonstrates, the factors relied upon by the majority here&#8212;the lack of an adjudication on the merits, uncertainty over the validity of the petitioner's claims of error in his conviction, and the possibility that the State's Attorney was motivated by factors not disclosed on the record&#8212;are all inappropriate grounds for deciding that the BIA was not compelled to conclude that the vacatur presented by Rumierz met the <i>Pickering</i> standard. Pursuant to a proper analysis, the record compels a finding that Rumierz has met the burden allocated to him by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether the vacatur meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to determine whether a vacatur is tied to a defect in the underlying conviction, rather than rehabilitative or immigration-related purposes, the BIA starts by examining the order itself. <i>See Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624. Often, the statutory basis for the order will resolve whether the underlying conviction remains valid for immigration purposes. <i>Compare Matter of Adamiak,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (holding that a conviction vacated under Ohio Revised Code &#167; 2943.031 for the trial court's failure to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes) <i>and Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000) (holding that a conviction vacated pursuant to Article 440 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law, which is neither an expungement statute nor a rehabilitative statute, did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes) <i>with Matter of Roldan-Santoyo,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 512 (BIA 1999) (holding that a conviction vacated by operation of a state rehabilitative statute still constitutes a conviction for immigration purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the order does not specify its statutory basis, the BIA will consider the grounds presented to the court by the petitioner in his or her motion to vacate the conviction. <i>See Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624 (\"The resolution of this case . . . turns on whether the conviction was quashed on the basis of a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings. In making this determination, we look to the law under which the [] court issued its order and the terms of the order itself, as well as the reasons presented by the respondent in requesting that the court vacate the conviction.\" (footnote omitted)); <i>see also Pinho,</i> 432 F.3d at 215 (\"To determine the basis for a vacatur order, the agency must look first to the order itself. If the order explains the court's reasons for vacating the conviction, the agency's inquiry must end there. If the order does not give a clear statement of reasons, the agency may look to the record before the court when the order was issued. No other evidence of reasons may be considered.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned above, the BIA will \"not look behind the state court judgment to ascertain whether the court acted in accordance with its own law in vacating the conviction.\" <i>Pickering,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 624. Thus, if the record shows that a state court vacated a conviction through a statutory mechanism for addressing defects in the underlying conviction, the BIA will not consider any suggestions by the government that the state court was actually motivated by a desire to ameliorate the deportation consequences rather than correct the defect. <i>See id.; Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz,</i> 22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1378, 1379-80 (BIA 2000); <i>see also Pickering,</i> 454 F.3d at 525, 530 n. 3, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1976043</span></span>, at *4 n. 3 (\"When a court acts pursuant to a law that allows it to act based only on the merits of the underlying position, it is presumed not to have acted contrary to that law, solely to enable the [p]etitioner to avoid adverse immigration consequences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Rumierz's case, the order striking and amending his conviction does not specify the statutory basis for the vacatur or the nature of his claims for relief. However, the Deputy State's Attorney's affidavit does explain that Rumierz filed a \"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief\" in which he \"alleged certain errors in his earlier conviction in Windsor District Court, Vermont.\" The affidavit does <i>not</i> state that Rumierz sought expungement through a rehabilitative statute or that he claimed relief on immigration-related grounds. The only reference in the affidavit is to <i>errors</i> in his conviction, alleged in his motion for post-conviction relief. While there is no statutory citation specified in the affidavit, Vermont's post-conviction relief statute specifies that relief is only available through that statutory mechanism on \"the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the United States, or of the state of Vermont, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\" 13 V.S.A. &#167; 7131.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA did not refer to these aspects of the affidavit, stating instead that \"there is no representation in the record regarding any kind of defects\" in Rumierz's conviction. Given that the <i>only</i> representation in the record is that Rumierz sought and obtained a vacatur after alleging errors in his conviction, the BIA's reasoning is patently erroneous. The record here compels the conclusion that the vacatur in this case meets the <i>Pickering</i> standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> By contrast, there is simply no indication that Rumierz sought or could have been granted post-conviction relief based on the grounds proscribed by the BIA in <i>Pickering.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> For these reasons, I would vacate the BIA's decision and remand for termination of the removal proceedings, without reaching the question of whether the allocation of the burden in this case was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> While the district court used the term \"reconsider,\" the more apt term under BIA regulations is \"reopen\" because the remand was based on new evidence, i.e., the Agreement and Stipulation and the state's attorney's affidavit<i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c).

However, <i>Pinho</i> did not deal with the BIA's interpretation of the statutory allocation of burden issue in the <i>Chevron</i> context at all. It applied a <i>Chevron</i> analysis to determine whether the BIA's definition of \"conviction\" in <i>Pickering</i> was entitled to deference, an issue we have already addressed in a previous decision. <i>See Herrera-Inirio v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198873\"><a href=\"/opinion/198873/herrera-inirio-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Such reasoning would hold whenever a person obtains a vacatur of his criminal conviction, regardless of the timing of the vacatur. Yet, at least during removal proceedings, the government still retains the burden of establishing removability even when a petitioner obtained a vacatur of an underlying conviction after proceedings have commenced<i>See supra</i> Part A.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Because of the procedural oddity of this case&#8212;on remand from the district court &#8212; Rumierz may have received a renewed review of his administrative appeal that the BIA might not otherwise have been inclined to grant him. Certainly, if Rumierz had not obtained a remand from the district court on habeas, he could have instead filed a motion to reopen directly with the BIA, which, though untimely, the BIA could have granted sua sponte<i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(a). But, as the majority points out, the BIA grants such motions only in extraordinary cases. Therefore, it was beneficial for Rumierz that the district court remanded this case to the BIA.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This procedural oddity only underscores why this case is a poor vehicle for announcing the majority's broad rule on the reallocation of the burden of proof when a petitioner seeks to reopen his case on the basis of a vacated conviction. Perhaps the BIA in this case should have sought clarification from the district court on the scope of the remand. Perhaps the BIA should have treated the remanded case as an untimely motion to reopen and proceeding accordingly. But it did neither of those things. Instead, as explained in its description of its decision, it reopened the administrative proceedings, considered the new evidence, decided the question of removability, and then dismissed Rumierz's administrative appeal. While it may have been preferable, in the majority's view, for the BIA to have treated this case differently, it is not appropriate for the majority to write a decision that it wishes the BIA had written or to make arguments that it wishes the government had presented in defending the agency's action.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Rumierz, who has been detained since 1994, was<i>pro se</i> at the time of the BIA's consideration of his vacatur.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The majority suggests that Rumierz might not have been able to avail himself of Vermont's post-conviction relief because he was no longer in custody in Vermont and had served his time for his conviction. The notion that Rumierz, detained for ten years pending removal due in part to this conviction for possession of stolen property, could not properly file a motion for post-conviction relief under the Vermont statute is plainly contrary to Vermont law<i>See In re Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1900351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1900351/in-re-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1106</span></a></span> (1981).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> While I appreciate the majority's concern that some petitioners may seek to avoid or delay deportation by taking advantage of overburdened state attorneys,<i>ante</i> at 42-43 n. 15, I disagree that these policy concerns are implicated here. Rumierz, pro-se at the time of the BIA proceedings, is relying not on his own unsubstantiated claims that he alleged errors in his conviction, but on the sworn statement of the State's Attorney in his case. To be sure, this case would have been much easier if Rumierz had supplied the BIA with his post-conviction relief petition, but given the State's Attorney's acknowledgment that his petition was based on \"errors in his earlier conviction,\" I would not characterize these actions as \"gamesmanship\" on his part.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> The Sixth Circuit's recent decision in<i>Pickering</i> is particularly on point here. <i>See Pickering,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794975\"><a href=\"/opinion/794975/christopher-pickering-v-alberto-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1976043</span></span>. In that case, the court vacated the decision of the BIA, noting that its \"conclusion that [the court that vacated Pickering's conviction] acted solely for immigration reasons can only be reached by inference\" and that inference was contrary to the record. <i>Id.</i> at *5, 531. Although the Sixth Circuit held that the government had the burden of establishing removability, it noted that even if the burden were with the petitioner, he met it. <i>Id.</i> at *4, 530 n. 3. Specifically, the court observed that \"[t]he only legal authority cited anywhere in the record of [the court that vacated his conviction] allows it to act only to redress violations of the [p]etitioner's rights.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, in order to have found that the petitioner was removable on this record, the BIA must have \"assumed that [the court] ignored the legal basis the Petitioner articulated for seeking to have his conviction quashed.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3, 529. The Sixth Circuit thus vacated the decision, holding that the record compelled the BIA to conclude that the petitioner's conviction was not vacated solely for rehabilitative or immigration-related reasons. <i>Id.</i> at *5, 531. Here, too, the only references in the record regarding the basis of Rumierz's vacatur are to his claims of \"errors in his earlier conviction\" and his \"Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.\" The inference that Rumierz's conviction was vacated by stipulation for rehabilitative or immigration-related purposes is flatly contrary to the record.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
