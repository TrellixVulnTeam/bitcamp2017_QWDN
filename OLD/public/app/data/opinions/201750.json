R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                         For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-1518\n\n                               UNITED STATES,\n\n                                  Appellee,\n\n                                       v.\n\n              JERRY L. HAYES, a/k/a JEREMIAH L. HAYES,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                             Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Timothy G. Watkins on brief for appellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, Paul G. Levenson,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and John T. McNeil, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               August 9, 2005\n\f     Per Curiam.   Jerry L. Hayes appeals from a sentence imposed\n\nfollowing his guilty pleas to five counts of bank robbery in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). Hayes' sentence was enhanced for\n\npossession of a firearm -- a handgun Hayes admitted he purchased in\n\nthe midst of his crime spree and kept in the glove compartment of\n\nthe car he owned and which he used to flee the final robbery.\n\nHayes has steadfastly asserted that he bought the handgun in order\n\nto provide protection for his family, and that he never used the\n\nhandgun during any of the robberies and never intended to do so.\n\n     In his original brief, Hayes argued that his sentence was\n\ninvalid under Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), because\n\nhe disputed the facts underlying the district court's determination\n\nthat he \"possessed\" the handgun during three of the five robberies\n\nand that he made an \"express threat of death\" during one of the\n\nrobberies pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) and (F).    While\n\nhis appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. ___, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).   At\n\nour invitation, the parties filed supplemental briefs in light of\n\nBooker. Hayes concedes that the Blakely/Booker issues he raises on\n\nappeal were not preserved below.   Having considered his arguments,\n\nwe conclude that he has failed to satisfy the standard set forth in\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n      Hayes admits that he kept a loaded handgun in the glove\n\ncompartment of the car he used in the commission of his bank\n\n\n                               -2-\n\frobberies.   Hayes denies, however, that he took the handgun with\n\nhim into the banks during any of the robberies.   The district court\n\naccepted this denial for the purposes of § 2B3.1(b)(2)(C).    Hayes\n\nadmits that he passed a note to a teller that stated, \"I am armed,\"\n\nbut he denies that he ever used a note that stated \"I have a gun.\"\n\nBased on Hayes' admitted facts, the sentencing enhancements applied\n\nby the district court pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) and\n\n(F) were correct as a matter of law.     United States v. Gray, 177\n\nF.3d 86, 91-92 (1st Cir. 1999) (legal interpretations of the\n\nguidelines subject to de novo review).\n\n      First, possession is established when one has \"actual and\n\nphysical control\" or \"exclusive detention and control of\" an\n\nobject.   Black's Law Dictionary 1046 (5th ed. 1979).   The handgun\n\nwas owned by Hayes and it was seized from the car he owned and was\n\noperating, alone, as his getaway car at the time of his arrest.   At\n\nall relevant times, therefore, Hayes exercised actual control and\n\nexclusive dominion over the handgun.   Cf. United States v. Lucas,\n\n282 F.3d 414, 423-24 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 849 (2002),\n\noverruled on other grounds by United States v. Leachman, 309 F.3d\n\n377 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\n     Second, in most circumstances, attempted escape from a bank\n\nrobbery is an integral part of the crime.         United States v.\n\nAshburn, 20 F.3d 1336, 1341 (5th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases),\n\ncert. denied, 514 U.S. 1113 (1995).      The presence of the loaded\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fhandgun in the front seat of Hayes' getaway car, regardless of the\n\nreasons Hayes claims it was there, constitutes possession and is\n\nsufficient to support the sentencing enhancement.\n\n      Third, and with respect to the § 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) enhancement,\n\nthe   district   court   committed    no   error   when   it   credited   the\n\nrecollection of the teller at the fourth bank Hayes robbed that\n\nHayes passed her a note stating \"I have a gun\" while he kept his\n\nleft hand concealed in his jacket. Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d at 79-\n\n80.   That Hayes claims he never had his gun on his person and would\n\nnever have used a gun during the robberies does not alter the\n\nnature of his \"unmistakable threat to use a deadly weapon.\" United\n\nStates v. Gray, 177 F.3d at 92.\n\n      Finally, Hayes has not shown that there is a \"reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would impose a different\n\nsentence more favorable to the defendant under the new 'advisory\n\nGuidelines' Booker regime.\"          Antonakopolous, 399 F.3d at 75.\n\nHayes' sentence of 78 months falls well below the statutory maximum\n\nof twenty years, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), and at the lowest end of the\n\napplicable guidelines range of 78 to 97 months. While the district\n\ncourt expressed his sympathy for Hayes who, at the age of 53 and\n\nafter a life devoted to his Pentecostal ministry, now faces a\n\nsignificant prison term, it is also clear from the transcript of\n\nthe sentencing hearing that there was no reasonable probability of\n\na lower sentence given the other factors required to be considered.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 767 (district court \"must\n\nconsult   those   Guidelines   and   take   them   into   account   when\n\nsentencing\").\n\n     Hayes' sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
