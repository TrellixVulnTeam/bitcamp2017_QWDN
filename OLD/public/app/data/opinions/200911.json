George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Richard J. Thomas, on brief pro se.\n     Frank P. Cihlar and Janet A. Bradley, Attorneys, Tax Division,\nDepartment of Justice and Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 16, 2004\n\f      Per Curiam.        Pro se appellant Richard J. Thomas appeals from\n\nthe district court's decision denying his motions to quash certain\n\nsummonses issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and\n\npartially enforcing such summonses.          See Thomas v. United States,\n\n254 F. Supp. 2d 174 (D. Me. 2003).           We affirm for the following\n\nreasons and impose a sanction for the frivolous appeal.\n\n      I.    The Appeal\n\n      In support of his challenge to the summonses, Thomas makes\n\nvarious contentions: that IRS personnel told him that he could\n\ndetermine    his   own    tax   liability;   that    certain   codes   in   IRS\n\ndocuments showed that he had \"fully paid\" his taxes for 1995 and\n\n1996 and was not required to file returns for the years 1995-2001;\n\nthat the IRS had not identified the \"particular taxing statute and\n\nimplementing regulation\" that made him liable for taxes; and that\n\nhe had not received an administrative hearing prior to issuance of\n\nthe   summonses.     Thomas     has   forfeited     consideration   of   these\n\narguments, however, because he failed to present them to the\n\ndistrict judge in his objection to the magistrate judge's report.\n\nSee 254 F. Supp. 2d at 182-83 (notifying Thomas of consequence of\n\nfailing to object to \"specified portions\" of the report); Keating\n\nv. United States, 848 F.2d 271, 274-75 (1st Cir. 1988) (declining\n\nto consider appellate arguments omitted in objection to magistrate\n\njudge's report where the report contained the same cautionary\n\nnotice as the instant report).\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f     Thomas also claims that the district judge and magistrate\n\njudge     abused      their   discretion         by   failing    to     obtain    expert\n\nassistance to construe certain IRS documents. To the extent he has\n\nnot forfeited that claim for reasons given above, he has done so\n\nbecause he has not developed his argument on appeal. United States\n\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"A claim is deemed\n\nwaived if it is merely adverted to in a perfunctory fashion,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation.\"). In any\n\nevent,    we    perceive      no   abuse    of    discretion      or    error     in   the\n\nmagistrate      judge's       determination,          which   the      district    judge\n\naccepted, that the documents he submitted failed to rebut the IRS's\n\nprima facie case in favor of enforcement.\n\n        Finally, Thomas contends that signing a 1040 form under pains\n\nof perjury would be tantamount to coercing him to waive his Fifth\n\nAmendment right not to incriminate himself.                     We need not consider\n\nthat claim -- although we note that it is frivolous -- because he\n\nfailed to raise it in the district court.                 United States v. Ocasio-\n\nRivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It is a bedrock principle\n\nin this circuit that issues must be squarely raised in the district\n\ncourt    if    they    are    to   be   preserved      for    appeal.\")     (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      II.    Sanctions\n\n      In a separate motion, the government asks this court to impose\n\na $6,000 sanction on Thomas for his frivolous appeal, citing Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1912.          It offers evidence that this\n\nsum is less than the average expense ($6,900) it incurred in\n\nattorney salaries and other costs to defend typical frivolous tax\n\nappeals during the 2001-2002 time period.             Thomas has opposed the\n\nmotion for sanctions, but does not contend that he cannot pay the\n\namount requested.\n\n      We agree with the government that this appeal was frivolous.\n\nAt bottom, Thomas contended that he could determine for himself\n\nwhether he was subject to federal tax laws, and he claimed that IRS\n\ndocuments showed that he had \"fully paid\" his 1995 and 1996 taxes,\n\nalthough his own reply brief included a Notice of Deficiency that\n\nhad been issued with respect to those very years.              Otherwise, he\n\nraised only arguments which he himself obviously did not deem\n\nsubstantial enough to pursue consistently or thoroughly in the\n\ndistrict court or on appeal.\n\n      In accordance with a recently published opinion of this court,\n\nMarino v. Brown, No. 03-1835 (1st Cir. Feb. 12, 2004) (per curiam),\n\nwe   award   a   $2,000   sanction.     We   eschew    the   higher   sanction\n\nrequested by the government in this instance because Thomas filed\n\nand briefed his appeal before we issued our Marino opinion, which\n\nexplicitly warned pro se appellants that filing an \"egregiously\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmeritless\" tax appeal could well result in a sanction \"of at least\n\n$4,000[.]\"   Slip op. at 8.\n\n     Affirmed.   A sanction of $2,000 is imposed on the appellant.\n\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 38; 28 U.S.C. ยง 1912.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
