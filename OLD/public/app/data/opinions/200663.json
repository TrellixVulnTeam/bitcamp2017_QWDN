Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                           Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                          Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n                       DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n    Stephen L. Raymond for appellant.\n\n     Joseph M. Hamilton, with whom Elizabeth L.B. Greene and\nMirick, O’Connell, DeMallie & Lougee, LLP were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                             September 25, 2003\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f             Per Curiam.          This appeal arises under the Employee\n\nRetirement     Income        Security     Act    (\"ERISA\"),    29     U.S.C.    §\n\n1132(a)(1)(B).      The district court granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the plan administrator’s decision denying long term\n\ndisability benefits to Professor Haluk Bekiroglu.                   The district\n\ncourt concluded that while the decision was debatable it was not\n\narbitrary or capricious.             In support of that conclusion, the\n\ndistrict court held that the medical and surveillance evidence in\n\nthe record supported the decision that Professor Bekiroglu was\n\ncapable of the light duty work required by his position as Business\n\nDivision Director and Professor of Management and Business at\n\nBecker College. We affirm essentially for the reasons given by the\n\ndistrict court in the memorandum and order dated October 16, 2002,\n\nadding only the following comments.\n\n             In a non-jury case, when, as here, the parties submit\n\ncross motions for judgment on an agreed record, the case is deemed\n\nto   be   submitted     as    stated.1         See   Garcia-Ayala    v.   Lederle\n\nParenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 643-44 (1st Cir. 2000).                  Instead\n\nof drawing inferences in favor of each nonmoving party, as would\n\nordinarily    be   done      in   considering    cross   motions    for   summary\n\njudgment, the court must determine the appropriate inferences to be\n\ndrawn from the factual record.                 Id.    Professor Bekiroglu can\n\nprevail on appeal \"only if he shows that the district court’s\n\n\n     1\n      Although this circuit has not decided whether a jury trial\nmight be available in an ERISA case, see Liston v.

Deaconess Waltham Hosp.,\n\n298 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              It is undisputed that the deferential ERISA standard\n\napplies.      The plan administrator’s decision will be reversed only\n\nif the \"eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of the\n\ninformation available to it.\"             Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co.,\n\n320 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).                  The eligibility determination\n\nmust be       upheld   \"if     it   was   within    [the     insurer’s]    authority,\n\nreasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\"\n\nDoyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).       \"The existence of contrary evidence does not necessarily\n\nrender [the insurer’s] decision arbitrary.\" Boardman v. Prudential\n\nIns. Co., 337 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              Professor Bekiroglu contends that the district court\n\nerred in evaluating the record evidence and, in particular, he\n\nurges    a    different      interpretation       of   his   treating     physician’s\n\nopinion.       He concedes that Dr. Johnson checked the \"yes\" box in\n\nquestion seven of the attending physician’s statement, indicating\n\nthat he was released for work in his occupation.                          He argues,\n\nhowever, that marking the \"yes\" box was a mistake and that Dr.\n\nJohnson      intended     to    support     his     application     for     long-term\n\ndisability benefits.\n\n              Professor Bekiroglu points to Dr. Johnson’s statement,\n\nconfirmed in her treating notes, that she would be happy to fill\n\nout medical forms for his disability application. He contends that\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDr. Johnson’s statement demonstrates that she intended to help his\n\napplication so that her responses on the attending physician’s\n\nstatement should be construed in his favor. Professor Bekiroglu\n\nalso points to Dr. Johnson’s narrative answer to the remainder of\n\nquestion seven, following the \"yes\" box, which asked her to explain\n\nher patient’s restrictions if he were medically unable to work at\n\nthat time.    Dr. Johnson wrote that certain symptoms made it very\n\ndifficult for Professor Bekiroglu to \"function at a full level.\"\n\n            Taken as a whole, Dr. Johnson’s opinion consistently\n\nindicated    that   Professor   Bekiroglu   was    able    to    work   at   his\n\noccupation, albeit at a somewhat reduced exertional level. Whether\n\nDr. Johnson \"happily\" agreed to complete forms in support of his\n\napplication    carries    little    persuasive   weight.        Dr.   Johnson’s\n\nspecificity about Professor Bekiroglu’s condition reveals that\n\nalthough she thought he would have difficulty performing at a full\n\nlevel, he would only have a slight limitation in his physical\n\nactivity. The surveillance conducted by Paul Revere confirms that\n\nconclusion, as does Dr. Pollak’s opinion.\n\n            While   the    record    evidence     is   open     to    different\n\ninterpretations, as the district court noted, given the deferential\n\nstandard of review Professor Bekiroglu has not shown that the\n\ndistrict court’s factual determinations were clearly erroneous.\n\nEven if the appeal were reviewed de novo, we would come to the same\n\nresult.     Therefore, the summary judgment granted by the district\n\ncourt in favor of Paul Revere is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
