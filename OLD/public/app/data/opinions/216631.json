A Cambodian woman, Vantha Pheng,\n\npetitions for review of the denial of her applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal (WOR), and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst   Torture   (CAT).      We    will   assume   familiarity   with    the\n\nstandards for granting such relief from removal and with the\n\ndeferential substantial evidence standard of judicial review, under\n\nwhich we will reverse the decision of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) only if \"a 'reasonable adjudicator would be compelled\n\nto conclude to the contrary.'\"         Castillo-Diaz v. Holder, 562 F.3d\n\n23, 26 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).                  We\n\nreview    the   decision   of   the   BIA    and   \"those   portions   of   the\n\n[Immigration Judge]'s opinion that the BIA has adopted.\"               Romilus\n\nv. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Pheng entered the United States on a six-month visitor\n\nvisa in December 2002, and in June 2004 was issued a Notice to\n\nAppear for overstaying that visa.             Before an Immigration Judge\n\n(IJ), she conceded removability and pursued an application she had\n\nfiled in October 2003 for asylum, WOR, and CAT relief. Previously,\n\nin 2000, Pheng had attempted to enter the United States using a\n\nfalse photo-substituted passport and visa.            She was interviewed at\n\nthe Newark airport, but she refused to reveal her true identity and\n\nstated that she had no fear of returning to Cambodia.                  She was\n\nremoved subject to an order of expedited removal.            Pheng failed to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdisclose this information on her 2003 asylum application and\n\ninitially lied about it at her asylum hearing.1\n\n          All told, the IJ conducted six hearings over nearly four\n\nyears, with Pheng testifying at three of the hearings.           The IJ\n\nfound Pheng's testimony credible in part, but held that she had not\n\nmet her burden to show she had been or would be persecuted, and so\n\ndid not qualify for asylum or WOR.      The IJ also found she had not\n\ndemonstrated eligibility for protection under the CAT.           The IJ\n\ndetailed several reasons for the decision.\n\n          First,   even   accepting    that   certain   misfortunes   had\n\nhappened to Pheng and her husband between 1996 and 2000, a period\n\nduring which they campaigned and demonstrated in support of the\n\nopposition Sam Rainsy party, none of these misfortunes rose to the\n\nlevel of persecution.2     Second, Pheng, who had argued that her\n\n\n     1\n          On cross-examination at her asylum hearing, when\ninitially asked whether she had ever been to the United States\nbefore she came in 2002, Pheng answered, \"No, never.\"         When\nconfronted with evidence of her earlier fraudulent attempt to\nenter, Pheng eventually admitted this denial was a lie. She also\nclaimed that she had intended to apply for asylum in 2000 and had\nbeen afraid to return to Cambodia, but had panicked when\ninterviewed. The Immigration Judge (IJ) found that the transcript\nof that interview, far from revealing anything indicating panic on\nPheng's part, rather revealed that Pheng \"was sticking to a\nparticular story and refused to budge from it.\"\n     2\n          Pheng testified that in 1996 and 1998, members of a rival\nparty came to their home and threatened them with harm; in 1997,\nthey fled to the Thai border for several months during a coup\nd'état, returning to find their home and shop vandalized; in 1998,\npolice officers chased them, hit Pheng on the back, and struck\nPheng's husband and detained him overnight when the couple\nparticipated in a demonstration protesting electoral fraud; in\n\n                                 -3-\n\fhusband's killing in 2003, after she had fled Cambodia, buttressed\n\nher own claim of persecution, had failed to provide any evidence\n\nother than her own surmise that her husband's reported death was on\n\naccount of political opinion.   Third, Pheng had not shown that her\n\nremaining family in Cambodia, including her father, sister, and two\n\nchildren (who remained with Pheng's father), had suffered any harm.\n\nFourth, despite repeated warnings that her credibility was at issue\n\nand ample time during continuances to secure affidavits from family\n\nmembers who were well-placed to corroborate her story, Pheng had\n\nfailed to produce any such corroborating evidence.3   There is ample\n\n\n\nOctober 2000, they were prevented by police from         handing out\nprovisions at a Buddhist temple; and in November 2000,   a friend who\nwas also a member of the political opposition was        killed, and\nPheng's husband, assuming that the killing was            politically\nmotivated, fled the following day.\n     3\n          Eventually, in September 2008, without explanation for\nthe delay, and despite her earlier testimony that \"in Cambodia you\ndon't have [a] birth certificate,\" Pheng produced some basic\ndocuments: an extract of her husband's death certificate, extracts\nof her children's birth certificates, and an extract of her\nmarriage certificate, all dated November 17, 2006. We point out\nthat while the BIA erred in saying that Pheng had produced no death\ncertificate for her husband, that error was immaterial to Pheng's\nclaims of persecution and harmless, as nothing in the extract of\nthe death certificate provided any information about the\ncircumstances of the man's death.\n          Notably absent from Pheng's documentation was any\nstatement from any family member corroborating her accounts. This\nwas particularly significant because, while testifying about a\nseries of rapes she endured in Cambodia, Pheng testified that\nfamily members were present the last time the rapist appeared at\nher door and that she told her father and her sister everything\nabout the rape. This is not an instance in which the trier of fact\nwould be compelled to conclude that corroborating evidence is\nunavailable. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4).\n\n                                -4-\n\fevidence in the record to support these four conclusions, and so we\n\nturn to the central point of Pheng's claims.\n\n          Pheng's petition for review focuses mainly on the IJ's\n\nfinding that Pheng's testimony that she was raped by a Cambodian\n\npoliceman, while credible, did not satisfy Pheng's burden to prove\n\nshe had been persecuted on account of a protected ground.      See\n\nAnacassus v. Holder, 602 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 2010) (explaining\n\npetitioner's burden of proof).   We describe Pheng's testimony.\n\n          Pheng's husband left home in late November 2000 after a\n\nfriend who was also part of the political opposition was killed,\n\nand Pheng had no contact with him or knowledge of his whereabouts\n\nafter he left. In April 2001, while Pheng's children were visiting\n\nfamily for the Cambodian New Year holiday and Pheng was at home\n\nalone, a policeman described in Pheng's written application as a\n\ncaptain knocked on the door.   When she asked the policeman who he\n\nwas looking for, he said he wanted to give Pheng information about\n\nher husband.   He then pointed his gun at her, pushed her into the\n\nhouse, and raped her.   In her asylum application, Pheng wrote that\n\nafterward, the man promised to remove her name from a \"blacklist.\"\n\nThe rapist did not say anything to suggest that he raped her\n\nbecause of her or her husband's political activities.\n\n          Pheng said the same policeman raped her four more times\n\nbut she gave little description of the next three assaults, much\n\nless of the reasons, explaining only that he came up with \"some\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\firrational reason to rape me,\" and that each time, like the first,\n\nshe was alone at home when the rapist appeared at her door and said\n\nhe had news about her husband.\n\n            She testified she was last raped in September 2002. This\n\ntime her family was at home with her when the rapist knocked at the\n\ndoor, claiming to have information about Pheng's husband.    At the\n\nhearing Pheng testified that, at the man's request, she left her\n\nhome and went with him in his car on a journey of about forty-five\n\nminutes.    When she refused his sexual overtures in the car, he\n\nthreatened to kill her and her children if she did not have sex\n\nwith him.     After he raped her, he drove her home.     In Pheng's\n\nwritten application, the description was different: Pheng said that\n\nthe man was furious her family was there, \"pretended to arrest\"\n\nher, and forced her into the car before he drove her into the woods\n\nand raped her.     In her application, she also said she told her\n\nfather and sister everything about the rape, and they told her she\n\nshould leave Cambodia, which she did within three months of the\n\nSeptember 2002 rape, leaving her children to remain in Cambodia\n\nwith her father.\n\n            While accepting Pheng's testimony that she had been\n\nraped, the IJ found that Pheng had not shown this was persecution.\n\n     The respondent has not proven to this Court's\n     satisfaction that . . . the rapes were politically\n     motivated. As horrendous as they may have been and the\n     Court believes that they occurred, the respondent has\n     not established that she sought safety elsewhere. . . .\n     She continued to live in Cambodia for another two months\n\n                                 -6-\n\f         in   the  same   location,   continuing   to   run   her\n         business . . . .    Again, it does not appear to this\n         Court's satisfaction that the rapes were motivated by\n         anybody seeking to harm the respondent on account of her\n         political opinion or on account of her relationship to\n         her husband, but rather that the individual in question\n         appears to have identified her as vulnerable . . . .\n\n             Pheng appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ's findings\n\nwere clearly erroneous, an argument the BIA rejected.         The BIA\n\nagreed with the IJ that Pheng had not met her burden of showing\n\npersecution, particularly her burden of showing that the rapes were\n\npolitically motivated or that the other harm she suffered rose to\n\nthe level of persecution.     The BIA also pointed to Pheng's failure\n\nto produce corroborative evidence.       Further, the BIA found that\n\nPheng's disclaimer of any fear of returning to Cambodia during her\n\nfraudulent 2000 attempt to enter the United States undermined her\n\nclaim that she feared future political persecution.\n\n             On petition for judicial review, Pheng primarily argues\n\nthat the IJ was required to find that the rapes constituted\n\npolitical persecution because they were committed by a government\n\nofficer and because that officer had said he had information about\n\nPheng's husband, who had been politically active and was missing\n\nduring the period when the rapes took place.4        There is no such\n\n\n     4\n          Pheng also argues for the first time in this court that\nshe has been persecuted on account of her membership in the social\ngroup of \"spouses of Opposition Party members who have fled or\notherwise gone missing.\" She failed to exhaust this claim before\nthe agency, and may not raise it for the first time in a petition\nfor review. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); Silva v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 68,\n72 (1st Cir. 2006). The social group claim would in any event\n\n                                   -7-\n\frequirement.    Rather, to carry her burden of proving eligibility\n\nfor asylum, Pheng was required to \"provide sufficient evidence to\n\nforge an actual connection between the harm and some statutorily\n\nprotected ground.\"     Lopez de Hincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213,\n\n218 (1st Cir. 2007).    The record in Pheng's case did not compel the\n\nIJ and BIA to conclude that Pheng had established this \"critical\"\n\ncausal nexus.    See Sompotan v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992)).\n\n            Rape, repugnant as it is, is committed for many reasons,\n\neven when committed by government officials. There was no evidence\n\nhere that the rapes were committed for political reasons, or that\n\nthe government knew about or authorized the sexual assaults.            See\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120-21 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nPheng's description of the rapes in her oral testimony and written\n\napplication was sparse, and she did not recount anything the rapist\n\nsaid or did that would support an inference that he was motivated\n\nby her or her husband's political activities.         In fact, Pheng's\n\nmention of the rapist's offer to shield and protect her by getting\n\nher named removed from a \"blacklist\" suggested otherwise.\n\n            Nor did anything in the 2002 and 2007 Cambodia country\n\ncondition   reports    Pheng   submitted   substantiate   her   claim    of\n\npolitically motivated rape.     In fact, the reports both stated that\n\nwhile Cambodian law prohibits rape, rape is common in Cambodia.\n\n\nsuffer from the same problem as her political opinion claim.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           No evidence compelled the IJ or BIA to conclude that the\n\nrapes had a nexus to a statutorily protected ground as required to\n\nshow prosecution. See Socop v. Holder, Nos. 09-1477, 09-1478, 2011\n\nWL 291094, at *1, *4 (1st Cir. Jan. 31, 2011) (unpublished)\n\n(holding that petitioner had not shown her repeated rape was tied\n\nto a protected ground).    Rather, as the IJ concluded, the evidence\n\nsuggested that the rapist took personal advantage of information\n\nthat Pheng was vulnerable in her husband's absence.         Pheng cannot\n\ndemonstrate past persecution.\n\n           In this court, Pheng has relied exclusively on the rapes\n\nin 2001 and 2002 to establish that she fears future persecution of\n\nthe same type.    Cf. Vilela v. Holder, 620 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2010)   (describing   petitioner's   sole   reliance   on   showing   past\n\npersecution).    However, because Pheng did not establish past\n\npersecution, she is not entitled to the rebuttable presumption that\n\nshe would suffer future persecution.        8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1);\n\nButt v. Keisler, 506 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 2007).       And she did not\n\nmeet her burden of showing any other basis for an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of future persecution on a statutorily protected\n\nground.   See Butt, 506 F.3d at 91; Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 122.       The\n\nasylum claim fails.\n\n           Pheng has not argued to this court that the BIA's and\n\nIJ's decisions denying her WOR or protection under the CAT were\n\nerroneous, and so she has waived both claims.      Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fat 120 n.3.   In any event, since the standard for withholding of\n\nremoval is higher than for asylum, Pheng necessarily failed to meet\n\nthat burden when she failed to meet her asylum burden.      Villa-\n\nLondono v. Holder, 600 F.3d 21, 24 n.1 (1st Cir. 2010).   Nor were\n\nthe BIA and IJ compelled by the evidence to find that Pheng had\n\nshown, as required for protection under the CAT, that it was more\n\nlikely than not that she would be subject to \"severe pain and\n\nsuffering\" at the hands of or with the consent or acquiescence of\n\na \"public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1); see also Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

Further, the BIA found that Pheng's disclaimer of any fear of returning to Cambodia during her fraudulent 2000 attempt to enter the United States undermined her claim that she feared future political persecution.</p>\n<p>On petition for judicial review, Pheng primarily argues that the IJ was required to find that the rapes constituted political persecution because they were committed by a government officer and because that officer had said he had information about Pheng's husband, who had been politically active and was missing during the period when the rapes took place.<sup>[4]</sup> There is no such requirement. Rather, to carry her burden of proving eligibility for asylum, Pheng was required to \"provide sufficient evidence to forge an actual connection between the harm and some statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Lopez de Hincapie v. Gonzales,</i> 494 F.3d 213, 218 (1st Cir.2007). The record in Pheng's case did not compel the IJ and BIA to conclude that Pheng had established this \"critical\" causal nexus. <i>See </i><i>Sompotan v. Mukasey,</i> 533 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p>Rape, repugnant as it is, is committed for many reasons, even when committed by government officials. There was no evidence here that the rapes were committed for political reasons, or that the government knew about or authorized the sexual assaults. <i>See </i><i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120-21 (1st Cir.2005). Pheng's description of the rapes in her oral testimony and written application was sparse, and she did not recount anything the rapist said or did that would support an inference that he was motivated by her or her husband's political activities. In fact, Pheng's mention of the rapist's offer to shield and protect her by getting her named removed from a \"blacklist\" suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p>Nor did anything in the 2002 and 2007 Cambodia country condition reports Pheng submitted substantiate her claim of politically motivated rape. In fact, the reports both stated that while Cambodian law prohibits rape, rape is common in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>No evidence compelled the IJ or BIA to conclude that the rapes had a nexus to a statutorily protected ground as required to show prosecution. <i>See Socop v. Holder,</i> 407 Fed.Appx. 495, 496, 499 (1st Cir.2011) (unpublished) (holding that petitioner had not shown her repeated rape was tied to a protected ground). Rather, as the IJ concluded, the evidence suggested that the rapist took personal advantage of information that Pheng was vulnerable in her husband's absence. Pheng cannot demonstrate past persecution.</p>\n<p>In this court, Pheng has relied exclusively on the rapes in 2001 and 2002 to establish that she fears future persecution of the same type. <i>Cf. </i><i>Vilela v. Holder,</i> 620 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.2010) (describing petitioner's sole reliance on showing past persecution). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> However, because Pheng did not establish past persecution, she is not entitled to the rebuttable presumption that she would suffer future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1); <i>Butt v. Keisler,</i> 506 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.2007). And she did not meet her burden of showing any other basis for an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution on a statutorily protected ground. <i>See </i><i>Butt,</i> 506 F.3d at 91; <i>Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 122. The asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p>Pheng has not argued to this court that the BIA's and IJ's decisions denying her WOR or protection under the CAT were erroneous, and so she has waived both claims. <i>Nikijuluw,</i> 427 F.3d at 120 n. 3. In any event, since the standard for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum, Pheng necessarily failed to meet that burden when she failed to meet her asylum burden. <i>Villa-Londono v. Holder,</i> 600 F.3d 21, 24 n. 1 (1st Cir.2010). Nor were the BIA and IJ compelled by the evidence to find that Pheng had shown, as required for protection under the CAT, that it was more likely than not that she would be subject to \"severe pain and suffering\" at the hands of or with the consent or acquiescence of a \"public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Chhay v. Mukasey,</i> 540 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The petition is denied.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  On cross-examination at her asylum hearing, when initially asked whether she had ever been to the United States before she came in 2002, Pheng answered, \"No, never.\" When confronted with evidence of her earlier fraudulent attempt to enter, Pheng eventually admitted this denial was a lie. She also claimed that she had intended to apply for asylum in 2000 and had been afraid to return to Cambodia, but had panicked when interviewed. The Immigration Judge (IJ) found that the transcript of that interview, far from revealing anything indicating panic on Pheng's part, rather revealed that Pheng \"was sticking to a particular story and refused to budge from it.\"</p>\n<p>[2]  Pheng testified that in 1996 and 1998, members of a rival party came to their home and threatened them with harm; in 1997, they fled to the Thai border for several months during a coup d'état, returning to find their home and shop vandalized; in 1998, police officers chased them, hit Pheng on the back, and struck Pheng's husband and detained him overnight when the couple participated in a demonstration protesting electoral fraud; in October 2000, they were prevented by police from handing out provisions at a Buddhist temple; and in November 2000, a friend who was also a member of the political opposition was killed, and Pheng's husband, assuming that the killing was politically motivated, fled the following day.</p>\n<p>[3]  Eventually, in September 2008, without explanation for the delay, and despite her earlier testimony that \"in Cambodia you don't have [a] birth certificate,\" Pheng produced some basic documents: an extract of her husband's death certificate, extracts of her children's birth certificates, and an extract of her marriage certificate, all dated November 17, 2006. We point out that while the BIA erred in saying that Pheng had produced no death certificate for her husband, that error was immaterial to Pheng's claims of persecution and harmless, as nothing in the extract of the death certificate provided any information about the circumstances of the man's death.\n</p>\n<p>Notably absent from Pheng's documentation was any statement from any family member corroborating her accounts. This was particularly significant because, while testifying about a series of rapes she endured in Cambodia, Pheng testified that family members were present the last time the rapist appeared at her door and that she told her father and her sister everything about the rape. This is not an instance in which the trier of fact would be compelled to conclude that corroborating evidence is unavailable. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4).</p>\n<p>[4]  Pheng also argues for the first time in this court that she has been persecuted on account of her membership in the social group of \"spouses of Opposition Party members who have fled or otherwise gone missing.\" She failed to exhaust this claim before the agency, and may not raise it for the first time in a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1); <i>Silva v. Gonzales,</i> 463 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2006). The social group claim would in any event suffer from the same problem as her political opinion claim.</p>\n\n</div>",

Before an Immigration Judge (IJ), she conceded removability and pursued an application she had filed in October 2003 for asylum, WOR, and CAT relief. Previously, in 2000, Pheng had attempted to enter the United States using a false photo-substituted passport and visa. She was interviewed at the Newark airport, but she refused to reveal her true identity and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> stated that she had no fear of returning to Cambodia. She was removed subject to an order of expedited removal. Pheng failed to disclose this information on her 2003 asylum application and initially lied about it at her asylum hearing.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>All told, the IJ conducted six hearings over nearly four years, with Pheng testifying at three of the hearings. The IJ found Pheng's testimony credible in part, but held that she had not met her burden to show she had been or would be persecuted, and so did not qualify for asylum or WOR. The IJ also found she had not demonstrated eligibility for protection under the CAT. The IJ detailed several reasons for the decision.</p>\n<p>First, even accepting that certain misfortunes had happened to Pheng and her husband between 1996 and 2000, a period during which they campaigned and demonstrated in support of the opposition Sam Rainsy party, none of these misfortunes rose to the level of persecution.<sup>[2]</sup> Second, Pheng, who had argued that her husband's killing in 2003, after she had fled Cambodia, buttressed her own claim of persecution, had failed to provide any evidence other than her own surmise that her husband's reported death was on account of political opinion. Third, Pheng had not shown that her remaining family in Cambodia, including her father, sister, and two children (who remained with Pheng's father), had suffered any harm. Fourth, despite repeated warnings that her credibility was at issue and ample time during continuances to secure affidavits from family members who were well-placed to corroborate her story, Pheng had failed to produce any such corroborating evidence.<sup>[3]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> There is ample evidence in the record to support these four conclusions, and so we turn to the central point of Pheng's claims.</p>\n<p>Pheng's petition for review focuses mainly on the IJ's finding that Pheng's testimony that she was raped by a Cambodian policeman, while credible, did not satisfy Pheng's burden to prove she had been persecuted on account of a protected ground. <i>See </i><i>Anacassus v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145536\"><a href=\"/opinion/145536/anacassus-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2010) (explaining petitioner's burden of proof). We describe Pheng's testimony.</p>\n<p>Pheng's husband left home in late November 2000 after a friend who was also part of the political opposition was killed, and Pheng had no contact with him or knowledge of his whereabouts after he left. In April 2001, while Pheng's children were visiting family for the Cambodian New Year holiday and Pheng was at home alone, a policeman described in Pheng's written application as a captain knocked on the door. When she asked the policeman who he was looking for, he said he wanted to give Pheng information about her husband. He then pointed his gun at her, pushed her into the house, and raped her. In her asylum application, Pheng wrote that afterward, the man promised to remove her name from a \"blacklist.\" The rapist did not say anything to suggest that he raped her because of her or her husband's political activities.</p>\n<p>Pheng said the same policeman raped her four more times but she gave little description of the next three assaults, much less of the reasons, explaining only that he came up with \"some irrational reason to rape me,\" and that each time, like the first, she was alone at home when the rapist appeared at her door and said he had news about her husband.</p>\n<p>She testified she was last raped in September 2002. This time her family was at home with her when the rapist knocked at the door, claiming to have information about Pheng's husband. At the hearing Pheng testified that, at the man's request, she left her home and went with him in his car on a journey of about forty-five minutes. When she refused his sexual overtures in the car, he threatened to kill her and her children if she did not have sex with him. After he raped her, he drove her home. In Pheng's written application, the description was different: Pheng said that the man was furious her family was there, \"pretended to arrest\" her, and forced her into the car before he drove her into the woods and raped her. In her application, she also said she told her father and sister everything about the rape, and they told her she should leave Cambodia, which she did within three months of the September 2002 rape, leaving her children to remain in Cambodia with her father.</p>\n<p>While accepting Pheng's testimony that she had been raped, the IJ found that Pheng had not shown this was persecution.</p>\n<blockquote>The respondent has not proven to this Court's satisfaction that ... the rapes were politically motivated. As horrendous as they may have been and the Court believes that they occurred, the respondent has not established that she sought safety elsewhere.... She continued to live in Cambodia for another two months in the same location, continuing to run her business.... Again, it does not appear to this Court's satisfaction that the rapes were motivated by anybody seeking to harm the respondent on account of her political opinion or on account of her relationship to her husband, but rather that the individual in question appears to have identified her as vulnerable....</blockquote>\n<p>Pheng appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ's findings were clearly erroneous, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> an argument the BIA rejected. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Pheng had not met her burden of showing persecution, particularly her burden of showing that the rapes were politically motivated or that the other harm she suffered rose to the level of persecution. The BIA also pointed to Pheng's failure to produce corroborative evidence. Further, the BIA found that Pheng's disclaimer of any fear of returning to Cambodia during her fraudulent 2000 attempt to enter the United States undermined her claim that she feared future political persecution.</p>\n<p>On petition for judicial review, Pheng primarily argues that the IJ was required to find that the rapes constituted political persecution because they were committed by a government officer and because that officer had said he had information about Pheng's husband, who had been politically active and was missing during the period when the rapes took place.<sup>[4]</sup> There is no such requirement.
