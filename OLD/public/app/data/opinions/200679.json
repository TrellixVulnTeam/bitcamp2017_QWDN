Defendant/Appellee Humberto\n\nCorreia was convicted of arson, three counts of mail fraud, and use\n\nof fire in the commission of a felony.   After the verdict, he moved\n\nfor a new trial pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 33.    At the suggestion\n\nof the district court, one of the claims advanced by Correia in\n\nsupport of that motion was ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nAfter the Rule 33 hearing, at which Correia was represented by new\n\ncounsel, the court granted a new trial on that ground.           The\n\ngovernment now appeals. We affirm the order of the district court.\n\n                                 I\n\n          In September 1996, a fire broke out in Correia’s photo\n\nprocessing plant at approximately nine o’clock in the morning.    It\n\nwas quickly extinguished by the fire department. Correia submitted\n\nan insurance claim to his insurer, Travelers Insurance.    Travelers\n\ninvestigated the incident and paid the claim.\n\n          The district court accurately summarized the government’s\n\ncase at trial in the following terms:\n\n                 At trial, the government could not, and\n          did not, present any direct evidence that\n          defendant set fire to his photo processing\n          laboratory on that fateful Monday morning, in\n          downtown Taunton, Massachusetts. Rather, the\n          case against him was crafted from a patchwork\n          of circumstantial evidence, largely unrebutted\n          by the defense. According to the government,\n          defendant arrived at his photo lab on\n          September 30, 1996, with the intent to set\n          fire to the building. The government’s theory\n          was that defendant was in financial straits\n          and the fire became his “exit strategy.”\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f             At   trial,   the   government     relied   largely    upon    the\n\ntestimony of three individuals: Vincent Calenda, a fire causation\n\nexpert;     Gregory   Galligan,    a     fire   investigator;      and     Roger\n\nNascimento, a wiring inspector.         They testified that there was no\n\nevident accidental cause and, in particular, that an electrical\n\nproblem was not involved. Galligan testified that Correia told him\n\non two occasions that he turned off the fire alarm system in his\n\nbuilding on the morning of the fire but was unable to offer any\n\nexplanation for having done so.\n\n             For the purpose of establishing the defendant’s motive\n\nfor the arson, the government introduced a chart into evidence\n\ndetailing the defendant’s debt at the time of the fire.            This chart\n\nshowed debts of over $270,000, without explanation.             These debts\n\napparently included approximately $208,000 in mortgages–$90,000 on\n\nhis home, and $118,000 on his business–as well as an equipment loan\n\nof around $53,000 and a car loan of $6,000, though the chart did\n\nnot inform the jury of these facts.\n\n             The defense argued that the government had failed to\n\nprove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.                    It\n\nsuggested that the fire was electrical in nature but offered no\n\nexpert testimony in support of that suggestion.\n\n             The trial court found four deficiencies in counsel’s\n\nperformance.1     First, counsel had no acceptable reason for failing\n\n\n     1\n         Correia was in fact represented by two attorneys.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fto call Manuel Franco, who would have testified that he installed\n\nthe alarm system in Correia’s building, that it was a burglar alarm\n\nsystem, and that there was no fire alarm system to be turned off.\n\nSecond, counsel’s argument that the fire was electrical in nature,\n\nwithout any proffer of expert testimony and in the face of numerous\n\nexperts for the government who stated that it was definitively not\n\nelectrical in nature, was counterproductive.               More importantly,\n\naccording to the court, counsel ignored a key piece of testimony\n\nthat   would   have   helped   the   defense       immeasurably.     Galligan\n\ntestified that in 20% of the cases, the origin and cause of the\n\nfire remains forever undetermined.               Because there was no direct\n\nevidence linking Correia to the fire and because the government’s\n\nexperts had reached their conclusion of arson by a process of\n\neliminating all other possible causes, counsel’s failure to follow\n\nup and cross-examine Galligan on the fact that fires often go\n\nunexplained, in the court’s words, “fell below the standard for\n\nprofessionally competent assistance that is safeguarded by the\n\nSixth Amendment.”      Third, the district court faulted counsel’s\n\nfailure   to   call   the   attorney       who    had   conducted   Travelers’\n\ninvestigation of the fire and who had concluded that “the cause of\n\nfire should be classified as undetermined.”             In the court’s view,\n\nthe “facts and opinions contained in [the attorney’s] report\n\npotentially provided a roadmap to reasonable doubt and a list of\n\nsolid defense witnesses.” Finally, the district court was troubled\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fby counsel’s failure to object to the chart of Correia’s debts,\n\nwhich was “highly misleading,” as it listed the total debt without\n\nexplanation and did not include any mention of Correia’s assets.\n\nIn fact, much of the debt was typical of business ownership and was\n\nnot evidence of a failing business.        Furthermore, there was no\n\nreference to Correia’s savings account of $26,000, nor to the fact\n\nthat he was able to support a household of five.\n\n            The district court concluded that the failure to call\n\nFranco, by itself, as well as all four errors combined, “fell below\n\nan   objective   standard   of   reasonableness   and   prejudiced   the\n\ndefense.”     As a result, “a serious miscarriage of justice” had\n\noccurred and a new trial was warranted.     For essentially the same\n\nreasons given by the district court, we affirm.\n\n                                   II\n\n            “Motions for a new trial are directed to the discretion\n\nof the trial court.”   United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019\n\n(1st Cir. 1980).    “We will not disturb the disposition of a new\n\ntrial motion unless the court abused its discretion or misapplied\n\nthe law.”     United States v. Rothrock, 806 F.2d 318, 321-22 (1st\n\nCir. 1986).    The district court clearly applied the correct legal\n\nstandard and, so, it is its discretionary judgment that we must\n\nreview.   See United States v. Conley, 249 F.3d 38, 44-45 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           “The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the\n\nright to effective assistance of counsel at trial.”               United States\n\nv. Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 265 (1st Cir. 2003). “To demonstrate\n\na violation of this right, a defendant must show that counsel's\n\nperformance    was    constitutionally      deficient   and     that   prejudice\n\nresulted.”      Id.       Counsel’s      assistance     is     constitutionally\n\nineffective only when it falls “below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness,”      Strickland    v.   Washington,     466    U.S.   668,   688\n\n(1984).    Moreover, counsel’s deficiency “must have resulted in\n\nprejudice, defined as a ‘reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, the result . . . would have been\n\ndifferent.’”     Epsom v. Hall, 330 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).\n\n           We hold that there was no abuse of discretion in the\n\nfinding that the errors identified by the district court rendered\n\nthe assistance received by Correia constitutionally ineffective.\n\nDefense counsel’s failure to call Franco, who was in the best\n\nposition to know whether the defendant had a fire alarm and would\n\nhave testified that no such alarm existed for the defendant to have\n\nturned off, is mystifying.         Galligan’s testimony that Correia had\n\nadmitted   turning off the fire alarm on the morning of the fire was\n\nby far the most damning evidence the government had to offer.\n\nDefense counsel had a full and convincing response from a neutral\n\nwitness and failed to play this trump card.             Moreover, given the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fabsence   of   direct   evidence   of   arson   and   the   fact   that   the\n\ngovernment’s experts were accordingly compelled to attempt to prove\n\nthe government’s case by eliminating other causes, the frequency of\n\ncases of undetermined cause was an obvious theme to have stressed.\n\n            With   respect   to    prejudice,     given     the    entirely\n\ncircumstantial nature of the government’s case and the seriousness\n\nof the failings of defense counsel, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in finding a “reasonable probability that, but\n\nfor counsels’ unprofessional errors, the result . . . would have\n\nbeen different.”\n\n                                   III\n\n            The order of the district court granting a new trial is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",

Galligan’s testimony that Correia had\n\nadmitted   turning off the fire alarm on the morning of the fire was\n\nby far the most damning evidence the government had to offer.\n\nDefense counsel had a full and convincing response from a neutral\n\nwitness and failed to play this trump card.             Moreover, given the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fabsence   of   direct   evidence   of   arson   and   the   fact   that   the\n\ngovernment’s experts were accordingly compelled to attempt to prove\n\nthe government’s case by eliminating other causes, the frequency of\n\ncases of undetermined cause was an obvious theme to have stressed.\n\n            With   respect   to    prejudice,     given     the    entirely\n\ncircumstantial nature of the government’s case and the seriousness\n\nof the failings of defense counsel, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in finding a “reasonable probability that, but\n\nfor counsels’ unprofessional errors, the result . . . would have\n\nbeen different.”\n\n                                   III\n\n            The order of the district court granting a new trial is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f</pre>",
