After a bench trial, the district court\n\nentered judgment for the United States on Dr. Juan R. Sánchez\n\nInfante's claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2671 et seq., that certain Veteran's Administration (\"VA\")\n\nphysicians negligently failed to review his MRI, to discuss the MRI\n\nresults with him, and to prescribe an anticoagulant therapy that\n\nwould have averted his 1994 stroke. Sánchez appeals and we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          We present a brief overview of the case, saving a more\n\ndetailed recitation for our analysis.           The following facts are\n\nundisputed.\n\n          Sánchez    began   work        at   the   San   Juan   Veterans\n\nAdministration Medical Center as a pathologist in 1991. During his\n\nrequired physical examination, he was diagnosed with diabetes\n\nmellitus type II, and placed on Glucotrol to control his elevated\n\nblood sugar.   Sánchez was 5'2\" tall and weighed between 190 and 210\n\npounds during the relevant time period.         He did not exercise, had\n\na poor diet and a family history of cardiac problems, and drank\n\nsocially nearly every day.   Sánchez also worked long hours at the\n\nhospital and characterized his duties as stressful.          His medical\n\nrecords from 1991 to 1994 show three blood pressure readings (one\n\nnormal and two borderline hypertensive by 1994 standards) and\n\nconsistent difficulties in controlling his blood sugar.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          In early 1994, one of Sánchez's colleagues, Dr. Angel\n\nNoriega, noticed that Sánchez was falling asleep during the day,\n\nand, fearing that Sánchez was suffering from sleep apnea,1 arranged\n\nfor an evaluation.   Part of the evaluation consisted of a March 7,\n\n1994 polysomnography,2 which revealed a significant number of apnea\n\nepisodes during the test period.      Noriega also sent Sánchez for a\n\nmagnetic resonance imagining (\"MRI\") study, to check for brain\n\nlesions indicative of a particularly serious form of sleep apnea.\n\nOn March 22, 1994, Sánchez had the MRI, which showed no brain\n\nlesions and was essentially normal.         However, the MRI report\n\nincluded the notation: \"Multiple hyperintense focci are seen within\n\nthe periventricular white matter suggestive of deep white matter\n\nischemic3 changes.   Please, correlate clinically.\"      The medical\n\nrecords do not indicate whether Sánchez's physicians ever acted\n\nupon the MRI or discussed it with him.      Nonetheless, Sánchez was\n\nsuccessfully treated for his sleep apnea condition.\n\n          On August 31, 1994, Sánchez suffered a cerebrovascular\n\naccident (\"CVA\"), a \"stroke\" in common parlance.      The stroke left\n\n\n\n     1\n      A serious condition in which an individual stops breathing\nwhile asleep. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 115-6\n(30th ed. 2003).\n     2\n      A diagnostic test for sleep disorders that monitors the\npatient's relevant physiological functions while he is asleep. See\nDorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1485 (30th ed. 2003).\n     3\n      Indicating  deficiency   in  blood   flow.  See      Dorland's\nIllustrated Medical Dictionary 954 (30th ed. 2003).\n\n                                -3-\n\fhim with significant paralysis of the right side of his body, which\n\nhas required him to walk with a cane or braces and learn to perform\n\nhis duties as a pathologist with his left hand.             The stroke has\n\nalso caused emotional disturbances and depression. Sánchez was\n\nplaced on anticoagulant therapy immediately after the stroke. In\n\nthe following years, Sánchez suffered from a host of other health\n\nproblems, including two subsequent CVAs, and has been regularly\n\ntreated by VA physicians. Sánchez claims that, upon requesting his\n\nmedical records for a 1999 procedure, he learned of the 1994 MRI\n\nreport for the first time.\n\n           Sánchez filed his administrative claim in December 2000,\n\nand, after it was denied, he filed this action in the district\n\ncourt on April 17, 2002.    As noted, he alleged that the treating VA\n\nphysicians failed to review the MRI, to discuss the MRI with him,\n\nand to provide proper treatment to avert the stroke that he would\n\nsuffer five months later.          The government moved to dismiss on\n\ngrounds of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that Sánchez failed to\n\nfile his administrative claim within two years of his 1994 stroke.\n\nThe court denied the motion because, on the pleading record, there\n\nwas no indication that Sánchez was aware of the alleged malpractice\n\nuntil he saw the MRI report in October 1999.                 See generally\n\nGonzalez   v.   United   States,    284   F.3d    281,   288-89    (1st   Cir.\n\n2002)(discovery   rule   tolls     running   of   statute   of    limitations\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fapplicable to the filing of the administrative claim that is a\n\nprerequisite to an FTCA action).\n\n          Six witnesses testified at the bench trial: Sánchez; his\n\nmedical expert, Dr. Angel Román Franco; two psychiatrists; the\n\noriginal treating physician, Dr. Noriega; and the government's\n\nexpert, Dr. Antonio Alvarez Berdecía.   The gist of Sánchez's claim\n\nwas that if he had been placed upon anticoagulants after the 1994\n\nMRI, he would not have suffered his stroke.\n\n          Dr. Román, a pathologist for the University of Puerto\n\nRico Medical School, testified that there would have been a good\n\nchance of avoiding the stroke if Sánchez had been placed on\n\nanticoagulants (such as aspirin) at the time of the MRI.     Román\n\nemphasized Sánchez's apnea, which significantly increased his heart\n\nrate and blood pressure, and resulted in oxygen deprivation to his\n\nbrain that caused \"cell death\" (as revealed by the ischemic changes\n\nin the brain shown in the MRI).      Román asserted that the white\n\nmatter changes shown in the MRI were indicative of \"mini strokes\"\n\nthat had already occurred and were harbingers of a larger stroke to\n\ncome if not prevented with anticoagulant therapy.    Román further\n\ntestified that Sánchez's other risk factors beyond apnea were\n\nessentially inconsequential, as his diabetes mellitus had only been\n\npresent for a short time (as evidenced by his normal kidney\n\nfunctions), his high blood pressure was only marginal and of recent\n\nonset, and he had normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f          Sánchez    testified at length about his experiences,\n\nmedical treatment, level of disability, and rehabilitation.     He\n\nstated that he never inquired about the results of the MRI because\n\nhe had complete confidence in his colleagues.   He also stated that\n\nhe could not have reviewed his own medical records, as that was\n\nstrictly forbidden by the hospital.\n\n          Dr. Noriega,4 a board certified neurologist, testified\n\nthat, while he could not specifically recall speaking with Sánchez\n\nabout the MRI, it was standard hospital practice to discuss test\n\nresults with patients, and no less so if they were also colleagues.\n\nHe further testified that he would never have begun Sánchez's sleep\n\napnea treatment without reviewing all test results and discussing\n\nthem with Sánchez.    He also stated that all VA physicians have\n\naccess to all medical records, including their own, and that, on\n\none occasion, Sánchez brought his own medical records to Noriega.\n\nHe also testified that the phrase \"correlate clinically\" on the MRI\n\nreport meant to relate the radiological findings to any actual\n\nphysical manifestations in the patient. He stated that Sánchez had\n\nno symptoms –- no evidence of \"little strokes\" -- so there was\n\nnothing to treat.    He further testified that nothing could have\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Noriega had retired from his duties at the VA Hospital some\nyears before, and neither side had arranged for his testimony.\nMid-trial, the district judge decided that his testimony was\ncritical and ordered the parties to bring him in as a witness.\n\n                               -6-\n\fbeen done to prevent this type of stroke, and that he would not\n\nhave prescribed aspirin out of a fear of hemorrhage.\n\n            Dr. Alvarez, a board certified neurologist, testified\n\nthat Sánchez's stroke was occasioned by small vessel disease that\n\nwas primarily caused by Sánchez's hypertension and diabetes.5           He\n\nnoted that the negative effects of diabetes and hypertension were\n\nadditive, with hypertension being the primary culprit for such\n\nstrokes in 70% of the cases.     He further testified that Sánchez's\n\nhypertension   and   diabetes   were   longstanding,   as   evidenced   by\n\nSánchez's left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic retinopathy.\n\n            Alvarez testified that the white matter lesions on the\n\nMRI were only just beginning to be noted in 1994, and that their\n\nmeaning is still the subject of debate today.      He was adamant that\n\nthe white matter changes were not \"strokes,\" and that there was no\n\nreal treatment available, in 1994 or at present, other than to\n\ncontrol the major risk factors – hypertension, diabetes, and\n\nobesity.    As to risk factor management, Alvarez noted that Sánchez\n\nappeared to take poor care of himself, noting his failure to\n\ncontrol his blood sugar, to follow a diet, and to monitor his blood\n\npressure.    As to anticoagulant therapy, Alvarez emphasized that\n\nthere was no evidence that aspirin or other anticoagulants were\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      He also noted Sánchez's other risk factors –- obesity, poor\ndiet, lack of exercise, family history of heart problems, and\nalcohol use.\n\n                                  -7-\n\feffective in the primary prevention6 of strokes.                     Indeed, he\n\nasserted that the primary efficacy of such anticoagulants was in\n\nsecondary prevention of strokes.          Further, he noted that aspirin\n\nincreased the risk of hemorrhagic strokes, which were typically\n\nworse    than    ischemic    strokes.      Moreover,       he    stated    that\n\nanticoagulants would not have helped Sánchez because his stroke was\n\nnot caused by a clot.     In support of this opinion, he observed that\n\nan echocardiogram from the time of the stroke showed no embolic\n\nsource from the heart and normal blood flow in Sánchez's large\n\narteries.       Alvarez   also   noted   that    Sánchez    showed    continued\n\nevidence of CVAs even while he was on anticoagulants after his\n\nfirst stroke.\n\n            The district court issued a memorandum order dismissing\n\nthe action as a \"no-liability\" case. See Sanchez v. United States,\n\nNo. 02-1590 (D.P.R. Apr. 12, 2004).         Relying largely on Noriega's\n\ntestimony, the court concluded that Sánchez was made aware of the\n\nMRI results at the time of his treatment for sleep apnea and had\n\naccess to his own medical records.              Id. at 6.       The court also\n\ncredited the testimony of Alvarez, accepting his conclusions that\n\nthe white matter lesions on the MRI were secondary to small vessel\n\ndisease brought about by Sánchez's hypertension and diabetes.               Id.\n\n\n\n     6\n      The experts distinguished between primary prevention, which\nthey defined as efforts to prevent the initial stroke, and\nsecondary prevention, which they defined as efforts to prevent\nadditional strokes.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fat 6-11.   The court found that the VA physicians did not violate\n\nany standard of care, Sánchez did nothing to control his risk\n\nfactors, and anticoagulants would not have been beneficial in\n\npreventing Sánchez's stroke (but might have made it worse).       Id.\n\nAs to Román, the district court praised his credentials, but,\n\nreferring to his prior experience with him in other cases, deemed\n\nhis testimony unacceptable \"Monday-morning quarterbacking\" that\n\nignored this case's factual realities.    Id. at 11-12.\n\n                               II.\n\n           A district court's findings after a bench trial \"shall\n\nnot be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be\n\ngiven to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).     A finding is\n\nonly clearly erroneous if a review of the entire record leads to a\n\ndefinite and firm conviction that an error has been made.         See\n\nPrimus v. United States, 389 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2004).     \"When\n\nthe proof supports plausible but competing inferences, the trier's\n\nchoice cannot be clearly erroneous.\"     Cape Fear, Inc. v. Martin,\n\n312 F.3d 496, 500 (1st Cir. 2002)(internal citation and quotation\n\nomitted). \"That the evidence also might support a contrary finding\n\nis often the inevitable reality when cases present difficult\n\nfactual questions; it is not, however, a basis for reversal.\"     Id.\n\nat 502. Further, a district court's credibility determinations are\n\nonly clearly erroneous when they are \"based on testimony that was\n\n\n                               -9-\n\finherently implausible, internally inconsistent, or critically\n\nimpeached.\"    Mitchell v. United States,         141 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n            In an action under the FTCA, the state law where the\n\nalleged     tort   occurred    provides     the   standard     of   liability.\n\nMitchell,    141   F.3d   at   13.   To     establish   a    case   of   medical\n\nmalpractice under Puerto Rico law, a plaintiff must prove \"(1) the\n\nduty owed (i.e., the minimum standard of professional knowledge and\n\nskill required in the relevant circumstances), (2) an act or\n\nomission transgressing that duty, and (3) a sufficient causal nexus\n\nbetween the breach and the claimed harm.\"               Cortes-Irizarry v.\n\nCorporacion Insular De Seguros, 111 F.3d 184, 189 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nPuerto Rico law presumes that a treating physician observes a\n\nreasonable standard of care in treating a patient, so a plaintiff\n\nhas the burden of refuting this presumption.                Rolon-Alvarado v.\n\nMunicipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74,78 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            Although Sánchez asserts a host of overlapping errors by\n\nthe district court, his claims boil down to two significant issues:\n\n(1) whether the court erred in concluding that              Sánchez knew about\n\nthe MRI report in 1994; and (2) whether the court erred in\n\nconcluding that the failure to discuss the MRI with Sánchez and to\n\nprescribe anticoagulant therapy was not the cause of the stroke.\n\n            We note at the outset that Sánchez is climbing a steep\n\nhill.    We must view the record as a whole, so that even if there is\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fsome evidence supporting Sánchez's contentions, we will still\n\naffirm if there is evidence supporting the contrary view. See Cape\n\nFear, Inc., 312 F.3d at 500.\n\n            We first consider Sánchez's challenge to the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Sánchez was aware of his MRI results in\n\n1994. Noriega testified that the standard VA hospital practice was\n\nto discuss test results with patients,7 Sánchez had access to his\n\nmedical records, and Noriega would not have ordered treatment for\n\nSánchez's apnea without discussing all test results with him.\n\nWhile Sánchez argues the truism that testimony regarding \"standard\n\npractice\" must yield to actual events in a specific case, standard\n\npractice evidence is nonetheless relevant and properly considered.\n\nSee generally Fed. R. Evid. 406.            The contrary evidence was the\n\nabsence of notations in the medical record, which Román conceded\n\ncould occur by mistake, and Sánchez's testimony that the MRI was\n\nnot discussed      with   him,   which   the   district   court   deemed   not\n\ncredible.     We    cannot   fault   the    district   court   for   doubting\n\nSánchez's account.        First, Sánchez's claimed indifference to his\n\ntest results is at best surprising.            Alvarez testified that most\n\nphysician \"patients\" are very demanding about test results and tend\n\nto read the MRI with the radiologist as soon as it is produced.\n\nSecond, Sánchez produced no evidence regarding the claimed hospital\n\n\n\n     7\n      Sánchez, Román, and Alvarez all confirmed this VA hospital\npractice in the course of their own testimony.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fpolicy that a VA physician cannot review his own medical records.\n\nThird, Sánchez's claim as to this policy was undercut by evidence\n\nthat he regularly returned his medical file to the records room and\n\ncould obtain copies of his records as he wished.        Finally, there is\n\nnothing innately suspicious about Noriega's inability to remember\n\na specific discussion about a specific MRI a decade after the fact.\n\nIn sum, the district court's conclusion is not clearly erroneous.8\n\n            The district court's conclusions regarding causation of\n\nthe stroke and possible preventive treatment implicate the experts'\n\ndiffering views.       As set forth above, Alvarez and Román disagreed\n\non the relative importance of Sánchez's diabetes and hypertension.\n\nThey also disagreed on the significance of the white matter changes\n\nin   the   MRI   and   the   appropriateness   and   likely   efficacy   of\n\nanticoagulant therapy.9\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      At oral argument, Sánchez asserted that the record was\nunclear as to the district court's ultimate finding regarding when\nSánchez saw his MRI. Sánchez maintains that the court's conclusion\nin the memorandum order after the trial that he knew of his MRI\nresults in 1994 is in hopeless conflict with the district court's\nprior conclusion that he did not see the MRI until 1999 in its\norder denying the government's motion to dismiss. But the court's\ninitial assessment of the pleadings must of course give way to its\nfactual findings after a full trial on the merits.\n      9\n      Sánchez's contention that the district court inappropriately\nminimized the relationship between Sánchez's sleep apnea and the\nstroke is a nonstarter. Both sides agree that he was successfully\ntreated for apnea in 1994. Further, if apnea was a factor in the\nstroke, the blame would appear to fall on Sánchez, as he conceded\nthat he failed to follow the prescribed therapy prior to his\nstroke.\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            Sánchez claims that he was not hypertensive (or only\n\nmarginally so), and that his diabetes was of too recent an onset to\n\nhave factored in his stroke.       This thesis is based upon the few\n\nblood pressure readings for the relevant period in the record10 and\n\nthe 1991 diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.         But Sánchez's argument\n\nignores the balance of the evidence.         First, as to hypertension,\n\nAlvarez testified, without significant challenge, that Sánchez had\n\nleft ventricular hypertrophy, a condition that can only exist with\n\nlongstanding hypertension.      The fact that Sánchez might not have\n\nbeen definitively diagnosed with hypertension does not mean that he\n\ndid not have it.    Second, Sánchez himself conceded that, in 1994,\n\nhe was aware that he had untreated hypertension.                Third, his\n\nargument that his blood pressure was merely \"borderline\" (by 1994\n\nstandards) ignores the fact that both experts agreed that such\n\nblood pressures were subsequently determined to be dangerously high\n\nfor diabetics.\n\n            As to diabetes, Sánchez ignores Alvarez's testimony that\n\nSánchez's   diabetes    retinopathy   was   indicative   of    longstanding\n\ndiabetes.   While Sánchez attempted to undermine this conclusion by\n\npointing to test results showing normal kidney functions, Alvarez\n\ntestified, without significant contradiction, that some diabetics\n\nhave such    results.     The   district    court's   choice   between   two\n\n\n\n     10\n      The doctors all agreed that one could not positively diagnose\nhypertension from three scattered blood pressure readings.\n\n                                   -13-\n\finterpretations of the significance of Sánchez's diabetes, both\n\nwith record support, cannot be clear error.       See Cape Fear, 312\n\nF.3d at 500.   Similarly, the district court's decision to credit\n\nAlvarez's testimony over Román's regarding the significance of the\n\nwhite matter changes in MRI, even if both experts' accounts had\n\nsupport in the record, would not constitute clear error.11\n\n           As to the advisability of using anticoagulant therapy on\n\nSánchez, the balance of the evidence favors Alvarez's view. First,\n\nNoriega supported Alvarez's conclusion that anticoagulants would\n\nnot have prevented a stroke of the type Sánchez suffered and would\n\nhave increased the risk of a hemorrhage.      Second, Alvarez pointed\n\nto an electrocardiogram at the time of the stroke, which supported\n\nhis view that a clot was not involved.       Third, Sánchez and Román\n\nconceded   that   Sánchez   continued   to    have   CVAs   while   on\n\nanticoagulants.    Finally, Román acknowledged that most of the\n\nanticoagulant studies that he cited related to secondary rather\n\nthan primary prevention.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      The district court did list hypercholesterolemia and\nhypertriglyceridemia among the conditions that Román failed to\nconsider in rejecting Román's conclusions. Sánchez is correct that\nAlvarez retreated from the conclusion in his initial report that\nthese maladies were additional contributors to the stroke and\nacknowledged that most of the test results were normal. Thus, the\ndistrict court may have errantly included these secondary factors\nbased upon Alvarez's initial report. Nonetheless, Alvarez's thesis\nwas always that hypertension and diabetes were the primary causes,\nand the district court supportably accepted this thesis, as\ndiscussed above.\n\n                               -14-\n\f            Moreover, there were other more general factors that\n\njustified the decision to accord Román's conclusions less weight.\n\nRomán conceded that hypertension and diabetes were significant\n\nfactors in strokes, but did not even mention these matters in his\n\nreport. His testimony also failed to take into account significant\n\nmedical evidence, such as Sánchez's left ventricular hypertrophy\n\nand diabetic retinopathy, which should at least have warranted a\n\ncomment.    Román also conceded that he had no personal experience\n\nmanaging patients with sleep apnea or CVAs.        In sum, the district\n\ncourt accepted Alvarez's assessment on both causation and course of\n\ntreatment, and our review reveals nothing about his testimony that\n\nwas implausible, inconsistent, or critically impeached.12                See\n\ngenerally Mitchell, 141 F.3d at 17.\n\n            Sánchez faults the district court for concluding that he\n\nwas a careless person who took inadequate care of himself.             But to\n\nprevail, Sánchez needed to prove that the VA physicians were\n\nnegligent   and   that   their   negligence   caused   his   injury.     The\n\n\n     12\n        In addressing the district court's decision to credit\nAlvarez's testimony over Román's, Sánchez suggests that the\ndistrict court showed an improper bias against Román by commenting\non other cases in which Román testified as an expert. We disagree.\nPrior judicial exposure to an individual is not by itself enough to\nestablish bias, see United States v. Ayala, 289 F.3d 16, 27 (1st\nCir. 2002), and the weight accorded to the testimony of a physician\nregarding an area outside his speciality can be adjusted\naccordingly, see Mitchell, 141 F.3d at 15.      The district judge\ngenerally praised Román's credentials, and his criticism was far\nless derogatory than other comments found not to amount to bias.\nSee, e.g., Malave-Felix v. Volvo Car Corp., 946 F.2d 967, 973 (1st\nCir. 1991)(\"come-for-hire expert\" and \"Mr. So and So\").\n\n                                   -15-\n\fdistrict court supportably concluded that Sánchez did not meet this\n\nburden, so any comments made by the court as to the true cause of\n\nSánchez's unfortunate illness are largely beside the point.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          For   the   reasons   stated   above,   the   judgment   of   the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f",

After a bench trial, the district court\n\nentered judgment for the United States on Dr. Juan R. Sánchez\n\nInfante's claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2671 et seq., that certain Veteran's Administration (\"VA\")\n\nphysicians negligently failed to review his MRI, to discuss the MRI\n\nresults with him, and to prescribe an anticoagulant therapy that\n\nwould have averted his 1994 stroke. Sánchez appeals and we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          We present a brief overview of the case, saving a more\n\ndetailed recitation for our analysis.           The following facts are\n\nundisputed.\n\n          Sánchez    began   work        at   the   San   Juan   Veterans\n\nAdministration Medical Center as a pathologist in 1991. During his\n\nrequired physical examination, he was diagnosed with diabetes\n\nmellitus type II, and placed on Glucotrol to control his elevated\n\nblood sugar.   Sánchez was 5'2\" tall and weighed between 190 and 210\n\npounds during the relevant time period.         He did not exercise, had\n\na poor diet and a family history of cardiac problems, and drank\n\nsocially nearly every day.   Sánchez also worked long hours at the\n\nhospital and characterized his duties as stressful.          His medical\n\nrecords from 1991 to 1994 show three blood pressure readings (one\n\nnormal and two borderline hypertensive by 1994 standards) and\n\nconsistent difficulties in controlling his blood sugar.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          In early 1994, one of Sánchez's colleagues, Dr. Angel\n\nNoriega, noticed that Sánchez was falling asleep during the day,\n\nand, fearing that Sánchez was suffering from sleep apnea,1 arranged\n\nfor an evaluation.   Part of the evaluation consisted of a March 7,\n\n1994 polysomnography,2 which revealed a significant number of apnea\n\nepisodes during the test period.      Noriega also sent Sánchez for a\n\nmagnetic resonance imagining (\"MRI\") study, to check for brain\n\nlesions indicative of a particularly serious form of sleep apnea.\n\nOn March 22, 1994, Sánchez had the MRI, which showed no brain\n\nlesions and was essentially normal.         However, the MRI report\n\nincluded the notation: \"Multiple hyperintense focci are seen within\n\nthe periventricular white matter suggestive of deep white matter\n\nischemic3 changes.   Please, correlate clinically.\"      The medical\n\nrecords do not indicate whether Sánchez's physicians ever acted\n\nupon the MRI or discussed it with him.      Nonetheless, Sánchez was\n\nsuccessfully treated for his sleep apnea condition.\n\n          On August 31, 1994, Sánchez suffered a cerebrovascular\n\naccident (\"CVA\"), a \"stroke\" in common parlance.      The stroke left\n\n\n\n     1\n      A serious condition in which an individual stops breathing\nwhile asleep. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 115-6\n(30th ed. 2003).\n     2\n      A diagnostic test for sleep disorders that monitors the\npatient's relevant physiological functions while he is asleep.

The stroke has\n\nalso caused emotional disturbances and depression. Sánchez was\n\nplaced on anticoagulant therapy immediately after the stroke. In\n\nthe following years, Sánchez suffered from a host of other health\n\nproblems, including two subsequent CVAs, and has been regularly\n\ntreated by VA physicians. Sánchez claims that, upon requesting his\n\nmedical records for a 1999 procedure, he learned of the 1994 MRI\n\nreport for the first time.\n\n           Sánchez filed his administrative claim in December 2000,\n\nand, after it was denied, he filed this action in the district\n\ncourt on April 17, 2002.    As noted, he alleged that the treating VA\n\nphysicians failed to review the MRI, to discuss the MRI with him,\n\nand to provide proper treatment to avert the stroke that he would\n\nsuffer five months later.          The government moved to dismiss on\n\ngrounds of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that Sánchez failed to\n\nfile his administrative claim within two years of his 1994 stroke.\n\nThe court denied the motion because, on the pleading record, there\n\nwas no indication that Sánchez was aware of the alleged malpractice\n\nuntil he saw the MRI report in October 1999.

The gist of Sánchez's claim\n\nwas that if he had been placed upon anticoagulants after the 1994\n\nMRI, he would not have suffered his stroke.\n\n          Dr. Román, a pathologist for the University of Puerto\n\nRico Medical School, testified that there would have been a good\n\nchance of avoiding the stroke if Sánchez had been placed on\n\nanticoagulants (such as aspirin) at the time of the MRI.     Román\n\nemphasized Sánchez's apnea, which significantly increased his heart\n\nrate and blood pressure, and resulted in oxygen deprivation to his\n\nbrain that caused \"cell death\" (as revealed by the ischemic changes\n\nin the brain shown in the MRI).      Román asserted that the white\n\nmatter changes shown in the MRI were indicative of \"mini strokes\"\n\nthat had already occurred and were harbingers of a larger stroke to\n\ncome if not prevented with anticoagulant therapy.    Román further\n\ntestified that Sánchez's other risk factors beyond apnea were\n\nessentially inconsequential, as his diabetes mellitus had only been\n\npresent for a short time (as evidenced by his normal kidney\n\nfunctions), his high blood pressure was only marginal and of recent\n\nonset, and he had normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f          Sánchez    testified at length about his experiences,\n\nmedical treatment, level of disability, and rehabilitation.     He\n\nstated that he never inquired about the results of the MRI because\n\nhe had complete confidence in his colleagues.   He also stated that\n\nhe could not have reviewed his own medical records, as that was\n\nstrictly forbidden by the hospital.\n\n          Dr. Noriega,4 a board certified neurologist, testified\n\nthat, while he could not specifically recall speaking with Sánchez\n\nabout the MRI, it was standard hospital practice to discuss test\n\nresults with patients, and no less so if they were also colleagues.\n\nHe further testified that he would never have begun Sánchez's sleep\n\napnea treatment without reviewing all test results and discussing\n\nthem with Sánchez.    He also stated that all VA physicians have\n\naccess to all medical records, including their own, and that, on\n\none occasion, Sánchez brought his own medical records to Noriega.\n\nHe also testified that the phrase \"correlate clinically\" on the MRI\n\nreport meant to relate the radiological findings to any actual\n\nphysical manifestations in the patient. He stated that Sánchez had\n\nno symptoms –- no evidence of \"little strokes\" -- so there was\n\nnothing to treat.    He further testified that nothing could have\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Noriega had retired from his duties at the VA Hospital some\nyears before, and neither side had arranged for his testimony.\nMid-trial, the district judge decided that his testimony was\ncritical and ordered the parties to bring him in as a witness.\n\n                               -6-\n\fbeen done to prevent this type of stroke, and that he would not\n\nhave prescribed aspirin out of a fear of hemorrhage.\n\n            Dr. Alvarez, a board certified neurologist, testified\n\nthat Sánchez's stroke was occasioned by small vessel disease that\n\nwas primarily caused by Sánchez's hypertension and diabetes.5           He\n\nnoted that the negative effects of diabetes and hypertension were\n\nadditive, with hypertension being the primary culprit for such\n\nstrokes in 70% of the cases.     He further testified that Sánchez's\n\nhypertension   and   diabetes   were   longstanding,   as   evidenced   by\n\nSánchez's left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic retinopathy.\n\n            Alvarez testified that the white matter lesions on the\n\nMRI were only just beginning to be noted in 1994, and that their\n\nmeaning is still the subject of debate today.      He was adamant that\n\nthe white matter changes were not \"strokes,\" and that there was no\n\nreal treatment available, in 1994 or at present, other than to\n\ncontrol the major risk factors – hypertension, diabetes, and\n\nobesity.    As to risk factor management, Alvarez noted that Sánchez\n\nappeared to take poor care of himself, noting his failure to\n\ncontrol his blood sugar, to follow a diet, and to monitor his blood\n\npressure.    As to anticoagulant therapy, Alvarez emphasized that\n\nthere was no evidence that aspirin or other anticoagulants were\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      He also noted Sánchez's other risk factors –- obesity, poor\ndiet, lack of exercise, family history of heart problems, and\nalcohol use.\n\n                                  -7-\n\feffective in the primary prevention6 of strokes.                     Indeed, he\n\nasserted that the primary efficacy of such anticoagulants was in\n\nsecondary prevention of strokes.          Further, he noted that aspirin\n\nincreased the risk of hemorrhagic strokes, which were typically\n\nworse    than    ischemic    strokes.      Moreover,       he    stated    that\n\nanticoagulants would not have helped Sánchez because his stroke was\n\nnot caused by a clot.     In support of this opinion, he observed that\n\nan echocardiogram from the time of the stroke showed no embolic\n\nsource from the heart and normal blood flow in Sánchez's large\n\narteries.       Alvarez   also   noted   that    Sánchez    showed    continued\n\nevidence of CVAs even while he was on anticoagulants after his\n\nfirst stroke.\n\n            The district court issued a memorandum order dismissing\n\nthe action as a \"no-liability\" case. See Sanchez v. United States,\n\nNo. 02-1590 (D.P.R. Apr. 12, 2004).         Relying largely on Noriega's\n\ntestimony, the court concluded that Sánchez was made aware of the\n\nMRI results at the time of his treatment for sleep apnea and had\n\naccess to his own medical records.              Id. at 6.       The court also\n\ncredited the testimony of Alvarez, accepting his conclusions that\n\nthe white matter lesions on the MRI were secondary to small vessel\n\ndisease brought about by Sánchez's hypertension and diabetes.               Id.\n\n\n\n     6\n      The experts distinguished between primary prevention, which\nthey defined as efforts to prevent the initial stroke, and\nsecondary prevention, which they defined as efforts to prevent\nadditional strokes.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fat 6-11.   The court found that the VA physicians did not violate\n\nany standard of care, Sánchez did nothing to control his risk\n\nfactors, and anticoagulants would not have been beneficial in\n\npreventing Sánchez's stroke (but might have made it worse).       Id.\n\nAs to Román, the district court praised his credentials, but,\n\nreferring to his prior experience with him in other cases, deemed\n\nhis testimony unacceptable \"Monday-morning quarterbacking\" that\n\nignored this case's factual realities.

We must view the record as a whole, so that even if there is\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fsome evidence supporting Sánchez's contentions, we will still\n\naffirm if there is evidence supporting the contrary view. See Cape\n\nFear, Inc., 312 F.3d at 500.\n\n            We first consider Sánchez's challenge to the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Sánchez was aware of his MRI results in\n\n1994. Noriega testified that the standard VA hospital practice was\n\nto discuss test results with patients,7 Sánchez had access to his\n\nmedical records, and Noriega would not have ordered treatment for\n\nSánchez's apnea without discussing all test results with him.\n\nWhile Sánchez argues the truism that testimony regarding \"standard\n\npractice\" must yield to actual events in a specific case, standard\n\npractice evidence is nonetheless relevant and properly considered.\n\nSee generally Fed. R. Evid. 406.            The contrary evidence was the\n\nabsence of notations in the medical record, which Román conceded\n\ncould occur by mistake, and Sánchez's testimony that the MRI was\n\nnot discussed      with   him,   which   the   district   court   deemed   not\n\ncredible.     We    cannot   fault   the    district   court   for   doubting\n\nSánchez's account.        First, Sánchez's claimed indifference to his\n\ntest results is at best surprising.            Alvarez testified that most\n\nphysician \"patients\" are very demanding about test results and tend\n\nto read the MRI with the radiologist as soon as it is produced.\n\nSecond, Sánchez produced no evidence regarding the claimed hospital\n\n\n\n     7\n      Sánchez, Román, and Alvarez all confirmed this VA hospital\npractice in the course of their own testimony.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fpolicy that a VA physician cannot review his own medical records.\n\nThird, Sánchez's claim as to this policy was undercut by evidence\n\nthat he regularly returned his medical file to the records room and\n\ncould obtain copies of his records as he wished.        Finally, there is\n\nnothing innately suspicious about Noriega's inability to remember\n\na specific discussion about a specific MRI a decade after the fact.\n\nIn sum, the district court's conclusion is not clearly erroneous.8\n\n            The district court's conclusions regarding causation of\n\nthe stroke and possible preventive treatment implicate the experts'\n\ndiffering views.       As set forth above, Alvarez and Román disagreed\n\non the relative importance of Sánchez's diabetes and hypertension.\n\nThey also disagreed on the significance of the white matter changes\n\nin   the   MRI   and   the   appropriateness   and   likely   efficacy   of\n\nanticoagulant therapy.9\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      At oral argument, Sánchez asserted that the record was\nunclear as to the district court's ultimate finding regarding when\nSánchez saw his MRI. Sánchez maintains that the court's conclusion\nin the memorandum order after the trial that he knew of his MRI\nresults in 1994 is in hopeless conflict with the district court's\nprior conclusion that he did not see the MRI until 1999 in its\norder denying the government's motion to dismiss. But the court's\ninitial assessment of the pleadings must of course give way to its\nfactual findings after a full trial on the merits.\n      9\n      Sánchez's contention that the district court inappropriately\nminimized the relationship between Sánchez's sleep apnea and the\nstroke is a nonstarter. Both sides agree that he was successfully\ntreated for apnea in 1994. Further, if apnea was a factor in the\nstroke, the blame would appear to fall on Sánchez, as he conceded\nthat he failed to follow the prescribed therapy prior to his\nstroke.\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            Sánchez claims that he was not hypertensive (or only\n\nmarginally so), and that his diabetes was of too recent an onset to\n\nhave factored in his stroke.       This thesis is based upon the few\n\nblood pressure readings for the relevant period in the record10 and\n\nthe 1991 diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.         But Sánchez's argument\n\nignores the balance of the evidence.         First, as to hypertension,\n\nAlvarez testified, without significant challenge, that Sánchez had\n\nleft ventricular hypertrophy, a condition that can only exist with\n\nlongstanding hypertension.      The fact that Sánchez might not have\n\nbeen definitively diagnosed with hypertension does not mean that he\n\ndid not have it.    Second, Sánchez himself conceded that, in 1994,\n\nhe was aware that he had untreated hypertension.                Third, his\n\nargument that his blood pressure was merely \"borderline\" (by 1994\n\nstandards) ignores the fact that both experts agreed that such\n\nblood pressures were subsequently determined to be dangerously high\n\nfor diabetics.\n\n            As to diabetes, Sánchez ignores Alvarez's testimony that\n\nSánchez's   diabetes    retinopathy   was   indicative   of    longstanding\n\ndiabetes.   While Sánchez attempted to undermine this conclusion by\n\npointing to test results showing normal kidney functions, Alvarez\n\ntestified, without significant contradiction, that some diabetics\n\nhave such    results.     The   district    court's   choice   between   two\n\n\n\n     10\n      The doctors all agreed that one could not positively diagnose\nhypertension from three scattered blood pressure readings.\n\n                                   -13-\n\finterpretations of the significance of Sánchez's diabetes, both\n\nwith record support, cannot be clear error.       See Cape Fear, 312\n\nF.3d at 500.   Similarly, the district court's decision to credit\n\nAlvarez's testimony over Román's regarding the significance of the\n\nwhite matter changes in MRI, even if both experts' accounts had\n\nsupport in the record, would not constitute clear error.11\n\n           As to the advisability of using anticoagulant therapy on\n\nSánchez, the balance of the evidence favors Alvarez's view. First,\n\nNoriega supported Alvarez's conclusion that anticoagulants would\n\nnot have prevented a stroke of the type Sánchez suffered and would\n\nhave increased the risk of a hemorrhage.      Second, Alvarez pointed\n\nto an electrocardiogram at the time of the stroke, which supported\n\nhis view that a clot was not involved.       Third, Sánchez and Román\n\nconceded   that   Sánchez   continued   to    have   CVAs   while   on\n\nanticoagulants.    Finally, Román acknowledged that most of the\n\nanticoagulant studies that he cited related to secondary rather\n\nthan primary prevention.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      The district court did list hypercholesterolemia and\nhypertriglyceridemia among the conditions that Román failed to\nconsider in rejecting Román's conclusions. Sánchez is correct that\nAlvarez retreated from the conclusion in his initial report that\nthese maladies were additional contributors to the stroke and\nacknowledged that most of the test results were normal. Thus, the\ndistrict court may have errantly included these secondary factors\nbased upon Alvarez's initial report. Nonetheless, Alvarez's thesis\nwas always that hypertension and diabetes were the primary causes,\nand the district court supportably accepted this thesis, as\ndiscussed above.\n\n                               -14-\n\f            Moreover, there were other more general factors that\n\njustified the decision to accord Román's conclusions less weight.\n\nRomán conceded that hypertension and diabetes were significant\n\nfactors in strokes, but did not even mention these matters in his\n\nreport. His testimony also failed to take into account significant\n\nmedical evidence, such as Sánchez's left ventricular hypertrophy\n\nand diabetic retinopathy, which should at least have warranted a\n\ncomment.    Román also conceded that he had no personal experience\n\nmanaging patients with sleep apnea or CVAs.        In sum, the district\n\ncourt accepted Alvarez's assessment on both causation and course of\n\ntreatment, and our review reveals nothing about his testimony that\n\nwas implausible, inconsistent, or critically impeached.12                See\n\ngenerally Mitchell, 141 F.3d at 17.\n\n            Sánchez faults the district court for concluding that he\n\nwas a careless person who took inadequate care of himself.             But to\n\nprevail, Sánchez needed to prove that the VA physicians were\n\nnegligent   and   that   their   negligence   caused   his   injury.     The\n\n\n     12\n        In addressing the district court's decision to credit\nAlvarez's testimony over Román's, Sánchez suggests that the\ndistrict court showed an improper bias against Román by commenting\non other cases in which Román testified as an expert. We disagree.\nPrior judicial exposure to an individual is not by itself enough to\nestablish bias, see United States v. Ayala, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199930\"><a href=\"/opinion/199930/united-states-v-ayala-ayala/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st\nCir. 2002), and the weight accorded to the testimony of a physician\nregarding an area outside his speciality can be adjusted\naccordingly, see Mitchell, 141 F.3d at 15.      The district judge\ngenerally praised Román's credentials, and his criticism was far\nless derogatory than other comments found not to amount to bias.\nSee, e.g., Malave-Felix v.
