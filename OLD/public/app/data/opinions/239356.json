PEZZNOLA, Plaintiff, Appellant,<br>v.<br>UNITED STATES of America, Appellee (two cases).</p>\n    <p class=\"docket\">Nos. 5060, 5061.</p>\n    <p class=\"court\">United States Court of Appeals First Circuit.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">May 7, 1956.<br>Rehearing Denied May 31, 1956.</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reuben Goodman, Boston, Mass.  (Paul T. Smith, Manuel Katz and Joseph T. Doyle, Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William J. Koen, Asst. U.S. Atty., Boston, Mass.  (Anthony Julian, U.S. Atty., and George H. Lewald, Asst. U.S. Atty., Boston, Mass., on the brief), for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before MAGRUDER, Chief Judge, and WOODBURY and HARTIGAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WOODBURY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant was sole proprietor of the enterprise known as Guy's Garage prior to its incorporation as Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc.  His first name appears in the corporate title, he was an organizer of the corporation, he was a stockholder, and he was treasurer from its creation through the years here involved.  He had access to the corporate records, and he with only Duggan, the president, now deceased, and Mrs. Simansky, the bookkeeper, had access to the cash drawer and the right to take cash therefrom.  He signed the incorrect tax returns for the years in question, and in each of those years the net income actually earned by the corporation was over three times the amount of net income reported.  He also made some of the sales which were later understated on the corporate books.  Perhaps none of these things standing alone would sustain a conviction.  Together, however, they seem to me clearly to warrant the conclusion that Pezznola was not a mere mechanic employed by the corporation, or as its treasurer was a mere figurehead, but instead was an active, participating, corporate officer of managerial rank who signed the returns knowing full well that they were false and fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the above matters provide an illuminating background against which to view Mrs. Simansky's testimony.  From the record it is very evident that Mrs. Simansky was not only a reluctant but also an evasive witness.  I cannot agree that on the written record her testimony is not susceptible of the interpretation that, although she could not remember in any given transaction whether Duggan or Pezznola directed her to make a false entry, each one of them did so on various occasions.  Her reluctance to be specific does not affect this view, for this is not a case of a single isolated incident of falsification which might be lost in the haze of memory.  There were nearly eighty falsified transactions on the corporation's books.  Her very choice of the alternative method of expression indicates to me that both Pezznola and Duggan were involved.  I can hardly believe that she would have even mentioned Pezznola's name, either in the alternative or otherwise, if he had never given her any direction to falsify the corporation's books.  Furthermore, even if her involved words when printed are susceptible of differing interpretations, their meaning when uttered, because of their complexity born of her obvious reluctance and evasiveness, depended in unusual degree upon intonation and demeanor observable to the trial judge and jury but not to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this situation I conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant wilfully and knowingly attempted to defeat and evade taxes due from Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgments of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MAGRUDER, Chief Judge, concurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HARTIGAN, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are appeals by the defendant, Guy R. Pezznola, from judgments entered on June 20, 1955, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts which sentenced the defendant in No. 54-195-F to imprisonment for a period of three months and to pay a fine of $2,500, the prison sentence to run concurrently with an identical term imposed upon the defendant in No. 54-236-F.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two indictments No. 54-195-F and No. 54-236-F charge in substance that the defendant, treasurer of Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc., did wilfully and knowingly attempt to defeat and evade a large part of the taxes due and owing by the corporation to the United States of America for the fiscal years ending on April 30, 1948, and April 30, 1949, respectively, in violation of Section 145(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.  26 U.S.C. 145.  A third indictment, No. 54-237-F, subsequently withdrawn by the trial judge from the consideration of the jury, charged the defendant with the evasion of his personal income tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence tended to establish the following facts.  The defendant, Guy R. Pezznola, was treasurer and part owner of Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the sale of new and used automobiles.  He transacted some sales in behalf of the corporation, but his chief duties were to serve as body-repairman and mechanic.  Thomas G. Duggan, president and likewise part owner of the corporation, was in charge of the office.  He did no mechanical work of any kind.  Although the defendant had access to the office records, there was no recollection on the part of Mrs. Ethel Simansky, bookkeeper for the corporation during the years involved, that the defendant had ever actually examined the books.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax returns in question were prepared by a firm of accountants.  There is no evidence that these returns do not accurately reflect the corporate books and accordingly it follows that any alleged deficiency must be explicable, if at all, in terms of the understatement of business transactions on the records of the corporation itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the Government's evidence the defendant moved for judgments of acquittal, which motions were denied as to No. 54-195-F and No. 54-236-F.  The defendant thereupon rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant contends that the court below erred in denying these motions, because there was not sufficient evidence of wilful and knowing understatement of taxable income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to a consideration of what evidence there may be in these cases tending to prove that the defendant had knowledge that the corporate books did not properly reflect the business transactions consummated by the corporation throughout the fiscal years ending on April 30, 1948, and April 30, 1949.  It is entirely clear that the jury would be completely justified in finding that many of the bookkeeping entries represent substantial and systematic understatements.  In this connection the Government relies heavily on the testimony of the bookkeeper, Mrs. Simansky.  The Government contends here-- and so represented to the jury below-- that Mrs. Simansky's testimony was that both the defendant and Duggan had upon occasion instructed her to understate various transactions upon the books.  If this contention was well founded, it would, of course, effectively dispose of defendant's claim that there was no evidence in these cases from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the spurious character of the corporate records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that Mrs. Simansky was a reluctant witness.  She testified in part:'Q. And would the entire amount of the receipts from the sale go into that portion of the book, or into the purchase book, or where would it go, the receipts to the company?  A.  The sale of the car would go into car sales or used car sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. Now, my question is when it was entered as a car sale, whether it be new or used, would the entire amount received as a result of that sale be entered in any portion of your books of account?  A.

Then let me ask you this: if the invoice was for 1750 and you recorded 1350 on sales, where did the other $400 go to?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>*      *      *      *      *      *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Court: Was it the way you did it?

Did you testify that you could not remember as to whether either one of them have given you a specific instruction, isn't that correct?  A.  I said either one of them, either Mr. Duggan or Mr. Pezznola.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'X-Q.  But you couldn't remember whether it was?  A.  I couldn't say either one of them.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a careful review of Mrs. Simansky's testimony I have come to the conclusion that it is not capable of an interpretation which would support the Government in its contention.  I believe that Mrs. Simansky's testimony went no farther in substance than this: 'The initiative for these understatements must of necessity have come from Pezznola, Duggan, or myself and it did not come from me.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nowhere in her testimony did Mrs. Simansky make the affirmative assertion that sometimes Pezznola instructed her in these matters and sometimes Duggan.  What she did say was that she had no memory as to particular transactions and the Government seizes upon these statements seeking to enlarge them by drawing the inference that she had a more general memory implicating the defendant which was limited only inasmuch as it could not be related to specific transactions.  I believe that it is not possible to draw any such inference from her testimony.  First of all, on one occasion, she specifically declined to testify that she had any such general memory implicating the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. Did it go to Mr. Pezznola on some occasions?  A.  I couldn't remember.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. Did it go to Mr. Duggan on some occasions?  A.  I couldn't remember.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the only defect in Mrs. Simansky's memory of these matters related to a mere inability to connect known guilt to specific transactions, she could have indicated as much by an affirmative answer to these questions which in no way called for a memory of individual transactions.  This she refused to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still further, I think it is clear from the record that Mrs. Simansky went no farther in the direction of incriminating either the defendant or Duggan than she was forced to go by the undeniable facts and the necessity of exculpating herself from liability for the understatements.  After testifying that the entries were properly recorded she was forced by questions directed towards specific entries in the books to acknowledge that they were not properly recorded; but she could not account for the reasons for these discrepancies.  She was then forced to admit that only three persons could be responsible, Pezznola, Duggan and herself.  Accordingly, she testified it must have been either Pezznola or Duggan because she would not make such entries on her own initiative.  This was the limit to which the ammunition in the Government's arsenal could force her to go.  In view of the obvious reluctance of the witness, her express refusal to testify at one time that she had a memory which would implicate the defendant 'on some occasions,' it seems to me clearly impossible to infer that she went one step farther than the Government could push her and gratuitously added the additional elements of evidence which the Government purports to find in her testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial there was some confusion as to the import of her testimony, but the trial judge seems to have agreed that she had no memory which would implicate either Duggan or the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Mr. Koen: Mr. Smith says that there is only one piece of testimony and that was with reference to the $200 from Gallagher or Geller.  My memory is that there is another piece of evidence from Steinberg which shows money going into Pezznola in addition.

I'm not going to be bothered about that.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this was the true import of her testimony then I believe the trial judge was incorrect in his view that this was a proper matter for jury interpretation.  If Mrs. Simansky, as I believe, said no more than this-- 'It had to be Pezznola, Duggan or I and it wasn't I,' then her testimony afforded no evidentiary basis upon which the jury could properly make a determination as to the guilt of the defendant.  If left to the jury, such a question could be resolved only by flipping a coin or some other fortuitous device.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of other evidence tending to prove that the defendant had knowledge of the fraudulent character of the corporate books, I believe this case should not have been submitted to the jury.  I have analyzed the record, and with only two exceptions-- the Geller and Steinberg transactions-- the Government's evidence either shows no connection with the defendant or at best merely that the defendant made certain sales correctly stated on the invoice which were subsequently understated or omitted on the books by some unknown person, either Duggan or himself.  Such evidence is clearly inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon analysis the Geller transaction shows nothing to indicate that the invoice was understated, but merely that Geller paid $200 more than he thought the car was worth.  Apparently this transaction was subsequently understated on the books, but as in all of these transactions there is nothing to show that the defendant was instrumental in making such understatements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Steinberg testified that he paid $2325 to the defendant and received a bill of sale 'if I were to trust my memory, I would say somewhere in the vicinity of $2000.'

Under these circumstances I believe the trial judge should have directed judgments of acquittal.  In Kassin v. United States, 5 Cir., 1937, 87 F.2d 183, at 184, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'* * * In each case, however, where the evidence is purely circumstantial, the links in the chain must be clearly proven, and taken together must point not to the possibility or probability, but to the moral certainty of guilt.  That is, the inferences which may reasonably be drawn from them as a whole must not only be consistent with guilt, but inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is entirely possible, though not probable, in the light of all the evidence, that Duggan was responsible for every understatement on the books and that the defendant was without knowledge of what was going on.  Duggan was dead at the time of the trial.  '* * * Since an essential link is missing, the United States has failed to establish its case * * *.  There is strong probability that (he) was guilty but the guilt of a defendant must be proved, not merely vehemently suspected in order to sustain a conviction.'  United States v. Stefanowicz, 3 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 189, 191.  The evidence in this case is not inconsistent with the possibility that Duggan alone was guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All ambiguity with respect to the testimony of Mrs. Simansky could have been easily cleared up if the Government had seen fit to ask her one simple question: 'Without reference to specific transactions, do you have any memory that the defendant ever at any time instructed you to understate the books of the corporation?'  Possibly the Government was afraid to ask this question.  In any event it did not, but contented itself with an attempt to draw the inference favorable to its case without risking the disaster which would have resulted from a negative response to such a question.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the import of Mrs. Simansky's testimony could have been readily clarified in this manner and since the Government neglected to seek any such clarification, I believe that the Government failed to carry its burden of proof and that there was insufficient evidence to take this case to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps it should be noted here that at the termination of a seven day trial and after four hours of deliberation, the jury asked the court the following question: 'Who is under indictment, Pezznola or Guy's Super Service, Incorporated?'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing that the jury could ask at this late date in the trial could indicate better the jury's utter confusion.  The indictment against Pezznola relating to his personal income tax had already been withdrawn by the court from the jury's consideration.  Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc. was not under indictment-- perhaps it should have been.  I am convinced that the jury thought that the corporation should have been indicted and it disregarded the lack of evidence against the defendant in order to reach a compromise verdict based upon its belief that some one ought to pay for the corporation's misdeeds.  Pezznola as treasurer was the only target at which to aim since Duggan, the corporation's president, who also signed the tax returns, was dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons I would reverse the judgments of the district court and remand the cases to that court with direction to enter judgments of acquittal.  However, my colleagues are of a different opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WOODBURY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has petitioned for rehearing on the ground that his assertions of error in the trial court's charge to the jury must have been overlooked because they were not mentioned anywhere in this court's opinion.  This is not so.  Judge Hartigan did not have occasion to consider the charge in the view he took of the case and Chief Judge Magruder and I considered the assertions of error only to reject them.  One sentence of the charge considered out of context might perhaps be interpreted as an erroneous statement of an applicable principle of law.  But considering the sentence in its context, such an interpretation would be so far fetched that we did not think there was any practical probability of misinterpretation by the jury.  Furthermore, it does not appear that counsel took exception to the sentence at the conclusion of the charge.  Rule 30, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 18 U.S.C.A.  The charge as a whole impressed us as eminently fair and any possible technical error in it so minor as not to affect substantial rights of the accused.  We therefore treated the error, if in fact there was any error at all, as harmless, and disregarded it in accordance with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Error was also pressed on failure of the court to give a certain requested charge, which, while it contained an abstractly correct proposition of law, was so adequately covered in the general charge as to preclude the possibility of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

His first name appears in the corporate title, he was an organizer of the corporation, he was a stockholder, and he was treasurer from its creation through the years here involved.  He had access to the corporate records, and he with only Duggan, the president, now deceased, and Mrs. Simansky, the bookkeeper, had access to the cash drawer and the right to take cash therefrom.  He signed the incorrect tax returns for the years in question, and in each of those years the net income actually earned by the corporation was over three times the amount of net income reported.  He also made some of the sales which were later understated on the corporate books.  Perhaps none of these things standing alone would sustain a conviction.  Together, however, they seem to me clearly to warrant the conclusion that Pezznola was not a mere mechanic employed by the corporation, or as its treasurer was a mere figurehead, but instead was an active, participating, corporate officer of managerial rank who signed the returns knowing full well that they were false and fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the above matters provide an illuminating background against which to view Mrs. Simansky's testimony.  From the record it is very evident that Mrs. Simansky was not only a reluctant but also an evasive witness.  I cannot agree that on the written record her testimony is not susceptible of the interpretation that, although she could not remember in any given transaction whether Duggan or Pezznola directed her to make a false entry, each one of them did so on various occasions.  Her reluctance to be specific does not affect this view, for this is not a case of a single isolated incident of falsification which might be lost in the haze of memory.  There were nearly eighty falsified transactions on the corporation's books.  Her very choice of the alternative method of expression indicates to me that both Pezznola and Duggan were involved.  I can hardly believe that she would have even mentioned Pezznola's name, either in the alternative or otherwise, if he had never given her any direction to falsify the corporation's books.  Furthermore, even if her involved words when printed are susceptible of differing interpretations, their meaning when uttered, because of their complexity born of her obvious reluctance and evasiveness, depended in unusual degree upon intonation and demeanor observable to the trial judge and jury but not to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this situation I conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant wilfully and knowingly attempted to defeat and evade taxes due from Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgments of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MAGRUDER, Chief Judge, concurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HARTIGAN, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are appeals by the defendant, Guy R.

A third indictment, No. 54-237-F, subsequently withdrawn by the trial judge from the consideration of the jury, charged the defendant with the evasion of his personal income tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence tended to establish the following facts.  The defendant, Guy R. Pezznola, was treasurer and part owner of Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the sale of new and used automobiles.  He transacted some sales in behalf of the corporation, but his chief duties were to serve as body-repairman and mechanic.  Thomas G. Duggan, president and likewise part owner of the corporation, was in charge of the office.  He did no mechanical work of any kind.  Although the defendant had access to the office records, there was no recollection on the part of Mrs. Ethel Simansky, bookkeeper for the corporation during the years involved, that the defendant had ever actually examined the books.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tax returns in question were prepared by a firm of accountants.  There is no evidence that these returns do not accurately reflect the corporate books and accordingly it follows that any alleged deficiency must be explicable, if at all, in terms of the understatement of business transactions on the records of the corporation itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the Government's evidence the defendant moved for judgments of acquittal, which motions were denied as to No. 54-195-F and No. 54-236-F.  The defendant thereupon rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant contends that the court below erred in denying these motions, because there was not sufficient evidence of wilful and knowing understatement of taxable income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, therefore, to a consideration of what evidence there may be in these cases tending to prove that the defendant had knowledge that the corporate books did not properly reflect the business transactions consummated by the corporation throughout the fiscal years ending on April 30, 1948, and April 30, 1949.  It is entirely clear that the jury would be completely justified in finding that many of the bookkeeping entries represent substantial and systematic understatements.  In this connection the Government relies heavily on the testimony of the bookkeeper, Mrs. Simansky.  The Government contends here-- and so represented to the jury below-- that Mrs. Simansky's testimony was that both the defendant and Duggan had upon occasion instructed her to understate various transactions upon the books.  If this contention was well founded, it would, of course, effectively dispose of defendant's claim that there was no evidence in these cases from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the spurious character of the corporate records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apparent that Mrs. Simansky was a reluctant witness.

I believe that Mrs. Simansky's testimony went no farther in substance than this: 'The initiative for these understatements must of necessity have come from Pezznola, Duggan, or myself and it did not come from me.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nowhere in her testimony did Mrs. Simansky make the affirmative assertion that sometimes Pezznola instructed her in these matters and sometimes Duggan.  What she did say was that she had no memory as to particular transactions and the Government seizes upon these statements seeking to enlarge them by drawing the inference that she had a more general memory implicating the defendant which was limited only inasmuch as it could not be related to specific transactions.  I believe that it is not possible to draw any such inference from her testimony.  First of all, on one occasion, she specifically declined to testify that she had any such general memory implicating the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. Did it go to Mr. Pezznola on some occasions?  A.  I couldn't remember.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Q. Did it go to Mr. Duggan on some occasions?  A.  I couldn't remember.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the only defect in Mrs. Simansky's memory of these matters related to a mere inability to connect known guilt to specific transactions, she could have indicated as much by an affirmative answer to these questions which in no way called for a memory of individual transactions.  This she refused to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still further, I think it is clear from the record that Mrs. Simansky went no farther in the direction of incriminating either the defendant or Duggan than she was forced to go by the undeniable facts and the necessity of exculpating herself from liability for the understatements.  After testifying that the entries were properly recorded she was forced by questions directed towards specific entries in the books to acknowledge that they were not properly recorded; but she could not account for the reasons for these discrepancies.  She was then forced to admit that only three persons could be responsible, Pezznola, Duggan and herself.  Accordingly, she testified it must have been either Pezznola or Duggan because she would not make such entries on her own initiative.  This was the limit to which the ammunition in the Government's arsenal could force her to go.  In view of the obvious reluctance of the witness, her express refusal to testify at one time that she had a memory which would implicate the defendant 'on some occasions,' it seems to me clearly impossible to infer that she went one step farther than the Government could push her and gratuitously added the additional elements of evidence which the Government purports to find in her testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial there was some confusion as to the import of her testimony, but the trial judge seems to have agreed that she had no memory which would implicate either Duggan or the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Mr. Koen: Mr. Smith says that there is only one piece of testimony and that was with reference to the $200 from Gallagher or Geller.  My memory is that there is another piece of evidence from Steinberg which shows money going into Pezznola in addition.

If Mrs. Simansky, as I believe, said no more than this-- 'It had to be Pezznola, Duggan or I and it wasn't I,' then her testimony afforded no evidentiary basis upon which the jury could properly make a determination as to the guilt of the defendant.  If left to the jury, such a question could be resolved only by flipping a coin or some other fortuitous device.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of other evidence tending to prove that the defendant had knowledge of the fraudulent character of the corporate books, I believe this case should not have been submitted to the jury.  I have analyzed the record, and with only two exceptions-- the Geller and Steinberg transactions-- the Government's evidence either shows no connection with the defendant or at best merely that the defendant made certain sales correctly stated on the invoice which were subsequently understated or omitted on the books by some unknown person, either Duggan or himself.  Such evidence is clearly inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon analysis the Geller transaction shows nothing to indicate that the invoice was understated, but merely that Geller paid $200 more than he thought the car was worth.  Apparently this transaction was subsequently understated on the books, but as in all of these transactions there is nothing to show that the defendant was instrumental in making such understatements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Steinberg testified that he paid $2325 to the defendant and received a bill of sale 'if I were to trust my memory, I would say somewhere in the vicinity of $2000.'

Under these circumstances I believe the trial judge should have directed judgments of acquittal.  In Kassin v. United States, 5 Cir., 1937, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1545754\"><a href=\"/opinion/1545754/kassin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, at 184, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'* * * In each case, however, where the evidence is purely circumstantial, the links in the chain must be clearly proven, and taken together must point not to the possibility or probability, but to the moral certainty of guilt.  That is, the inferences which may reasonably be drawn from them as a whole must not only be consistent with guilt, but inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is entirely possible, though not probable, in the light of all the evidence, that Duggan was responsible for every understatement on the books and that the defendant was without knowledge of what was going on.  Duggan was dead at the time of the trial.  '* * * Since an essential link is missing, the United States has failed to establish its case * * *.  There is strong probability that (he) was guilty but the guilt of a defendant must be proved, not merely vehemently suspected in order to sustain a conviction.'  United States v. Stefanowicz, 3 Cir., 1949, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></span>, 191.  The evidence in this case is not inconsistent with the possibility that Duggan alone was guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All ambiguity with respect to the testimony of Mrs. Simansky could have been easily cleared up if the Government had seen fit to ask her one simple question: 'Without reference to specific transactions, do you have any memory that the defendant ever at any time instructed you to understate the books of the corporation?'  Possibly the Government was afraid to ask this question.  In any event it did not, but contented itself with an attempt to draw the inference favorable to its case without risking the disaster which would have resulted from a negative response to such a question.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the import of Mrs. Simansky's testimony could have been readily clarified in this manner and since the Government neglected to seek any such clarification, I believe that the Government failed to carry its burden of proof and that there was insufficient evidence to take this case to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps it should be noted here that at the termination of a seven day trial and after four hours of deliberation, the jury asked the court the following question: 'Who is under indictment, Pezznola or Guy's Super Service, Incorporated?'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing that the jury could ask at this late date in the trial could indicate better the jury's utter confusion.  The indictment against Pezznola relating to his personal income tax had already been withdrawn by the court from the jury's consideration.  Guy's Super Service Garage, Inc. was not under indictment-- perhaps it should have been.  I am convinced that the jury thought that the corporation should have been indicted and it disregarded the lack of evidence against the defendant in order to reach a compromise verdict based upon its belief that some one ought to pay for the corporation's misdeeds.  Pezznola as treasurer was the only target at which to aim since Duggan, the corporation's president, who also signed the tax returns, was dead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons I would reverse the judgments of the district court and remand the cases to that court with direction to enter judgments of acquittal.  However, my colleagues are of a different opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WOODBURY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has petitioned for rehearing on the ground that his assertions of error in the trial court's charge to the jury must have been overlooked because they were not mentioned anywhere in this court's opinion.  This is not so.  Judge Hartigan did not have occasion to consider the charge in the view he took of the case and Chief Judge Magruder and I considered the assertions of error only to reject them.  One sentence of the charge considered out of context might perhaps be interpreted as an erroneous statement of an applicable principle of law.  But considering the sentence in its context, such an interpretation would be so far fetched that we did not think there was any practical probability of misinterpretation by the jury.  Furthermore, it does not appear that counsel took exception to the sentence at the conclusion of the charge.  Rule 30, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 18 U.S.C.A.  The charge as a whole impressed us as eminently fair and any possible technical error in it so minor as not to affect substantial rights of the accused.  We therefore treated the error, if in fact there was any error at all, as harmless, and disregarded it in accordance with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Error was also pressed on failure of the court to give a certain requested charge, which, while it contained an abstractly correct proposition of law, was so adequately covered in the general charge as to preclude the possibility of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
