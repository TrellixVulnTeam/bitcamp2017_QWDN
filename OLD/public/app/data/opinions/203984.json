Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District              Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Stahl and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Irma R. Valldejuli on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Thomas F. Klumper,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United\nStates Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 31, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.    The substantive question that the defendant\n\nraises in this appeal is whether the district court erred in ruling\n\nthat if the defendant asked for a criminal- history-based downward\n\ndeparture or variance, that request would constitute a breach of\n\nthe plea agreement, freeing the government from abiding by the\n\nterms of that agreement. However, a threshold issue is whether the\n\nappeal waiver contained in the plea agreement applies to bar this\n\nappeal.    The government argues that the defendant forfeited, via\n\ninadequate   briefing,     any   argument   that   the   appeal    waiver    is\n\ninapplicable or unenforceable.           We bypass the forfeiture issue\n\nbecause the applicability and enforceability of the appeal waiver\n\nare intertwined with the merits of the appeal, which are fully\n\nbriefed, and because we conclude, for the reasons discussed below,\n\nthat the appeal waiver is applicable and enforceable in any event.\n\n            The appeal waiver provided, in full, as follows:               \"The\n\ndefendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts this\n\nagreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions,\n\ndefendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment\n\nand sentence in this case.\"      Because of the generic wording of this\n\nwaiver, determining its applicability requires perusing the rest of\n\nthe agreement to see whether the defendant was sentenced \"according\n\nto   its   terms   and    conditions.\"      This   exercise,      though    not\n\nparticularly difficult here, could have been avoided entirely if\n\nthe waiver were more case specific.         See United States v. Acosta-\n\n                                    -2-\n\fRoman, 549 F.3d 1, 4 n.3 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding virtually\n\nidentical waiver provision to be \"'simple and easily understood'\"\n\n(citation   omitted)     but    suggesting        that     such    provisions       \"make\n\nspecific    reference    to    any    terms       and    conditions      of   the   plea\n\nagreement that are not intended by the parties to be covered by the\n\nwaiver\").\n\n            The defendant argues, in essence, that the court did not\n\nsentence him \"according to the terms and conditions\" of the plea\n\nagreement because it wrongly refused to consider his argument for\n\na lower sentence based on the overrepresentation of his criminal\n\nhistory category.       This is where the appeal waiver and substantive\n\nissues overlap.\n\n            In   arguing      that    the    plea        agreement      permitted    the\n\noverrepresentation argument, the defendant points to the lack of a\n\nstipulation as to the defendant's criminal history category and\n\ncharacterizes     the   overrepresentation              argument   as    an   objection\n\nrelated to the criminal history category rather than as an argument\n\nfor a \"further adjustment[] or departure[] to the defendant's base\n\noffense level\" prohibited by the agreement.                   He also argues that\n\nthe \"assessment of the criminal history category,\" left open by the\n\nplea agreement, includes not only the raw calculation of that\n\ncategory under USSG §§ 4A1.1 and 4A1.2 but also any reduction in\n\nthat   category    warranted         by     the    overrepresentation          of     the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fdefendant's criminal history under USSG § 4A1.3.   Those arguments,\n\nthough creative, are unpersuasive for several reasons.\n\n          First, they arguably conflict both with the defendant's\n\nrepeated concession, at sentencing, that he had no objection to the\n\ncalculation of his criminal history category and with his own\n\nprevious characterization of his argument for a reduced sentence as\n\none for a \"downward departure.\"\n\n          Second, that post hoc characterization is inconsistent\n\nwith the guidelines' treatment of such a reduction as a \"departure\"\n\nunder USSG § 4A1.3(b), rather than as part of the calculation of\n\nthe criminal history category under USSG §§ 4A1.1 and 4A1.2.\n\n          Third, rather than construing the plea agreement as a\n\nwhole, Acosta-Roman, 549 F.3d at 4, such arguments improperly focus\n\non certain words and phrases of the plea agreement in isolation.\n\nUnder the heading, \"NO FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS OR DEPARTURES,\" the\n\nparties agreed \"that no further adjustments or departures to the\n\ndefendant's base offense level, pursuant to [18 U.S.C. § 3553], or\n\na variance from the recommended sentence of imprisonment, shall be\n\nsought by the parties.\"   Any ambiguity as to whether that agreed-\n\nupon prohibition applied only to adjustments to or departures from\n\nthe \"base offense level,\" as the defendant argues, or, rather, to\n\ndepartures or variances more generally, including those related to\n\nthe defendant's criminal history, as the district court held, is\n\neliminated when the above-quoted sentence is read in conjunction\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fwith the next one, in which the parties \"agree[d] that any request\n\nfor a different sentence of imprisonment constitutes a departure or\n\nvariance from the recommended sentence.\" Similarly, construing the\n\nplea agreement to permit parties to argue for some departures or\n\nvariances appears contrary to the parties' intent, evidenced by\n\ntheir stipulations as to sentencing guideline calculations (other\n\nthan the defendant's criminal history category), to limit the range\n\nof disagreement and hence the ultimate sentence the court was\n\nlikely to choose.    If, despite those stipulations, the defendant\n\ncould seek a downward departure under section 4A1.3(b), then the\n\ngovernment could seek an upward one under section 4A1.3(a), based\n\non its opposing view of the defendant's true criminal propensity or\n\nlikelihood of recidivism, thereby widely opening the door that the\n\nparties attempted to shut as far as they could without knowing the\n\ndefendant's criminal history.\n\n          Fourth,    and    more   generally,    a    defendant's   criminal\n\nhistory is often unknown at the point of a guilty plea.             Allowing\n\ndefendants to seek downward departures or variances, otherwise\n\nbarred by their plea agreements, when their criminal history\n\ncategories   later   turn   out    to   be   higher   than   expected   would\n\nundermine any attempt to stipulate to a guideline sentencing range.\n\n          Accordingly, we reject the defendant's arguments and\n\nconstrue the plea agreement to bar the present appeal as follows:\n\nThe key provision of the plea agreement concerning sentencing is\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe parties' agreement to \"recommend a sentence of imprisonment at\n\nthe lower end of the applicable Guideline sentencing range.\"\n\nAlthough     that    agreement    was    conditioned    on    \"the    defendant's\n\ncriminal history category exceed[ing] Category I,\" that condition\n\nwas   met    since   the     defendant's    criminal    history      category   was\n\ncalculated to be IV and the defendant conceded the accuracy of that\n\ncalculation.         Given    that   criminal    history      category   and    the\n\ndefendant's stipulated total offense level of 21, his \"applicable\n\nGuideline sentencing range\" was 57 to 71 months, USSG ch. 5, pt. A\n\n(Sentencing Table), and the \"lower end\" of that range was 57\n\nmonths.     Since the district court did sentence the defendant to 57\n\nmonths' imprisonment, it sentenced him \"according to [the plea\n\nagreement's] terms and conditions.\"             Therefore, the appeal waiver\n\napplies.\n\n             Nor would enforcing the appeal waiver here be manifestly\n\nunjust.     Cf. United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 25-26 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). \"As a general matter, there is nothing unjust about holding\n\na defendant to the bargain struck in his plea agreement.\"                  United\n\nStates v. Calderón-Pacheco, 564 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2009).                    And\n\nthe bargain struck here was clearly favorable to the defendant. In\n\nreturn      for   pleading      guilty     to   Count   25,     stipulating     to\n\nresponsibility for a relatively small amount of drugs, agreeing not\n\nto seek any further departures or variances, and waiving his right\n\nto appeal, the defendant avoided exposure to the much longer\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fsentence that could have resulted from being convicted on Count 1,\n\nwhich charged a four-month-long conspiracy involving 14 individuals\n\nand much larger amounts of drugs.      Even as to Count 25, he avoided\n\nthe government's seeking an available two-level enhancement for\n\ncommitting a drug offense inside a public housing project and\n\nbenefitted from a citation error in the indictment, absent which he\n\nwould have been subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five\n\nyears (three months over the 57-month sentence ultimately imposed)\n\nbased on the amount of crack to which he stipulated.\n\n           Nor was his 57-month sentence manifestly unjust in the\n\nsense that it was based on an \"egregious\" error.      Cf. Teeter, 257\n\nF.3d at 25. The only purported error identified here--the district\n\ncourt's ruling that the defendant's request for a departure or\n\nvariance below the guideline range constituted a breach of the plea\n\nagreement--was not erroneous at all, much less egregiously so, for\n\nthe reasons already discussed.\n\n           In sum, because the appeal waiver is both applicable and\n\nenforceable, this appeal is summarily dismissed.      See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
