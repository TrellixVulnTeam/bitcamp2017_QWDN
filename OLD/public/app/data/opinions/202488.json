After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties’ submissions, we affirm the district court’s denial of\n\nthe Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion.\n\n           To the extent that the appellants, Alison E. Clapp\n\nO’Callaghan and Daniel J. O’Callaghan (“the O’Callaghans”), sought\n\nrelief under Rule 60(b)(5) and/or (6), we review the denial of the\n\nmotion for an abuse of discretion.          See United States v. Boch\n\nOldsmobile, Inc., 909 F.2d 657, 661 (1st Cir. 1990).          “It is well\n\nsettled that courts will not disturb final judgments unless the\n\nmoving   party    demonstrates    the    existence    of   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.”       Id. at 660 (citing United States v. Swift, 286\n\nU.S. 106, 119 (1932)).     Ordinarily, a change in decisional law is\n\nnot considered an “extraordinary circumstance” justifying relief\n\nfrom judgment.    See United States ex rel. Garibaldi v. Orleans\n\nParish Sch. Bd., 397 F.3d 334, 337-38 (5th Cir. 2005) (Supreme\n\nCourt decision clarifying law and resolving circuit split was not\n\nan   “extraordinary    circumstance”    justifying   relief   under   Rule\n\n60(b)); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trustees of UMWA Combined Benefit\n\nFund, 249 F.3d 519, 524-25 (6th Cir. 2001) (notwithstanding change\n\nin decisional law, equity favored denial of Rule 60(b)(6) motion,\n\ngiven the amount of time that had passed since final judgment;\n\nreliance of parties upon that judgment; and public policy favoring\n\nfinality of judgments).     Moreover, a motion filed pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) or (6) must be filed within a reasonable time.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).       In determining whether a Rule 60(b)\n\fmotion has been filed within a reasonable time, the court should\n\nconsider “whether the parties have been prejudiced by the delay.”\n\nId.\n\n            We see no extraordinary circumstances here that would\n\nhave justified the district court in allowing the motion.                         The\n\nSupreme Court’s recent decision in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\n\nInd.   Corp.,   544     U.S.   280     (2005),       is   not    an   extraordinary\n\ncircumstance,      as   that   decision       only    clarified       existing   law.\n\nMoreover, substantial prejudice would result if this judgment were\n\nreopened, and, as the appellees correctly note, the prejudicial\n\neffects would be difficult to quantify. This dispute originated as\n\na   guardianship    petition,    and    the    subject      of    that    petition   –\n\nHortense Clapp Pollard – has been dead for over four years.\n\nPollard’s   will    has   been   probated        and      her    assets   have   been\n\ndistributed. The O’Callaghans’ request to reopen these proceedings\n\nnot only could prejudice severely those who long ago inherited from\n\nPollard, but it seemingly would require the federal courts to (once\n\nagain) second-guess the final judgments of the state court that\n\nprobated Pollard’s will.\n\n            Because we find no extraordinary circumstances present,\n\nand because it appears that allowing the motion under either Rule\n\n60(b)(5) or (6) would have resulted in significant prejudice, the\n\nlower court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            To the extent that the O’Callaghans sought relief on the\n\nbasis that the original judgment was void, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b)(4), the court reviews a denial of the motion de novo.                   See\n\nEsso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.) v. Rodriguez-Perez, 455 F.3d 1, 4-5\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).     We find no error in the court’s denial of the\n\nRule 60(b)(4) motion, because the original judgment in this case is\n\nnot void.    “There are only two sets of circumstances in which a\n\njudgment is void (as opposed to voidable).              The first is when the\n\nrendering   court   lacked     either   subject    matter      jurisdiction    or\n\njurisdiction over the defendant's person. [] The second is when the\n\nrendering court's actions so far exceeded a proper exercise of\n\njudicial power that a violation of the Due Process Clause results.”\n\nFarm Credit Bank v. Ferrera-Goitia, 316 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(citing Boch Oldsmobile, 909 F.2d at 661).\n\n            The O’Callaghans do not claim that the district court\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute; indeed, they\n\nsay the opposite, that is, that because Rooker-Feldman does not\n\napply, the district court did have subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nSee District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462,\n\n486 (1983) (federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nchallenges to state court decisions).               Accordingly, the Rule\n\n60(b)(4) motion should have been granted only if the district\n\ncourt’s original decision “so far exceeded a proper exercise of\n\njudicial    power   that   a   violation   of     the    Due   Process   Clause\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fresult[ed].”         Farm Credit Bank, 316 F.3d at 67.           We see no such\n\nexercise of judicial power, and the O’Callaghans do not explain how\n\nthe court’s original judgment could be so characterized.                   Indeed,\n\nwe would be hesitant to say a court’s decision that it lacked the\n\npower    to    act   in   a   matter   (because   it    lacked   subject    matter\n\njurisdiction) could be said to have exceeded the court’s power. In\n\nany event, the O’Callaghans only argue that the court’s original\n\ndecision was wrong (because it improperly applied the Rooker-\n\nFeldman doctrine), not that it was an improper exercise of judicial\n\npower.        Their argument is insufficient to establish that the\n\njudgment was void.        “A judgment is not void merely because it is or\n\nmay be erroneous [] or because the precedent upon which it was\n\nbased is later altered or even overruled.”                Boch Oldsmobile, 909\n\nF.2d at 661 (citing Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State\n\nBank, 308 U.S. 371, 376 (1940)).\n\n              Upon    review    of   the   appellees’   motion   for   sanctions\n\npursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 38, we deny the motion.\n\n              Affirmed.       See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f",
