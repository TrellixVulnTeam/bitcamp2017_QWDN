Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Robert S.

This discrimination case, brought\n\nunder both federal and state law, involves charges of sexual and\n\nretaliatory harassment.       Faced with a plethora of issues, the\n\ndistrict court entered summary judgment for the defendant.              On\n\nappeal, we must sort out which of the plaintiff's claims are\n\ntimely;   address   whether   her    timeous    claims   for   retaliatory\n\nharassment, cast in the form of a hostile work environment, are\n\nlegally cognizable and sufficiently supported; grapple with her one\n\ntimely claim of sexual harassment, also cast in the form of a\n\nhostile work environment; and discuss various aspects of the case\n\nrelating to employer liability.           After careful consideration of\n\nthese variegated issues, we conclude (i) that the district court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment on the retaliation claims, as\n\nthose claims are timely, cognizable, and supported by sufficient\n\nevidence, but (ii) that the district court correctly entered\n\nsummary judgment on the sexual harassment claims:              despite the\n\nattempt to recast them in a hostile work environment format, the\n\nstate-law claim is time-barred and its federal analogue runs afoul\n\nof an inexpugnable affirmative defense — the employer's swift,\n\neffective, and non-negligent response to the underlying incident.\n\nAccordingly, we vacate in part, affirm in part, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            Because this appeal follows a grant of summary judgment,\n\nwe rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty   (here,     the   plaintiff),   consistent   with   record      support.\n\nGarside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).              That\n\napproach entails, among other things, giving the nonmovant the\n\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences that those facts will bear.\n\nId.\n\n                               A.   The Facts.\n\n            While on the job on September 11, 1999, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Christi Noviello, a parking enforcement officer for the\n\ncity of Boston, was riding in a city-owned van with her immediate\n\nsuperior, José Ortiz. After first announcing his intentions, Ortiz\n\nforcibly unhooked the plaintiff's brassière, ripped it from her\n\nbody, hung it on the van's outside mirror, and bellowed a crude\n\nsexual remark to a fellow employee on the street.               Over the next\n\nfew days, the plaintiff reported the incident to a number of\n\nmunicipal   hierarchs.       They   promptly     investigated    the    matter,\n\nsuspended Ortiz a week after the incident, and ultimately cashiered\n\nhim.\n\n            Soon after Ortiz's banishment, coworkers began to subject\n\nthe plaintiff to sundry indignities, or, in the words of the\n\nemployees themselves, to \"bust[] her chops.\"           The record contains\n\nevidence of the following incidents (the plaintiff recounts others,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fbut we have omitted those that lack any conceivable probative\n\nvalue):\n\n          C    On October 5, 1999, Barbara DiGirolamo\n               accused the plaintiff of throwing a\n               tampon at a coworker.      The charge\n               fizzled out after several witnesses\n               attested to its falsity.\n\n          C    On October 26, 1999, a coworker shouted\n               that the plaintiff was the \"scum of the\n               earth.\" Another loudly proclaimed, in\n               reference to the plaintiff, \"I smell a\n               rat, do you smell a rat?\" Yet another\n               lamented that the parking enforcement\n               officers' \"good\" supervisor had been\n               drummed out of office. The plaintiff\n               complained to a senior supervisor,\n               Irene Landry, who took no action.\n\n          C    On December 8, 1999, a new employee\n               told the plaintiff that although he had\n               no problem with her, other coworkers\n               had advised him to \"stay away\" because\n               she was \"trouble.\"\n\n          C     On December 9, 1999, the entire\n                department ostracized the plaintiff\n                during a holiday party. Consequently,\n                she sat alone for two hours. A deputy\n                commissioner saw her sitting alone,\n                acknowledged   the    ostracism,   and\n                suggested that she change her shift.\n                The plaintiff took the advice, but the\n                harassment continued.\n\n          C     On   December  16,   1999,  DiGirolamo\n                informed   the   plaintiff  that   all\n                personnel on her shift had to take\n                their dinner breaks separately.    The\n                plaintiff later learned that this was\n                not true and that she was the only\n                person who had been told to eat alone.\n\n          C     On   December  21,   1999,   Bernadette\n                Gilardi announced in front of the\n                plaintiff that she would be taking up a\n\n                              -4-\n\f                 collection for Ortiz. She proceeded to\n                 do so during working hours.\n\n          C      On December 23, 1999, the plaintiff\n                 attended a holiday party on the\n                 department's premises. The collection\n                 for   Ortiz   was   in   full   flower.\n                 Coworkers waved the money they had\n                 amassed   in  the   plaintiff's   face,\n                 crowing \"look how much money we have\n                 collected!\"    One of the plaintiff's\n                 superiors, Kathy O'Brien, advised her\n                 to \"go to the office\" about the\n                 harassment.    There is no evidence,\n                 however, that O'Brien intervened to\n                 stop the ongoing conduct.\n\n          C      On December 30, 1999, the plaintiff met\n                 with a high-level supervisor, Kathleen\n                 Moccia.   She described the toll that\n                 the harassment was taking on her and\n                 asked   Moccia   why   management   was\n                 tolerating the harassment. Moccia did\n                 not intervene.    Moreover, she stated\n                 that she did not think that the\n                 harassment would stop; rather, she\n                 forecast that it would become \"ten\n                 times worse\" with the plaintiff's\n                 recent shift change.\n\n          C      In January of 2000, a tow truck driver\n                 told the plaintiff that Gilardi had\n                 begun circulating a petition urging\n                 management to dismiss the plaintiff,\n                 but that he had refused to sign it.\n\n          C      During a snowstorm that month, Gilardi\n                 refused to pick up the plaintiff from\n                 her route. Although that refusal, duly\n                 reported,    was    in  derogation   of\n                 departmental    policy,  there   is  no\n                 evidence that Gilardi was sanctioned or\n                 punished in any way.\n\n          On March 6, 2000, the plaintiff filed a complaint with\n\nthe Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) and the\n\n\n                               -5-\n\ffederal   Equal   Employment   Opportunity   Commission   (EEOC).   The\n\nharassment nonetheless persisted.       Two examples follow:\n\n\n           C       In February of 2001, the plaintiff\n                   approached a van that was used to\n                   transport parking enforcement officers\n                   to their posts.     Gilardi was at the\n                   wheel.    When she saw the plaintiff\n                   approach, she closed the van's door,\n                   ignored the plaintiff's tapping on the\n                   window, and drove away, nearly striking\n                   the plaintiff. The plaintiff reported\n                   the incident and Gilardi admitted that\n                   she   had   seen   the   plaintiff  but\n                   nonetheless had pulled away. There is\n                   no    evidence    that    Gilardi   was\n                   disciplined for this conduct.\n\n           C       In March of 2001, Gilardi told a\n                   coworker, in reference to Ortiz's\n                   firing, that the plaintiff's \"payday\"\n                   was drawing near.\n\n           The plaintiff alleges that, as a result of this steady\n\nstream of what she characterizes as retaliatory harassment, she\n\nlost weight, experienced nightmares and panic attacks, became\n\nanxious at work, and was forced to seek medical care.\n\n                       B.   Travel of the Case.\n\n           On October 16, 2002, the plaintiff requested withdrawal\n\nof her administrative complaint in order to pave the way for the\n\ninstitution of suit.    The MCAD obliged and the plaintiff commenced\n\na civil action against the city in a Massachusetts state court.\n\nHer complaint, filed on November 1, 2002, charged the city with\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4.       On April 25, 2003,\n\nthe plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC.         One\n\n                                  -6-\n\fmonth later, she amended her state court complaint to include Title\n\nVII claims.   See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2, e-3.            At that point, the\n\ncity removed the case to the federal district court.           See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1331, 1441.\n\n          In due course, the city moved for summary judgment under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56, arguing (i) that most of the plaintiff's claims\n\nunder chapter 151B were time-barred; (ii) that those which remained\n\nwere not actionable; (iii) that as to the federal retaliation\n\nclaims, the evidence, even when interpreted in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff, did not reveal any actionable conduct;\n\nand (iv) that the city could not be held liable for Ortiz's\n\nbehavior because it had taken prompt and effective remedial action.\n\nThe plaintiff opposed the motion.          Ruling ore sponte, the district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment for the city.            The court concluded\n\nthat there was no timely sexual harassment claim under chapter 151B\n\nand that the city's response to the Ortiz incident foreclosed any\n\nsexual harassment claim under Title VII.            As to the retaliation\n\nclaims, the court acknowledged that, viewing the proof in the\n\nrequisite light, the plaintiff had been subjected to a \"series of\n\ndistasteful, unpleasant, non-empathetic acts . . . by a series of\n\nsubordinate officials.\" Nevertheless, the court concluded that the\n\nretaliation   claims   must   fail    because    none   of   the   individual\n\nincidents was an \"adverse employment action[]\" that bore directly\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fupon the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment.                    This\n\ntimely appeal followed.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n                 The plaintiff's suit implicates both federal and state\n\nanti-discrimination and anti-retaliation statues.                   It requires us\n\nto confront — and resolve — two questions of first impression in\n\nthis circuit.\n\n                  As framed, all of the plaintiff's claims are dependent\n\nupon       her   allegation    that   the    city   tolerated   a    hostile    work\n\nenvironment.1         In general, a plaintiff may recover on such a theory\n\nwhen \"the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.\"           Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510\n\nU.S.       17,   21   (1993)   (citations     and   internal    quotation      marks\n\nomitted); accord O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 728\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); Muzzy v. Cahillane Motors, Inc., 749 N.E.2d 691,\n\n694 (Mass. 2001).         The plaintiff's hostile work environment claims\n\nare of two types.\n\n                 Most hostile work environments are bred from an ongoing\n\nseries of harassing incidents.              The plaintiff's claim of a hostile\n\n\n       1\n      This is an odd configuration for the claim that Ortiz, on a\nsingle occasion, sexually harassed the plaintiff. We assume that\nthe plaintiff attempts to force the harassment claim into that mold\nin an effort to elude the limitations question under chapter 151B.\nSee infra Part II(B).\n\n                                        -8-\n\fwork environment, based singularly upon Ortiz's assault, is not of\n\nthis ilk.       However, a single act of harassment may, if egregious\n\nenough, suffice to evince a hostile work environment. See Faragher\n\nv. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998) (Title VII); Gnerre\n\nv. MCAD, 524 N.E.2d 84, 88-89 (Mass. 1988) (chapter 151B).                 The\n\nplaintiff's claims of a retaliatory hostile work environment are\n\nmore stereotypical.          These claims are based upon the pervasive\n\nretaliation       that   the   plaintiff   allegedly      experienced     after\n\ncomplaining about Ortiz's assault.\n\n               With this brief preface, we proceed to explicate the\n\nsummary judgment standard and then examine the anatomy of the\n\nplaintiff's claims.\n\n                    A.   The Summary Judgment Standard.\n\n               An order granting summary judgment engenders de novo\n\nreview.    Serapion v. Martinez, 119 F.3d 982, 987 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nIn conducting that review, we must scrutinize the evidence in the\n\nlight most agreeable to the nonmoving party, giving that party the\n\nbenefit of any and all reasonable inferences.             Cox v. Hainey, 391\n\nF.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).          For her part, the nonmovant bears\n\n\"the burden of producing specific facts sufficient to deflect the\n\nswing of the summary judgment scythe.\" Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf\n\nCo., 335 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).         Those facts, typically set\n\nforth     in   affidavits,     depositions,   and   the    like,   must   have\n\nevidentiary value; as a rule, \"[e]vidence that is inadmissible at\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\ftrial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may not be considered on\n\nsummary judgment.\"        Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st\n\nCir. 1998); accord Garside, 895 F.2d at 49.\n\n            Most    of    the   facts     presented    by    the   plaintiff,     as\n\nrecounted   above,       satisfy   this    standard.        In   large   part,   the\n\nchronicled events are within the plaintiff's personal knowledge.\n\nThe insults and taunting that the plaintiff recounts do not create\n\nhearsay problems; those statements are not offered for their truth,\n\nbut, rather, to show that the words were spoken (and, thus,\n\ncontributed to the hostile work environment). They are, therefore,\n\nadmissible.    See Mota v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr.,\n\n261 F.3d 512, 526 n.46 (5th Cir. 2001).                The statements made by\n\nsupervisors   are    admissible      as    non-hearsay       statements     of   the\n\ndefendant's agents made within the scope of their employment.                    See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).\n\n            We note, however, that two statements give us pause. The\n\nfirst is a statement from an unnamed coworker that other employees\n\ntold him to \"stay away\" from the plaintiff as she was \"trouble.\"\n\nInsofar as the plaintiff is attempting to introduce this statement\n\nas evidence of other coworkers' harassing behavior, it is hearsay;\n\nits   probative    value    ultimately      depends    on    the    truth   of   the\n\ndeclarant's own unsworn out-of-court utterance.                  It is, therefore,\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\finadmissible.2          See Fed. R. Evid. 801, 802; see also Vazquez, 134\n\nF.3d       at   34.      A   similar     problem     exists    with    respect    to   the\n\nplaintiff's assertion that a tow truck driver said that Gilardi had\n\nbeen       circulating        a   petition     to    have     the     plaintiff   fired.\n\nConsequently, we cannot consider the content of either statement in\n\nanalyzing the plaintiff's claims.                   See LaRou v. Ridlon, 98 F.3d\n\n659, 663 (1st Cir. 1996) (branding incompetent on summary judgment\n\nportions of a party's affidavit recounting inadmissible hearsay).\n\n                                    B.    Timeliness.\n\n                The first question that we must answer pertains to\n\ntimeliness.           In order to prosecute a harassment claim under either\n\nMassachusetts or federal law, an aggrieved party must first file a\n\ntimely administrative complaint.                    The time parameters for these\n\nfilings differ.              In 1999, chapter 151B mandated filing with the\n\nMCAD within six months of the alleged violation.                        See   Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 151B, § 5 (1989) (amended 2002).                     By contrast, the EEOC\n\nfiling had to occur within 300 days of the date of the alleged\n\nviolation.            See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); see also Sabree v.\n\nUnited Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners, 921 F.2d 396, 399 & n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (discussing timely filing of charges of discrimination\n\n\n       2\n      Were that statement offered as evidence of the declarant's\ncontribution to the hostile work environment, it would likely be\nadmissible. In that event, its effect on the plaintiff would be\nthe same regardless of the truth of the matter asserted. See Mota,\n261 F.3d at 526 n.46. Here, however, the plaintiff's affidavit\ntakes the air out of any suggestion that the declarant's statement\nwas itself a product of retaliatory animus.\n\n                                             -11-\n\fwith    the    EEOC     in    \"deferral\"     states,    i.e.,   states      such   as\n\nMassachusetts, which have their own civil rights statute and\n\nagency).        There    is   no   dispute    that   the   plaintiff     met   these\n\nadministrative        deadlines;     the     earliest      incident    of    alleged\n\nharassment occurred on September 11, 1999, and the plaintiff's\n\nadministrative complaint was filed with both agencies on March 6,\n\n2000.\n\n              A claimant who wishes to sue under chapter 151B must\n\nallow a waiting period to pass, file her suit, and notify the MCAD\n\n(which is then required to dismiss the administrative proceeding).\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9.             This civil suit must be instituted\n\nno later than three years after the occurrence of the alleged\n\nviolation.       See id.      The federal prototype is different.            A Title\n\nVII claimant may sue only after the EEOC issues a right-to-sue\n\nletter.        42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1).              Once such a letter is\n\nreceived, the claimant must file her suit within ninety days.                      Id.\n\nThe fact that an analogous state statute of limitations has expired\n\nwith respect to a parallel state harassment action does not create\n\na temporal bar to a Title VII suit.             See Burgh v. Borough Council,\n\n251 F.3d 465, 473 (3d Cir. 2001); Kirk v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 578\n\nF.2d 814, 819 (9th Cir. 1978); Draper v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co.,\n\n527 F.2d 515, 522 (6th Cir. 1975).\n\n              Here, the plaintiff's Title VII claims are unquestionably\n\ntimely:       she received a right-to-sue letter on April 25, 2003 and\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fadded her Title VII claims to her pending suit on May 19, 2003.\n\nThe situation is more tenebrous with regard to the chapter 151B\n\nclaims.     The plaintiff first brought suit on these claims on\n\nNovember 1, 2002.     Based on the three-year statute of limitations\n\napplicable to chapter 151B actions, this would seem to foreclose\n\nrecovery for any incidents that occurred prior to November 1, 1999,\n\nincluding   the    original    sexual    harassment   and    several    of    the\n\ninstances of alleged retaliation.\n\n            The plaintiff offers a theory as to why these claims\n\nnonetheless are timely.        After reviewing her thesis, we conclude\n\nthat her state-law claims based on the Ortiz imbroglio are barred\n\nbut that her retaliation claims are not.           We explain briefly.\n\n            Massachusetts      law    recognizes   that     \"some   claims     of\n\ndiscrimination involve a series of related events that have to be\n\nviewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their\n\ndiscriminatory     nature     and    impact.\"   Cuddyer     v.   Stop   &    Shop\n\nSupermarket Co., 750 N.E.2d 928, 936 (Mass. 2001).                  Under this\n\ncontinuing violation doctrine, a plaintiff who ordinarily would be\n\nunable to recover damages for discrete acts of discrimination\n\nfalling outside the limitations period may avoid that bar if those\n\nacts are shown to be part of a pattern of discrimination anchored\n\nby acts that occurred within the limitations period.                Id. at 936-\n\n37. Hostile environment claims, by their nature, often fall within\n\nthis rubric.      See id. at 937; Clifton v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f815 N.E.2d 614, 624 (Mass. App. Ct. 2004).                     In such situations,\n\nhowever,       the    anchoring   event     must   \"substantially      relate[]   to\n\nearlier incidents of abuse and substantially contribute[] to the\n\ncontinuation of a hostile work environment.\"                   Cuddyer, 750 N.E.2d\n\nat 938.\n\n               The application of the continuing violation doctrine\n\nsometimes       has    the   effect   of    expanding    the    three-year   filing\n\ndeadline for suits under chapter 151B.                  See, e.g., Clifton, 815\n\nN.E.2d at 620-21; Carter v. Comm'r of Corr., 681 N.E.2d 1255, 1261-\n\n62 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997).         We thus confront the question of whether\n\nthe facts in this case, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff, make out a continuing violation.\n\n               On the one hand, we think that reasonable jurors could\n\nfind that the distasteful and unpleasant actions undertaken by the\n\nplaintiff's coworkers before and after November 1, 1999 were part\n\nof a pattern of retaliation.               For one thing, the harassment began\n\nsoon after the plaintiff lodged her initial complaint about Ortiz's\n\nboorishness and surfaced most frequently in the first few months\n\nafter Ortiz was dismissed.             When harassment follows hard on the\n\nheels     of    protected     activity,      the   timing      often   is   strongly\n\nsuggestive of retaliation.            See     Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,\n\n846 F.2d 103, 110 (1st Cir. 1988); Mole v. Univ. of Mass., 814\n\nN.E.2d 329, 341 (Mass. 2004).               For another thing, the harassment\n\nitself offered circumstantial evidence of causation; coworkers\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\freferred to the plaintiff as a \"rat\" (a term that connotes an\n\ninformer   or    snitch),     lamented       the   firing   of     their     \"good\n\nsupervisor,\" and took up a collection for his benefit.                     Even as\n\nlate as 2001, Gilardi committed an act of harassment and, shortly\n\nthereafter, made reference to the plaintiff's upcoming \"payday.\"\n\nUp to that point, we believe that reasonable jurors could deem the\n\nlisted incidents to comprise a pattern of retaliatory harassment.\n\nSince   this    pattern    includes    events      within   and    without     the\n\nlimitations period, we are free to use incidents from both periods\n\nin deciding whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case\n\nof a hostile work environment under chapter 151B.\n\n           That said, we find unpersuasive the plaintiff's labored\n\neffort to include Ortiz's solitary act of sexual harassment as part\n\nof the pattern of subsequent retaliatory acts.                   This attempted\n\nagglomeration relies heavily, but mistakenly, upon the MCAD's\n\ndecision in Muise v. Credit Exch., 17 M.D.L.R. 1684 (MCAD 1995), a\n\ncase in which the agency said that timely incidents of retaliation\n\nmay anchor an untimely incident of sexual harassment if \"the charge\n\nof retaliation is inextricably related to the original charge of\n\nsexual harassment.\"       Id. at 1690.   The plaintiff overlooks that in\n\norder to invoke this doctrine, a claimant must show at a bare\n\nminimum a series of discriminatory acts that emanate from the same\n\ndiscriminatory animus. See Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, 145 F.3d 5,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f14 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Morrisey v. Holiday Inn, 25 M.D.L.R.\n\n74, 86 n.12 (MCAD 2003) (citing Provencher).        We explain briefly.\n\n           When an individual sexually harasses a victim and then\n\nengages in non-sexual retaliatory harassment, the sexual and non-\n\nsexual harassment arguably may be part and parcel of the same\n\nviolation.   Cf. O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 729 (noting that, in such\n\ncircumstances, the non-sexual harassment is still charged with the\n\noriginal animus).      But cf. Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court,\n\n201 F.3d 784, 790-91 (6th Cir. 2000) (refusing to aggregate sexual\n\nharassment and non-sexual retaliatory harassment undertaken by a\n\nsingle supervisor).       That was the fact pattern in Muise, 17\n\nM.D.L.R. at 1686-87.\n\n           The majority of cases are not cut from this seamless\n\ncloth.   Even when retaliation is derivative of a particular act of\n\nharassment, it normally does not stem from the same animus.            Most\n\noften,   retaliation     is   a   distinct   and   independent   act     of\n\ndiscrimination, motivated by a discrete intention to punish a\n\nperson who has rocked the boat by complaining about an unlawful\n\nemployment practice.     See, e.g., Ruffino v. State St. Bank & Trust\n\nCo., 908 F. Supp. 1019, 1040 (D. Mass. 1995); Tinkham v. Flatley\n\nCo., No. 98-BEM-0437, 2004 WL 1746070, at *12 (MCAD July 7, 2004)\n\n(quoting Ruffino).      That is a different animus than the sexual\n\nanimus that drove the original harassment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f              This case aptly illustrates the disparity of motives.\n\nOrtiz's attack was a one-time incident of sexual harassment.                       By\n\ncontrast, the retaliatory harassment consisted of a series of\n\ndiscrete acts orchestrated by a cohort of different individuals\n\n(not including Ortiz) and occurring over a period of many months\n\n(beginning      only   after     Ortiz      was   suspended).          Of   critical\n\nimportance, nothing in the record indicates that these retaliatory\n\nacts were undertaken for reasons related to the plaintiff's gender.\n\nAs such, the sexual harassment and retaliatory harassment in this\n\ncase   must    be   viewed     for   what    they   are:         two   separate    and\n\nindependent harms.      See Goguen v. Quality Plan Adm'rs, 11 Mass. L.\n\nRptr. 288, 2000 WL 282485, at *4 (Mass. Super. Ct. 2000) (holding\n\nthat sexual harassment by one person and subsequent retaliation by\n\nanother   are    not   sufficiently       related   to     add    up   to   a   single\n\ncontinuing violation); cf. Sitar v. Ind. Dep't. of Transp., 344\n\nF.3d 720, 726 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting generally that \"retaliation\n\n. . . and sexual harassment charges are not 'like or reasonably\n\nrelated' to one another to permit an EEOC charge of one type of\n\nwrong to support a subsequent civil suit for another\").                            The\n\nplaintiff cannot rely on the second to revive the first.\n\n              For much the same reason, we decline the plaintiff's\n\ninvitation to treat her case as one involving a \"mixed-motive\"\n\nclaim.    In support of this entreaty, the plaintiff relies upon Lam\n\nv. Univ. of Hawai'i, 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir. 1994), and Hicks v.\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fGates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1987).                Both decisions\n\nheld, however, that race and sex may be aggregated under Title VII\n\nwhere the allegations involved discrimination against a subclass of\n\npeople sharing both protected traits but not against those sharing\n\nonly one or the other.          See Lam, 40 F.3d at 1561-62 (involving\n\ndiscrimination against a subclass of Asian women); Hicks, 833 F.2d\n\nat 1416 & n.2 (involving discrimination against a subclass of black\n\nwomen).    Such a claim still involves a single wrong and a single\n\nharm, prompted by a single animus.           That is clearly not the case\n\nhere: Ortiz's assault was not directed at the plaintiff due to her\n\nstatus as a complaining woman, as she was not yet a member of that\n\nsubclass when the assault occurred.          Lam and Hicks are, therefore,\n\ninapposite.\n\n            To sum up, we find timely the plaintiff's Title VII\n\nsexual harassment claim and her federal and state claims for\n\nretaliatory harassment.         We find untimely, however, her state-law\n\nsexual    harassment    claim    (and,    therefore,   affirm     the    district\n\ncourt's entry of summary judgment for the defendant on that claim).\n\n    C.    Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment:           Cognizability.\n\n            We turn now to the cognizability of the retaliatory\n\nharassment    claims.     Both    Title    VII   and   chapter    151B   contain\n\nprovisions that make it unlawful for employers to retaliate against\n\npersons who complain about unlawfully discriminatory employment\n\npractices.    See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f§ 4(4).   To engage the gears of either statute, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that (i) she undertook protected conduct, (ii) she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action, and (iii) the two were causally linked.\n\nSee Dressler v. Daniel, 315 F.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir. 2003) (Title\n\nVII); Sullivan v. Raytheon Co., 262 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(chapter 151B).\n\n           Here, there is no dispute that the plaintiff engaged in\n\nprotected activity by filing a complaint. The parties instead spar\n\nover the second and third elements, which in this instance collapse\n\ninto a single question:         did the plaintiff sustain an adverse\n\nemployment action in the form of a hostile work environment based\n\non retaliation for filing a sexual harassment complaint against\n\nOrtiz?\n\n           Typically,     an   adverse     employment   action    involves   a\n\ndiscrete change in the terms and conditions of employment (say, a\n\ndischarge, demotion, or reduction in pay).              This case is more\n\nnuanced. In order for the plaintiff to survive summary judgment on\n\nthis record, she must show that, as a legal matter, the creation\n\nand   perpetuation   of    a   hostile     work   environment    itself   can\n\nconstitute a retaliatory adverse employment action.             She also must\n\nshow that, as a factual matter, her coworkers' actions furnished a\n\nsufficient   basis   to    ground   a    finding    that   a    hostile   work\n\nenvironment actually existed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f           As to the legal point, the plaintiff maintains that a\n\nhostile work environment may constitute an adverse employment\n\naction for purposes of both Title VII and chapter 151B.           The city\n\ndemurs.    It notes that the plaintiff has not been cashiered,\n\ndemoted,   denied    promotion,   stripped    of   meaningful   duties,   or\n\notherwise materially disadvantaged in the terms and conditions of\n\nher employment.     Thus, the city argues, she cannot be said to have\n\nsuffered an adverse employment action.\n\n           This     precise   question    —   whether   a   hostile   work\n\nenvironment can constitute a retaliatory adverse employment action\n\n— has never been fully addressed either by this court (with regard\n\nto Title VII) or by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (with\n\nregard to chapter 151B).      We look at the federal and state claims\n\nseparately.\n\n           1. Title VII. The weight of authority supports the view\n\nthat, under Title VII, the creation and perpetuation of a hostile\n\nwork environment can comprise a retaliatory adverse employment\n\naction under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).           See, e.g., Von Gunten v.\n\nMaryland, 243 F.3d 858, 864-65 (4th Cir. 2001); Ray v. Henderson,\n\n217 F.3d 1234, 1244-45 (9th Cir. 2000); Morris, 201 F.3d at 791;\n\nRichardson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. Serv., 180 F.3d 426, 446\n\n(2d Cir. 1999); Gunnell v. Utah Valley State Coll., 152 F.3d 1253,\n\n1264 (10th Cir. 1998); Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d\n\n1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998); Knox v. Indiana, 93 F.3d 1327, 1334-35\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f(7th Cir. 1996).        That view has engendered a circuit split.              The\n\nFifth Circuit has held that a hostile work environment cannot\n\nconstitute     a    retaliatory     adverse      employment    action;   instead,\n\nretaliation requires an \"ultimate employment decision . . . such as\n\nhiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\"\n\nMattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir. 1997);\n\nsee also id. at 709.        The Eighth Circuit also requires an \"ultimate\n\nemployment decision,\" Ledergerber v. Stangler, 122 F.3d 1142, 1144\n\n(8th Cir. 1997), but defines that term somewhat more elastically,\n\nsee, e.g., Scusa v. Nestle U.S.A. Co., 181 F.3d 958, 968-69 (8th\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n           Although         this   court   has    never     fully   analyzed   the\n\nquestion, our case law tilts noticeably toward the majority view.\n\nThe pertinent decisions form a totem pole.                At the base of the pole\n\nis Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13 (1st Cir. 1994) (per\n\ncuriam), where, in dictum, we cited a treatise for the proposition\n\nthat \"toleration of harassment by other employees\" might amount to\n\nan adverse employment action. Id. at 15-16 (citing 3 Arthur Larson\n\n& Lex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination § 87.20 (1994)).                    That\n\nled   to   a       series    of    epibolies:        in    Hernandez-Torres      v.\n\nIntercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998), we\n\nparaphrased the Wyatt dictum; in White v. New Hampshire Department\n\nof Corrections, 221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2000), we noted the\n\nHernandez-Torres paraphrase with approbation; in Marrero v. Goya of\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fPuerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 26 (1st Cir. 2002), we approvingly\n\ncited     White's    reference;       and    in    Che    v.   Massachusetts          Bay\n\nTransportation Authority, 342 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir. 2003), we made\n\na bow in the direction of Marrero.                  This totem pole is highly\n\nsuggestive.       Today, we cap it off and hold explicitly that a\n\nhostile work environment, tolerated by the employer, is cognizable\n\nas a retalitory adverse employment action for purposes of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§     2000e-3(a).         This   means      that   workplace         harassment,       if\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive, may in and of itself constitute\n\nan adverse employment action sufficient to satisfy the second prong\n\nof the prima facie case for Title VII retaliation cases.\n\n               This conclusion is compelled by the statutory text and\n\ncomports with congressional intent.                The operative provision of\n\nTitle VII makes it unlawful \"to discriminate against any individual\n\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\n\nof employment, because of such individual's . . . sex.\"                     42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1).          Given Congress's intention \"to strike at the\n\nentire    spectrum    of    disparate       treatment     of   men    and   women      in\n\nemployment,       which    includes      requiring       people      to   work   in     a\n\ndiscriminatorily hostile or abusive environment,\" Harris, 510 U.S.\n\nat 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), it makes\n\nsense to construe the qualifier (regarding \"compensation, terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment\") broadly.                    On that basis,\n\nthe     verb   \"discriminate,\"      as      used   in    section      2000e-2(a)(1),\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\flogically     includes      subjecting       a    person      to   a   hostile     work\n\nenvironment.       See Morris, 201 F.3d at 791-92.\n\n            We move next to Title VII's anti-retaliation provision.\n\nThat provision directs an employer not to discriminate against any\n\nemployee \"because [the employee] has made a charge, testified,\n\nassisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation,\n\nproceeding, or hearing under [Title VII].\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\nHere, the term \"discriminate\" appears without the qualifier.                          A\n\nfamiliar canon of construction teaches that \"[a] term appearing in\n\nseveral places in a statutory text is generally read the same way\n\neach time it appears.\"           Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 143\n\n(1994).      We    apply    that    canon    here.      The    result:      the    verb\n\n\"discriminate\" in the anti-retaliation clause includes subjecting\n\na person to a hostile work environment.                 See Morris, 201 F.3d at\n\n792; see also Knox, 93 F.3d at 1334 (\"Nothing indicates why . . .\n\nretaliating       against    a     complainant     by   permitting       her     fellow\n\nemployees to punish her for invoking her rights under Title VII .\n\n. . does not fall within the statute.\").\n\n            Our interpretation of the statutory text is shared by the\n\nEEOC,     which    finds    the     lack    of    any   qualifier      on   the    term\n\n\"discriminate\" in the anti-retaliation context to evince a purpose\n\nto \"prohibit any discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter\n\nprotected activity.\"         EEOC Compl. Man. (CCH) ¶ 8005, § 8-II.D.3\n\n(2004). This is important because an administrative interpretation\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fof a federal statute by the agency charged with its enforcement,\n\nwhile not controlling upon the courts, constitutes an informed\n\njudgment to which some deference ordinarily is due.3               See Meritor\n\nSav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986).\n\n           If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — this\n\ncapacious reading of section 2000e-3(a) is consonant with its\n\npurpose of \"[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial\n\nmechanisms.\"    Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).\n\nHarassment by coworkers as a punishment for undertaking protected\n\nactivity is a paradigmatic example of adverse treatment spurred by\n\nretaliatory    motives   and,    as    such,   is   likely    to    deter    the\n\ncomplaining party (or others) from engaging in protected activity.\n\nRay, 217 F.3d at 1245; Wideman, 141 F.3d at 1456.                  Reading the\n\nstatute   to   provide   a   remedy    for   retaliatory     harassment     that\n\nexpresses itself in the form of a hostile work environment thus\n\nfurthers the goal of ensuring access to the statute's remedial\n\nmechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We emphasize that we refer here only to Skidmore deference,\nnot Chevron deference. Compare Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S.\n134, 140 (1944), with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). After all, statements\nin the EEOC's Compliance Manual are neither adjudicatory nor the\nproduct of notice-and-comment rulemaking.    See United States v.\nCity of New York, 359 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2004); cf. Navarro v.\nPfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 99 (1st Cir. 2001).          They are,\ntherefore, entitled to deference only to the extent that they have\nthe power to persuade. See Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S.\n576, 587 (2000).\n\n                                      -24-\n\f           2. Chapter 151B. As for the state-law claim, we believe\n\nthat, were the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) squarely\n\npresented with the question, it would find a retaliatory hostile\n\nwork environment to be an adverse employment action cognizable\n\nunder chapter 151B, § 4(4).            Several factors enter into this\n\ndetermination.\n\n           First and foremost, the statute's anti-discrimination and\n\nanti-retaliation provisions are very similar to the counterpart\n\nprovisions    contained   in   Title    VII.      Where    such   linguistic\n\nsimilarity exists, the SJC frequently looks to federal court\n\ninterpretations of Title VII for guidance.             See Wheatley v. AT&T\n\nCo., 636 N.E.2d 265, 268 (Mass. 1994) (\"It is our practice to apply\n\nFederal   case   law   construing    the     Federal    anti-discrimination\n\nstatutes in interpreting [chapter] 151B.\"); College-Town, Div. of\n\nInterco, Inc. v. MCAD, 508 N.E.2d 587, 591 (Mass. 1987) (describing\n\nfederal precedents as \"helpful\").           We are, therefore, confident\n\nthat the SJC, if confronted with this precise question, would quite\n\nlikely interpret the anti-retaliation provision of chapter 151B\n\nexactly as we have interpreted the counterpart provision of Title\n\nVII.\n\n             Second, to the extent that any ambiguity lurks in the\n\nstatutory language, Massachusetts law explicitly directs that the\n\nprovisions of chapter 151B \"shall be construed liberally for the\n\naccomplishment of its purposes.\"           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9.\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fAs with Title VII, the purpose of the anti-retaliation provision in\n\nchapter 151B is to allow parties to \"seek redress for allegations\n\nof discrimination without fear of retaliation for or interference\n\nwith the exercise of that right.\"               Sahli v. Bull HN Info. Sys.,\n\nInc., 774 N.E.2d 1085, 1090 (Mass. 2002).                 Construing chapter\n\n151B's text to protect complaining employees from retaliatory\n\nharassment that results in the creation and perpetuation of a\n\nhostile work environment advances that purpose.\n\n          Third, although the SJC has not spoken directly to the\n\nsubject, the Appeals Court has recognized a claim of retaliatory\n\nharassment based on a hostile work environment.             See Clifton, 815\n\nN.E.2d at 618, 624.           While this holding is not indisputably\n\nauthoritative — the highest court of a state is, after all, the\n\nfinal arbiter of state-law questions, Acadia Ins. Co. v. McNeil,\n\n116 F.3d 599, 604 (1st Cir. 1997) — the decision of an intermediate\n\nappellate court of the state generally constitutes a reliable piece\n\nof evidence.        See West v. ATCT Co., 311 U.S. 223, 237 (1940);\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir. 2001); Losacco v. F.D.\n\nRich Constr. Co., 992 F.2d 382, 384 (1st Cir. 1993).           This evidence\n\nseems all the more compelling in this case because the MCAD — whose\n\ndecisions construing chapter 151B are ceded some deference by the\n\nSJC, Cuddyer, 750 N.E.2d at 938 — has interpreted chapter 151B's\n\nanti-retaliation         language   to     include   retaliatory   harassment\n\nculminating    in    a   hostile    work   environment.     See MCAD   Sexual\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fHarassment in the Workplace Guidelines IX.B (2002) (\"An employer\n\ntakes adverse action under § 4(4) when it materially disadvantages\n\nthe complainant with regard to any of the terms or conditions of\n\nher employment.        The term 'adverse action' can encompass . . .\n\nhostile or abusive workplace treatment.\"); Wareing v. New Bedford\n\nSch. Dep't, No. 99-BEM-3363, 2004 WL 2361016, at *8 (MCAD Oct. 6,\n\n2004) (\"Retaliation may . . . take the form of hostile or abusive\n\nworkplace treatment.).\n\n           To say more on this topic would be to paint the lily.\n\nFor the reasons elucidated above, we hold that, under Massachusetts\n\nlaw as under Title VII, subjecting an employee to a hostile work\n\nenvironment in retaliation for protected activity constitutes an\n\nadverse   employment     action   (and,      thus,   triggers   the   statutory\n\nprophylaxis).\n\nD.   Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment:            Sufficiency of Proof.\n\n\n           We   have    established    that,    as   a   theoretical   matter,\n\nsubjecting a party to a hostile work environment in retaliation for\n\nprotected activity may be actionable under both Title VII and\n\nchapter 151B. That poses the question whether the evidence in this\n\ncase, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Garside,\n\n895 F.2d at 48, shows that a hostile work environment existed.              We\n\nturn to that question.\n\n           1.    Elements of the Cause of Action.                An allegedly\n\nretaliatory act must rise to some level of substantiality before it\n\n                                      -27-\n\fcan be actionable. Wideman, 141 F.3d at 1456; MacCormack v. Boston\n\nEdison Co., 672 N.E.2d 1, 7-8 (Mass. 1996).                   The hostile work\n\nenvironment    doctrine,   as   developed     in   the    anti-discrimination\n\njurisprudence of Title VII, embodies that prerequisite.\n\n             In order to prove a hostile work environment, a plaintiff\n\nmust show that she was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment\n\nthat   materially     altered    the     conditions      of   her   employment.\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 786. The harassment must be \"objectively and\n\nsubjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find\n\nhostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to\n\nbe so.\"   Id. at 787.      In determining whether a reasonable person\n\nwould find particular conduct hostile or abusive, a court must mull\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, including factors such as the\n\n\"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it\n\nis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive\n\nutterance;     and   whether    it     unreasonably      interferes   with   an\n\nemployee's work performance.\"          Id. at 787-88 (quoting Harris, 510\n\nU.S. at 23).    The thrust of this inquiry is to distinguish between\n\nthe ordinary, if occasionally unpleasant, vicissitudes of the\n\nworkplace and actual harassment.          Id. at 788.\n\n          This framework is readily transferable to the retaliatory\n\nharassment context.     On the one hand, if protected activity leads\n\nonly to commonplace indignities typical of the workplace (such as\n\ntepid jokes, teasing, or aloofness), a reasonable person would not\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fbe deterred from such activity.          After all, an employee reasonably\n\ncan expect to encounter such tribulations even if she eschews any\n\ninvolvement in protected activity.           On the other hand, severe or\n\npervasive harassment in retaliation for engaging in protected\n\nactivity threatens to deter due enforcement of the rights conferred\n\nby statutes such as Title VII and chapter 151B.\n\n            Along this continuum, rudeness or ostracism, standing\n\nalone, usually is not enough to support a hostile work environment\n\nclaim.    See Manatt v. Bank of Am., 339 F.3d 792, 803 (9th Cir.\n\n2003); Gagnon v. Sprint Corp., 284 F.3d 839, 850 (8th Cir. 2002);\n\ncf. Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 52\n\nn.12 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting, in related context, that \"social\n\nostracism alone is rarely actionable\").           The anti-discrimination\n\nlaws were not enacted to create or enforce a \"general civility\n\ncode.\"    Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80\n\n(1998).    So too the anti-retaliation laws.\n\n            2.     Applying the Requirements.         Having sketched the\n\ncontours of retaliatory hostile work environments in the Title VII\n\nand chapter 151B milieus, we reach the central question presented\n\nin this appeal:      viewing the totality of the circumstances in the\n\nlight    most    flattering   to   the   plaintiff,   is   the   evidence   of\n\nretaliatory harassment adequate to allow a reasonable jury to find\n\nthat she was confronted by a hostile work environment?\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f            At the outset, we take note of a unique difficulty posed\n\nby allegations of retaliatory harassment.         When dealing with\n\ndiscriminatory harassment (e.g., harassment based on gender, race,\n\nor the like), there is seldom, if ever, a defensible purpose behind\n\nthe injurious actions.   The only question is whether the bad acts,\n\ntaken in the aggregate, are sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nconstitute actionable harassment.      See, e.g., Cardenas v. Massey,\n\n269 F.3d 251, 261-62 (3d Cir. 2001); Johnson v. City of Fort Wayne,\n\n91 F.3d 922, 932 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n            Retaliatory harassment, however, requires a more nuanced\n\nanalysis.   The very act of filing a charge against a coworker will\n\ninvariably cause tension and result in a less agreeable workplace.\n\nVon Gunten, 243 F.3d at 870.    The target of the complaint likely\n\nwill have coworker-friends who come to his defense, while other\n\ncoworkers will seek to steer clear of trouble by avoiding both the\n\ncomplainant and the target.       Although admittedly a source of\n\nunpleasantness in the workplace, such behavior should not be seen\n\nas contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment.        Id.\n\nAfter all, there is nothing inherently wrong either with supporting\n\na friend or with striving to avoid controversy.          We think it\n\nfollows that those actions that are hurtful to a complainant only\n\nbecause coworkers do not take her side in a work-related dispute\n\nmay not be considered as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work\n\nenvironment.   It is only those actions, directed at a complainant,\n\n\n                                -30-\n\fthat stem from a retaliatory animus which may be factored into the\n\nhostile work environment calculus.\n\n            Even with these nuances in mind, we conclude that the\n\nevidence in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff,    would     permit   —   although     certainly    not    compel     —    a\n\nreasonable jury to find that the plaintiff was subjected to a\n\nretaliation-based hostile work environment.                   In reaching this\n\nconclusion, we take into account the relative ubiquity of the\n\nretaliatory       conduct,    its    severity,    its    natural     tendency        to\n\nhumiliate (and, on occasion, physically threaten) a reasonable\n\nperson, and its capacity to interfere with the plaintiff's work\n\nperformance.       See Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.\n\n            In    the   months   immediately      following    the    plaintiff's\n\ninitial   series       of   complaints    about   Ortiz's     actions,     she   was\n\nsubjected    to    a    steady   stream    of   abuse.      Much     of   this   was\n\nsignificant and was of a kind that courts historically have found\n\npersuasive as evidence of a hostile work environment.                      She was\n\nfalsely accused of misconduct (DiGirolamo levied a baseless charge\n\nagainst her in the tampon-throwing incident) — and the case law\n\nrecognizes that false accusations of misconduct can contribute to\n\nthe creation of a hostile work environment.              See Ray, 217 F.3d at\n\n1245; Aviles v. Cornell Forge Co., 183 F.3d 598, 606 (7th Cir.\n\n1999).    DiGirolamo also interfered with the plaintiff's working\n\nconditions by falsely informing her that she was required to take\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\fher dinner breaks alone — and \"work sabotage, exclusion, [and]\n\ndenial of support\" also may contribute to the creation of a hostile\n\nwork environment.        O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 730.            The harassing\n\ninsults directed at the plaintiff are likewise entitled to some\n\nweight in the decisional calculus.        See Bolden v. PRC Inc., 43 F.3d\n\n545, 551 (10th Cir. 1994) (noting that even infrequent harassing\n\ninsults   should    be   considered,    along   with   other   instances   of\n\nharassment).       So too the taunting of the plaintiff with the\n\ncollection on behalf of Ortiz.4         Marrero, 304 F.3d at 26 (finding\n\nthat taunting plaintiff in relation to her filing of an EEOC\n\ncomplaint was evidence of retaliatory harassment); cf. Oncale, 523\n\nU.S. at 80 (noting that open and direct hostility clearly based on\n\nprotected status is evidence of hostile work environment).\n\n            Gilardi's continued tormenting of the plaintiff is also\n\nrelevant.   Soon after the collection incident, Gilardi interfered\n\nwith the plaintiff's ability to work by leaving her out in the cold\n\n(literally, not figuratively).         This conduct may be seen as having\n\ncontributed to the creation of a hostile work environment.                 See\n\n\n     4\n      To be sure, the mere fact that coworkers collect money on\nbehalf of a person accused of discrimination is not actionable.\nSuch behavior falls outside the realm of conduct undertaken out of\nanimus toward a complainant and should not be considered for\npurposes of determining whether there was a hostile work\nenvironment. The fact that coworkers rubbed the plaintiff's nose\nin the collection is a horse of a different hue. If the incident\noccurred as the plaintiff suggests (an assumption that we must\nindulge at the summary judgment stage), it was a clear indication\nof open hostility directed at the plaintiff and would have\ndeleteriously affected her working conditions.\n\n                                   -32-\n\fGorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corr., 290 F.3d 466, 472 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nO'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 730.      Gilardi later placed the plaintiff at\n\nrisk of physical harm by coming close to striking her with a van;\n\nif   that   was   intentional   (and,   for   now,   we   must   credit   the\n\nplaintiff's averment that it was), it is a cogent indicator of an\n\nadverse change in the conditions of the plaintiff's employment.\n\nCf. White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 298 n.6 (4th Cir.\n\n2004) (noting that \"the presence of physical threats undeniably\n\nstrengthens a hostile work environment claim\"); Raniola v. Bratton,\n\n243 F.3d 610, 621 (2d Cir. 2001) (similar).          To cinch matters, the\n\nplaintiff offered evidence that these incidents contributed to\n\nphysical and psychological problems that required treatment, thus\n\nunderscoring the negative effect on her work performance.\n\n            Of course, no pat formula exists for determining with\n\ncertainty whether the sum of harassing workplace incidents rises to\n\nthe level of an actionable hostile work environment.             See Harris,\n\n510 U.S. at 22.    Such a determination requires the trier of fact to\n\nassess the matter on a case-by-case basis, weighing the totality of\n\nthe circumstances.     Lipsett v. Univ. of P.R., 864 F.2d 881, 898 &\n\nn.18 (1st Cir. 1988).     Our function is one of screening, that is,\n\nto determine whether, on particular facts, a reasonable jury could\n\nreach such a conclusion.        Rivera-Rodríguez v. Frito Lay Snacks\n\nCaribbean, 265 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir. 2001).          Taking the aggregate\n\nfacts of record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fbelieve that a jury rationally could find that the plaintiff was\n\nsubjected to a hostile work environment arising out of retaliation\n\nfor her complaint against a popular coworker.\n\n                       E.   The Liability Standard.\n\n           This conclusion takes us to the liability standard.            In\n\nimporting the hostile work environment doctrine into the anti-\n\nretaliation context, courts are left to draw the standards for\n\nemployer   liability    from   the   case   law    involving   hostile   work\n\nenvironments in the anti-discrimination context. The Supreme Court\n\nhas divided the universe of employer liability along a line that\n\nseparates supervisors from non-supervisors.              When a supervisor\n\ncreates a hostile work environment, the employer is vicariously\n\nliable for it, subject, however, to a possible affirmative defense.\n\nSee Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998);\n\nFaragher, 524 U.S. at 807-08.\n\n           This defense, familiarly known as the Faragher/Ellerth\n\ndefense,   consists of two elements which, if proven, permit the\n\nemployer to avoid liability. First, the employer must show that it\n\n\"exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly\" the\n\nharassment.   Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 765.           Second, the employer must\n\nshow that the employee \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of\n\nany preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer\n\nor to avoid harm otherwise.\"         Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\f            As     with     Title    VII,     chapter     151B      makes     employers\n\nvicariously       liable    for     hostile    work     environments        created    by\n\nsupervisors.       College-Town, 508 N.E.2d at 592.                Unlike Title VII,\n\nhowever, chapter 151B does not afford employers any affirmative\n\ndefenses to liability.              Based on the legislative mandate that\n\nchapter    151B    must     be    construed       liberally   to     effectuate       its\n\npurposes, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 9, the SJC has endorsed\n\na   rule   that    holds    employers        strictly    liable     for     supervisory\n\nharassment.       See College-Town, 508 N.E.2d at 591-94 (rejecting a\n\n\"reasonable       care\"    standard     as    a    defense    to    a   hostile      work\n\nenvironment claim); see also Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co., 337 F.3d\n\n17, 28 n.3 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that the Faragher/Ellerth\n\ndefense does not apply to chapter 151B actions).                           Because the\n\nreasoning of College-Town belies any meaningful distinction between\n\ndiscriminatory       harassment        and     retaliatory         harassment       where\n\nsupervisors are concerned, we conclude that no Faragher/Ellerth\n\ntype of affirmative defense is available under chapter 151B to an\n\nemployer    whose    supervisors       create      a   retaliatory        hostile   work\n\nenvironment.\n\n            When coworkers, rather than supervisors, are responsible\n\nfor the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment,\n\nTitle VII and chapter 151B seem essentially coterminous as they\n\nrelate to employer liability.                Notwithstanding the absence of a\n\ncontrolling       Supreme    Court    precedent,        several     federal     courts,\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\fincluding this court, have held that, in such situations, an\n\nemployer can only be liable if the harassment is causally connected\n\nto some negligence on the employer's part.            See, e.g., Wyninger v.\n\nNew   Venture    Gear,   Inc.,    361   F.3d   965,   976    (7th    Cir.   2004);\n\nOcheltree v. Scollon Prods., Inc., 335 F.3d 325, 333-34 (4th Cir.\n\n2003); Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 401 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   Typically, this involves a showing that the employer knew\n\nor should have known about the harassment, yet failed to take\n\nprompt   action    to    stop    it.     See   Crowley,     303     F.3d   at   401.\n\nSimilarly, under chapter 151B, employer liability for coworker\n\nharassment requires a showing that the employer knew or should have\n\nknown about the harassment, yet failed to halt it.                     Messina v.\n\nAraserve, Inc., 906 F. Supp. 34, 37-38 (D. Mass. 1995) (discussing\n\nMassachusetts law); College-Town, 508 N.E.2d at 593.\n\n           At the summary judgment stage, these determinations are\n\ncomplicated.      The question of whether an employee is a supervisor\n\nin the relevant sense is itself factual in nature.                   Hrobowski v.\n\nWorthington Steel Co., 358 F.3d 473, 478 (7th Cir. 2004).                       Here,\n\nthe lower court found only coworker harassment; it declared that\n\nthe evidence showed that the retaliation had been undertaken by\n\n\"subordinate officials, none of whom had control over terms and\n\nconditions of [the plaintiff's] employment.\"\n\n           The     district     court's    skepticism       about    the    claimed\n\nsupervisory status of some of the harassers seems well-founded.\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fThe   key   to   determining   supervisory   status   is   the   degree   of\n\nauthority possessed by the putative supervisor.            Joens v. John\n\nMorrell & Co., 354 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2004); Parkins v. Civil\n\nConstructors of Ill., Inc., 163 F.3d 1027, 1033 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\nThus, courts must distinguish \"employees who are supervisors merely\n\nas a function of nomenclature from those who are entrusted with\n\nactual supervisory powers.\"        Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1033; accord\n\nMikels v. City of Durham, 183 F.3d 323, 334 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\nHaving in mind both common law agency principles and the purposes\n\nof the anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation laws, we agree with\n\nthe Seventh Circuit that \"the essence of supervisory status is the\n\nauthority to affect the terms and conditions of the victim's\n\nemployment.\" Parkins, 163 F.3d at 1034. This authority \"primarily\n\nconsists of the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or\n\ndiscipline an employee.\"       Id. at 1034.    Without some modicum of\n\nthis authority, a harasser cannot qualify as a supervisor for\n\npurposes of imputing vicarious liability to the employer in a Title\n\nVII case, but, rather, should be regarded as an ordinary coworker.5\n\nSee id. at 1033-34.     We think that the same standard applies under\n\nchapter 151B.     See College-Town, 508 N.E.2d at 593 (observing that\n\n\n      5\n      The Second Circuit takes a somewhat broader view. That court\nconsiders a supervisor to be someone who has actual authority to\ndirect an employee's work-related tasks in a way that could\nincrease her workload or saddle her with less desirable tasks.\nMack v. Otis Elev. Co., 326 F.3d 116, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2003). Even\nwere we to adopt this less demanding test, the nominal supervisors\nhere would not qualify as supervisors in fact.\n\n                                   -37-\n\fthe   power    wielded       by    a   harassing    supervisor      may    range   from\n\n\"discharge to assignment of work, particularly exacting scrutiny,\n\nor refusal to protect the employee from coworker harassment\").\n\n              In this case, the plaintiff has not presented facts\n\nsufficient to show that she was harassed at the hands of persons\n\nwho qualify         as    supervisors.       The   deposition    of   Irene     Landry\n\nprovides the clearest evidence of the organizational structure of\n\nthe workplace.           The parking enforcement officers are on the lowest\n\nrung of the ladder.           On the next rung are the shift supervisors,\n\nwho drive the parking enforcement officers to their assigned routes\n\nand pick them up.             The third rung is occupied by more senior\n\nsupervisors, (each of whom holds the title \"senior supervisor II\").\n\nThe functions of these individuals include dealing with personnel\n\nproblems. During the time in question, Landry held the position of\n\nsenior supervisor II.              She reported to Moccia, a higher-level\n\nofficial who         held    the   title    of    senior   supervisor      of   parking\n\nenforcement.         Moccia had authority to handle a wide variety of\n\nemployee issues and complaints.\n\n              The         plaintiff        uses      the     word         \"supervisor\"\n\nindiscriminately, referring to people on the second, third, and\n\nfourth rungs as \"supervisors\" and making no distinctions among\n\nthem.   That approach elevates nomenclature over actual authority.\n\nWhen we shift the focus to those persons whose actual authority\n\n\n\n\n                                           -38-\n\fmade them supervisors in the relevant sense, a different picture\n\nemerges.\n\n            Landry and Moccia each appear to have possessed the\n\nrequisite   authority,     but   neither    of   them   were   guilty   of   any\n\nretaliatory harassment.       The only two \"supervisors\" whose actions\n\nrationally can be said to have contributed to the hostile work\n\nenvironment are Gilardi and DiGirolamo.          Gilardi was a second-rung\n\nshift supervisor, and DiGirolamo's level of authority seems no\n\ngreater (the record only permits us to speculate on this point, and\n\nthe lack of proof counts against the plaintiff). The plaintiff has\n\npresented us with no evidence that either woman had the power to\n\nterminate, discipline, or otherwise affect the terms and conditions\n\nof her employment.         In the absence of such evidence, the city\n\ncannot be held vicariously responsible for their harassment.\n\n            The plaintiff's claim thus reduces to one of coworker\n\nharassment.       The viability of that claim depends on whether there\n\nis sufficient evidence to permit a finding that the employer knew\n\nor should have known about the hostile work environment, yet failed\n\nto   stop   it.      We   conclude   that   sufficient     evidence     exists.\n\nPlaintiff complained of the harassment to two senior supervisors\n\n(Landry and Moccia).        Landry did not deal with the plaintiff's\n\ncomplaints at all and Moccia, rather than rectifying the situation,\n\nspeculated that the harassment would likely become \"ten times\n\nworse\" with the plaintiff's recent shift change.                Moreover, the\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fdeputy commissioner was aware of the harassment, but did nothing to\n\ndispel it.      Since Landry, Moccia, and the deputy commissioner were\n\nappropriate recipients of the plaintiff's complaints, there is\n\nenough evidence to allow a finding of actual notice on the city's\n\npart.       See Crowley, 303 F.3d at 403; Breda v. Wolf Camera & Video,\n\n222 F.3d 886, 889 (11th Cir. 2000).\n\n               The    city's    only   rejoinder    is   that    the   supervisors\n\nresponded to the plaintiff's allegations in an appropriate manner.\n\nAt best, this presents a factual dispute that is not amenable to\n\nresolution       on       summary   judgment.      Consequently,       there   is   a\n\ntrialworthy issue as to whether the city was negligent in not\n\nputting a stop to the harassment.\n\n                     F.    Sexual Harassment Under Title VII.\n\n               This brings us to the plaintiff's claim that Ortiz's\n\nassault subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her\n\nsex.6       Even if the assault was sufficient, in and of itself, to\n\ncreate a hostile work environment — a proposition that we regard as\n\nhighly dubious — the plaintiff cannot prevail.                  Though she refers\n\nto Ortiz as her \"supervisor,\" the record contains a paucity of\n\nevidence about his job description and authority.                 That which does\n\nappear indicates that Ortiz, like Gilardi, was merely a second-rung\n\nshift supervisor.           As the plaintiff provided no evidence that such\n\n\n        6\n      This claim is, of course, limited to Title VII. Insofar as\nit might have been brought under chapter 151B, it is time-barred.\nSee supra Part II(B).\n\n                                         -40-\n\fan employee had the authority to hire, fire, or otherwise dictate\n\nthe terms and conditions of employment, vicarious liability is off\n\nthe table.       It follows that the plaintiff can survive summary\n\njudgment only if she can show that a rational jury could find the\n\ncity    negligent      because   it   knew    or   should    have   known    of   the\n\nharassment yet failed to take prompt action to stop it.                     Crowley,\n\n303 F.3d at 401.\n\n            The plaintiff cannot carry this burden.                   There is no\n\nevidence of any prior misconduct on Ortiz's part.                   The first that\n\nthe city knew (or could have known) about his assaultive demeanor\n\nwas when it received the initial report of the attack.                            The\n\nundisputed evidence shows that a mere seven days elapsed between\n\nthe time of the assault and the commencement of disciplinary\n\nproceedings (which began with Ortiz's immediate suspension and\n\nculminated      in    his   discharge).       Between   the    assault      and   the\n\nsuspension, the plaintiff says that she \"encountered\" Ortiz in the\n\nworkplace, but there is no evidence that she was forced to work\n\nwith him or was exposed to further harassment by him.                       While we\n\nleave    open        the    possibility      that,   under     certain       extreme\n\ncircumstances, a delay of seven days in separating a harasser and\n\nhis victim might evince negligence, there is nothing to indicate\n\nthat the city acted here in a dilatory manner.                 On this record, a\n\nrational jury could only conclude that, as to the Title VII sexual\n\nharassment claim, the city acted in a professional and appropriate\n\n\n                                       -41-\n\fmanner to resolve the problem.     No more was exigible.   See, e.g.,\n\nReed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc., 333 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(noting that investigation of sexual assault by employer, quickly\n\nleading to malefactor's termination, indicates reasonable care on\n\nbehalf of employer).\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.     One of the main\n\npurposes of Title VII is to encourage proactive resolution of\n\nworkplace harassment.     We would undermine that purpose were we to\n\nsubject the city to sexual harassment liability despite its prompt\n\nand effective action in investigating the incident and removing the\n\nperpetrator from the workplace.\n\nIII.     CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. To recapitulate, we hold that the\n\nplaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to survive summary\n\njudgment on her retaliatory harassment claims under Title VII and\n\nchapter 151B.      As to her sexual harassment claims, however, we\n\nreach a different conclusion.      Her chapter 151B claim is time-\n\nbarred and her Title VII claim is foreclosed by her failure to\n\npresent a trialworthy issue about whether the city was negligent in\n\nits handling of the Ortiz situation.\n\n\n\n             Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.     No\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -42-\n\f",

Faced with a plethora of issues, the district court entered summary judgment for the defendant. On appeal, we must sort out which of the plaintiff's claims are timely; address whether her timeous claims for retaliatory harassment, cast in the form of a hostile work environment, are legally cognizable and sufficiently supported; grapple with her one timely claim of sexual harassment, also cast in the form of a hostile work environment; and discuss various aspects of the case relating to employer liability. After careful consideration of these variegated issues, we conclude (i) that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the retaliation claims, as those claims are timely, cognizable, and supported by sufficient evidence, but (ii) that the district court correctly entered summary judgment on the sexual harassment claims: despite the attempt to recast them in a hostile work environment format, the state-law claim is time-barred and its federal analogue runs afoul of an inexpugnable affirmative defense &#8212; the employer's swift, effective, and non-negligent response to the underlying incident.

After first announcing his intentions, Ortiz forcibly unhooked the plaintiff's brassiere, ripped it from her body, hung it on the van's outside mirror, and bellowed a crude sexual remark to a fellow employee on the street. Over the next few days, the plaintiff reported the incident to a number of municipal hierarchs. They promptly investigated the matter, suspended Ortiz a week after the incident, and ultimately cashiered him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after Ortiz's banishment, coworkers began to subject the plaintiff to sundry indignities, or, in the words of the employees themselves, to \"bust [ ] her chops.\" The record contains evidence of the following incidents (the plaintiff recounts others, but we have omitted those that lack any conceivable probative value):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On October 5, 1999, Barbara DiGirolamo accused the plaintiff of throwing a tampon at a coworker.

The plaintiff complained to a senior supervisor, Irene Landry, who took no action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On December 8, 1999, a new employee told the plaintiff that although he had no problem with her, other coworkers had advised him to \"stay away\" because she was \"trouble.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On December 9, 1999, the entire department ostracized the plaintiff during a holiday party.

The collection for Ortiz was in full flower. Coworkers waved the money they had amassed in the plaintiff's face, crowing \"look how much money we have collected!\" One of the plaintiff's superiors, Kathy O'Brien, advised her to \"go to the office\" about the harassment. There is no evidence, however, that O'Brien intervened to stop the ongoing conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On December 30, 1999, the plaintiff met with a high-level supervisor, Kathleen Moccia. She described the toll that the harassment was taking on her and asked Moccia why management was tolerating the harassment. Moccia did not intervene. Moreover, she stated that she did not think that the harassment would stop; rather, she forecast that it would become \"ten times worse\" with the plaintiff's recent shift change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; In January of 2000, a tow truck driver told the plaintiff that Gilardi had begun circulating a petition urging management to dismiss the plaintiff, but that he had refused to sign it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; During a snowstorm that month, Gilardi refused to pick up the plaintiff from her route.

Two examples follow:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; In February of 2001, the plaintiff approached a van that was used to transport parking enforcement officers to their posts. Gilardi was at the wheel. When she saw the plaintiff approach, she closed the van's door, ignored the plaintiff's tapping on the window, and drove away, nearly striking the plaintiff. The plaintiff reported the incident and Gilardi admitted that she had seen the plaintiff but nonetheless had pulled away. There is no evidence that Gilardi was disciplined for this conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; In March of 2001, Gilardi told a coworker, in reference to Ortiz's firing, that the plaintiff's \"payday\" was drawing near.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff alleges that, as a result of this steady stream of what she characterizes as retaliatory harassment, she lost weight, experienced nightmares and panic attacks, became anxious at work, and was forced to seek medical care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 2002, the plaintiff requested withdrawal of her administrative complaint in order to pave the way for the institution of suit. The MCAD obliged and the plaintiff commenced a civil action against the city in a Massachusetts state court. Her complaint, filed on November 1, 2002, charged the city with violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4. On April 25, 2003, the plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. One month later, she amended her state court complaint to include Title VII claims. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2, e-3. At that point, the city removed the case to the federal district court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the city moved for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, arguing (i) that most of the plaintiff's claims under chapter 151B were time-barred; (ii) that those which remained were not actionable; (iii) that as to the federal retaliation claims, the evidence, even when interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, did not reveal any actionable conduct; and (iv) that the city could not be held liable for Ortiz's behavior because it had taken prompt and effective remedial action. The plaintiff opposed the motion. Ruling ore sponte, the district court granted summary judgment for the city. The court concluded that there was no timely sexual harassment claim under chapter 151B and that the city's response to the Ortiz incident foreclosed any sexual harassment claim under Title VII. As to the retaliation claims, the court acknowledged that, viewing the proof in the requisite light, the plaintiff had been subjected to a \"series of distasteful, unpleasant, non-empathetic acts ... by a series of subordinate officials.\" Nevertheless, the court concluded that the retaliation claims must fail because none of the individual incidents was an \"adverse employment action [ ]\" that bore directly upon the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's suit implicates both federal and state anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation statutes. It requires us to confront &#8212; and resolve &#8212; two questions of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As framed, all of the plaintiff's claims are dependent upon her allegation that the city tolerated a hostile work environment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In general, a plaintiff may recover on such a theory when \"the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.\" <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Muzzy v. Cahillane Motors, Inc.,</i> 434 Mass. 409, 749 N.E.2d 691, 694 (2001). The plaintiff's hostile work environment claims are of two types.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most hostile work environments are bred from an ongoing series of harassing incidents. The plaintiff's claim of a hostile work environment, based singularly upon Ortiz's assault, is not of this ilk. However, a single act of harassment may, if egregious enough, suffice to evince a hostile work environment. <i>See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,</i> 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (Title VII); <i>Gnerre v. MCAD,</i> 402 Mass. 502, 524 N.E.2d 84, 88-89 (1988) (chapter 151B). The plaintiff's claims of a retaliatory hostile work environment are more stereotypical. These claims are based upon the pervasive retaliation that the plaintiff allegedly experienced after complaining about Ortiz's assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this brief preface, we proceed to explicate the summary judgment standard and then examine the anatomy of the plaintiff's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Summary Judgment Standard.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An order granting summary judgment engenders de novo review. <i>Serapion v. Martinez,</i> 119 F.3d 982, 987 (1st Cir.1997). In conducting that review, we must scrutinize the evidence in the light most agreeable to the nonmoving party, giving that party the benefit of any and all reasonable inferences. <i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> 391 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2004). For her part, the nonmovant bears \"the burden of producing specific facts sufficient to deflect the swing of the summary judgment scythe.\" <i>Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co.,</i> 335 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.2003). Those facts, typically set forth in affidavits, depositions, and the like, must have evidentiary value; as a rule, \"[e]vidence that is inadmissible at trial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may not be considered on summary judgment.\" <i>Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1998); <i>accord Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the facts presented by the plaintiff, as recounted above, satisfy this standard. In large part, the chronicled events are within the plaintiff's personal knowledge. The insults and taunting that the plaintiff recounts do not create hearsay problems; those statements are not offered for their truth, but, rather, to show that the words were spoken (and, thus, contributed to the hostile work environment). They are, therefore, admissible. <i>See Mota v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr.,</i> 261 F.3d 512, 526 n. 46 (5th Cir.2001). The statements made by supervisors are admissible as non-hearsay statements of the defendant's agents made within the scope of their employment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, however, that two statements give us pause. The first is a statement from an unnamed coworker that other employees told him to \"stay away\" from the plaintiff as she was \"trouble.\" Insofar as the plaintiff is attempting to introduce this statement as evidence of <i>other</i> coworkers' harassing behavior, it is hearsay; its probative value ultimately depends on the truth of the declarant's own unsworn out-of-court utterance. It is, therefore, inadmissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801, 802; <i>see also Vazquez,</i> 134 F.3d at 34. A similar problem exists with respect to the plaintiff's assertion that a tow truck driver said that Gilardi had been circulating a petition to have the plaintiff fired. Consequently, we cannot consider the content of either statement in analyzing the plaintiff's claims. <i>See LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> 98 F.3d 659, 663 (1st Cir.1996) (branding incompetent on summary judgment portions of a party's affidavit recounting inadmissible hearsay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Timeliness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question that we must answer pertains to timeliness. In order to prosecute a harassment claim under either Massachusetts or federal law, an aggrieved party must first file a timely administrative complaint. The time parameters for these filings differ. In 1999, chapter 151B mandated filing with the MCAD within six months of the alleged violation. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 5 (1989) (amended 2002). By contrast, the EEOC filing had to occur within 300 days of the date of the alleged violation. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1); <i>see also Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners,</i> 921 F.2d 396, 399 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.1990) (discussing timely filing of charges of discrimination with the EEOC in \"deferral\" states, i.e., states such as Massachusetts, which have their own civil rights statute and agency). There is no dispute that the plaintiff met these administrative deadlines; the earliest incident of alleged harassment occurred on September 11, 1999, and the plaintiff's administrative complaint was filed with both agencies on March 6, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claimant who wishes to sue under chapter 151B must allow a waiting period to pass, file her suit, and notify the MCAD (which is then required to dismiss the administrative proceeding). Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 9. This civil suit must be instituted no later than three years after the occurrence of the alleged violation. <i>See id.</i> The federal prototype is different. A Title VII claimant may sue only after the EEOC issues a right-to-sue letter. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1). Once such a letter is received, the claimant must file her suit within ninety days. <i>Id.</i> The fact that an analogous state statute of limitations has expired with respect to a parallel state harassment action does not create a temporal bar to a Title VII suit. <i>See Burgh v. Borough Council,</i> 251 F.3d 465, 473 (3d Cir.2001); <i>Kirk v. Rockwell Int'l Corp.,</i> 578 F.2d 814, 819 (9th Cir.1978); <i>Draper v. U.S. Pipe &amp; Foundry Co.,</i> 527 F.2d 515, 522 (6th Cir.1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff's Title VII claims are unquestionably timely: she received a right-to-sue letter on April 25, 2003 and added her Title VII claims to her pending suit on May 19, 2003. The situation is more tenebrous with regard to the chapter 151B claims. The plaintiff first brought suit on these claims on November 1, 2002. Based on the three-year statute of limitations applicable to chapter 151B actions, this would seem to foreclose recovery for any incidents that occurred prior to November 1, 1999, including the original sexual harassment and several of the instances of alleged retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff offers a theory as to why these claims nonetheless are timely. After reviewing her thesis, we conclude that her state-law claims based on the Ortiz imbroglio are barred but that her retaliation claims are not. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law recognizes that \"some claims of discrimination involve a series of related events that have to be viewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and impact.\" <i>Cuddyer v. Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.,</i> 434 Mass. 521, 750 N.E.2d 928, 936 (2001). Under this continuing violation doctrine, a plaintiff who ordinarily would be unable to recover damages for discrete acts of discrimination falling outside the limitations period may avoid that bar if those acts are shown to be part of a pattern of discrimination anchored by acts that occurred within the limitations period. <i>Id.</i> at 936-37. Hostile environment claims, by their nature, often fall within this rubric. <i>See id.</i> at 937; <i>Clifton v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth.,</i> 62 Mass.App.Ct. 164, 815 N.E.2d 614, 624 (2004). In such situations, however, the anchoring event must \"substantially relate[ ] to earlier incidents of abuse and substantially contribute[ ] to the continuation of a hostile work environment.\" <i>Cuddyer,</i> 750 N.E.2d at 938.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application of the continuing violation doctrine sometimes has the effect of expanding the three-year filing deadline for suits under chapter 151B. <i>See, e.g., Clifton,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 620-21; <i>Carter v. Comm'r of Corr.,</i> 43 Mass.App.Ct. 212, 681 N.E.2d 1255, 1261-62 (1997). We thus confront the question of whether the facts in this case, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, make out a continuing violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, we think that reasonable jurors could find that the distasteful and unpleasant actions undertaken by the plaintiff's coworkers before and after November 1, 1999 were part of a pattern of retaliation. For one thing, the harassment began soon after the plaintiff lodged her initial complaint about Ortiz's boorishness and surfaced most frequently in the first few months after Ortiz was dismissed. When harassment follows hard on the heels of protected activity, the timing often is strongly suggestive of retaliation. <i>See Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 846 F.2d 103, 110 (1st Cir.1988); <i>Mole v. Univ. of Mass.,</i> 442 Mass. 582, 814 N.E.2d 329, 341 (2004). For another thing, the harassment itself offered circumstantial evidence of causation; coworkers referred to the plaintiff as a \"rat\" (a term that connotes an informer or snitch), lamented the firing of their \"good supervisor,\" and took up a collection for his benefit. Even as late as 2001, Gilardi committed an act of harassment and, shortly thereafter, made reference to the plaintiff's upcoming \"payday.\" Up to that point, we believe that reasonable jurors could deem the listed incidents to comprise a pattern of retaliatory harassment. Since this pattern includes events within and without the limitations period, we are free to use incidents from both periods in deciding whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of a hostile work environment under chapter 151B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we find unpersuasive the plaintiff's labored effort to include Ortiz's solitary act of sexual harassment as part of the pattern of subsequent retaliatory acts. This attempted agglomeration relies heavily, but mistakenly, upon the MCAD's decision in <i>Muise v. Credit Exch.,</i> 17 M.D.L.R. 1684 (MCAD 1995), a case in which the agency said that timely incidents of retaliation may anchor an untimely incident of sexual harassment if \"the charge of retaliation is inextricably related to the original charge of sexual harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1690. The plaintiff overlooks that in order to invoke this doctrine, a claimant must show at a bare minimum a series of discriminatory acts that emanate from the same discriminatory animus. <i>See Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,</i> 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also Morrisey v. Holiday Inn,</i> 25 M.D.L.R. 74, 86 n. 12 (MCAD 2003) (citing <i>Provencher</i>). We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an individual sexually harasses a victim and then engages in non-sexual retaliatory harassment, the sexual and non-sexual harassment arguably may be part and parcel of the same violation. <i>Cf. O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729 (noting that, in such circumstances, the non-sexual harassment is still charged with the original animus). <i>But cf. Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court,</i> 201 F.3d 784, 790-91 (6th Cir.2000) (refusing to aggregate sexual harassment and non-sexual retaliatory harassment undertaken by a single supervisor). That was the fact pattern in <i>Muise,</i> 17 M.D.L.R. at 1686-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of cases are not cut from this seamless cloth. Even when retaliation is derivative of a particular act of harassment, it normally does not stem from the same animus. Most often, retaliation is a distinct and independent act of discrimination, motivated by a discrete intention to punish a person who has rocked the boat by complaining about an unlawful employment practice. <i>See, e.g., Ruffino v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 908 F.Supp. 1019, 1040 (D.Mass.1995); <i>Tinkham v. Flatley Co.,</i> No. 98-BEM-0437, 2004 WL 1746070, at *12 (MCAD July 7, 2004) (quoting <i>Ruffino</i>). That is a different animus than the sexual animus that drove the original harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case aptly illustrates the disparity of motives. Ortiz's attack was a one-time incident of sexual harassment. By contrast, the retaliatory harassment consisted of a series of discrete acts orchestrated by a cohort of different individuals (not including Ortiz) and occurring over a period of many months (beginning only after Ortiz was suspended). Of critical importance, nothing in the record indicates that these retaliatory acts were undertaken for reasons related to the plaintiff's gender. As such, the sexual harassment and retaliatory harassment in this case must be viewed for what they are: two separate and independent harms. <i>See Goguen v. Quality Plan Adm'rs,</i> 11 Mass.L.Rptr. 288, 2000 WL 282485, at *4 (Mass.Super.2000) (holding that sexual harassment by one person and subsequent retaliation by another are not sufficiently related to add up to a single continuing violation); <i>cf. Sitar v. Ind. Dep't. of Transp.,</i> 344 F.3d 720, 726 (7th Cir.2003) (noting generally that \"retaliation ... and sexual harassment charges are not `like or reasonably related' to one another to permit an EEOC charge of one type of wrong to support a subsequent civil suit for another\"). The plaintiff cannot rely on the second to revive the first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For much the same reason, we decline the plaintiff's invitation to treat her case as one involving a \"mixed-motive\" claim. In support of this entreaty, the plaintiff relies upon <i>Lam v. Univ. of Hawaii,</i> 40 F.3d 1551 (9th Cir.1994), and <i>Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.,</i> 833 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir.1987). Both decisions held, however, that race and sex may be aggregated under Title VII where the allegations involved discrimination against a subclass of people sharing both protected traits but not against those sharing only one or the other. <i>See Lam,</i> 40 F.3d at 1561-62 (involving discrimination against a subclass of Asian women); <i>Hicks,</i> 833 F.2d at 1416 &amp; n. 2 (involving discrimination against a subclass of black women). Such a claim still involves a single wrong and a single harm, prompted by a single animus. That is clearly not the case here: Ortiz's assault was not directed at the plaintiff due to her status as a complaining woman, as she was not yet a member of that subclass when the assault occurred. <i>Lam</i> and <i>Hicks</i> are, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we find timely the plaintiff's Title VII sexual harassment claim and her federal and state claims for retaliatory harassment. We find untimely, however, her state-law sexual harassment claim (and, therefore, affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment for the defendant on that claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment: Cognizability.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the cognizability of the retaliatory harassment claims. Both Title VII and chapter 151B contain provisions that make it unlawful for employers to retaliate against persons who complain about unlawfully discriminatory employment practices. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(4). To engage the gears of either statute, a plaintiff must show that (i) she undertook protected conduct, (ii) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (iii) the two were causally linked. <i>See Dressler v. Daniel,</i> 315 F.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir.2003) (Title VII); <i>Sullivan v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 262 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir.2001) (chapter 151B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is no dispute that the plaintiff engaged in protected activity by filing a complaint. The parties instead spar over the second and third elements, which in this instance collapse into a single question: did the plaintiff sustain an adverse employment action in the form of a hostile work environment based on retaliation for filing a sexual harassment complaint against Ortiz?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, an adverse employment action involves a discrete change in the terms and conditions of employment (say, a discharge, demotion, or reduction in pay). This case is more nuanced. In order for the plaintiff to survive summary judgment on this record, she must show that, as a legal matter, the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment itself can constitute a retaliatory adverse employment action. She also must show that, as a factual matter, her coworkers' actions furnished a sufficient basis to ground a finding that a hostile work environment actually existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the legal point, the plaintiff maintains that a hostile work environment may constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of both Title VII and chapter 151B. The city demurs. It notes that the plaintiff has not been cashiered, demoted, denied promotion, stripped of meaningful duties, or otherwise materially disadvantaged in the terms and conditions of her employment. Thus, the city argues, she cannot be said to have suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This precise question &#8212; whether a hostile work environment can constitute a retaliatory adverse employment action &#8212; has never been fully addressed either by this court (with regard to Title VII) or by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (with regard to chapter 151B). We look at the federal and state claims separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Title VII.</i> The weight of authority supports the view that, under Title VII, the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment can comprise a retaliatory adverse employment action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a). <i>See, e.g., Von Gunten v. Maryland,</i> 243 F.3d 858, 864-65 (4th Cir.2001); <i>Ray v. Henderson,</i> 217 F.3d 1234, 1244-45 (9th Cir.2000); <i>Morris,</i> 201 F.3d at 791; <i>Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. Serv.,</i> 180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir.1999); <i>Gunnell v. Utah Valley State Coll.,</i> 152 F.3d 1253, 1264 (10th Cir.1998); <i>Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir.1998); <i>Knox v. Indiana,</i> 93 F.3d 1327, 1334-35 (7th Cir.1996). That view has engendered a circuit split. The Fifth Circuit has held that a hostile work environment cannot constitute a retaliatory adverse employment action; instead, retaliation requires an \"ultimate employment decision ... such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\" <i>Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co.,</i> 104 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir.1997); <i>see also id.</i> at 709. The Eighth Circuit also requires an \"ultimate employment decision,\" <i>Ledergerber v. Stangler,</i> 122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir.1997), but defines that term somewhat more elastically, <i>see, e.g., Scusa v. Nestle U.S.A. Co.,</i> 181 F.3d 958, 968-69 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this court has never fully analyzed the question, our case law tilts noticeably toward the majority view. The pertinent decisions form a totem pole. At the base of the pole is <i>Wyatt v. City of Boston,</i> 35 F.3d 13 (1st Cir.1994) (per curiam), where, in dictum, we cited a treatise for the proposition that \"toleration of harassment by other employees\" might amount to an adverse employment action. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16 (citing 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <i>Employment Discrimination</i> &#167; 87.20 (1994)). That led to a series of epibolies: in <i>Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc.,</i> 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir.1998), we paraphrased the <i>Wyatt</i> dictum; in <i>White v. New Hampshire Department of Corrections,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir.2000), we noted the <i>Hernandez-Torres</i> paraphrase with approbation; in <i>Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 7, 26 (1st Cir.2002), we approvingly cited <i>White's</i> reference; and in <i>Che v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,</i> 342 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir.2003), we made a bow in the direction of <i>Marrero.</i> This totem pole is highly suggestive. Today, we cap it off and hold explicitly that a hostile work environment, tolerated by the employer, is cognizable as a retaliatory adverse employment action for purposes of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a). This means that workplace harassment, if sufficiently severe or pervasive, may in and of itself constitute an adverse employment action sufficient to satisfy the second prong of the prima facie case for Title VII retaliation cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is compelled by the statutory text and comports with congressional intent. The operative provision of Title VII makes it unlawful \"to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's ... sex.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1). Given Congress's intention \"to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment, which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment,\" <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. 367 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), it makes sense to construe the qualifier (regarding \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\") broadly. On that basis, the verb \"discriminate,\" as used in section 2000e-2(a)(1), logically includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment. <i>See Morris,</i> 201 F.3d at 791-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move next to Title VII's anti-retaliation provision. That provision directs an employer not to discriminate against any employee \"because [the employee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII].\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a). Here, the term \"discriminate\" appears without the qualifier. A familiar canon of construction teaches that \"[a] term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears.\" <i>Ratzlaf v. United States,</i> 510 U.S. 135, 143, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994). We apply that canon here. The result: the verb \"discriminate\" in the anti-retaliation clause includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment. <i>See Morris,</i> 201 F.3d at 792; <i>see also Knox,</i> 93 F.3d at 1334 (\"Nothing indicates why ... retaliating against a complainant by permitting her fellow employees to punish her for invoking her rights under Title VII ... does not fall within the statute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation of the statutory text is shared by the EEOC, which finds the lack of any qualifier on the term \"discriminate\" in the anti-retaliation context to evince a purpose to \"prohibit <i>any</i> discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity.\" <i>EEOC Compl. Man.</i> (CCH) &#182; 8005, &#167; 8-II.D.3 (2004). This is important because an administrative interpretation of a federal statute by the agency charged with its enforcement, while not controlling upon the courts, constitutes an informed judgment to which some deference ordinarily is due.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson,</i> 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; this capacious reading of section 2000e-3(a) is consonant with its purpose of \"[m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms.\" <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 346, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). Harassment by coworkers as a punishment for undertaking protected activity is a paradigmatic example of adverse treatment spurred by retaliatory motives and, as such, is likely to deter the complaining party (or others) from engaging in protected activity. <i>Ray,</i> 217 F.3d at 1245; <i>Wideman,</i> 141 F.3d at 1456. Reading the statute to provide a remedy for retaliatory harassment that expresses itself in the form of a hostile work environment thus furthers the goal of ensuring access to the statute's remedial mechanisms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Chapter 151B.</i> As for the state-law claim, we believe that, were the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) squarely presented with the question, it would find a retaliatory hostile work environment to be an adverse employment action cognizable under chapter 151B, &#167; 4(4). Several factors enter into this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, the statute's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions are very similar to the counterpart provisions contained in Title VII. Where such linguistic similarity exists, the SJC frequently looks to federal court interpretations of Title VII for guidance. <i>See Wheatley v. AT &amp; T Co.,</i> 418 Mass. 394, 636 N.E.2d 265, 268 (1994) (\"It is our practice to apply Federal case law construing the Federal anti-discrimination statutes in interpreting [chapter] 151B.\"); <i>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. v. MCAD,</i> 400 Mass. 156, 508 N.E.2d 587, 591 (1987) (describing federal precedents as \"helpful\"). We are, therefore, confident that the SJC, if confronted with this precise question, would quite likely interpret the anti-retaliation provision of chapter 151B exactly as we have interpreted the counterpart provision of Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, to the extent that any ambiguity lurks in the statutory language, Massachusetts law explicitly directs that the provisions of chapter 151B \"shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 9. As with Title VII, the purpose of the anti-retaliation provision in chapter 151B is to allow parties to \"seek redress for allegations of discrimination without fear of retaliation for or interference with the exercise of that right.\" <i>Sahli v. Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc.,</i> 437 Mass. 696, 774 N.E.2d 1085, 1090 (2002). Construing chapter 151B' s text to protect complaining employees from retaliatory harassment that results in the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment advances that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, although the SJC has not spoken directly to the subject, the Appeals Court has recognized a claim of retaliatory harassment based on a hostile work environment. <i>See Clifton,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 618, 624. While this holding is not indisputably authoritative &#8212; the highest court of a state is, after all, the final arbiter of state-law questions, <i>Acadia Ins. Co. v. McNeil,</i> 116 F.3d 599, 604 (1st Cir.1997) &#8212; the decision of an intermediate appellate court of the state generally constitutes a reliable piece of evidence. <i>See West v. AT&amp;T Co.,</i> 311 U.S. 223, 237, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940); <i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Losacco v. F.D. Rich Constr. Co.,</i> 992 F.2d 382, 384 (1st Cir.1993). This evidence seems all the more compelling in this case because the MCAD &#8212; whose decisions construing chapter 151B are ceded some deference by the SJC, <i>Cuddyer,</i> 750 N.E.2d at 938 &#8212; has interpreted chapter 151B's anti-retaliation language to include retaliatory harassment culminating in a hostile work environment. <i>See MCAD Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Guidelines</i> IX.B (2002) (\"An employer takes adverse action under &#167; 4(4) when it materially disadvantages the complainant with regard to any of the terms or conditions of her employment. The term `adverse action' can encompass ... hostile or abusive workplace treatment.\"); <i>Wareing v. New Bedford Sch. Dep't,</i> No. 99-BEM-3363, 2004 WL 2361016, at *8 (MCAD Oct. 6, 2004) (\"Retaliation may... take the form of hostile or abusive workplace treatment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this topic would be to paint the lily. For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that, under Massachusetts law as under Title VII, subjecting an employee to a hostile work environment in retaliation for protected activity constitutes an adverse employment action (and, thus, triggers the statutory prophylaxis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment: Sufficiency of Proof.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have established that, as a theoretical matter, subjecting a party to a hostile work environment in retaliation for protected activity may be actionable under both Title VII and chapter 151B. That poses the question whether the evidence in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, <i>Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 48, shows that a hostile work environment existed. We turn to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Elements of the Cause of Action.</i> An allegedly retaliatory act must rise to some level of substantiality before it can be actionable. <i>Wideman,</i> 141 F.3d at 1456; <i>MacCormack v. Boston Edison Co.,</i> 423 Mass. 652, 672 N.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1996). The hostile work environment doctrine, as developed in the anti-discrimination jurisprudence of Title VII, embodies that prerequisite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that she was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment that materially altered the conditions of her employment. <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 786, 118 S.Ct. 2275. The harassment must be \"objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so.\" <i>Id.</i> at 787, 118 S.Ct. 2275. In determining whether a reasonable person would find particular conduct hostile or abusive, a court must mull the totality of the circumstances, including factors such as the \"frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 787-88, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (quoting <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367). The thrust of this inquiry is to distinguish between the ordinary, if occasionally unpleasant, vicissitudes of the workplace and actual harassment. <i>Id.</i> at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This framework is readily transferable to the retaliatory harassment context. On the one hand, if protected activity leads only to commonplace indignities typical of the workplace (such as tepid jokes, teasing, or aloofness), a reasonable person would not be deterred from such activity. After all, an employee reasonably can expect to encounter such tribulations even if she eschews any involvement in protected activity. On the other hand, severe or pervasive harassment in retaliation for engaging in protected activity threatens to deter due enforcement of the rights conferred by statutes such as Title VII and chapter 151B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along this continuum, rudeness or ostracism, standing alone, usually is not enough to support a hostile work environment claim. <i>See Manatt v. Bank of Am.,</i> 339 F.3d 792, 803 (9th Cir.2003); <i>Gagnon v. Sprint Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 839, 850 (8th Cir.2002); <i>cf. Simas v. First Citizens' Fed. Credit Union,</i> 170 F.3d 37, 52 n. 12 (1st Cir.1999) (noting, in related context, that \"social ostracism alone is rarely actionable\"). The anti-discrimination laws were not enacted to create or enforce a \"general civility code.\" <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998). So too the anti-retaliation laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Applying the Requirements.</i> Having sketched the contours of retaliatory hostile work environments in the Title VII and chapter 151B milieus, we reach the central question presented in this appeal: viewing the totality of the circumstances in the light most flattering to the plaintiff, is the evidence of retaliatory harassment adequate to allow a reasonable jury to find that she was confronted by a hostile work environment?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we take note of a unique difficulty posed by allegations of retaliatory harassment. When dealing with discriminatory harassment (e.g., harassment based on gender, race, or the like), there is seldom, if ever, a defensible purpose behind the injurious actions. The only question is whether the bad acts, taken in the aggregate, are sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute actionable harassment. <i>See, e.g., Cardenas v. Massey,</i> 269 F.3d 251, 261-62 (3d Cir.2001); <i>Johnson v. City of Fort Wayne,</i> 91 F.3d 922, 932 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Retaliatory harassment, however, requires a more nuanced analysis. The very act of filing a charge against a coworker will invariably cause tension and result in a less agreeable workplace. <i>Von Gunten,</i> 243 F.3d at 870. The target of the complaint likely will have coworker-friends who come to his defense, while other coworkers will seek to steer clear of trouble by avoiding both the complainant and the target. Although admittedly a source of unpleasantness in the workplace, such behavior should not be seen as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment. <i>Id.</i> After all, there is nothing inherently wrong either with supporting a friend or with striving to avoid controversy. We think it follows that those actions that are hurtful to a complainant only because coworkers do not take her side in a work-related dispute may not be considered as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment. It is only those actions, directed at a complainant, that stem from a retaliatory animus which may be factored into the hostile work environment calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even with these nuances in mind, we conclude that the evidence in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would permit &#8212; although certainly not compel &#8212; a reasonable jury to find that the plaintiff was subjected to a retaliation-based hostile work environment. In reaching this conclusion, we take into account the relative ubiquity of the retaliatory conduct, its severity, its natural tendency to humiliate (and, on occasion, physically threaten) a reasonable person, and its capacity to interfere with the plaintiff's work performance. <i>See Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the months immediately following the plaintiff's initial series of complaints about Ortiz's actions, she was subjected to a steady stream of abuse. Much of this was significant and was of a kind that courts historically have found persuasive as evidence of a hostile work environment. She was falsely accused of misconduct (DiGirolamo levied a baseless charge against her in the tampon-throwing incident) &#8212; and the case law recognizes that false accusations of misconduct can contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment. <i>See Ray,</i> 217 F.3d at 1245; <i>Aviles v. Cornell Forge Co.,</i> 183 F.3d 598, 606 (7th Cir.1999). DiGirolamo also interfered with the plaintiff's working conditions by falsely informing her that she was required to take her dinner breaks alone &#8212; and \"work sabotage, exclusion, [and] denial of support\" also may contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment. <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 730. The harassing insults directed at the plaintiff are likewise entitled to some weight in the decisional calculus. <i>See Bolden v. PRC Inc.,</i> 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir.1994) (noting that even infrequent harassing insults should be considered, along with other instances of harassment). So too the taunting of the plaintiff with the collection on behalf of Ortiz.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Marrero,</i> 304 F.3d at 26 (finding that taunting plaintiff in relation to her filing of an EEOC complaint was evidence of retaliatory harassment); <i>cf. Oncale,</i> 523 U.S. at 80, 118 S.Ct. 998 (noting that open and direct hostility clearly based on protected status is evidence of hostile work environment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilardi's continued tormenting of the plaintiff is also relevant. Soon after the collection incident, Gilardi interfered with the plaintiff's ability to work by leaving her out in the cold (literally, not figuratively). This conduct may be seen as having contributed to the creation of a hostile work environment. <i>See Gorski v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 290 F.3d 466, 472 (1st Cir.2002); <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 730. Gilardi later placed the plaintiff at risk of physical harm by coming close to striking her with a van; if that was intentional (and, for now, we must credit the plaintiff's averment that it was), it is a cogent indicator of an adverse change in the conditions of the plaintiff's employment. <i>Cf. White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC,</i> 375 F.3d 288, 298 n. 6 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that \"the presence of physical threats undeniably strengthens a hostile work environment claim\"); <i>Raniola v. Bratton,</i> 243 F.3d 610, 621 (2d Cir.2001) (similar). To cinch matters, the plaintiff offered evidence that these incidents contributed to physical and psychological problems that required treatment, thus underscoring the negative effect on her work performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, no pat formula exists for determining with certainty whether the sum of harassing workplace incidents rises to the level of an actionable hostile work environment. <i>See Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 22, 114 S.Ct. 367. Such a determination requires the trier of fact to assess the matter on a case-by-case basis, weighing the totality of the circumstances. <i>Lipsett v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 864 F.2d 881, 898 &amp; n. 18 (1st Cir.1988). Our function is one of screening, that is, to determine whether, on particular facts, a reasonable jury could reach such a conclusion. <i>Rivera-Rodriguez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,</i> 265 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir.2001). Taking the aggregate facts of record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we believe that a jury rationally could find that the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment arising out of retaliation for her complaint against a popular coworker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Liability Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion takes us to the liability standard. In importing the hostile work environment doctrine into the anti-retaliation context, courts are left to draw the standards for employer liability from the case law involving hostile work environments in the anti-discrimination context. The Supreme Court has divided the universe of employer liability along a line that separates supervisors from non-supervisors. When a supervisor creates a hostile work environment, the employer is vicariously liable for it, subject, however, to a possible affirmative defense. <i>See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. 742, 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998); <i>Faragher,</i> 524 U.S. at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This defense, familiarly known as the <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> defense, consists of two elements which, if proven, permit the employer to avoid liability. First, the employer must show that it \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly\" the harassment. <i>Ellerth,</i> 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257. Second, the employer must show that the employee \"unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with Title VII, chapter 151B makes employers vicariously liable for hostile work environments created by supervisors. <i>College-Town,</i> 508 N.E.2d at 592. Unlike Title VII, however, chapter 151B does not afford employers any affirmative defenses to liability. Based on the legislative mandate that chapter 151B must be construed liberally to effectuate its purposes, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 9, the SJC has endorsed a rule that holds employers strictly liable for supervisory harassment. <i>See College-Town,</i> 508 N.E.2d at 591-94 (rejecting a \"reasonable care\" standard as a defense to a hostile work environment claim); <i>see also Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co.,</i> 337 F.3d 17, 28 n. 3 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that the <i>Faragher/ Ellerth</i> defense does not apply to chapter 151B actions). Because the reasoning of <i>College-Town</i> belies any meaningful distinction between discriminatory harassment and retaliatory harassment where supervisors are concerned, we conclude that no <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> type of affirmative defense is available under chapter 151B to an employer whose supervisors create a retaliatory hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When coworkers, rather than supervisors, are responsible for the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment, Title VII and chapter 151B seem essentially coterminous as they relate to employer liability. Notwithstanding the absence of a controlling Supreme Court precedent, several federal courts, including this court, have held that, in such situations, an employer can only be liable if the harassment is causally connected to some negligence on the employer's part. <i>See, e.g., Wyninger v. New Venture Gear, Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 965, 976 (7th Cir.2004); <i>Ocheltree v. Scollon Prods., Inc.,</i> 335 F.3d 325, 333-34 (4th Cir.2003); <i>Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387, 401 (1st Cir.2002). Typically, this involves a showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment, yet failed to take prompt action to stop it. <i>See Crowley,</i> 303 F.3d at 401. Similarly, under chapter 151B, employer liability for coworker harassment requires a showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment, yet failed to halt it. <i>Messina v. Araserve, Inc.,</i> 906 F.Supp. 34, 37-38 (D.Mass.1995) (discussing Massachusetts law); <i>College-Town,</i> 508 N.E.2d at 593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the summary judgment stage, these determinations are complicated. The question of whether an employee is a supervisor in the relevant sense is itself factual in nature. <i>Hrobowski v. Worthington Steel Co.,</i> 358 F.3d 473, 478 (7th Cir.2004). Here, the lower court found only coworker harassment; it declared that the evidence showed that the retaliation had been undertaken by \"subordinate officials, none of whom had control over terms and conditions of [the plaintiff's] employment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's skepticism about the claimed supervisory status of some of the harassers seems well-founded. The key to determining supervisory status is the degree of authority possessed by the putative supervisor. <i>Joens v. John Morrell &amp; Co.,</i> 354 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir.2004); <i>Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc.,</i> 163 F.3d 1027, 1033 (7th Cir.1998). Thus, courts must distinguish \"employees who are supervisors merely as a function of nomenclature from those who are entrusted with actual supervisory powers.\" <i>Parkins,</i> 163 F.3d at 1033; <i>accord Mikels v.</i> <i>City of Durham,</i> 183 F.3d 323, 334 (4th Cir.1999). Having in mind both common law agency principles and the purposes of the anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation laws, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that \"the essence of supervisory status is the authority to affect the terms and conditions of the victim's employment.\" <i>Parkins,</i> 163 F.3d at 1034. This authority \"primarily consists of the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline an employee.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1034. Without some modicum of this authority, a harasser cannot qualify as a supervisor for purposes of imputing vicarious liability to the employer in a Title VII case, but, rather, should be regarded as an ordinary coworker.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See id.</i> at 1033-34. We think that the same standard applies under chapter 151B. <i>See College-Town,</i> 508 N.E.2d at 593 (observing that the power wielded by a harassing supervisor may range from \"discharge to assignment of work, particularly exacting scrutiny, or refusal to protect the employee from coworker harassment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiff has not presented facts sufficient to show that she was harassed at the hands of persons who qualify as supervisors. The deposition of Irene Landry provides the clearest evidence of the organizational structure of the workplace. The parking enforcement officers are on the lowest rung of the ladder. On the next rung are the shift supervisors, who drive the parking enforcement officers to their assigned routes and pick them up. The third rung is occupied by more senior supervisors, (each of whom holds the title \"senior supervisor II\"). The functions of these individuals include dealing with personnel problems. During the time in question, Landry held the position of senior supervisor II. She reported to Moccia, a higher-level official who held the title of senior supervisor of parking enforcement. Moccia had authority to handle a wide variety of employee issues and complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff uses the word \"supervisor\" indiscriminately, referring to people on the second, third, and fourth rungs as \"supervisors\" and making no distinctions among them. That approach elevates nomenclature over actual authority. When we shift the focus to those persons whose actual authority made them supervisors in the relevant sense, a different picture emerges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Landry and Moccia each appear to have possessed the requisite authority, but neither of them were guilty of any retaliatory harassment. The only two \"supervisors\" whose actions rationally can be said to have contributed to the hostile work environment are Gilardi and DiGirolamo. Gilardi was a second-rung shift supervisor, and DiGirolamo's level of authority seems no greater (the record only permits us to speculate on this point, and the lack of proof counts against the plaintiff). The plaintiff has presented us with no evidence that either woman had the power to terminate, discipline, or otherwise affect the terms and conditions of her employment. In the absence of such evidence, the city cannot be held vicariously responsible for their harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's claim thus reduces to one of coworker harassment. The viability of that claim depends on whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a finding that the employer knew or should have known about the hostile work environment, yet failed to stop it. We conclude that sufficient evidence exists. Plaintiff complained of the harassment to two senior supervisors (Landry and Moccia). Landry did not deal with the plaintiff's complaints at all and Moccia, rather than rectifying the situation, speculated that the harassment would likely become \"ten times worse\" with the plaintiff's recent shift change. Moreover, the deputy commissioner was aware of the harassment, but did nothing to dispel it. Since Landry, Moccia, and the deputy commissioner were appropriate recipients of the plaintiff's complaints, there is enough evidence to allow a finding of actual notice on the city's part. <i>See Crowley,</i> 303 F.3d at 403; <i>Breda v. Wolf Camera &amp; Video,</i> 222 F.3d 886, 889 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The city's only rejoinder is that the supervisors responded to the plaintiff's allegations in an appropriate manner. At best, this presents a factual dispute that is not amenable to resolution on summary judgment. Consequently, there is a trialworthy issue as to whether the city was negligent in not putting a stop to the harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">F. <i>Sexual Harassment Under Title VII.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the plaintiff's claim that Ortiz's assault subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her sex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Even if the assault was sufficient, in and of itself, to create a hostile work environment &#8212; a proposition that we regard as highly dubious &#8212; the plaintiff cannot prevail. Though she refers to Ortiz as her \"supervisor,\" the record contains a paucity of evidence about his job description and authority. That which does appear indicates that Ortiz, like Gilardi, was merely a second-rung shift supervisor. As the plaintiff provided no evidence that such an employee had the authority to hire, fire, or otherwise dictate the terms and conditions of employment, vicarious liability is off the table. It follows that the plaintiff can survive summary judgment only if she can show that a rational jury could find the city negligent because it knew or should have known of the harassment yet failed to take prompt action to stop it. <i>Crowley,</i> 303 F.3d at 401.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff cannot carry this burden. There is no evidence of any prior misconduct on Ortiz's part. The first that the city knew (or could have known) about his assaultive demeanor was when it received the initial report of the attack. The undisputed evidence shows that a mere seven days elapsed between the time of the assault and the commencement of disciplinary proceedings (which began with Ortiz's immediate suspension and culminated in his discharge). Between the assault and the suspension, the plaintiff says that she \"encountered\" Ortiz in the workplace, but there is no evidence that she was forced to work with him or was exposed to further harassment by him. While we leave open the possibility that, under certain extreme circumstances, a delay of seven days in separating a harasser and his victim might evince negligence, there is nothing to indicate that the city acted here in a dilatory manner. On this record, a rational jury could only conclude that, as to the Title VII sexual harassment claim, the city acted in a professional and appropriate manner to resolve the problem. No more was exigible. <i>See, e.g., Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,</i> 333 F.3d 27, 34-35 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that investigation of sexual assault by employer, quickly leading to malefactor's termination, indicates reasonable care on behalf of employer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. One of the main purposes of Title VII is to encourage proactive resolution of workplace harassment. We would undermine that purpose were we to subject the city to sexual harassment liability despite its prompt and effective action in investigating the incident and removing the perpetrator from the workplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we hold that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on her retaliatory harassment claims under Title VII and chapter 151B. As to her sexual harassment claims, however, we reach a different conclusion. Her chapter 151B claim is time-barred and her Title VII claim is foreclosed by her failure to present a trialworthy issue about whether the city was negligent in its handling of the Ortiz situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

In that event, its effect on the plaintiff would be the same regardless of the truth of the matter asserted<i>See Mota,</i> 261 F.3d at 526 n. 46. Here, however, the plaintiff's affidavit takes the air out of any suggestion that the declarant's statement was itself a product of retaliatory animus.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We emphasize that we refer here only to<i>Skidmore</i> deference, not <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>Compare Skidmore v.

Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). After all, statements in the EEOC's Compliance Manual are neither adjudicatory nor the product of notice-and-comment rulemaking. <i>See United States v.

The fact that coworkers rubbed the plaintiff's nose in the collection is a horse of a different hue. If the incident occurred as the plaintiff suggests (an assumption that we must indulge at the summary judgment stage), it was a clear indication of open hostility directed at the plaintiff and would have deleteriously affected her working conditions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Second Circuit takes a somewhat broader view.

Faced with a plethora of issues, the district court entered summary judgment for the defendant. On appeal, we must sort out which of the plaintiff's claims are timely; address whether her timeous claims for retaliatory harassment, cast in the form of a hostile work environment, are legally cognizable and sufficiently supported; grapple with her one timely claim of sexual harassment, also cast in the form of a hostile work environment; and discuss various aspects of the case relating to employer liability. After careful consideration of these variegated issues, we conclude (i) that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the retaliation claims, as those claims are timely, cognizable, and supported by sufficient evidence, but (ii) that the district court correctly entered summary judgment on the sexual harassment claims: despite the attempt to recast them in a hostile work environment format, the state-law claim is time-barred and its federal analogue runs afoul of an inexpugnable affirmative defense &#8212; the employer's swift, effective, and non-negligent response to the underlying incident. Accordingly, we vacate in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

After first announcing his intentions, Ortiz forcibly unhooked the plaintiff's brassiere, ripped it from her body, hung it on the van's outside mirror, and bellowed a crude sexual remark to a fellow employee on the street. Over the next few days, the plaintiff reported the incident to a number of municipal hierarchs. They promptly investigated the matter, suspended Ortiz a week after the incident, and ultimately cashiered him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after Ortiz's banishment, coworkers began to subject the plaintiff to sundry indignities, or, in the words of the employees themselves, to \"bust [ ] her chops.\" The record contains evidence of the following incidents (the plaintiff recounts others, but we have omitted those that lack any conceivable probative value):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On October 5, 1999, Barbara DiGirolamo accused the plaintiff of throwing a tampon at a coworker.

The plaintiff complained to a senior supervisor, Irene Landry, who took no action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On December 8, 1999, a new employee told the plaintiff that although he had no problem with her, other coworkers had advised him to \"stay away\" because she was \"trouble.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On December 9, 1999, the entire department ostracized the plaintiff during a holiday party.

The collection for Ortiz was in full flower. Coworkers waved the money they had amassed in the plaintiff's face, crowing \"look how much money we have collected!\" One of the plaintiff's superiors, Kathy O'Brien, advised her to \"go to the office\" about the harassment. There is no evidence, however, that O'Brien intervened to stop the ongoing conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; On December 30, 1999, the plaintiff met with a high-level supervisor, Kathleen Moccia. She described the toll that the harassment was taking on her and asked Moccia why management was tolerating the harassment. Moccia did not intervene. Moreover, she stated that she did not think that the harassment would stop; rather, she forecast that it would become \"ten times worse\" with the plaintiff's recent shift change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; In January of 2000, a tow truck driver told the plaintiff that Gilardi had begun circulating a petition urging management to dismiss the plaintiff, but that he had refused to sign it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; During a snowstorm that month, Gilardi refused to pick up the plaintiff from her route.

The MCAD obliged and the plaintiff commenced a civil action against the city in a Massachusetts state court. Her complaint, filed on November 1, 2002, charged the city with violations of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4. On April 25, 2003, the plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. One month later, she amended her state court complaint to include Title VII claims. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2, e-3. At that point, the city removed the case to the federal district court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331, 1441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the city moved for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, arguing (i) that most of the plaintiff's claims under chapter 151B were time-barred; (ii) that those which remained were not actionable; (iii) that as to the federal retaliation claims, the evidence, even when interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, did not reveal any actionable conduct; and (iv) that the city could not be held liable for Ortiz's behavior because it had taken prompt and effective remedial action. The plaintiff opposed the motion. Ruling ore sponte, the district court granted summary judgment for the city. The court concluded that there was no timely sexual harassment claim under chapter 151B and that the city's response to the Ortiz incident foreclosed any sexual harassment claim under Title VII. As to the retaliation claims, the court acknowledged that, viewing the proof in the requisite light, the plaintiff had been subjected to a \"series of distasteful, unpleasant, non-empathetic acts ... by a series of subordinate officials.\" Nevertheless, the court concluded that the retaliation claims must fail because none of the individual incidents was an \"adverse employment action [ ]\" that bore directly upon the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

Those facts, typically set forth in affidavits, depositions, and the like, must have evidentiary value; as a rule, \"[e]vidence that is inadmissible at trial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may not be considered on summary judgment.\" <i>Vazquez v.

In large part, the chronicled events are within the plaintiff's personal knowledge. The insults and taunting that the plaintiff recounts do not create hearsay problems; those statements are not offered for their truth, but, rather, to show that the words were spoken (and, thus, contributed to the hostile work environment). They are, therefore, admissible. <i>See Mota v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24798\"><a href=\"/opinion/24798/mota-v-univ-tx-houston-hlth/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 526 n. 46 (5th Cir.2001).

The first is a statement from an unnamed coworker that other employees told him to \"stay away\" from the plaintiff as she was \"trouble.\" Insofar as the plaintiff is attempting to introduce this statement as evidence of <i>other</i> coworkers' harassing behavior, it is hearsay; its probative value ultimately depends on the truth of the declarant's own unsworn out-of-court utterance. It is, therefore, inadmissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801, 802; <i>see also Vazquez,</i> 134 F.3d at 34. A similar problem exists with respect to the plaintiff's assertion that a tow truck driver said that Gilardi had been circulating a petition to have the plaintiff fired. Consequently, we cannot consider the content of either statement in analyzing the plaintiff's claims. <i>See LaRou v. Ridlon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197044\"><a href=\"/opinion/197044/larou-v-ridlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span>, 663 (1st Cir.1996) (branding incompetent on summary judgment portions of a party's affidavit recounting inadmissible hearsay).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Timeliness.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question that we must answer pertains to timeliness. In order to prosecute a harassment claim under either Massachusetts or federal law, an aggrieved party must first file a timely administrative complaint. The time parameters for these filings differ. In 1999, chapter 151B mandated filing with the MCAD within six months of the alleged violation. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 5 (1989) (amended 2002). By contrast, the EEOC filing had to occur within 300 days of the date of the alleged violation. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1); <i>see also Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553173\"><a href=\"/opinion/553173/54-fair-emplpraccas-1070-55-empl-prac-dec-p-40456-mark-h-sabree-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 399 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.1990) (discussing timely filing of charges of discrimination with the EEOC in \"deferral\" states, i.e., states such as Massachusetts, which have their own civil rights statute and agency). There is no dispute that the plaintiff met these administrative deadlines; the earliest incident of alleged harassment occurred on September 11, 1999, and the plaintiff's administrative complaint was filed with both agencies on March 6, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claimant who wishes to sue under chapter 151B must allow a waiting period to pass, file her suit, and notify the MCAD (which is then required to dismiss the administrative proceeding). Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 9. This civil suit must be instituted no later than three years after the occurrence of the alleged violation. <i>See id.</i> The federal prototype is different. A Title VII claimant may sue only after the EEOC issues a right-to-sue letter. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(1). Once such a letter is received, the claimant must file her suit within ninety days. <i>Id.</i> The fact that an analogous state statute of limitations has expired with respect to a parallel state harassment action does not create a temporal bar to a Title VII suit. <i>See Burgh v.

The situation is more tenebrous with regard to the chapter 151B claims. The plaintiff first brought suit on these claims on November 1, 2002. Based on the three-year statute of limitations applicable to chapter 151B actions, this would seem to foreclose recovery for any incidents that occurred prior to November 1, 1999, including the original sexual harassment and several of the instances of alleged retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff offers a theory as to why these claims nonetheless are timely. After reviewing her thesis, we conclude that her state-law claims based on the Ortiz imbroglio are barred but that her retaliation claims are not. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law recognizes that \"some claims of discrimination involve a series of related events that have to be viewed in their totality in order to assess adequately their discriminatory nature and impact.\" <i>Cuddyer v.

Under this continuing violation doctrine, a plaintiff who ordinarily would be unable to recover damages for discrete acts of discrimination falling outside the limitations period may avoid that bar if those acts are shown to be part of a pattern of discrimination anchored by acts that occurred within the limitations period. <i>Id.</i> at 936-37. Hostile environment claims, by their nature, often fall within this rubric. <i>See id.</i> at 937; <i>Clifton v. Mass. Bay Transp.

In such situations, however, the anchoring event must \"substantially relate[ ] to earlier incidents of abuse and substantially contribute[ ] to the continuation of a hostile work environment.\" <i>Cuddyer,</i> 750 N.E.2d at 938.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application of the continuing violation doctrine sometimes has the effect of expanding the three-year filing deadline for suits under chapter 151B. <i>See, e.g., Clifton,</i> 815 N.E.2d at 620-21; <i>Carter v.

We thus confront the question of whether the facts in this case, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, make out a continuing violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, we think that reasonable jurors could find that the distasteful and unpleasant actions undertaken by the plaintiff's coworkers before and after November 1, 1999 were part of a pattern of retaliation. For one thing, the harassment began soon after the plaintiff lodged her initial complaint about Ortiz's boorishness and surfaced most frequently in the first few months after Ortiz was dismissed. When harassment follows hard on the heels of protected activity, the timing often is strongly suggestive of retaliation. <i>See Oliver v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505831\"><a href=\"/opinion/505831/46-fair-emplpraccas-1535-46-empl-prac-dec-p-37989-norman-w-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.1988); <i>Mole v.

For another thing, the harassment itself offered circumstantial evidence of causation; coworkers referred to the plaintiff as a \"rat\" (a term that connotes an informer or snitch), lamented the firing of their \"good supervisor,\" and took up a collection for his benefit. Even as late as 2001, Gilardi committed an act of harassment and, shortly thereafter, made reference to the plaintiff's upcoming \"payday.\" Up to that point, we believe that reasonable jurors could deem the listed incidents to comprise a pattern of retaliatory harassment. Since this pattern includes events within and without the limitations period, we are free to use incidents from both periods in deciding whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of a hostile work environment under chapter 151B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we find unpersuasive the plaintiff's labored effort to include Ortiz's solitary act of sexual harassment as part of the pattern of subsequent retaliatory acts. This attempted agglomeration relies heavily, but mistakenly, upon the MCAD's decision in <i>Muise v. Credit Exch.,</i> 17 M.D.L.R. 1684 (MCAD 1995), a case in which the agency said that timely incidents of retaliation may anchor an untimely incident of sexual harassment if \"the charge of retaliation is inextricably related to the original charge of sexual harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1690. The plaintiff overlooks that in order to invoke this doctrine, a claimant must show at a bare minimum a series of discriminatory acts that emanate from the same discriminatory animus. <i>See Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754633\"><a href=\"/opinion/754633/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1569-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45393-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also Morrisey v. Holiday Inn,</i> 25 M.D.L.R. 74, 86 n. 12 (MCAD 2003) (citing <i>Provencher</i>). We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an individual sexually harasses a victim and then engages in non-sexual retaliatory harassment, the sexual and non-sexual harassment arguably may be part and parcel of the same violation. <i>Cf. O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 729 (noting that, in such circumstances, the non-sexual harassment is still charged with the original animus). <i>But cf. Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767382\"><a href=\"/opinion/767382/judy-g-morris-v-oldham-county-fiscal-court-john-w-black-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 790-91 (6th Cir.2000) (refusing to aggregate sexual harassment and non-sexual retaliatory harassment undertaken by a single supervisor). That was the fact pattern in <i>Muise,</i> 17 M.D.L.R. at 1686-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority of cases are not cut from this seamless cloth. Even when retaliation is derivative of a particular act of harassment, it normally does not stem from the same animus. Most often, retaliation is a distinct and independent act of discrimination, motivated by a discrete intention to punish a person who has rocked the boat by complaining about an unlawful employment practice. <i>See, e.g., Ruffino v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457495/ruffino-v-state-street-bank-and-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>, 1040 (D.Mass.1995); <i>Tinkham v.

That is a different animus than the sexual animus that drove the original harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case aptly illustrates the disparity of motives. Ortiz's attack was a one-time incident of sexual harassment. By contrast, the retaliatory harassment consisted of a series of discrete acts orchestrated by a cohort of different individuals (not including Ortiz) and occurring over a period of many months (beginning only after Ortiz was suspended). Of critical importance, nothing in the record indicates that these retaliatory acts were undertaken for reasons related to the plaintiff's gender. As such, the sexual harassment and retaliatory harassment in this case must be viewed for what they are: two separate and independent harms. <i>See Goguen v. Quality Plan Adm'rs,</i> 11 Mass.L.Rptr. 288, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">282485</span></span>, at *4 (Mass.Super.2000) (holding that sexual harassment by one person and subsequent retaliation by another are not sufficiently related to add up to a single continuing violation); <i>cf. Sitar v. Ind. Dep't. of Transp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783651\"><a href=\"/opinion/783651/caroline-m-sitar-v-indiana-department-of-transportation/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span>, 726 (7th Cir.2003) (noting generally that \"retaliation ... and sexual harassment charges are not `like or reasonably related' to one another to permit an EEOC charge of one type of wrong to support a subsequent civil suit for another\"). The plaintiff cannot rely on the second to revive the first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For much the same reason, we decline the plaintiff's invitation to treat her case as one involving a \"mixed-motive\" claim. In support of this entreaty, the plaintiff relies upon <i>Lam v. Univ. of Hawaii,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683150\"><a href=\"/opinion/683150/maivan-lam-v-university-of-hawaii-albert-simone-in-his-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1551</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1994), and <i>Hicks v.

Both decisions held, however, that race and sex may be aggregated under Title VII where the allegations involved discrimination against a subclass of people sharing both protected traits but not against those sharing only one or the other. <i>See Lam,</i> 40 F.3d at 1561-62 (involving discrimination against a subclass of Asian women); <i>Hicks,</i> 833 F.2d at 1416 &amp; n. 2 (involving discrimination against a subclass of black women). Such a claim still involves a single wrong and a single harm, prompted by a single animus. That is clearly not the case here: Ortiz's assault was not directed at the plaintiff due to her status as a complaining woman, as she was not yet a member of that subclass when the assault occurred. <i>Lam</i> and <i>Hicks</i> are, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we find timely the plaintiff's Title VII sexual harassment claim and her federal and state claims for retaliatory harassment. We find untimely, however, her state-law sexual harassment claim (and, therefore, affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment for the defendant on that claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Retaliatory Hostile Work Environment: Cognizability.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the cognizability of the retaliatory harassment claims. Both Title VII and chapter 151B contain provisions that make it unlawful for employers to retaliate against persons who complain about unlawfully discriminatory employment practices. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a); Mass.

Today, we cap it off and hold explicitly that a hostile work environment, tolerated by the employer, is cognizable as a retaliatory adverse employment action for purposes of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a). This means that workplace harassment, if sufficiently severe or pervasive, may in and of itself constitute an adverse employment action sufficient to satisfy the second prong of the prima facie case for Title VII retaliation cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is compelled by the statutory text and comports with congressional intent.

Given Congress's intention \"to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment, which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment,\" <i>Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On that basis, the verb \"discriminate,\" as used in section 2000e-2(a)(1), logically includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment. <i>See Morris,</i> 201 F.3d at 791-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move next to Title VII's anti-retaliation provision.

Here, the term \"discriminate\" appears without the qualifier. A familiar canon of construction teaches that \"[a] term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears.\" <i>Ratzlaf v.

The result: the verb \"discriminate\" in the anti-retaliation clause includes subjecting a person to a hostile work environment. <i>See Morris,</i> 201 F.3d at 792; <i>see also Knox,</i> 93 F.3d at 1334 (\"Nothing indicates why ... retaliating against a complainant by permitting her fellow employees to punish her for invoking her rights under Title VII ... does not fall within the statute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation of the statutory text is shared by the EEOC, which finds the lack of any qualifier on the term \"discriminate\" in the anti-retaliation context to evince a purpose to \"prohibit <i>any</i> discrimination that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity.\" <i>EEOC Compl.

On the one hand, if protected activity leads only to commonplace indignities typical of the workplace (such as tepid jokes, teasing, or aloofness), a reasonable person would not be deterred from such activity. After all, an employee reasonably can expect to encounter such tribulations even if she eschews any involvement in protected activity.

When dealing with discriminatory harassment (e.g., harassment based on gender, race, or the like), there is seldom, if ever, a defensible purpose behind the injurious actions. The only question is whether the bad acts, taken in the aggregate, are sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute actionable harassment. <i>See, e.g., Cardenas v. Massey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775327\"><a href=\"/opinion/775327/gerard-cardenas-v-jon-massey-james-rebo-robert-lipscher-james-ciancia/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 261-62 (3d Cir.2001); <i>Johnson v.

The very act of filing a charge against a coworker will invariably cause tension and result in a less agreeable workplace. <i>Von Gunten,</i> 243 F.3d at 870. The target of the complaint likely will have coworker-friends who come to his defense, while other coworkers will seek to steer clear of trouble by avoiding both the complainant and the target. Although admittedly a source of unpleasantness in the workplace, such behavior should not be seen as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment. <i>Id.</i> After all, there is nothing inherently wrong either with supporting a friend or with striving to avoid controversy. We think it follows that those actions that are hurtful to a complainant only because coworkers do not take her side in a work-related dispute may not be considered as contributing to a retaliatory hostile work environment. It is only those actions, directed at a complainant, that stem from a retaliatory animus which may be factored into the hostile work environment calculus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even with these nuances in mind, we conclude that the evidence in this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would permit &#8212; although certainly not compel &#8212; a reasonable jury to find that the plaintiff was subjected to a retaliation-based hostile work environment. In reaching this conclusion, we take into account the relative ubiquity of the retaliatory conduct, its severity, its natural tendency to humiliate (and, on occasion, physically threaten) a reasonable person, and its capacity to interfere with the plaintiff's work performance. <i>See Harris,</i> 510 U.S. at 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Much of this was significant and was of a kind that courts historically have found persuasive as evidence of a hostile work environment. She was falsely accused of misconduct (DiGirolamo levied a baseless charge against her in the tampon-throwing incident) &#8212; and the case law recognizes that false accusations of misconduct can contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment. <i>See Ray,</i> 217 F.3d at 1245; <i>Aviles v. Cornell Forge Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765137\"><a href=\"/opinion/765137/alfredo-aviles-v-cornell-forge-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 606 (7th Cir.1999). DiGirolamo also interfered with the plaintiff's working conditions by falsely informing her that she was required to take her dinner breaks alone &#8212; and \"work sabotage, exclusion, [and] denial of support\" also may contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment. <i>O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 730. The harassing insults directed at the plaintiff are likewise entitled to some weight in the decisional calculus. <i>See Bolden v.

Soon after the collection incident, Gilardi interfered with the plaintiff's ability to work by leaving her out in the cold (literally, not figuratively). This conduct may be seen as having contributed to the creation of a hostile work environment. <i>See Gorski v. N.H.

Gilardi later placed the plaintiff at risk of physical harm by coming close to striking her with a van; if that was intentional (and, for now, we must credit the plaintiff's averment that it was), it is a cogent indicator of an adverse change in the conditions of the plaintiff's employment. <i>Cf.

In importing the hostile work environment doctrine into the anti-retaliation context, courts are left to draw the standards for employer liability from the case law involving hostile work environments in the anti-discrimination context. The Supreme Court has divided the universe of employer liability along a line that separates supervisors from non-supervisors. When a supervisor creates a hostile work environment, the employer is vicariously liable for it, subject, however, to a possible affirmative defense. <i>See Burlington Indus., Inc. v.

Unlike Title VII, however, chapter 151B does not afford employers any affirmative defenses to liability. Based on the legislative mandate that chapter 151B must be construed liberally to effectuate its purposes, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 9, the SJC has endorsed a rule that holds employers strictly liable for supervisory harassment. <i>See College-Town,</i> 508 N.E.2d at 591-94 (rejecting a \"reasonable care\" standard as a defense to a hostile work environment claim); <i>see also Blockel v.

Because the reasoning of <i>College-Town</i> belies any meaningful distinction between discriminatory harassment and retaliatory harassment where supervisors are concerned, we conclude that no <i>Faragher/Ellerth</i> type of affirmative defense is available under chapter 151B to an employer whose supervisors create a retaliatory hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When coworkers, rather than supervisors, are responsible for the creation and perpetuation of a hostile work environment, Title VII and chapter 151B seem essentially coterminous as they relate to employer liability. Notwithstanding the absence of a controlling Supreme Court precedent, several federal courts, including this court, have held that, in such situations, an employer can only be liable if the harassment is causally connected to some negligence on the employer's part. <i>See, e.g., Wyninger v.

Typically, this involves a showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment, yet failed to take prompt action to stop it. <i>See Crowley,</i> 303 F.3d at 401.

Thus, courts must distinguish \"employees who are supervisors merely as a function of nomenclature from those who are entrusted with actual supervisory powers.\" <i>Parkins,</i> 163 F.3d at 1033; <i>accord Mikels v.</i> <i>City of Durham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765112\"><a href=\"/opinion/765112/jasey-mikels-v-city-of-durham-north-carolina-ca-95-261-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 334 (4th Cir.1999). Having in mind both common law agency principles and the purposes of the anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation laws, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that \"the essence of supervisory status is the authority to affect the terms and conditions of the victim's employment.\" <i>Parkins,</i> 163 F.3d at 1034. This authority \"primarily consists of the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline an employee.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1034. Without some modicum of this authority, a harasser cannot qualify as a supervisor for purposes of imputing vicarious liability to the employer in a Title VII case, but, rather, should be regarded as an ordinary coworker.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See id.</i> at 1033-34. We think that the same standard applies under chapter 151B. <i>See College-Town,</i> 508 N.E.2d at 593 (observing that the power wielded by a harassing supervisor may range from \"discharge to assignment of work, particularly exacting scrutiny, or refusal to protect the employee from coworker harassment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the plaintiff has not presented facts sufficient to show that she was harassed at the hands of persons who qualify as supervisors. The deposition of Irene Landry provides the clearest evidence of the organizational structure of the workplace. The parking enforcement officers are on the lowest rung of the ladder. On the next rung are the shift supervisors, who drive the parking enforcement officers to their assigned routes and pick them up. The third rung is occupied by more senior supervisors, (each of whom holds the title \"senior supervisor II\"). The functions of these individuals include dealing with personnel problems. During the time in question, Landry held the position of senior supervisor II. She reported to Moccia, a higher-level official who held the title of senior supervisor of parking enforcement. Moccia had authority to handle a wide variety of employee issues and complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff uses the word \"supervisor\" indiscriminately, referring to people on the second, third, and fourth rungs as \"supervisors\" and making no distinctions among them.

The only two \"supervisors\" whose actions rationally can be said to have contributed to the hostile work environment are Gilardi and DiGirolamo. Gilardi was a second-rung shift supervisor, and DiGirolamo's level of authority seems no greater (the record only permits us to speculate on this point, and the lack of proof counts against the plaintiff). The plaintiff has presented us with no evidence that either woman had the power to terminate, discipline, or otherwise affect the terms and conditions of her employment. In the absence of such evidence, the city cannot be held vicariously responsible for their harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's claim thus reduces to one of coworker harassment. The viability of that claim depends on whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a finding that the employer knew or should have known about the hostile work environment, yet failed to stop it. We conclude that sufficient evidence exists. Plaintiff complained of the harassment to two senior supervisors (Landry and Moccia). Landry did not deal with the plaintiff's complaints at all and Moccia, rather than rectifying the situation, speculated that the harassment would likely become \"ten times worse\" with the plaintiff's recent shift change. Moreover, the deputy commissioner was aware of the harassment, but did nothing to dispel it. Since Landry, Moccia, and the deputy commissioner were appropriate recipients of the plaintiff's complaints, there is enough evidence to allow a finding of actual notice on the city's part. <i>See Crowley,</i> 303 F.3d at 403; <i>Breda v. Wolf Camera &amp; Video,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></span>, 889 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The city's only rejoinder is that the supervisors responded to the plaintiff's allegations in an appropriate manner. At best, this presents a factual dispute that is not amenable to resolution on summary judgment. Consequently, there is a trialworthy issue as to whether the city was negligent in not putting a stop to the harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">F. <i>Sexual Harassment Under Title VII.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the plaintiff's claim that Ortiz's assault subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her sex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Even if the assault was sufficient, in and of itself, to create a hostile work environment &#8212; a proposition that we regard as highly dubious &#8212; the plaintiff cannot prevail. Though she refers to Ortiz as her \"supervisor,\" the record contains a paucity of evidence about his job description and authority. That which does appear indicates that Ortiz, like Gilardi, was merely a second-rung shift supervisor. As the plaintiff provided no evidence that such an employee had the authority to hire, fire, or otherwise dictate the terms and conditions of employment, vicarious liability is off the table. It follows that the plaintiff can survive summary judgment only if she can show that a rational jury could find the city negligent because it knew or should have known of the harassment yet failed to take prompt action to stop it. <i>Crowley,</i> 303 F.3d at 401.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff cannot carry this burden. There is no evidence of any prior misconduct on Ortiz's part. The first that the city knew (or could have known) about his assaultive demeanor was when it received the initial report of the attack. The undisputed evidence shows that a mere seven days elapsed between the time of the assault and the commencement of disciplinary proceedings (which began with Ortiz's immediate suspension and culminated in his discharge). Between the assault and the suspension, the plaintiff says that she \"encountered\" Ortiz in the workplace, but there is no evidence that she was forced to work with him or was exposed to further harassment by him. While we leave open the possibility that, under certain extreme circumstances, a delay of seven days in separating a harasser and his victim might evince negligence, there is nothing to indicate that the city acted here in a dilatory manner. On this record, a rational jury could only conclude that, as to the Title VII sexual harassment claim, the city acted in a professional and appropriate manner to resolve the problem. No more was exigible. <i>See, e.g., Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that investigation of sexual assault by employer, quickly leading to malefactor's termination, indicates reasonable care on behalf of employer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. One of the main purposes of Title VII is to encourage proactive resolution of workplace harassment. We would undermine that purpose were we to subject the city to sexual harassment liability despite its prompt and effective action in investigating the incident and removing the perpetrator from the workplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we hold that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on her retaliatory harassment claims under Title VII and chapter 151B. As to her sexual harassment claims, however, we reach a different conclusion. Her chapter 151B claim is time-barred and her Title VII claim is foreclosed by her failure to present a trialworthy issue about whether the city was negligent in its handling of the Ortiz situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

In that event, its effect on the plaintiff would be the same regardless of the truth of the matter asserted<i>See Mota,</i> 261 F.3d at 526 n. 46.

The fact that coworkers rubbed the plaintiff's nose in the collection is a horse of a different hue.
