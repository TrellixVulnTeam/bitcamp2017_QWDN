George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Robert D.

Plaintiff Robert Spickler, a retired real-estate\n\ndeveloper in Maine, filed this action against three managers of a\n\nprivate electric-utility company, alleging breach of an agreement\n\nto install power lines free of charge once certain conditions were\n\nmet.     Brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, the complaint set forth\n\nclaims      under    both    federal    and    state   law.      Upon    motion   of\n\ndefendants, the district court dismissed the federal claims under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, concluding\n\nthat the requisite state action had not been established.                  See 208\n\nF. Supp. 2d 68 (D. Me. 2002).           In turn, it dismissed the state-law\n\nclaims without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(c). Spickler\n\nhas appealed, and we now affirm.\n\n       We   agree,    substantially      for    the    reasons   recited    by    the\n\ndistrict court, that the complaint did not make a sufficient\n\nallegation     of    state    action.     Such    a    conclusion   is   virtually\n\ndictated by Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345\n\n(1974), a case which Spickler has failed to distinguish in any\n\nmeaningful sense.       As there, the regulatory commission here cannot\n\nbe said to have placed its \"imprimatur\" on the challenged practice\n\n(the alleged rescission of all pre-1990 contracts) simply by having\n\nassented thereto.       Id. at 357; accord, e.g., Blum v. Yaretsky, 457\n\nU.S. 991, 1004-05 (1982) (\"[m]ere approval of or acquiescence in\n\nthe initiatives of a private party is not sufficient to justify\n\nholding the State responsible for those initiatives\"); see also\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fDestek Group, Inc. v.

Under the circumstances, we\n\nperceive no error.        The state-action inquiry, to be sure, is\n\n\"necessarily fact-bound.\"        Brentwood Acad. v. Tennessee Secondary\n\nSchool Athletic Ass'n, 531 U.S. 288, 298 (2001) (quoting Lugar v.\n\nEdmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 939 (1982)).              Yet disposition\n\nthereof at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage prior to discovery is not always\n\nunwarranted.    See, e.g., Gonzalez-Morales v. Hernandez-Arencibia,\n\n221 F.3d 45, 47-51 (1st Cir. 2000); accord, e.g., Hack v. President\n\nand Fellows of Yale College, 237 F.3d 81, 84-85 (2d Cir. 2000),\n\ncert. denied, 534 U.S. 888 (2001); DeBauche v. Trani, 191 F.3d 499,\n\n506-09 (4th Cir. 1999).         Here, we see no hint that Spickler's\n\nrequested discovery would have yielded anything of pertinence to\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe state-action issue.      Indeed, we note that the complaint in\n\nJackson itself was dismissed on the pleadings.           See 348 F.

Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).     Indeed, Spickler focuses on a separate matter on\n\nappeal, expressing the wish to add a member of the regulatory\n\ncommission as a defendant. Yet contrary to his assertion, see Blue\n\nBrief at 14-15, such a possibility was never mentioned below.           The\n\ndistrict court cannot be faulted for failing to anticipate such a\n\nrequest, and under the circumstances we see no reason to pursue it\n\nfurther.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
