Bate on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                          April 12, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.   On the afternoon of October 10,\n\n2004, two park rangers approached a stationary pickup truck in a\n\nparking lot inside Acadia National Park.      Looking inside, they\n\nobserved William McFarland sitting in the driver's seat with his\n\nupper body \"slumped over into the middle of the vehicle.\"     A key\n\nwas in the ignition and the front hood was warm.    The rangers had\n\ntrouble arousing the slumbering McFarland, but once awake, he\n\nproduced the vehicle's registration. When asked what he was doing,\n\nMcFarland responded that he had merely been taking a nap. Smelling\n\nan alcoholic beverage on his breath, the rangers asked McFarland to\n\nstep out of the truck.    Upon receiving McFarland's consent, they\n\nsearched the truck and discovered, among other things, a bag of\n\nmarijuana and two largely consumed bottles of hard alcohol. All of\n\nthe drugs and alcohol had been within McFarland's reach.   A wobbly\n\nMcFarland failed three field sobriety tests, and a subsequent\n\nintoxilyzer test confirmed that his blood-alcohol level was 0.31\n\npercent.\n\n           McFarland was charged with being \"knowingly and willfully\n\nin actual physical control of a motor vehicle in a park area . . .\n\nwhile he had a blood-alcohol level in excess of 0.08% and while he\n\nwas under the influence of alcohol to a degree that rendered [him]\n\nincapable of safe operation of said vehicle,\" see 36 C.F.R. §\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f4.23(a), a Class B Misdemeanor.1     Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3401, a\n\ntrial was held before a magistrate judge, who concluded that the\n\ngovernment had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that McFarland\n\nhad been in actual physical control of the truck while he was\n\nintoxicated. The magistrate judge inferred, based on the warmth of\n\nthe hood, that the truck had been operated shortly before the\n\nrangers arrived.     Combining that inference with the facts that\n\nMcFarland had been found seated behind the wheel of the truck with\n\nthe key in the ignition, the magistrate judge entered judgment\n\nagainst McFarland.\n\n            The district court affirmed.         See United States v.\n\nMcFarland, 369 F. Supp. 2d 54 (D. Me. 2005).2        Applying the same\n\nstandard of review we would apply to a district court's conviction,\n\nsee 18 U.S.C. § 3402; Fed. R. Crim. P. 58(g)(2)(D), the court\n\nconcluded   that   sufficient   evidence   was   presented   to   convict\n\nMcFarland of being in actual physical control of his truck while\n\nintoxicated, and that McFarland had fair notice that his actions\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although 36 C.F.R. § 4.23(a) does not appear to require a\nmens rea showing, the government charged that McFarland's violation\nwas done \"knowingly\" and \"willfully.\"       Because McFarland was\ncharged under this higher standard the sufficiency of the evidence\nis assessed accordingly. See United States v. Zanghi, 189 F.3d 71,\n79 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"The terms of an indictment can raise the bar\nof proof for the government to a higher level than the bare minimum\nrequired by the terms of a criminal statute.\").\n     2\n      McFarland was also convicted of possessing marijuana in a\nnational park, see 36 C.F.R. § 2.35(b)(2), but he has not appealed\nthat conviction.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fwere criminal.     McFarland, 369 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61.                   McFarland now\n\nappeals to this court.           See United States v. Forcellati, 610 F.2d\n\n25, 28 (1st Cir. 1979) (confirming our jurisdiction to review the\n\ndistrict court's appellate decision).\n\n            Our standard for reviewing the record is the same as that\n\napplied by the district court.                   See United States v. Bursey, 416\n\nF.3d 301, 305-06 (4th Cir. 2005).                      We will not reverse factual\n\nfindings    absent      clear     error,         but    legal    questions,    such       as\n\ninterpretation of the regulation and sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nare considered de novo.           See United States v. Camilo, 71 F.3d 984,\n\n986 (1st Cir. 1995).             In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, we\n\nevaluate    the    evidence       in       the    light    most    favorable       to    the\n\ngovernment,    accepting         all   \"reasonable           evidentiary    inferences\"\n\nconsonant with the verdict, and ask whether \"any rational trier of\n\nfact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"            United States v. Grace, 367 F.3d 29, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (quotations omitted).                  Notwithstanding the high burden\n\nof   proof,       the     government's             evidence       \"may    be   entirely\n\ncircumstantial,         and     need   not         exclude      every    hypothesis       of\n\ninnocence.\" United States v. Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quotations omitted).\n\n            McFarland advances three arguments on appeal.                      First, he\n\nchallenges the lower courts' interpretation of the regulation.                            He\n\nargues,    essentially,        that    a    sleeping      person    can    never    be    in\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\f\"actual\" physical control of a vehicle. Second, he argues that the\n\ngovernment failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that\n\nhe was \"knowingly and willfully in actual physical control\" of the\n\nvehicle while intoxicated.            Finally, he argues that the rule of\n\nlenity should apply because the term \"actual physical control\"\n\nfailed to give him sufficient warning that his conduct was illegal.\n\n             There is little case law concerning 36 C.F.R. § 4.23, and\n\nonly   one   court    opinion   has    discussed   the    meaning    of   \"actual\n\nphysical control.\" See United States v. Coleman, 750 F. Supp. 191,\n\n194-95   (W.D.       Va.   1990).        McFarland       advocates    a    narrow\n\ninterpretation of the regulation.             Although he concedes that a\n\nperson need not be driving the vehicle to be in actual physical\n\ncontrol of it, he contends that a sleeping person cannot exercise\n\nsuch control.     He cites to a line of state cases -- interpreting\n\nstatutes analogous to the regulation at issue here -- that have\n\nheld that a person sleeping in a vehicle is more likely using the\n\nvehicle for \"shelter\" than for transportation. See, e.g., Atkinson\n\nv. Maryland, 627 A.2d 1019, 1028-29 (Md. 1993); Harris v. Kentucky,\n\n709 S.W.2d 846, 847 (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).             He would have us reject\n\na contrary line of state cases that have more expansively construed\n\nthe same language. See, e.g., South Dakota v. Kitchens, 498 N.W.2d\n\n649, 652 (S.D. 1993); Illinois v. Davis, 562 N.E.2d 1152, 1155-57\n\n(Ill. App. Ct. 1990).       The latter line of cases is grounded on the\n\nidea that the intended purpose of an intoxicated driver statute is\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fto keep alcohol-impaired drivers off the public roads, and that an\n\nintoxicated, albeit sleeping, vehicle occupant presents a danger to\n\nthe public given the potential that he could awaken and resume\n\ndriving in an instant.      See, e.g., Kitchens, 498 N.W.2d at 652;\n\nDavis, 562 N.E.2d at 1156-57.3\n\n           We need not choose between these competing lines of cases\n\nhere because McFarland is the paradigmatic \"trout in the milk.\"\n\nHenry D. Thoreau, Journal, Nov. 11, 1850.         Given the evidence, the\n\nmagistrate judge as fact finder was free to infer how McFarland\n\ncame to be inebriated and asleep in the front seat of his pickup\n\ntruck with the key in the ignition.4             The logical and obvious\n\nanswer is that he placed himself in that position. Logic permitted\n\nthe magistrate judge to conclude that McFarland was awake and\n\nacting voluntarily when he entered his truck, when he consumed the\n\nalcohol, and when he placed the key in the ignition.            Although it\n\nis   unresolved   whether   McFarland   became    intoxicated    within   or\n\nwithout the truck, that question is of no consequence.             Because\n\n\n\n      3\n      The government contends that the cases McFarland cites are\ninapposite because they involved statutes forbidding only\n\"operation\" of a motor vehicle. Indeed, unlike 36 C.F.R. § 4.23,\nsome of the statutes use \"actual physical control\" as a conjunctive\nwith, or as a part of the definition of, \"operation.\" But because\nwe do not view the various state approaches as necessary to our\nanalysis, we bypass a lengthy discussion of those cases.\n      4\n      The evidence did not suggest any alternative explanation,\nsuch as that a third-party or parties were present or were\npotentially responsible for McFarland's intoxication, his placement\nin the truck, or the placement of his keys in the ignition.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthere is no evidence to contradict the inference that McFarland\n\nplaced himself at the scene, the magistrate judge reasonably could\n\nhave concluded that, at some point before he fell asleep, McFarland\n\nwas both drunk and awake, sitting in the front of his truck, with\n\nthe key in the ignition.5   See United States v. Escobar-de Jesus,\n\n187 F.3d 148, 175-76 (1st Cir. 1999) (a factfinder may make\n\ninferences in light of \"human experience\").\n\n          That is all the regulation requires. If \"actual physical\n\ncontrol\" is to mean anything short of \"operation,\" it must exist\n\nwhen the vehicle's owner is conscious and seated in the driver's\n\nseat with the key in the ignition.    See Coleman, 750 F. Supp. at\n\n194 (finding, on similar facts, that the defendant had \"actual\n\nphysical control\" of the vehicle); accord Bodner v. Delaware, 752\n\nA.2d 1169, 1173 (Del. 2000) (\"Insofar as 'physical control' refers\n\nto something other than 'driving' or 'operating,' . . . [it] is\n\nmeant to cover situations where an inebriated person is found in a\n\nparked vehicle under circumstances where the car, without too much\n\ndifficulty, might again be started and become a source of danger to\n\n\n     5\n      One line in the appellant's brief suggests that McFarland may\nhave gone to sleep after consuming the alcoholic beverage and\nbefore he became intoxicated. Whatever force this suggestion might\nhave if it had been sufficiently argued, the evidence, as we have\nnoted, is to the contrary. The hood of the truck was still warm,\nsuggesting recent operation, and, when tested later, McFarland's\nblood alcohol content was .31%.         While McFarland's counsel\nsuggested at oral argument that the test may have shown a rising\nblood alcohol content, the totality of the evidence before the\nmagistrate judge easily supported an inference of intoxication\nprior to McFarland's falling asleep.\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe operator, to others, or to property.\") (quoting Minnesota v.\n\nStarfield, 481 N.W.2d 834, 837 (Minn. 1992)).   Indeed, McFarland's\n\nreply brief concedes that a \"better description of 'actual physical\n\ncontrol'\" would include \"an owner in the driver's seat who is\n\nawake.\"   The government therefore presented sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport McFarland's conviction.\n\n            We also reject McFarland's arguments that the government\n\nfailed to produce sufficient evidence of his state of mind, and\n\nthat \"actual physical control\" has an ambiguous application in his\n\ncase.   In the absence of any alternative explanation, the evidence\n\nthat McFarland was found drunk and asleep behind the wheel of his\n\ntruck with the key in the ignition was also sufficient to support\n\na finding that he knowingly and willfully placed himself in that\n\nposition.    See United States v. Bay State Ambulance and Hosp.\n\nRental Serv., Inc., 874 F.2d 20, 33 (1st Cir. 1989) (defining\n\n\"knowingly\" and \"willfully\").    Further, we view the regulation as\n\nunambiguously applying to an intoxicated but conscious person who\n\nhas freely chosen to sit behind the wheel of a vehicle with the key\n\nin the ignition.    See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 66\n\n(1997) (\"The rule [of lenity] does not apply when a statute is\n\nunambiguous.\").\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

Looking inside, they observed William McFarland sitting in the driver's seat with his upper body \"slumped over into the middle of the vehicle.\" A key was in the ignition and the front hood was warm. The rangers had trouble arousing the slumbering McFarland, but once awake, he produced the vehicle's registration. When asked what he was doing, McFarland responded that he had merely been taking a nap. Smelling an alcoholic beverage on his breath, the rangers asked McFarland to step out of the truck. Upon receiving McFarland's consent, they searched the truck and discovered, among other things, a bag of marijuana and two largely consumed bottles of hard alcohol. All of the drugs and alcohol had been within McFarland's reach. A wobbly McFarland failed three field sobriety tests, and a subsequent intoxilyzer test confirmed that his blood-alcohol level was 0.31 percent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McFarland was charged with being \"knowingly and willfully in actual physical control of a motor vehicle in a park area... while he had a blood-alcohol level in excess of 0.08% and while he was under the influence of alcohol to a degree that rendered [him] incapable of safe operation of said vehicle,\" <i>see</i> 36 C.F.R. &#167; 4.23(a), a Class B Misdemeanor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3401, a trial was held before a magistrate judge, who concluded that the government had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that McFarland had been in actual physical control of the truck while he was intoxicated.

First, he challenges the lower courts' interpretation of the regulation. He argues, essentially, that a sleeping person can never be in \"actual\" physical control of a vehicle. Second, he argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that he was \"knowingly and willfully in actual physical control\" of the vehicle while intoxicated. Finally, he argues that the rule of lenity should apply because the term \"actual physical control\" failed to give him sufficient warning that his conduct was illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little case law concerning 36 C.F.R. &#167; 4.23, and only one court opinion has discussed the meaning of \"actual physical control.\" <i>See United States v. Coleman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1473699\"><a href=\"/opinion/1473699/united-states-v-coleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 194-95 (W.D.Va. 1990). McFarland advocates a narrow interpretation of the regulation. Although he concedes that a person need not be driving the vehicle to be in actual physical control of it, he contends that a sleeping person cannot exercise such control. He cites to a line of state cases&#8212;interpreting statutes analogous to the regulation at issue here&#8212;that have held that a person sleeping in a vehicle is more likely using the vehicle for \"shelter\" than for transportation. <i>See, e.g., Atkinson v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2337244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2337244/atkinson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2337244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2337244/atkinson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span>, 1028-29 (1993); <i>Harris v.

He would have us reject a contrary line of state cases that have more expansively construed the same language. <i>See, e.g., State v. Kitchens,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></span>, 652 (S.D.1993); <i>Illinois v.

The latter line of cases is grounded on the idea that the intended purpose of an intoxicated driver statute is to keep alcohol-impaired drivers off the public roads, and that an intoxicated, albeit sleeping, vehicle occupant presents a danger to the public given the potential that he could awaken and resume driving in an instant. <i>See, e.g., Kitchens,</i> 498 N.W.2d at 652; <i>Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2154020\"><a href=\"/opinion/2154020/people-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Thoreau, <i>Journal,</i> Nov. 11, 1850. Given the evidence, the magistrate judge as fact finder was free to infer how McFarland came to be inebriated and asleep in the front seat of his pickup truck with the key in the ignition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The logical and obvious answer is that he placed himself in that position. Logic permitted the magistrate judge to conclude that McFarland was awake and acting voluntarily when he entered his truck, when he consumed the alcohol, and when he placed the key in the ignition. Although it is unresolved whether McFarland became intoxicated within or without the truck, that question is of no consequence. Because there is no evidence to contradict the inference that McFarland placed himself at the scene, the magistrate judge reasonably could have concluded that, at some point before he fell asleep, McFarland was both <i>drunk and awake,</i> sitting in the front of his truck, with the key in the ignition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See United States v.
