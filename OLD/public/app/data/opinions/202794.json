Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n               Selya and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert E. Richardson, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellant.\n     Leslie Feldman-Rumpler for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 13, 2007\n\f           SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.          In this interlocutory\n\nappeal, the government challenges a suppression order entered in\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nIt assigns error both to the district court's determination that an\n\ninvestigatory encounter was undertaken without reasonable suspicion\n\nand to the court's assessment of when a seizure occurred.          We have\n\njurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3731.\n\n           The district court made the challenged rulings after\n\nholding an evidentiary hearing and mulling the impact of a unique\n\nset of circumstances. Judgments of this sort are notoriously fact-\n\nsensitive, and an appellate court should defer in large measure to\n\nthe trial court's superior coign of vantage.              So it is here:\n\nalthough we, if sitting as a court of first instance, might not\n\nhave drawn the same inferences from the underlying facts, we cannot\n\nsay that the district court lacked the right to draw the inferences\n\nthat it did.      Nor can we say that, given those inferences, the\n\ncourt   abused    its   discretion     in   suppressing    the   evidence.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the suppression order.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In this case, the defendant stands accused of conspiracy\n\nto transport, and the transportation of, illegal aliens.            See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), (a)(1)(A)(v)(I).       We begin our account\n\nwith a concise summary of the events leading to those charges, as\n\nsupportably found by the district court.          See United States v.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fRomain, 393 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Lee, 317\n\nF.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          On the morning of February 7, 2005, defendant-appellee\n\nBenjamin Espinoza was a front-seat passenger in a commuter van\n\nbearing Texas license plates that was traveling through Boston on\n\nInterstate 93. The van piqued the interest of Glen Fitzpatrick, an\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, who was en route\n\nto his office in an unmarked car.\n\n          Fitzpatrick was aware that, within the past year, Boston-\n\nbased ICE agents had intercepted at least two similar extended-\n\npassenger vans engaged in the illegal transportation of aliens.\n\nAlthough the van had tinted windows, he could see the silhouettes\n\nof several persons (other than the driver and front-seat passenger)\n\ninside it. Consequently, he started following the van while at the\n\nsame time contacting sector communications. This inquiry yielded\n\ninformation that the van was registered to Jesús Zendejas of\n\nDallas, Texas.   Fitzpatrick recognized Zendejas's name as having\n\nappeared on a suspect's telephone toll records in an earlier ICE\n\ninvestigation of human smuggling — an investigation that had not\n\nyet resulted in the filing of any criminal charges.\n\n          Fitzpatrick continued to follow the van surreptitiously\n\nfor approximately twenty-five minutes.   At around that time, the\n\nvan left the expressway and proceeded on the Revere Beach Parkway.\n\nIn due course, it pulled over and parked near a sandwich shop in\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fEverett, Massachusetts.           The driver, Ambrosio Villareal, did not\n\nturn off the engine but let it idle.              No one disembarked from the\n\nvan.\n\n               Fitzpatrick parked his car some fifty feet away in an\n\nadjacent lot and approached the stopped van on foot.                  He wore\n\ncivilian clothes and carried a holstered firearm.               Upon reaching\n\nthe van, he flashed his badge and identified himself to Villareal\n\nas an immigration officer.               Speaking in Spanish, he requested\n\nidentification.       Villareal complied.          Then Fitzpatrick, using a\n\nhand motion, \"directed Villareal to shut off the engine.\"              United\n\nStates v. Espinoza, No. 05-10060, slip op. at 1 (D. Mass. June 15,\n\n2006)       (unpublished)   (D.    Ct.    Op.).     The   identification   that\n\nVillareal produced consisted of a Texas driver's license, an alien\n\nregistration card, and a business card indicating his affiliation\n\nwith a company called \"Mi Tierra.\"\n\n               In approximately the same time frame, Fitzpatrick asked\n\nthe defendant for identification.1             The defendant proffered a Texas\n\ndriver's license and, in response to a direct question, informed\n\nFitzpatrick that he was a naturalized citizen.               To buttress that\n\n\n        1\n      The government claims that the defendant volunteered\ninformation in English during Fitzpatrick's initial conversation\nwith Villareal. This characterization is premised on Fitzpatrick's\ntestimony that he recalls the defendant interjecting that he and\nVillareal were both employees of Mi Tierra. The district court\nappears not to credit this testimony.    At any rate, even if we\nassume, favorably to the government, that this interjection\noccurred as Fitzpatrick described it, the result that we reach\nwould not be affected.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fstatement, he showed Fitzpatrick a photocopy of his naturalization\n\npapers.        A    conversation        ensued      regarding       Mi   Tierra       and    the\n\nemployment of Villareal and the defendant as drivers for that firm.\n\n               Fitzpatrick       next      turned       his    attention    to    the       five\n\npassengers         in   the   rear    of   the     van.        He   questioned        them    in\n\nPortuguese and learned that three of the five had been arrested in\n\nTexas by border patrol officers on February 4, 2005 — three days\n\nearlier.       All three had received notices to appear for removal\n\nproceedings. The other two men carried Brazilian passports but had\n\nno    other    identification.             Upon    completing       this    phase      of    his\n\ninquiry, Fitzpatrick read Villareal and the defendant their Miranda\n\nrights.       See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966).\n\nII.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n               In   examining        the   presence       or    absence    of    reasonable\n\nsuspicion and the timing of a seizure, we deal with mixed questions\n\nof law and fact.              Each of those questions requires a searching\n\nappraisal of the particular factual context.\n\n               As   to   the    first      issue    —    the    existence       vel    non    of\n\nreasonable         suspicion     —   we    must     \"assess      the     totality      of    the\n\ncircumstances, on a case-specific basis, in order to ascertain\n\nwhether the officer had a particularized, objectively reasonable\n\nbasis for suspecting wrongdoing.\"                    United States v. Coplin, 463\n\nF.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United States v. Arvizu, 534\n\nU.S. 266, 273 (2002)).               The same is true of the seizure issue,\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fwhich necessitates careful consideration of \"all the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the encounter.\"   Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 439\n\n(1991).\n\n          Given the textured nature of these inquiries, appellate\n\ncourts must proceed circumspectly and with regard for the district\n\ncourt's superior vantage point.     See United States v. Zapata, 18\n\nF.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that an appellate court\n\nreviewing the disposition of a suppression motion must \"exhibit\n\ngreat respect for the presider's opportunity to hear the testimony,\n\nobserve the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first\n\nhand\"). Consequently, we will disturb the trier's factual findings\n\nonly if they are clearly erroneous.2    See Coplin, 463 F.3d at 100;\n\nsee also Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d\n\n575, 576 (1st Cir. 1989) (observing that disputes over facts are\n\n\"the staples of a trial court's diet and comprise an unappetizing,\n\nusually unnourishing, bill of fare for appellate digestion\").     In\n\nthis process, credibility calls — with only rare exceptions — are\n\nthe district court's prerogative.     See United States v. Rutkowski,\n\n877 F.2d 139, 144 (1st Cir. 1989).      Legal conclusions, including\n\nultimate constitutional determinations (such as the sufficiency of\n\nthe facts as found to support a conclusion that, for example,\n\n\n\n     2\n      A finding is clearly erroneous only when, upon a careful\nreview of the record, a court is left with a \"definite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v.\nU.S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948).\n\n                                -6-\n\freasonable suspicion exists or a seizure occurred), engender de\n\nnovo review.      See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699\n\n(1996); Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.\n\n            We remain mindful throughout that when two or more\n\nlegitimate interpretations of the evidence exist, the factfinder's\n\nchoice between them cannot be deemed clearly erroneous.                     See\n\nRomain, 393 F.3d at 70; see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470\n\nU.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).         Thus, if the district court chooses to\n\ndraw   a   reasonable    (though      not    inevitable)   inference   from   a\n\nparticular combination of facts, that inference is entitled to\n\ndeference.    See Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 699.\n\nIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            We subdivide our substantive discussion of the district\n\ncourt's    decision     into    two    segments,     corresponding     to   the\n\ngovernment's twin lines of argument.\n\n                        A.     Reasonable Suspicion.\n\n            Typically, brief investigatory stops can be grounded on\n\nreasonable suspicion as opposed to, say, probable cause. See Terry\n\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968); Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.                     That\n\nstandard is not self-elucidating; we have warned before that the\n\nreasonable suspicion calculus \"defies precise definition.\"              United\n\nStates v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).               No prefigured\n\nmold or cookie-cutter design exists to delineate whether or not a\n\nlaw enforcement officer, at a given time and place, acted on the\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fbasis of reasonable suspicion.           Instead, that evaluation comprises\n\n\"a fact-sensitive task, bound up in the warp and woof of the\n\nsurrounding circumstances.\"            Id. at 8.\n\n            Of course, precedent plays an important role in our\n\nsystem of justice, and the case law offers some general guidance.\n\nA finding of reasonable suspicion requires \"'a particularized and\n\nobjective basis' for suspecting the person stopped of criminal\n\nactivity.\"       Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 696 (quoting United States v.\n\nCortez,    449    U.S.   411,     417-18     (1981)).    This   particularity\n\nrequirement means, in effect, that such a finding must be \"grounded\n\nin specific and articulable facts.\"             United States v. Hensley, 469\n\nU.S. 221, 229 (1985); see United States v. Monteiro, 447 F.3d 39,\n\n43 (1st Cir. 2006).      Moreover, the objective nature of the inquiry\n\nensures that courts will focus not on what the officer himself\n\nbelieved but, rather, on what a reasonable officer in his position\n\nwould have thought.          Romain, 393 F.3d at 74.\n\n            Here, the government alleges that Fitzpatrick initiated\n\nthe encounter with the van's occupants based on a reasonable\n\nsuspicion of criminal activity, that is, a suspicion that they were\n\nengaged in the illegal transportation of undocumented aliens.               The\n\ndistrict court disagreed.          It found, after hearing Fitzpatrick's\n\ntestimony, that his rationale for following the van, approaching\n\nit, and commencing an investigation of the individuals within was\n\nbottomed   on     a   pale    patina    of     facts.   These   included:   (i)\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fFitzpatrick's observation of an extended-passenger van bearing\n\nTexas license plates traveling on a highway in Massachusetts; (ii)\n\nhis awareness that the van was registered to Zendejas, whose name\n\nhad   surfaced     (albeit    not    as     a    target)   during   a   previous\n\ninvestigation for human smuggling; and (iii) his prior knowledge of\n\nthe interception of \"two and perhaps three similar passenger vans\n\nthat were transporting illegal aliens\" in the Boston area within\n\nthe past year.     D. Ct. Op. at 3.       The district court commented that\n\nthis patina, pale to begin with, faded even more in light of\n\ncountervailing considerations such as Fitzpatrick's admission that\n\nthe Boston area was not a place generally associated with the\n\nsmuggling of illegal aliens and the fact that he observed nothing\n\nunusual    or    unlawful    about    the       van's   operation   during   his\n\nsurveillance.      Id. at 3-4.       Indeed, the only \"peculiarity\" that\n\nFitzpatrick had noted about the van \"was that it bore Texas\n\nplates.\"   Id. at 5.\n\n           Weighing the facts as a whole, the court concluded that\n\nFitzpatrick's actions in approaching the van and starting to\n\nquestion its occupants were \"based on nothing more than a hunch.\"\n\nId.   With specific reference to the Zendejas connection,3 the court\n\n\n      3\n      Fitzpatrick testified on cross-examination that one of the\npreviously intercepted vans was owned by Alfonso Garza, reputed to\nbe a former business partner of Zendejas. The district court found\nthat this information was new to the equation; Fitzpatrick did not\nknow about this connection when he decided to follow and approach\nthe van. See D. Ct. Op. at 3 n.2. That finding was not clearly\nerroneous.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fadded that the \"tendrils of information known to Fitzpatrick about\n\nthis individual [at the time of the encounter were] insufficient to\n\ntransform the hunch into reasonable suspicion.\"             Id. at 5-6.\n\n          The government does not claim any error in the district\n\ncourt's findings of raw fact.            It does, however, attack with\n\nconsiderable ferocity the inferences drawn by the court from the\n\nfacts as found.    This attack overlooks that those inferences, too,\n\nare subject to clear error review.        See Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 699;\n\nZapata, 18 F.3d at 975.     Using that barometer, our function is not\n\nto decide whether we, if sitting as arbiters of the facts, would\n\nhave drawn the same inferences but, rather, to determine whether\n\nthe district court's chosen inferences are plausible (and, thus,\n\npermissible) based on the raw facts as supportably found.                 See\n\nRomain, 393 F.3d at 70.\n\n          In this instance, we think that the district court's\n\ninferences, though not compelled by the facts, are nevertheless\n\nreasonable.   Accordingly, they pass muster.\n\n          The requirement of reasonable suspicion as a basis for an\n\ninvestigatory    stop   reflects   the    core   concerns    of   the   Fourth\n\nAmendment.      See Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 273.           Here, Fitzpatrick\n\napproached the van endowed only with the scanty knowledge recounted\n\nby the district court.     Given the nebulous nature of what he knew\n\nand the importance of the Fourth Amendment interests at stake, the\n\ncourt's conclusion that Fitzpatrick's actions were predicated on a\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fhunch,   bereft    of   the    particularity     required       for   reasonable\n\nsuspicion, was not clearly erroneous.            See id.    Put another way,\n\nthe record yields no definite and firm conviction that the district\n\ncourt's conclusion was mistaken.\n\n                                B.    Seizure.\n\n           Our    validation    of     the   lower    court's    finding    that\n\nFitzpatrick lacked reasonable suspicion at the outset of the\n\nencounter does not end our odyssey.          In this case, the agent played\n\nno part in bringing the van to a halt; the driver stopped of his\n\nown   volition    and   for   his    own   reasons.     Thus,     even   without\n\nreasonable suspicion, Fitzpatrick had a right to approach the\n\nparked vehicle and talk to its occupants if that interview was\n\npurely consensual. See United States v. Barry, 394 F.3d 1070, 1075\n\n(8th Cir. 2005) (holding that the Fourth Amendment permits an\n\nofficer to approach a parked vehicle without any show of force and\n\nquestion the occupants); see also United States v. Smith, 423 F.3d\n\n25, 30 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding to like effect as to a pedestrian).\n\n           The district court found, however, that this encounter\n\nwas not consensual because a seizure occurred at the point when\n\nFitzpatrick ordered Villareal to shut off the engine.                    On that\n\nbasis, the court granted the defendant's motion to suppress the\n\nstatements made and papers produced in the interval between the\n\ncommand and the furnishing of Miranda warnings (including, of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fcourse, the fruits of those revelations).              We turn now to that\n\nfinding.\n\n            The case law offers certain guideposts to assist in\n\ndetermining the nature of an encounter between law enforcement\n\nofficers and civilians. Not every police-initiated conversation is\n\na seizure.    See, e.g., Smith, 423 F.3d at 30; Barry, 394 F.3d at\n\n1075.      Thus,   a   law   enforcement    officer   does    not    trigger    an\n\nindividual's Fourth Amendment protections simply by approaching the\n\nperson in public and asking routine questions.               United States v.\n\nDrayton, 536 U.S. 194, 200-01 (2002); Smith, 423 F.3d at 30.                   The\n\ntrigger point for Fourth Amendment purposes is the presence or\n\nabsence of some cognizable coercion or constraint.                  See Drayton,\n\n536 U.S. at 201 (\"If a reasonable person would feel free to\n\nterminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized.\");\n\nUnited States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (explaining\n\nthat \"[a]s long as the person to whom questions are put remains\n\nfree to disregard the questions and walk away,\" Fourth Amendment\n\nprotections are not implicated).\n\n            The test is objective: Would a reasonable person standing\n\nin the shoes of the individual who is approached have felt free to\n\ncease interaction with the officer and depart?               Ornelas, 517 U.S.\n\nat 693; Smith, 423 F.3d at 28.       If an objectively reasonable person\n\nwould have felt compelled to stay, the encounter amounts to an\n\ninvestigatory stop in derogation of the defendant's constitutional\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\frights unless accompanied by, at the least, reasonable suspicion.\n\nSee Terry, 392 U.S. at 21; Coplin, 463 F.3d at 100.\n\n          Here, the parties and the district court have framed the\n\ninquiry as a question of when the defendant was effectively seized\n\nby Fitzpatrick.4   The government concedes that a seizure occurred\n\nat the point when Fitzpatrick informed the defendant of his Miranda\n\nrights.   The defendant, however, places the seizure at an earlier\n\nstep in the progression.   The timing is of decretory significance\n\nbecause the evidence that the district court suppressed consisted\n\nmainly of statements made and documents tendered in the interval\n\nbetween these two moments in time.\n\n          The district court resolved this quandary in favor of the\n\ndefendant. In doing so, the court relied upon the following facts:\n\n(i) Fitzpatrick, identifying himself as an ICE officer and wearing\n\na holstered firearm, approached the van; (ii) he displayed his\n\nbadge and began asking questions; and (iii) with a commanding tone\n\nand manner, he indicated that he wanted the driver to shut off the\n\nvan's engine.   D. Ct. Op. at 1-2.    Although Fitzpatrick protested\n\nduring the evidentiary hearing that the nonverbal command to shut\n\noff the engine was given solely to facilitate conversation, the\n\n\n\n     4\n      In accepting this terminology, we do not imply any limitation\non the doctrine that coercion, unaccompanied by reasonable\nsuspicion, is constitutionally unacceptable. See Florida v. Royer,\n460 U.S. 491, 498 (1983) (stating that an individual \"may not be\ndetained even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds for\ndoing so\").\n\n                               -13-\n\fdistrict   court   reasonably   concluded    that   the    absence   of   any\n\nevidence indicating that the van's occupants knew or intuited this\n\nunspoken limitation was extremely significant.            See id. at 2 n.1.\n\n           In our view, this is a near-classic case of a set of\n\nfacts that might — depending on the trier's interpretation —\n\nsupport either of two competing inferences.           On the one hand, it\n\nseems plausible that a reasonable person in the defendant's shoes\n\nmight have considered the encounter consensual and non-custodial.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems equally plausible that a reasonable\n\nperson in the defendant's shoes might have felt constrained to\n\nremain seated in the stopped van and to respond to the agent's\n\nqueries.     The    district    court     concluded    that    the   latter\n\ninterpretation was the more likely scenario and, thus, ruled that\n\nFitzpatrick had effectively seized the defendant when he ordered\n\nVillareal to shut down the engine. Because this inference from the\n\nfacts as found was not clearly erroneous, the district court did\n\nnot err in ordering suppression.         See United States v. Ladd, 885\n\nF.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir. 1989) (cautioning that appellate courts\n\nshould not intrude when \"a trier chooses among plausible (albeit\n\ncompeting) inferences\").\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the government\n\nargues that this case is controlled by our decision in Smith.             In\n\nour view, however, these two cases are not fair congeners.                 In\n\nSmith, the district court determined that a seizure had occurred\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fwhen two police officers exited their cruiser, approached the\n\ndefendant on a public street, and asked him for identification.\n\n423 F.3d at 27.     We reversed the district court's consequent grant\n\nof a motion to suppress because the historical facts as found by\n\nthe court did not support a reasonable inference that the defendant\n\nhad been seized.      Id. at 30.    The court's inference flew in the\n\nteeth of well-settled law that police officers who do no more than\n\napproach individuals without a show of authority and ask routine\n\nquestions will not be held to have generated a sense of coercion.\n\nId. at 29-30.\n\n            Here, unlike in Smith, the officer did more than merely\n\napproach and propound routine questions. According to the district\n\ncourt, which made a supportable factual finding in this regard,\n\nFitzpatrick commanded the driver to shut off the engine.           See D.\n\nCt. Op. at 2, 4.    That command, in the circumstances of this case,\n\nmay not have compelled a finding of coercion but it supports such\n\na finding (and, thus, a finding that a seizure occurred then and\n\nthere).\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. The district court's conclusion\n\nthat a seizure occurred, unaccompanied by reasonable suspicion, is\n\nconsonant    with   the   facts    as   found   and   with   the   record.\n\nAccordingly, we uphold the district court's order suppressing the\n\nevidence in question.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -16-\n\f",

It assigns error both to the district court's determination that an investigatory encounter was undertaken without reasonable suspicion and to the court's assessment of when a seizure occurred. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made the challenged rulings after holding an evidentiary hearing and mulling the impact of a unique set of circumstances. Judgments of this sort are notoriously fact-sensitive, and an appellate court should defer in large measure to the trial court's superior coign of vantage. So it is here: although we, if sitting as a court of first instance, might not have drawn the same inferences from the underlying facts, we cannot say that the district court lacked the right to draw the inferences that it did. Nor can we say that, given those inferences, the court abused its discretion in suppressing the evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the suppression order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the defendant stands accused of conspiracy to transport, and the transportation of, illegal aliens. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), (a)(1)(A)(v)(I). We begin our account with a concise summary of the events leading to those charges, as supportably found by the district court. <i>See United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of February 7, 2005, defendant-appellee Benjamin Espinoza was a front-seat passenger in a commuter van bearing Texas license plates that was traveling through Boston on Interstate 93. The van piqued the interest of Glen Fitzpatrick, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, who was en route to his office in an unmarked car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick was aware that, within the past year, Boston-based ICE agents had intercepted at least two similar extended-passenger vans engaged in the illegal transportation of aliens. Although the van had tinted windows, he could see the silhouettes of several persons (other than the driver and front-seat passenger) inside it. Consequently, he started following the van while at the same time contacting sector communications. This inquiry yielded information that the van was registered to Jes&#250;s Zendejas of Dallas, Texas. Fitzpatrick recognized Zendejas's name as having appeared on a suspect's telephone toll records in an earlier ICE investigation of human smuggling &#8212; an investigation that had not yet resulted in the filing of any criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick continued to follow the van surreptitiously for approximately twenty-five minutes. At around that time, the van left the expressway and proceeded on the Revere Beach Parkway. In due course, it pulled over and parked near a sandwich shop in Everett, Massachusetts. The driver, Ambrosio Villareal, did not turn off the engine but let it idle. No one disembarked from the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick parked his car some fifty feet away in an adjacent lot and approached the stopped van on foot. He wore civilian clothes and carried a holstered firearm. Upon reaching the van, he flashed his badge and identified himself to Villareal as an immigration officer. Speaking in Spanish, he requested identification. Villareal complied. Then Fitzpatrick, using a hand motion, \"directed Villareal to shut off the engine.\" <i>United States v. Espinoza,</i> 433 F.Supp.2d 186, 188 (D.Mass. 2006) (D.Ct.Op.). The identification that Villareal produced consisted of a Texas driver's license, an alien registration card, and a business card indicating his affiliation with a company called \"Mi Tierra.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In approximately the same time frame, Fitzpatrick asked the defendant for identification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The defendant proffered a Texas driver's license and, in response to a direct question, informed Fitzpatrick that he was a naturalized citizen. To buttress that statement, he showed Fitzpatrick a photocopy of his naturalization papers. A conversation ensued regarding Mi Tierra and the employment of Villareal and the defendant as drivers for that firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick next turned his attention to the five passengers in the rear of the van. He questioned them in Portuguese and learned that three of the five had been arrested in Texas by border patrol officers on February 4, 2005 &#8212; three days earlier. All three had received notices to appear for removal proceedings. The other two men carried Brazilian passports but had no other identification. Upon completing this phase of his inquiry, Fitzpatrick read Villareal and the defendant their <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 444-45, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining the presence or absence of reasonable suspicion and the timing of a seizure, we deal with mixed questions of law and fact. Each of those questions requires a searching appraisal of the particular factual context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first issue &#8212; the existence vel non of reasonable suspicion &#8212; we must \"assess the totality of the circumstances, on a case &#8212; specific basis, in order to ascertain whether the officer had a particularized, objectively reasonable basis for suspecting wrongdoing.\" <i>United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>United States v. Arvizu,</i> 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)). The same is true of the seizure issue, which necessitates careful consideration of \"all the circumstances surrounding the encounter.\" <i>Florida v. Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. 429, 439, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the textured nature of these inquiries, appellate courts must proceed circumspectly and with regard for the district court's superior vantage point. <i>See United States v. Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that an appellate court reviewing the disposition of a suppression motion must \"exhibit great respect for the presider's opportunity to hear the testimony, observe the witnesses' demeanor, and evaluate the facts at first hand\"). Consequently, we will disturb the trier's factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d at 100; <i>see also Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 880 F.2d 575, 576 (1st Cir.1989) (observing that disputes over facts are \"the staples of a trial court's diet and comprise an unappetizing, usually unnourishing, bill of fare for appellate digestion\"). In this process, credibility calls &#8212; with only rare exceptions &#8212; are the district court's prerogative. <i>See United States v. Rutkowski,</i> 877 F.2d 139, 144 (1st Cir.1989). Legal conclusions, including ultimate constitutional determinations (such as the sufficiency of the facts as found to support a conclusion that, for example, reasonable suspicion exists or a seizure occurred), engender de novo review. <i>See Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We remain mindful throughout that when two or more legitimate interpretations of the evidence exist, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be deemed clearly erroneous. <i>See Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 70; <i>see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Thus, if the district court chooses to draw a reasonable (though not inevitable) inference from a particular combination of facts, that inference is entitled to deference. <i>See Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We subdivide our substantive discussion of the district court's decision into two segments, corresponding to the government's twin lines of argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Reasonable Suspicion.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, brief investigatory stops can be grounded on reasonable suspicion as opposed to, say, probable cause. <i>See Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975. That standard is not self-elucidating; we have warned before that the reasonable suspicion calculus \"defies precise definition.\" <i>United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001). No prefigured mold or cookie-cutter design exists to delineate whether or not a law enforcement officer, at a given time and place, acted on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Instead, that evaluation comprises \"a fact-sensitive task, bound up in the warp and woof of the surrounding circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, precedent plays an important role in our system of justice, and the case law offers some general guidance. A finding of reasonable suspicion requires \"`a particularized and objective basis' for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity.\" <i>Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657 (quoting <i>United States v. Cortez,</i> 449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). This particularity requirement means, in effect, that such a finding must be \"grounded in specific and articulable facts.\" <i>United States v. Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. 221, 229, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985); <i>see United States v. Monteiro,</i> 447 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.2006). Moreover, the objective nature of the inquiry ensures that courts will focus not on what the officer himself believed but, rather, on what a reasonable officer in his position would have thought. <i>Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government alleges that Fitzpatrick initiated the encounter with the van's occupants based on a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, that is, a suspicion that they were engaged in the illegal transportation of undocumented aliens. The district court disagreed. It found, after hearing Fitzpatrick's testimony, that his rationale for following the van, approaching it, and commencing an investigation of the individuals within was bottomed on a pale patina of facts. These included: (i) Fitzpatrick's observation of an extended-passenger van bearing Texas license plates traveling on a highway in Massachusetts; (ii) his awareness that the van was registered to Zendejas, whose name had surfaced (albeit not as a target) during a previous investigation for human smuggling; and (iii) his prior knowledge of the interception of \"two and perhaps three similar passenger vans that were transporting illegal aliens\" in the Boston area within the past year. D. Ct. Op. at 189. The district court commented that this patina, pale to begin with, faded even more in light of countervailing considerations such as Fitzpatrick's admission that the Boston area was not a place generally associated with the smuggling of illegal aliens and the fact that he observed nothing unusual or unlawful about the van's operation during his surveillance. <i>Id.</i> at 190. Indeed, the only \"peculiarity\" that Fitzpatrick had noted about the van \"was that it bore Texas plates.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weighing the facts as a whole, the court concluded that Fitzpatrick's actions in approaching the van and starting to question its occupants were \"based on nothing more than a hunch.\" <i>Id.</i> With specific reference to the Zendejas connection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the court added that the \"tendrils of information known to Fitzpatrick about this individual [at the time of the encounter were] insufficient to transform the hunch into reasonable suspicion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does not claim any error in the district court's findings of raw fact. It does, however, attack with considerable ferocity the inferences drawn by the court from the facts as found. This attack overlooks that those inferences, too, are subject to clear error review. <i>See Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657; <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975. Using that barometer, our function is not to decide whether we, if sitting as arbiters of the facts, would have drawn the same inferences but, rather, to determine whether the district court's chosen inferences are plausible (and, thus, permissible) based on the raw facts as supportably found. <i>See Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, we think that the district court's inferences, though not compelled by the facts, are nevertheless reasonable. Accordingly, they pass muster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement of reasonable suspicion as a basis for an investigatory stop reflects the core concerns of the Fourth Amendment. <i>See Arvizu,</i> 534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. 744. Here, Fitzpatrick approached the van endowed only with the scanty knowledge recounted by the district court. Given the nebulous nature of what he knew and the importance of the Fourth Amendment interests at stake, the court's conclusion that Fitzpatrick's actions were predicated on a hunch, bereft of the particularity required for reasonable suspicion, was not clearly erroneous. <i>See id.</i> Put another way, the record yields no definite and firm conviction that the district court's conclusion was mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Seizure.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our validation of the lower court's finding that Fitzpatrick lacked reasonable suspicion at the outset of the encounter does not end our odyssey. In this case, the agent played no part in bringing the van to a halt; the driver stopped of his own volition and for his own reasons. Thus, even without reasonable suspicion, Fitzpatrick had a right to approach the parked vehicle and talk to its occupants if that interview was purely consensual. <i>See United States v. Barry,</i> 394 F.3d 1070, 1075 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to approach a parked vehicle without any show of force and question the occupants); <i>see also United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2005) (holding to like effect as to a pedestrian).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, however, that this encounter was not consensual because a seizure occurred at the point when Fitzpatrick ordered Villareal to shut off the engine. On that basis, the court granted the defendant's motion to suppress the statements made and papers produced in the interval between the command and the furnishing of <i>Miranda</i> warnings (including, of course, the fruits of those revelations). We turn now to that finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law offers certain guideposts to assist in determining the nature of an encounter between law enforcement officers and civilians. Not every police-initiated conversation is a seizure. <i>See, e.g., Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 30; <i>Barry,</i> 394 F.3d at 1075. Thus, a law enforcement officer does not trigger an individual's Fourth Amendment protections simply by approaching the person in public and asking routine questions. <i>United States v. Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. 194, 200-01, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002); <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 30. The trigger point for Fourth Amendment purposes is the presence or absence of some cognizable coercion or constraint. <i>See Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 201, 122 S.Ct. 2105 (\"If a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized.\"); <i>United States v. Mendenhall,</i> 446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (explaining that \"[a]s long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away,\" Fourth Amendment protections are not implicated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The test is objective: Would a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the individual who is approached have felt free to cease interaction with the officer and depart? <i>Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 693, 116 S.Ct. 1657; <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 28. If an objectively reasonable person would have felt compelled to stay, the encounter amounts to an investigatory stop in derogation of the defendant's constitutional rights unless accompanied by, at the least, reasonable suspicion. <i>See Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868; <i>Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d at 100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the parties and the district court have framed the inquiry as a question of when the defendant was effectively seized by Fitzpatrick.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government concedes that a seizure occurred at the point when Fitzpatrick informed the defendant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. The defendant, however, places the seizure at an earlier step in the progression. The timing is of decretory significance because the evidence that the district court suppressed consisted mainly of statements made and documents tendered in the interval between these two moments in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court resolved this quandary in favor of the defendant. In doing so, the court relied upon the following facts: (i) Fitzpatrick, identifying himself as an ICE officer and wearing a holstered firearm, approached the van; (ii) he displayed his badge and began asking questions; and (iii) with a commanding tone and manner, he indicated that he wanted the driver to shut off the van's engine. D. Ct. Op. at 188. Although Fitzpatrick protested during the evidentiary hearing that the nonverbal command to shut off the engine was given solely to facilitate conversation, the district court reasonably concluded that the absence of any evidence indicating that the van's occupants knew or intuited this unspoken limitation was extremely significant. <i>See id.</i> at 188 n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this is a near-classic case of a set of facts that might &#8212; depending on the trier's interpretation &#8212; support either of two competing inferences. On the one hand, it seems plausible that a reasonable person in the defendant's shoes might have considered the encounter consensual and non-custodial. On the other hand, it seems equally plausible that a reasonable person in the defendant's shoes might have felt constrained to remain seated in the stopped van and to respond to the agent's queries. The district court concluded that the latter interpretation was the more likely scenario and, thus, ruled that Fitzpatrick had effectively seized the defendant when he ordered Villareal to shut down the engine. Because this inference from the facts as found was not clearly erroneous, the district court did not err in ordering suppression. <i>See United States v. Ladd,</i> 885 F.2d 954, 957 (1st Cir.1989) (cautioning that appellate courts should not intrude when \"a trier chooses among plausible (albeit competing) inferences\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the government argues that this case is controlled by our decision in <i>Smith.</i> In our view, however, these two cases are not fair congeners. In <i>Smith,</i> the district court determined that a seizure had occurred when two police officers exited their cruiser, approached the defendant on a public street, and asked him for identification. 423 F.3d at 27. We reversed the district court's consequent grant of a motion to suppress because the historical facts as found by the court did not support a reasonable inference that the defendant had been seized. <i>Id.</i> at 30. The court's inference flew in the teeth of well-settled law that police officers who do no more than approach individuals without a show of authority and ask routine questions will not be held to have generated a sense of coercion. <i>Id.</i> at 29-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, unlike in <i>Smith,</i> the officer did more than merely approach and propound routine questions. According to the district court, which made a supportable factual finding in this regard, Fitzpatrick <i>commanded</i> the driver to shut off the engine. <i>See</i> D. Ct. Op. at 188, 190. That command, in the circumstances of this case, may not have compelled a finding of coercion but it supports such a finding (and, thus, a finding that a seizure occurred then and there).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Judgments of this sort are notoriously fact-sensitive, and an appellate court should defer in large measure to the trial court's superior coign of vantage. So it is here: although we, if sitting as a court of first instance, might not have drawn the same inferences from the underlying facts, we cannot say that the district court lacked the right to draw the inferences that it did. Nor can we say that, given those inferences, the court abused its discretion in suppressing the evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the suppression order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

We begin our account with a concise summary of the events leading to those charges, as supportably found by the district court. <i>See United States v.

The van piqued the interest of Glen Fitzpatrick, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, who was en route to his office in an unmarked car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick was aware that, within the past year, Boston-based ICE agents had intercepted at least two similar extended-passenger vans engaged in the illegal transportation of aliens. Although the van had tinted windows, he could see the silhouettes of several persons (other than the driver and front-seat passenger) inside it. Consequently, he started following the van while at the same time contacting sector communications. This inquiry yielded information that the van was registered to Jes&#250;s Zendejas of Dallas, Texas. Fitzpatrick recognized Zendejas's name as having appeared on a suspect's telephone toll records in an earlier ICE investigation of human smuggling &#8212; an investigation that had not yet resulted in the filing of any criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick continued to follow the van surreptitiously for approximately twenty-five minutes. At around that time, the van left the expressway and proceeded on the Revere Beach Parkway. In due course, it pulled over and parked near a sandwich shop in Everett, Massachusetts. The driver, Ambrosio Villareal, did not turn off the engine but let it idle. No one disembarked from the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fitzpatrick parked his car some fifty feet away in an adjacent lot and approached the stopped van on foot. He wore civilian clothes and carried a holstered firearm. Upon reaching the van, he flashed his badge and identified himself to Villareal as an immigration officer. Speaking in Spanish, he requested identification. Villareal complied. Then Fitzpatrick, using a hand motion, \"directed Villareal to shut off the engine.\" <i>United States v. Espinoza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2533443\"><a href=\"/opinion/2533443/united-states-v-espinoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The identification that Villareal produced consisted of a Texas driver's license, an alien registration card, and a business card indicating his affiliation with a company called \"Mi Tierra.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In approximately the same time frame, Fitzpatrick asked the defendant for identification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The defendant proffered a Texas driver's license and, in response to a direct question, informed Fitzpatrick that he was a naturalized citizen. To buttress that statement, he showed Fitzpatrick a photocopy of his naturalization papers.

He questioned them in Portuguese and learned that three of the five had been arrested in Texas by border patrol officers on February 4, 2005 &#8212; three days earlier. All three had received notices to appear for removal proceedings. The other two men carried Brazilian passports but had no other identification. Upon completing this phase of his inquiry, Fitzpatrick read Villareal and the defendant their <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See Miranda v.

These included: (i) Fitzpatrick's observation of an extended-passenger van bearing Texas license plates traveling on a highway in Massachusetts; (ii) his awareness that the van was registered to Zendejas, whose name had surfaced (albeit not as a target) during a previous investigation for human smuggling; and (iii) his prior knowledge of the interception of \"two and perhaps three similar passenger vans that were transporting illegal aliens\" in the Boston area within the past year. D. Ct. Op. at 189. The district court commented that this patina, pale to begin with, faded even more in light of countervailing considerations such as Fitzpatrick's admission that the Boston area was not a place generally associated with the smuggling of illegal aliens and the fact that he observed nothing unusual or unlawful about the van's operation during his surveillance. <i>Id.</i> at 190. Indeed, the only \"peculiarity\" that Fitzpatrick had noted about the van \"was that it bore Texas plates.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weighing the facts as a whole, the court concluded that Fitzpatrick's actions in approaching the van and starting to question its occupants were \"based on nothing more than a hunch.\" <i>Id.</i> With specific reference to the Zendejas connection,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the court added that the \"tendrils of information known to Fitzpatrick about this individual [at the time of the encounter were] insufficient to transform the hunch into reasonable suspicion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 190.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government does not claim any error in the district court's findings of raw fact. It does, however, attack with considerable ferocity the inferences drawn by the court from the facts as found. This attack overlooks that those inferences, too, are subject to clear error review. <i>See Ornelas,</i> 517 U.S. at 699, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Using that barometer, our function is not to decide whether we, if sitting as arbiters of the facts, would have drawn the same inferences but, rather, to determine whether the district court's chosen inferences are plausible (and, thus, permissible) based on the raw facts as supportably found. <i>See Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, we think that the district court's inferences, though not compelled by the facts, are nevertheless reasonable.

Given the nebulous nature of what he knew and the importance of the Fourth Amendment interests at stake, the court's conclusion that Fitzpatrick's actions were predicated on a hunch, bereft of the particularity required for reasonable suspicion, was not clearly erroneous. <i>See id.</i> Put another way, the record yields no definite and firm conviction that the district court's conclusion was mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Seizure.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our validation of the lower court's finding that Fitzpatrick lacked reasonable suspicion at the outset of the encounter does not end our odyssey. In this case, the agent played no part in bringing the van to a halt; the driver stopped of his own volition and for his own reasons. Thus, even without reasonable suspicion, Fitzpatrick had a right to approach the parked vehicle and talk to its occupants if that interview was purely consensual. <i>See United States v.

On that basis, the court granted the defendant's motion to suppress the statements made and papers produced in the interval between the command and the furnishing of <i>Miranda</i> warnings (including, of course, the fruits of those revelations).

Not every police-initiated conversation is a seizure. <i>See, e.g., Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 30; <i>Barry,</i> 394 F.3d at 1075. Thus, a law enforcement officer does not trigger an individual's Fourth Amendment protections simply by approaching the person in public and asking routine questions. <i>United States v.

The defendant, however, places the seizure at an earlier step in the progression. The timing is of decretory significance because the evidence that the district court suppressed consisted mainly of statements made and documents tendered in the interval between these two moments in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court resolved this quandary in favor of the defendant. In doing so, the court relied upon the following facts: (i) Fitzpatrick, identifying himself as an ICE officer and wearing a holstered firearm, approached the van; (ii) he displayed his badge and began asking questions; and (iii) with a commanding tone and manner, he indicated that he wanted the driver to shut off the van's engine. D. Ct. Op. at 188. Although Fitzpatrick protested during the evidentiary hearing that the nonverbal command to shut off the engine was given solely to facilitate conversation, the district court reasonably concluded that the absence of any evidence indicating that the van's occupants knew or intuited this unspoken limitation was extremely significant. <i>See id.</i> at 188 n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, this is a near-classic case of a set of facts that might &#8212; depending on the trier's interpretation &#8212; support either of two competing inferences. On the one hand, it seems plausible that a reasonable person in the defendant's shoes might have considered the encounter consensual and non-custodial. On the other hand, it seems equally plausible that a reasonable person in the defendant's shoes might have felt constrained to remain seated in the stopped van and to respond to the agent's queries. The district court concluded that the latter interpretation was the more likely scenario and, thus, ruled that Fitzpatrick had effectively seized the defendant when he ordered Villareal to shut down the engine. Because this inference from the facts as found was not clearly erroneous, the district court did not err in ordering suppression. <i>See United States v. Ladd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529712\"><a href=\"/opinion/529712/united-states-v-gary-ladd/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 957 (1st Cir.1989) (cautioning that appellate courts should not intrude when \"a trier chooses among plausible (albeit competing) inferences\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the government argues that this case is controlled by our decision in <i>Smith.</i> In our view, however, these two cases are not fair congeners. In <i>Smith,</i> the district court determined that a seizure had occurred when two police officers exited their cruiser, approached the defendant on a public street, and asked him for identification. 423 F.3d at 27. We reversed the district court's consequent grant of a motion to suppress because the historical facts as found by the court did not support a reasonable inference that the defendant had been seized. <i>Id.</i> at 30. The court's inference flew in the teeth of well-settled law that police officers who do no more than approach individuals without a show of authority and ask routine questions will not be held to have generated a sense of coercion. <i>Id.</i> at 29-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, unlike in <i>Smith,</i> the officer did more than merely approach and propound routine questions. According to the district court, which made a supportable factual finding in this regard, Fitzpatrick <i>commanded</i> the driver to shut off the engine. <i>See</i> D. Ct. Op. at 188, 190. That command, in the circumstances of this case, may not have compelled a finding of coercion but it supports such a finding (and, thus, a finding that a seizure occurred then and there).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The district court's conclusion that a seizure occurred, unaccompanied by reasonable suspicion, is consonant with the facts as found and with the record. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's order suppressing the evidence in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government claims that the defendant volunteered information in English during Fitzpatrick's initial conversation with Villareal.
