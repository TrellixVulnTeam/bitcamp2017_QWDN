Gajarsa, Circuit Judge, United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          GAJARSA, Circuit Judge. Ismael Alfonzo-Reyes (\"Alfonzo\")\n\nand   Vanessa     Morales-Hernández        (\"Morales\")       (collectively\n\n\"appellants\") appeal judgments of the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico.         The judgments found appellants\n\nguilty of defrauding the Farm Service Agency (\"FSA\") of emergency\n\nloans and incentives to qualified farmers following the damage\n\ninflicted on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Georges.\n\nFollowing an 82-day jury trial, appellants were convicted of fraud\n\nand bribery relating to various FSA loan applications.          Appellants\n\ntimely appealed their convictions.        For the reasons stated below,\n\nthe judgments are affirmed.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          On September 21, 1998, Hurricane Georges swept through\n\nPuerto Rico causing significant structural and environmental damage\n\nto the island.    The President of the United States declared the\n\nisland a major disaster area, entitling the Commonwealth to various\n\nfederal aid programs. In the wake of the hurricane, numerous Puerto\n\nRican farmers applied for emergency loans through the FSA, the\n\nfederal agency responsible for administering aid to eligible farmers\n\nafter a natural disaster.\n\n          Under   the   FSA   program,    farmers   may    qualify   for   an\n\nemergency loan up to $500,000 or for an operating loan up to\n\n$200,000 for rebuilding farming operations.               Farmers may also\n\nqualify for loans under the Livestock Indemnity Program for perished\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\flivestock and the Emergency Conservation Program for debris removal\n\nand for fence and road repairs.              The FSA program has several\n\neligibility requirements, including the farm size and a farmer's\n\nability to obtain commercial loans.\n\n             Appellants Alfonzo and his wife1 Morales were residents of\n\nPuerto Rico when Hurricane Georges struck the island.           Alfonzo was\n\nemployed as a FSA loan manager and Morales worked as a FSA contract\n\nemployee in Ponce, Puerto Rico.        Morales had previously worked at\n\nthe law office of Efrén Irizarry-Colon (\"Irizarry\") in Arecibo,\n\nPuerto Rico preparing FSA loan applications and earning a four\n\npercent commission on the loans.\n\n             Because   appellants    challenge   the    sufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence used to convict them on various counts, we recount the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to the verdict.          United States v.\n\nDeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir. 2008).            We outline the case\n\nhere in general and analyze further facts as relevant to the\n\nsufficiency claims later in the analysis.\n\n             In October 1998, Alfonzo met with José Torres-Correa\n\n(\"Torres\"), the FSA Program Director, to reveal his plan to defraud\n\nthe   FSA.     Alfonzo   explained    that    Morales   would   process    the\n\ncattlemen's applications out of Irizarry's law firm for a four\n\npercent commission on the loans.        Alfonzo offered Torres kickbacks\n\nof one percent of the loans, or approximately $130,000 ($80,000 in\n\n\n      1\n             Appellants are no longer married.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcash and forgiveness of $50,000 in debt) for expediting, approving,\n\nand disbursing these loans.        Alfonzo needed Torres' participation\n\nin the scheme because Torres was authorized to approve loans in\n\nexcess of $300,000 as the FSA Program Director.\n\n           Between     September   28,    1998,   and   January     22,    1999,\n\nappellants submitted FSA loan and incentive applications bearing\n\nfalse information on behalf of thirteen dairy farmers for alleged\n\ndamage to various dairy farms owned by the Toledo family.2                Morales\n\ninflated the damage and loss amounts in each application, and\n\nAlfonzo   instructed    the   farmers    to   obtain    falsified    invoices,\n\nestimates, and certifications to support their claimed losses.\n\nTorres approved approximately $10 million in FSA relief.                      In\n\nexchange for approving the fraudulent loan applications, Torres\n\nreceived $18,000 in kickbacks and forgiveness of $50,000 in debt.\n\n           According to numerous witnesses at trial, the criminal\n\nscheme was pervasive and systemic.            It involved multiple actors\n\nthroughout the Arecibo region of Puerto Rico. Farmers were required\n\nto obtain invoices demonstrating damage to their farms caused by the\n\nhurricane to support their FSA loan applications.            As a result, a\n\ngroup of contractors, suppliers, and agronomists provided invoices,\n\ncertifications, and estimates containing information they knew to\n\n\n\n     2\n          The dairy farms owned by various Toledo family relatives\ninclude the Toledo Dairy, Inc., Gregorio Toledo, Inc., J. Dairy,\nInc., and Café Dairy, Inc. (hereinafter, \"the Toledo family dairy\nfarms\").\n\n                                    -4-\n\fbe false or simply chose not to verify.               Veterinarians provided\n\nfalse certifications to dairy farmers concerning the number of\n\nlivestock    killed    as   a   result   of   Hurricane       Georges.      Doctor\n\nRivera-Hernández (\"Rivera\"), a veterinarian, spoke to Alfonzo on the\n\ntelephone to express his concern that a cattleman asked him to\n\ncertify    untrue     information    regarding    the    number    of     perished\n\nlivestock.     Alfonzo assured Rivera that he would not be held\n\nresponsible for providing a false certification.\n\n            Appellants accepted various bribes from cattlemen for\n\ntheir   assistance     in   procuring    fraudulent     FSA    loans.      Alfonzo\n\nreceived hefty cash bribes.         In January 2000, a number of cattlemen\n\npooled together $10,000 in cash and gave it to Alfonzo in the\n\nArecibo FSA office parking lot.          The farmers included a list of the\n\nnames of the contributors so that Alfonzo would know who gave him\n\nthe money.    The farmers provided cash donations to Alfonzo to put\n\nthem in a \"better position\" to obtain future benefits through the\n\nFSA.    They also made certain payments to Alfonzo \"in appreciation\"\n\nfor helping them obtain the federal aid.                In the fall of 2000,\n\nMorales accepted a bribe in the form of free auto body repairs from\n\ntwo cattlemen in Hatillo, Puerto Rico.           The cattlemen provided the\n\ncomplimentary repairs of Morales' automobile \"in appreciation\" for\n\nAlfonzo's assistance in procuring past and future FSA incentives.\n\n            Alfonzo also committed fraud regarding various loans\n\nprovided by commercial banks in the Arecibo region.                      To obtain\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\femergency loans through the FSA, farmers were required to show that\n\nthey were financially unable to obtain a commercial loan.   In July\n\n1999, Alfonzo requested commercial loan denial letters from the\n\nArecibo branch of Puerto Rico Farm Credit.        Esther Morales, a\n\nmanager of the Arecibo branch, testified that Alfonzo requested loan\n\ndenial letters for the Toledo Family dairy farms. Ester Morales had\n\nnever before provided such a letter for a FSA employee.       Other\n\nemployees of commercial banks in the Arecibo region testified that\n\ncattlemen applied for loans with no serious expectation of receiving\n\nthem because they offered insufficient collateral and sought a rate\n\nof interest well below prevailing market rates.\n\n          FSA employees in the Arecibo office began to develop\n\nsuspicions regarding statements and information contained in the\n\nloan applications.    Arlette Arana, a contract employee in the\n\nArecibo office, performed on-site farm inspections to verify the\n\nclaimed damages used to calculate the Emergency Conservation Program\n\nincentive awards. Arana's estimates of the farmers' damages did not\n\ncorrelate with the farmers' invoices for repair costs.   Despite the\n\ndiscrepancies, Alfonzo instructed Arana to increase the Emergency\n\nConservation Program incentive awards even in cases where a farmer\n\npresented invoices claiming greater repair costs than her on-site\n\ndamage estimates. Jorge Ramírez, a clerk in the FSA Arecibo office,\n\nalso worked on Emergency Conservation Program payments.     Ramírez\n\nspoke with Arana about the irregularities contained in the Emergency\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fConservation Program files. Ramírez and Arana shared their concerns\n\nwith Alfonzo.        Alfonzo instructed them to accept the files as\n\nsubmitted, told them it was not their duty to investigate, and\n\nassured them they were not responsible for the farmers providing\n\nfalse information.\n\n            Employees       from     other    FSA    offices      also   developed\n\nsuspicions.    In December 1998, an unannounced investigation team of\n\nFSA employees led by Melissa Cummings reviewed some of the Arecibo\n\noffice's   files.         Cummings     issued    a   memorandum    outlining   the\n\ndeficiencies and dearth of documentary support for damage claims.\n\nShe noted the possibility of fraudulent inflation of the loan\n\namounts    based    on    the   fact   that     Irizarry's     office    charged   a\n\ncommission based on the disbursed loan amount.\n\n            In January 2000, Clarence Ropp, a senior loan officer of\n\nthe United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), visited the\n\nArecibo office to review the loan applications handled by Irizarry's\n\nfirm.    In reviewing the loan applications, Ropp could not find any\n\nclosing documentation.           When Ropp questioned Alfonzo about the\n\nmissing documents, Alfonzo admitted to handling those applications\n\ndifferently.       Ropp observed that the investigation team's notes\n\noutlining the application deficiencies had been removed from the\n\nfiles.     Alfonzo       told   Ropp that he discarded the notes after\n\nreviewing them and after making the necessary corrections in the\n\nloan files.    Ropp also noted that the loan applications failed to\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdisclose Irizarry's fee, although that information should have been\n\nclearly listed on the loan's settlement statement.           Ropp's review\n\nconcluded that Alfonzo had been approving loans based upon improper\n\nand incomplete loan applications.\n\n           In March 2000, Ropp returned for a second visit to the\n\nArecibo office to perform an internal review of all FSA loans made\n\nin Puerto Rico from 1999 to 2000.          Ropp noted that, while a number\n\nof applications filed by other FSA offices contained inadvertent\n\nerrors, the files from the Arecibo office contained intentional\n\nerrors and deficiencies, e.g., lack of closing documents, untracked\n\nfunds, and ambiguity regarding whether the files were open or\n\nclosed. The mistakes Ropp observed in the Arecibo applications were\n\nnot the type of mistakes made by the other FSA offices in Puerto\n\nRico.   Accordingly, Ropp requested that the Arecibo applications be\n\nreferred   to   an   investigator.     Ropp     also   testified   that   the\n\nfraudulent loans made as a result of Hurricane Georges' disaster\n\ndepleted the FSA emergency funds in a single fiscal year for the\n\nfirst time in the program’s history.\n\n           Alfonzo was also involved in procuring a fraudulent loan\n\nfor Angel Ramón Alvarez-Rodríguez (\"Alvarez\"), a produce farmer\n\nwhose farm was damaged by Hurricane Georges.           When Alvarez visited\n\nAlfonzo at the FSA office in Ponce, Alfonzo recommended that Alvarez\n\napply for a commercial loan from Banco Santander (\"Santander\").\n\nAlvarez applied for a $150,000 loan.         Alfonzo provided Alvarez with\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fa letter dated January 14, 1999, stating that Alvarez's FSA loan for\n\n$100,000 had been approved, and when issued, the proceeds could be\n\nused to repay the bank loan.       This was false information because\n\nAlvarez's FSA loan was in fact not approved until almost a year\n\nlater on December 13, 1999.\n\n            After A1varez applied for the Santander loan, A1fonzo\n\nasked him to personally lend him $100,000 to avoid losing his farms\n\nthat were financially vulnerable.        When Alvarez told Alfonzo that\n\nhe did not have the funds to make such a loan, Alfonzo suggested\n\nthat his Santander loan could be increased to $250,000.            Alvarez\n\nagreed and amended his loan application requesting a loan for\n\n$250,000.\n\n            Alfonzo subsequently sent a letter to Santander on January\n\n21, 1999, stating that Alvarez had been approved for a $250,000 FSA\n\nloan.   This letter was submitted to the bank's credit committee.\n\nAlfonzo later advised Fernando Fernández-Cintron (\"Fernández\"), the\n\nmanager of the Ponce branch of Santander, that the earlier letter\n\nstating that Alvarez had been approved for only a $100,000 FSA loan\n\nwas an error.   Premised on the amended FSA letter, Alvarez received\n\na $250,000 loan from Santander.        He testified that Alfonzo was at\n\nthe bank when he closed on the loan, asking for a $100,000 check.\n\nThe   check,   however,   was   made   payable   to   Ignacio   Pintado,   a\n\nwell-reputed coffee farmer from Yauco to conceal the true nature of\n\nthe transaction. Fernández corroborated Alvarez's story, testifying\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fthat Alfonzo and Pintado were present at the closing and had asked\n\nfor temporary checks to be issued to Alvarez.               Fernández also\n\ntestified that if Santander knew Alvarez's FSA loan had not been\n\napproved, his loan through Santander would have been denied.\n\n            On April 2, 2004, a grand jury returned a true bill on a\n\nsuperseding indictment3 charging Alfonzo and Morales with various\n\nacts of fraud and bribery relating to the FSA loan applications.\n\nCount 1 charged appellants with willful conspiracy to defraud the\n\nFSA of $10 million in the process of evaluating, approving, and\n\ndisbursing emergency and operating loans and incentives to qualified\n\nfarmers following the Hurricane Georges disaster.          Counts 2 through\n\n19 charged appellants with making false statements to the FSA\n\nregarding emergency and operating loans for the Toledo dairy farms.\n\nCounts 20 and 21 charged Morales and Alfonzo, respectively, with\n\nbribery of the FSA Program Director, and Count 22 charged Alfonzo\n\nwith violation of 18 U.S.C. § 208 for assisting a farmer in\n\nobtaining   a   commercial   loan   in   which   Alfonzo   had   a   personal\n\nfinancial interest.      Counts 23 through 42 charged Morales and\n\nAlfonzo with additional violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1014 in connection\n\nwith emergency and operating loans for numerous cattlemen in the\n\nArecibo region. Counts 43 through 62 charged Alfonzo with assisting\n\n\n\n     3\n          The original indictment issued approximately a year\nearlier on April 25, 2003 and charged Alfonzo and Morales with\nsimilar but fewer Counts relating to their fraudulent conduct\ninvolving various FSA loan applications.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fin the submission of false applications for livestock indemnities\n\nand other FSA incentives, improper supplementation of income, and\n\nassisting in making false statements on the loan applications of two\n\nToledo family members.\n\n            Following an 82-day trial, a jury found appellants guilty\n\nof all Counts with the exception of Counts 41 and 47.4    Morales was\n\nsentenced on February 13, 2006, and judgment was entered on February\n\n17, 2006.      Alfonzo was sentenced on February 17, 2006, and a\n\njudgment was entered on March 13, 2006.      Appellants filed timely\n\nnotices of appeal.       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Appellants   raise   multiple   issues   regarding     their\n\nconvictions.     Morales and Alfonzo jointly appeal three issues:\n\n(A)   whether appellants were charged with non-existent federal\n\noffenses in violation of the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause,\n\n(B) whether the evidence was sufficient to support appellants'\n\nconvictions, and (C) whether the district court erred in submitting\n\ncertain sentencing guideline enhancements to the jury.           Morales\n\nindividually raises two additional issues specific to her case,\n\n\n\n      4\n          Count 41 charged Morales with making false statements on\na FSA loan application in violation of § 1014; Count 47 charged\nAlfonzo with assisting with the submission of false applications\nfor livestock indemnities in violation of § 1014. The trial judge\ndismissed these Counts for insufficient evidence as a result of\nappellants' Rule 29 motions.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fnamely (D) whether the district court abused its discretion in\n\ndisqualifying     her    attorney      before    trial,    and    (E)    whether    the\n\ndistrict    court       committed      reversible     error      by     imposing     an\n\nunreasonable     sentence.        Alfonzo       individually     appeals     only    an\n\nadditional issue, namely (F) whether the district court erred in\n\nassessing a four-point leadership role enhancement to his sentence.\n\nWe consider these issues in turn.\n\nA.   Appellants' Convictions Do Not Violate The Ex Post Facto\n     Clause\n\n            Counts 1¯19, 23¯58 and 61¯62 and Counts 2¯13 and 23¯42\n\ncharged Alfonzo and Morales, respectively, for submitting fraudulent\n\nreports    to   the    FSA,   a   successor      agency    to    the    Farmers    Home\n\nAdministration        (\"FHA\"),    in    violation     of    18    U.S.C.    §     1014.\n\nAppellants argue that § 1014 does not encompass fraud on the FSA\n\nbefore October 22, 1999, the date on which the statute was first\n\namended to include the term \"successor agency.\"                   See Pub. L. No.\n\n106-78, Title VII § 767, 113 Stat. 1135 (codified as amended in\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1014 (2000)).              Appellants assert that prior to that\n\ndate, § 1014 encompassed false statements or reports made only\n\nthrough the FHA, but not its successor agency, the FSA.                    Under this\n\ntheory, a false statement to the FSA prior to October 22, 1999, did\n\nnot qualify as a violation of § 1014;              thus, appellants' acts were\n\nnot criminal when they were committed.\n\n            Between September 1998 and January 1999, the period when\n\nappellants were submitting fraudulent FSA applications, § 1014 read:\n\n                                         -12-\n\f               Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or\n               report . . . for the purpose of influencing in\n               any way the action of . . . the Secretary of\n               Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home\n               Administration . . . upon any application\n                . . . or loan . . . shall be fined not more\n               than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30\n               years, or both . . . .\n\nIn    1994,    however,      Congress    had    eliminated     the     Farmers     Home\n\nAdministration, had provided for the creation of the FSA as its\n\nsuccessor, and had given the FSA jurisdiction over all pre-existing\n\nFHA    disaster      loan   programs     and   other   lending      programs.       See\n\n7    U.S.C.    §    6932;   see   also   Barreto-Barreto       v.    United   States,\n\n551 F.3d 95, 97 (1st Cir. 2008).                     In October 1999, Congress\n\neventually amended § 1014 to reflect this change by adding the\n\nphrase        \"or    successor      agency\"      after     \"the      Farmers       Home\n\nAdministration.\"            See   Pub.

No.   106-78,   Title    VII    §   767,\n\n113 Stat. 1135.\n\n               Both before and after the 1999 amendment, § 1014 by its\n\nterms criminalized knowingly making any false statements \"for the\n\npurpose of influencing in any way the action of . . .\" the\n\nSecretary of Agriculture, as well as a number of federal agencies,\n\nbanks, and credit unions.           See 18 U.S.C. § 1014.           It is clear from\n\nthe comprehensive list of entities in § 1014 that the statute's\n\nprimary concern is to protect a range of federal and affiliated\n\nlenders against the common harm of fraud perpetuated by third\n\nparties.       It is also clear from 7 U.S.C. § 6932 that the FSA\n\ninherited substantive responsibility for the FHA disaster loan\n\n                                         -13-\n\fprograms.\n\n            In light of this context, we conclude that the 1999\n\namendment to § 1014 to include \"successor agency\" was merely a\n\nhousekeeping statute that made § 1014 consistent with the transfer\n\nof responsibilities that 7 U.S.C. § 6932 had already effectuated.\n\nWhether the FSA or the FHA is the agency administering the loan\n\nprogram does not change the wrongfulness of the third party's\n\nfraudulent    statements    and    does    not   affect    the     essential\n\ncharacteristics of the crime as defined in § 1014.               See Blum v.\n\nUnited States, 212 F.2d 907, 908-09 (5th Cir. 1954) (finding no ex\n\npost facto violation where a defendant was convicted of knowingly\n\nfiling   false   reports   with   the   Public   Housing   Administration,\n\npreviously known as the U.S. Housing Authority, despite the fact\n\nthat the criminal statute was not amended to reflect the name\n\nchange for four years). There is no statutory ambiguity that would\n\nwarrant application of the rule of lenity here, as appellants urge.\n\n            Because the 1999 amendment to § 1014 created no new\n\ncriminal liability, imposed no greater punishment, and did not\n\nalter the rules of evidence, we hold that appellants' convictions\n\ndo not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nB.   The Evidence Is Sufficient To Support Appellants' Convictions\n\n            Appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nconvict them.    Alfonzo challenges the sufficiency of evidence for\n\nCounts 2¯13, 22¯30, 42, 44, 53 and 58¯60, and Morales challenges\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthe sufficiency of evidence for Count 20.             This Court reviews Rule\n\n29 motions for acquittal de novo.          United States v. Godin, 534 F.3d\n\n51, 62 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\nprovides that a court may acquit a defendant after the close of the\n\nprosecution's case if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a\n\nconviction.      In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we\n\nconsider   whether,    in    viewing    the   evidence     in   the   light    most\n\nfavorable to the jury's verdict, \"a rational fact finder could find\n\nthat the government proved the essential elements of its case\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\"        United States v. Marin, 523 F.3d 24,\n\n27 (1st Cir. 2008).      We review appellants' challenges in turn.\n\n1.    The Bribery Charge Against Morales\n\n            Count 20 charged both Morales and Alfonzo with aiding and\n\nabetting each other in bribing, and with directly and indirectly\n\nbribing and attempting to bribe, Torres, the FSA Program Director.\n\nThe   substantive     offense    against      Morales    was    a   violation   of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1); the aiding and abetting offense was a\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.            The bribery charged was promising\n\n$130,000, and giving $18,000 in cash, to Torres to influence him to\n\napprove    and   authorize      disbursement     of     unqualified    loans    to\n\ncattlemen in Arecibo.\n\n            Morales argues that even if there were enough evidence\n\nthat Alfonzo made a direct cash payment of $18,000 to Torres and\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fforgave a $50,000 debt, there was insufficient evidence that she\n\nwas directly involved or that she knew any money she was earning\n\nwould be used to pay a bribe to Torres.          Of course, she need not\n\nhave actually been the person to pay the bribe to be culpable, see\n\nUnited States v. Dixon, 658 F.3d 181, 191 (3d Cir. 1981), and she\n\ndoes not contend that.       More specifically, she argues there was\n\ntestimony that she was not present at the meeting where the scheme\n\nwas   hatched   and   that   her   arrangement   with   Irizarry   was   not\n\nsufficient to show her involvement with the scheme to bribe Torres.\n\nThe mere fact that she and Torres were married alone would not be\n\nsufficient.     But there was more evidence than that, and it was\n\nsufficient.\n\n           The government introduced circumstantial evidence showing\n\nthat Alfonzo coordinated the criminal scheme with Torres and\n\nMorales, and sent the cases to the Arecibo office for Morales to\n\nprocess.   At the Arecibo office, Morales compiled the fraudulent\n\nloan applications, inflated the claimed damages, and submitted\n\nfalsified documents to substantiate the claimed losses.            There is\n\nalso evidence showing that Alfonzo told Torres that he would get\n\npaid \"little by little as the cases were closed,\" and that Morales\n\ndeducted money from the accounts to pay Torres. This is sufficient\n\nevidence for the jury to conclude that Morales consciously shared\n\nAlfonzo's knowledge of the scheme to defraud the FSA, and worked to\n\nfurther the scheme by processing numerous FSA applications with\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\finflated damages and falsified invoices.\n\n2.   The Banco Santander Fraudulent Loan Charge\n\n           Count 22 alleged that Alfonzo helped Alvarez obtain a\n\ncommercial loan from Santander in which Alfonzo had a personal\n\nfinancial interest in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 208 and 216(a)(2).\n\nThe government asserted that Alfonzo, in his capacity as a FSA loan\n\nmanager, wrote a letter falsely stating that Alvarez had been\n\napproved for a $100,000 FSA loan that would be used to repay the\n\ncommercial loan from Santander.\n\n           Alfonzo argues that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nshow that he participated in the processing of the emergency loan\n\nrequest.   However, whether Alfonzo personally participated in the\n\nprocessing    of   the   emergency   loan   request   is   immaterial.      To\n\nestablish a violation of § 208, the government must prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant (1) was an officer or employee\n\nof the executive branch or an independent agency; (2) participated\n\npersonally and substantially in his official governmental capacity\n\nin a matter; and (3) knew that he had a financial interest in that\n\nparticular matter.       United States v. Nevers, 7 F.3d 59, 52 (5th\n\nCir. 1993).   The elements of the crime under § 208 are supported by\n\nsufficient    evidence.      Alfonzo,   while   employed    as   a   FSA   loan\n\nmanager, personally and substantially participated in his official\n\ncapacity by sending a letter on behalf of the FSA to Santander.\n\nAlfonzo's letter falsely stated that Alvarez's FSA loan had been\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fapproved, when in fact, Alfonzo knew that it had not been approved.\n\nThe   government    also   established       that    Alfonzo      had    a   personal\n\nfinancial interest in the Santander loan, which he intended to use\n\nto save his financially vulnerable farms.                 Accordingly, there is\n\nsufficient evidence to support Alfonzo's conviction on Count 22.\n\n3.    The Fraudulent Loan Charges\n\n            Counts 2¯13, 23¯30 and 42 charged Alfonzo with making\n\nfalse statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2(a) and 1014.\n\nCounts 2-13 concerned the Toledo family's emergency and operating\n\nloans for alleged damage to their dairy farms.                          Counts 23-30\n\nconcerned the Barreto family's loans.                Count 42 concerned Jorge\n\nDelgado-Peréz's emergency loan for $500,000.\n\n            To establish a violation of § 2(a), the government must\n\nprove that (1) the principal knowingly submitted false statements;\n\nand   (2)   the   accomplice    consciously         shared      knowledge     of   it,\n\nassociated    himself   with    it,   and    intended      to    help    ensure    its\n\nsuccess.     García-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d at 130.                 To establish a\n\nviolation of § 1014, the government must prove that (1) the\n\ndefendant    made   a   false    statement;         (2)   the    defendant     acted\n\nknowingly; and (3) the false statement was made for the purpose of\n\ninfluencing action on the loan.         Tierney, 266 F.3d at 40.\n\n            Alfonzo argues there is insufficient evidence to support\n\nhis conviction in the absence of direct evidence showing his\n\nparticipation in submitting the fraudulent loan applications.                      In\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fparticular, Alfonzo asserts that in order to find him guilty, the\n\njury    improperly    inferred     that   Morales     \"told    him   about    the\n\ninfirmities\" in the loan applications.               Direct evidence is not\n\nrequired to find him guilty, and juries are entitled to draw\n\nreasonable inferences at trial based on circumstantial evidence.\n\nSee Rodríguez-Durán, 507 F.3d at 758; Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d at 261.\n\n            There is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support\n\nthe    jury's    finding    that   Alfonzo    was   guilty    of   making   false\n\nstatements to obtain FSA loans.               Multiple witnesses at trial\n\ntestified that Alfonzo's wife Morales intentionally inflated the\n\ndamages on the loan applications and instructed the cattlemen to\n\nobtain falsified invoices. Other witnesses testified that they met\n\nwith Alfonzo after applying for FSA loans and that he was concerned\n\nabout their loan applications being investigated. The investigator\n\ntestified that Alfonzo made excuses for failing to turn over the\n\nfiles in question and also made excuses for why these files\n\ncontained discrepancies.           Based on this evidence, the jury was\n\npermitted to infer that Alfonzo shared knowledge of the cattlemen's\n\nfalse statements in the loan applications.\n\n4.     The Fraudulent Livestock Indemnity And Emergency Conservation\n       Application Charges\n\n            Counts 44, 53 and 58 charged Alfonzo with making false\n\nstatements      in   connection    with   applications       relating   to    the\n\nLivestock       Indemnity    and   Emergency     Conservation      Programs    in\n\nviolation of §§ 2(a) and 1014.               Counts 44 and 58 alleged that\n\n                                      -19-\n\fAlfonzo knowingly and willfully made false statements in connection\n\nwith applications for Livestock Indemnity funds in the amount of\n\n$18,868, and for Emergency Conservation funds in the amount of\n\n$14,837, on behalf of Nelson Ramos-Irizarry (\"Ramos\").           Count 53\n\nalleged that Alfonzo knowingly and willfully made false statements\n\nand overvalued land, property, and security to fraudulently obtain\n\nEmergency Conservation funds in the amount of $19,200 for Teodoro\n\nAlfonzo-Toledo (\"Toledo\").\n\n            Alfonzo argues that the government did not elicit any\n\ntestimony    concerning   Alfonzo's     direct   participation   in    the\n\nsubmission of false information. We disagree. For Count 44, there\n\nis   sufficient   circumstantial      evidence   including:   the     close\n\nrelationship between Alfonzo and Ramos; several meetings between\n\nAlfonzo and Ramos to discuss intentional inflation of losses in\n\ncattle; and Alfonzo's instructions to obtain a letter from a\n\nveterinarian certifying the number of perished cattle to receive\n\nadditional FSA incentives.    For Count 58, there is also sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence that Alfonzo met with Toledo on several\n\noccasions to discuss expediting falsified loans under the FSA, and\n\nthat they shared tips on how to increase amount of falsified\n\ndamages on the loan applications.         For Count 53, Toledo testified\n\nthat he contributed a $1,000 \"donation\" to Alfonzo for expediting\n\nthe loans.   Toledo also testified that he personally attended the\n\n\"donation\" meeting to ensure that Alfonzo would help the cattlemen\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fobtain     FSA   benefits.        Accordingly,    there      is     sufficient\n\ncircumstantial evidence upon which the jury can infer Alfonzo's\n\nguilt for Counts 44, 53, and 58.\n\n5.   The Improper Income Supplementation Charge\n\n            Counts 59 and 60 charged Alfonzo with knowingly and\n\nwillfully receiving improper payments from FSA clients in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. §§ 209 and 216.           Count 59 alleged that Alfonzo\n\nreceived a cash payment of $10,000.        Count 60 alleged that Alfonzo\n\nreceived payment in the form of auto body repairs to his wife's\n\nautomobile.\n\n            To establish a claim under § 209, the government must\n\nestablish the following four elements: (1) a non-government party\n\n(2) makes a contribution or supplementation to (3) the salary of an\n\nexecutive branch official (4) as compensation for his services as\n\nan officer or employee of the executive branch.           See United States\n\nv. Project on Gov't Oversight, 543 F. Supp. 2d 55, 62 (D.D.C.\n\n2008).     The last element requires two inquiries: (1) what the\n\ndisputed    payment   is   for,   i.e.,    what   activity    prompted     the\n\ncompensation; and (2) the subjective intent of the parties to\n\ndetermine what the payment was actually for, especially where there\n\nare various activities that could have motivated the payment.              Id.\n\n            Alfonzo argues that there is insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport his convictions on Counts 59 and 60 because the $10,000\n\ncash payment and automobile repairs were \"gifts.\"                 Alfonzo also\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fargues that no witnesses testified that they paid Alfonzo for his\n\nFSA services.    These assertions are without merit.                In support of\n\nCount 59, numerous cattlemen testified that they provided the cash\n\npayment to Alfonzo to place them \"in a better position to obtain\"\n\nfuture benefits through the FSA, and that they donated the money to\n\nAlfonzo \"in appreciation, because he had helped [them] get those\n\nbenefits.\"     In support of Count 60, several witnesses testified\n\nthat they paid for the repairs performed on Alfonzo's wife's\n\nautomobile to get on Alfonzo's \"good side\" and \"to please\" Alfonzo.\n\nAccordingly,    there    is    sufficient      evidence      that   non-government\n\nparties improperly supplemented Alfonzo's income in exchange for\n\nthe services he rendered as a FSA employee.                 This is sufficient to\n\nsupport Alfonzo's convictions on Counts 59 and 60.\n\nC.   The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Instructing\n     The Jury On Sentencing Enhancements\n\n            Appellants     argue      that    the   district     court   erred   in\n\ninstructing the jury on definitions regarding certain sentencing\n\nenhancements.        Appellants' trial commenced on June 8, 2004.                At\n\nthat time, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000)\n\ngoverned the law on sentencing.              The Apprendi standard requires\n\nthat \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\"    Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490.           On June 24, 2004, during the\n\nmiddle    of   the    trial,    the    Supreme      Court    issued   Blakely    v.\n\n                                       -22-\n\fWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), which held that \"a sentence that\n\nwas enhanced on the basis of factors found by the judge, rather\n\nthan the jury, violated the defendant's constitutional right to a\n\ntrial by jury.\"      United States v. Lopez, 380 F.3d 538, 541 n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).      It was unclear at the time whether Blakely\n\napplied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines or had retroactive\n\neffect.   To resolve the issue, the parties agreed to rely on the\n\nApprendi standard.    As a prophylactic measure, the judge asked the\n\njurors to fill out a special verdict form.\n\n          Appellants assert that they were prejudiced by the jury's\n\nconsideration of certain sentencing enhancement questions. Morales\n\nobjects to the jury's consideration of whether she took significant\n\naffirmative steps to conceal the offense; whether she applied more\n\nthan minimal planning to accomplish the scheme; and whether Morales\n\nused \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public [that]\n\nusually requires substantial education, training or licensing.\"\n\nAlfonzo challenges the jury's consideration of whether he had a\n\nleadership role in the offense; the amount of loss; whether he\n\napplied more than minimal planning; and whether he abused the\n\npublic trust.\n\n          We understand the arguments to fall into two basic\n\ncategories.     The first is a claim that, since the case was not\n\nbifurcated into a guilt phase and then a penalty phase, it was\n\nerror to have the jury focus on issues that assumed guilt.      The\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fdistrict court, avoiding this risk, instructed that the jury should\n\ndeliberate   on   these   issues    if   and   only    if    they     had   already\n\nconcluded the defendants were guilty.          This is not a situation in\n\nwhich a jury might reasonably do the reverse, as in United States\n\nv. Spock, 416 F.2d 165, 183 (1st Cir. 1969).                Further, there was\n\nstrong evidence of guilt.\n\n          Second, there is an objection to the content of the loss\n\ninstruction, which Morales claims misstated the definition of the\n\nterm \"loss\" as it was used in the Sentencing Guidelines.                       It is\n\nunclear   that    Morales    timely      objected     to    this    instruction.\n\nRegardless of whether we review this instruction for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion rather than plain error, however, the district court's\n\ndefinition   of    loss     did    not    materially        diverge     from     the\n\nthen-governing definition in the Sentencing Guidelines, and there\n\nis no indication of prejudice.\n\nD.   The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion                        In   Its\n     Pre-Trial Disqualification Of Morales' Attorney\n\n          Morales argues that her Sixth Amendment right to counsel\n\nwas violated because the district court disqualified her chosen\n\nattorney, Maria Sandoval, before trial.               She was represented by\n\nother counsel at trial.     The district court found that there was an\n\nactual and potential conflict of interest because Attorney Sandoval\n\npreviously represented a government witness who was scheduled to\n\ntestify against Morales' husband and co-defendant, Alfonzo.                       We\n\nreview the district court's disqualification decision for abuse of\n\n                                      -24-\n\fdiscretion.      United    States     v.    Lanoue,    137    F.3d     656,   663\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           The   Sixth    Amendment     guarantees      the    right    to    the\n\nassistance of counsel in a trial for any serious crime.                Gideon v.\n\nWainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343 (1963).          An element of that right is\n\n\"the right of the defendant who does not require appointed counsel\n\nto choose who will represent him.\"             United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nLopez, 548 U.S. 140, 144 (2006).            In evaluating Sixth Amendment\n\nclaims,   \"the   appropriate    inquiry      focuses   on     the    adversarial\n\nprocess, not on the accused's relationship with his lawyer as\n\nsuch.\"    United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.21 (1984).\n\nAccordingly, although a defendant may generally waive his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to a non-conflicted attorney, \"the essential aim of\n\nthe [Sixth] Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for\n\neach criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will\n\ninexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\" Wheat v.\n\nUnited States, 486 U.S. 153, 159 (1998); see also Morris v. Slappy,\n\n461 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1983).      Against this background, our review is\n\ndeferential and the district court has broad latitude.                   Lanoue,\n\n137 F.3d at 663.\n\n           Before trial, the magistrate judge disqualified Attorney\n\nSandoval, finding that an \"actual conflict of interest exists\" and,\n\nin   addition,   warned   of   \"other      potential   conflicts      which   may\n\nmetamorphose into actual conflicts as the case progresses.\"                    In\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fsupport of this decision, the magistrate judge, after a hearing,\n\nfound five \"crucial\" facts5:\n\n          (i)   Attorney   Sandoval,  previous   to   her\n          involvement    in   this   case,    represented\n          [government witness] \"GW\" in a drug conspiracy\n          and money laundering case unrelated to this\n          case;\n          (ii) Following his sentence in a drug case, GW\n          became a government cooperator;\n          (iii) At the time GW approached the government\n          to become a cooperator, Attorney Sandoval\n          continued to represent him;\n          (iv) Besides cooperating in the drug-related\n          matters subject of an ongoing investigation, GW\n          was present at the time a co-defendant in this\n          case was bribed. This co-defendant is Ismael\n          Alfonzo-Reyes who is the defendant's husband;\n          (v) the [g]overnment has announced that GW will\n          be a witness in the present case, which\n          involves a conspiracy charge[] [sic].\n\n          Morales    argues   that   there   was   no   actual   conflict\n\nwarranting disqualification, and even if there were, any potential\n\nconflict could have been waived by both clients.         In particular,\n\nshe asserts that the government witness was willing to waive the\n\nattorney-client privilege and represented this willingness to the\n\ndistrict court.     There is no record that such a waiver actually\n\noccurred, so that argument is hypothetical.\n\n          With respect to a potential conflict of interest, this\n\nCourt has noted that such a conflict \"is a matter that is uniquely\n\n\n\n     5\n          Following oral argument, the parties submitted letter\nbriefing to clarify an alleged \"factual dispute\" material to the\ndisqualification issue. After a careful review of the record, we\nconclude that the trial court based its decision on sound factual\nfindings relating to the conflict of interest.\n\n                                 -26-\n\ffactual and presents a special dilemma for trial courts.\"            Lanoue,\n\n137 F.3d at 663.     Accordingly, \"[t]he evaluation of the facts and\n\ncircumstances of each case . . . must be left primarily to the\n\ninformed judgment of the trial court.\"          Wheat, 486 U.S. at 164.\n\n             In this case, Attorney Sandoval’s representation may have\n\nplaced her in the position of having to cross-examine her former\n\nclient, a witness with whom she shared confidences protected by\n\nattorney-client privilege.      The district court could conclude the\n\nmatters were sufficiently related given some evidence linking the\n\ngovernment’s potential witness, GW, to co-defendant Morales.\n\n             Morales argues that \"the prosecution neither called nor\n\nalluded to this purportedly 'important' witness during the entire\n\ncourse of the trial,\" which \"only compound[ed] the error\" of\n\ndisqualification.     But a court's decision on disqualification is\n\nnot made with the clarity of hindsight.         The Supreme Court in Wheat\n\nexplained that a district court's decision to disqualify counsel is\n\nbased on the facts presented at the time of the disqualification\n\nmotion, and does not turn upon subsequent events at trial — i.e.,\n\nwhether the witness ultimately takes the stand:\n\n             [W]e think the district court must be allowed\n             substantial latitude in refusing waivers of\n             conflicts of interest not only in those rare\n             cases where an actual conflict may be\n             demonstrated before trial, but in the more\n             common cases where a potential for conflict\n             exists which may or may not burgeon into an\n             actual conflict as the trial progresses . . . .\n\n486   U.S.    153,   163   (1998)   (emphasis    added).     Under     these\n\n                                    -27-\n\fcircumstances,    the    district    court    did    not    abuse   its   broad\n\ndiscretion in disqualifying Attorney Sandoval.\n\nE.   Appellant Morales' Sentence Is Not Unreasonable\n\n            Morales     asserts     that    her     27-month    sentence    is\n\nunreasonable because the district court judge improperly treated\n\nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).                  We review the\n\nreasonableness of sentences for abuse of discretion.                  Gall v.\n\nUnited States, 552 U.S. 38, 56 (2007).\n\n            Morales contends that the trial judge's statement that\n\nBooker \"directs sentencing courts to resort to the guidelines in\n\norder to structure a reasonable sentence\" demonstrates that the\n\njudge improperly treated the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as\n\nmandatory, instead of advisory.            We disagree.      In light of the\n\ndistrict court's reference to the \"now advisory Federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines,\" we find that the district court treated them as\n\nadvisory.     Nor did the court's analysis fail to consider the\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3533(a) factors.        Indeed, the district court described\n\nMorales as \"a first time offender\" and a \"productive member within\n\nher community.\" As a result, the district court imposed a sentence\n\nat the bottom end of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range,\n\ndemonstrating the individualized assessment.               For these reasons,\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fF.   The District Court Did Not Err In Awarding A Four-Point\n     Leadership Role Enhancement\n\n            Alfonzo argues that the district court erred in giving\n\nhim a four-point leadership role enhancement during sentencing.               A\n\ncourt's   decision    to   impose    a     sentencing   enhancement    for    a\n\nleadership role based on the facts is reviewed for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez-Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 44 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n            Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant's\n\nbase offense level is raised by four levels if he \"was an organizer\n\nor leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more\n\nparticipants . . . .\"      U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 3B1.1\n\n(2004).   We must also consider the following factors:\n\n            the exercise of decision making authority, the\n            nature of participation in the commission of\n            the offense, the recruitment of accomplices,\n            the claimed right to a larger share of the\n            fruits   of   the   crime,   the   degree   of\n            participation in planning or organizing the\n            offense, the nature and scope of the illegal\n            activity, and the degree of control and\n            authority exercised over others.\n\nId. at cmt. 4.    Alfonzo argues the evidence at trial showed that\n\nthere were only four participants to the crime, which he asserts\n\ndoes not include his co-conspirators.               This is not correct.\n\nAlfonzo's    leadership    role     over    his   co-conspirators     may    be\n\nconsidered for a sentencing enhancement.            See Rodríguez-Lozada,\n\n558 F.3d at 44.      The evidence at trial showed that Alfonzo had a\n\nleadership role in the criminal scheme involving five or more\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fparticipants.   Alfonzo recruited twenty cattlemen in Puerto Rico\n\nwho testified that Alfonzo participated in inflating their damages\n\nand instructed them to obtain falsified estimates.   Alfonzo also\n\ndirected Morales to falsify the loan applications submitted by the\n\ncattlemen.   Furthermore, Alfonzo bribed Torres for the required\n\nFSA authorization for loans over $300,000.   Accordingly, based on\n\nthis evidence, we find that Alfonzo's four-point leadership role\n\nenhancement was not clear error.\n\n                              III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm on all issues.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

The judgments found appellants guilty of defrauding the Farm Service Agency (\"FSA\") of emergency loans and incentives to qualified farmers following the damage inflicted on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Georges. Following an 82-day jury trial, appellants were convicted of fraud and bribery relating to various FSA loan applications. Appellants timely appealed their convictions. For the reasons stated below, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On September 21, 1998, Hurricane Georges swept through Puerto Rico causing significant structural and environmental damage to the island. The President of the United States declared the island a major disaster area, entitling the Commonwealth to various federal aid programs. In the wake of the hurricane, numerous Puerto Rican farmers applied for emergency loans through the FSA, the federal agency responsible for administering aid to eligible farmers after a natural disaster.</p>\n<p>Under the FSA program, farmers may qualify for an emergency loan up to $500,000 or for an operating loan up to $200,000 for rebuilding farming operations. Farmers may also qualify for loans under the Livestock Indemnity Program for perished livestock and the Emergency Conservation Program for debris removal and for fence and road repairs. The FSA program has several eligibility requirements, including the farm size and a farmer's ability to obtain commercial loans.</p>\n<p>Appellants Alfonzo and his wife<sup>[1]</sup> Morales were residents of Puerto Rico when Hurricane Georges struck the island. Alfonzo was employed as a FSA loan manager and Morales worked as a FSA contract employee in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Morales had previously worked at the law office of Efrén Irizarry-Colon (\"Irizarry\") in Arecibo, Puerto Rico preparing FSA loan applications and earning a four percent commission on the loans.</p>\n<p>Because appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict them on various counts, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.2008). We outline the case here in general and analyze further facts as relevant to the sufficiency claims later in the analysis.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> In October 1998, Alfonzo met with José Torres-Correa (\"Torres\"), the FSA Program Director, to reveal his plan to defraud the FSA. Alfonzo explained that Morales would process the cattlemen's applications out of Irizarry's law firm for a four percent commission on the loans. Alfonzo offered Torres kickbacks of one percent of the loans, or approximately $130,000 ($80,000 in cash and forgiveness of $50,000 in debt) for expediting, approving, and disbursing these loans. Alfonzo needed Torres' participation in the scheme because Torres was authorized to approve loans in excess of $300,000 as the FSA Program Director.</p>\n<p>Between September 28, 1998, and January 22, 1999, appellants submitted FSA loan and incentive applications bearing false information on behalf of thirteen dairy farmers for alleged damage to various dairy farms owned by the Toledo family.<sup>[2]</sup> Morales inflated the damage and loss amounts in each application, and Alfonzo instructed the farmers to obtain falsified invoices, estimates, and certifications to support their claimed losses. Torres approved approximately $10 million in FSA relief. In exchange for approving the fraudulent loan applications, Torres received $18,000 in kickbacks and forgiveness of $50,000 in debt.</p>\n<p>According to numerous witnesses at trial, the criminal scheme was pervasive and systemic. It involved multiple actors throughout the Arecibo region of Puerto Rico. Farmers were required to obtain invoices demonstrating damage to their farms caused by the hurricane to support their FSA loan applications. As a result, a group of contractors, suppliers, and agronomists provided invoices, certifications, and estimates containing information they knew to be false or simply chose not to verify. Veterinarians provided false certifications to dairy farmers concerning the number of livestock killed as a result of Hurricane Georges. Doctor Rivera-Hernández (\"Rivera\"), a veterinarian, spoke to Alfonzo on the telephone to express his concern that a cattleman asked him to certify untrue information regarding the number of perished livestock. Alfonzo assured Rivera that he would not be held responsible for providing a false certification.</p>\n<p>Appellants accepted various bribes from cattlemen for their assistance in procuring fraudulent FSA loans. Alfonzo received hefty cash bribes. In January 2000, a number of cattlemen pooled together $10,000 in cash and gave it to Alfonzo in the Arecibo FSA office parking lot. The farmers included a list of the names of the contributors so that Alfonzo would know who gave him the money. The farmers provided cash donations to Alfonzo to put them in a \"better position to obtain\" future benefits through the FSA. They also made certain payments to Alfonzo \"in appreciation\" for helping them obtain the federal aid. In the fall of 2000, Morales accepted a bribe in the form of free auto body repairs from two cattlemen in Hatillo, Puerto Rico. The cattlemen provided the complimentary repairs of Morales' automobile \"in appreciation\" for Alfonzo's assistance in procuring past and future FSA incentives.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo also committed fraud regarding various loans provided by commercial banks in the Arecibo region. To obtain emergency loans through the FSA, farmers were required to show that they were financially unable to obtain a commercial loan. In July 1999, Alfonzo requested commercial loan denial letters from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> Arecibo branch of Puerto Rico Farm Credit. Esther Morales, a manager of the Arecibo branch, testified that Alfonzo requested loan denial letters for the Toledo Family dairy farms. Ester Morales had never before provided such a letter for a FSA employee. Other employees of commercial banks in the Arecibo region testified that cattlemen applied for loans with no serious expectation of receiving them because they offered insufficient collateral and sought a rate of interest well below prevailing market rates.</p>\n<p>FSA employees in the Arecibo office began to develop suspicions regarding statements and information contained in the loan applications. Arlette Arana, a contract employee in the Arecibo office, performed on-site farm inspections to verify the claimed damages used to calculate the Emergency Conservation Program incentive awards. Arana's estimates of the farmers' damages did not correlate with the farmers' invoices for repair costs. Despite the discrepancies, Alfonzo instructed Arana to increase the Emergency Conservation Program incentive awards even in cases where a farmer presented invoices claiming greater repair costs than her on-site damage estimates. Jorge Ramírez, a clerk in the FSA Arecibo office, also worked on Emergency Conservation Program payments. Ramírez spoke with Arana about the irregularities contained in the Emergency Conservation Program files. Ramírez and Arana shared their concerns with Alfonzo. Alfonzo instructed them to accept the files as submitted, told them it was not their duty to investigate, and assured them they were not responsible for the farmers providing false information.</p>\n<p>Employees from other FSA offices also developed suspicions. In December 1998, an unannounced investigation team of FSA employees led by Melissa Cummings reviewed some of the Arecibo office's files. Cummings issued a memorandum outlining the deficiencies and dearth of documentary support for damage claims. She noted the possibility of fraudulent inflation of the loan amounts based on the fact that Irizarry's office charged a commission based on the disbursed loan amount.</p>\n<p>In January 2000, Clarence Ropp, a senior loan officer of the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), visited the Arecibo office to review the loan applications handled by Irizarry's firm. In reviewing the loan applications, Ropp could not find any closing documentation. When Ropp questioned Alfonzo about the missing documents, Alfonzo admitted to handling those applications differently. Ropp observed that the investigation team's notes outlining the application deficiencies had been removed from the files. Alfonzo told Ropp that he discarded the notes after reviewing them and after making the necessary corrections in the loan files. Ropp also noted that the loan applications failed to disclose Irizarry's fee, although that information should have been clearly listed on the loan's settlement statement. Ropp's review concluded that Alfonzo had been approving loans based upon improper and incomplete loan applications.</p>\n<p>In March 2000, Ropp returned for a second visit to the Arecibo office to perform an internal review of all FSA loans made in Puerto Rico from 1999 to 2000. Ropp noted that, while a number of applications filed by other FSA offices contained inadvertent errors, the files from the Arecibo office contained intentional errors and deficiencies, e.g., lack of closing documents, untracked funds, and ambiguity regarding whether the files were open or closed. The mistakes Ropp observed in the Arecibo applications were not the type of mistakes made by the other FSA offices in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Ropp requested that the Arecibo applications be referred to an investigator. Ropp also testified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> that the fraudulent loans made as a result of Hurricane Georges' disaster depleted the FSA emergency funds in a single fiscal year for the first time in the program's history.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo was also involved in procuring a fraudulent loan for Angel Ramón Alvarez-Rodríguez (\"Alvarez\"), a produce farmer whose farm was damaged by Hurricane Georges. When Alvarez visited Alfonzo at the FSA office in Ponce, Alfonzo recommended that Alvarez apply for a commercial loan from Banco Santander (\"Santander\"). Alvarez applied for a $150,000 loan. Alfonzo provided Alvarez with a letter dated January 14, 1999, stating that Alvarez's FSA loan for $100,000 had been approved, and when issued, the proceeds could be used to repay the bank loan. This was false information because Alvarez's FSA loan was in fact not approved until almost a year later on December 13, 1999.</p>\n<p>After Alvarez applied for the Santander loan, Alfonzo asked him to personally lend him $100,000 to avoid losing his farms that were financially vulnerable. When Alvarez told Alfonzo that he did not have the funds to make such a loan, Alfonzo suggested that his Santander loan could be increased to $250,000. Alvarez agreed and amended his loan application requesting a loan for $250,000.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo subsequently sent a letter to Santander on January 21, 1999, stating that Alvarez had been approved for a $250,000 FSA loan. This letter was submitted to the bank's credit committee. Alfonzo later advised Fernando Fernández-Cintron (\"Fernández\"), the manager of the Ponce branch of Santander, that the earlier letter stating that Alvarez had been approved for only a $100,000 FSA loan was an error. Premised on the amended FSA letter, Alvarez received a $250,000 loan from Santander. He testified that Alfonzo was at the bank when he closed on the loan, asking for a $100,000 check. The check, however, was made payable to Ignacio Pintado, a well-reputed coffee farmer from Yauco to conceal the true nature of the transaction. Fernández corroborated Alvarez's story, testifying that Alfonzo and Pintado were present at the closing and had asked for temporary checks to be issued to Alvarez. Fernández also testified that if Santander knew Alvarez's FSA loan had not been approved, his loan through Santander would have been denied. On April 2, 2004, a grand jury returned a true bill on a superseding indictment<sup>[3]</sup> charging Alfonzo and Morales with various acts of fraud and bribery relating to the FSA loan applications. Count 1 charged appellants with willful conspiracy to defraud the FSA of $10 million in the process of evaluating, approving, and disbursing emergency and operating loans and incentives to qualified farmers following the Hurricane Georges disaster. Counts 2 through 19 charged appellants with making false statements to the FSA regarding emergency and operating loans for the Toledo dairy farms. Counts 20 and 21 charged Morales and Alfonzo, respectively, with bribery of the FSA Program Director, and Count 22 charged Alfonzo with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 208 for assisting a farmer in obtaining a commercial loan in which Alfonzo had a personal financial interest. Counts 23 through 42 charged Morales and Alfonzo with additional violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1014 in connection with emergency and operating loans for numerous cattlemen in the Arecibo region. Counts 43 through 62 charged Alfonzo with assisting in the submission of false applications for livestock indemnities and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> other FSA incentives, improper supplementation of income, and assisting in making false statements on the loan applications of two Toledo family members.</p>\n<p>Following an 82-day trial, a jury found appellants guilty of all Counts with the exception of Counts 41 and 47.<sup>[4]</sup> Morales was sentenced on February 13, 2006, and judgment was entered on February 17, 2006. Alfonzo was sentenced on February 17, 2006, and a judgment was entered on March 13, 2006. Appellants filed timely notices of appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Appellants raise multiple issues regarding their convictions. Morales and Alfonzo jointly appeal three issues: (A) whether appellants were charged with non-existent federal offenses in violation of the Constitution's <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause, (B) whether the evidence was sufficient to support appellants' convictions, and (C) whether the district court erred in submitting certain sentencing guideline enhancements to the jury. Morales individually raises two additional issues specific to her case, namely (D) whether the district court abused its discretion in disqualifying her attorney before trial, and (E) whether the district court committed reversible error by imposing an unreasonable sentence. Alfonzo individually appeals only an additional issue, namely (F) whether the district court erred in assessing a four-point leadership role enhancement to his sentence. We consider these issues in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Appellants' Convictions Do Not Violate The Ex Post Facto Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 1-19, 23-58 and 61-62 and Counts 2-13 and 23-42 charged Alfonzo and Morales, respectively, for submitting fraudulent reports to the FSA, a successor agency to the Farmers Home Administration (\"FHA\"), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1014. Appellants argue that § 1014 does not encompass fraud on the FSA before October 22, 1999, the date on which the statute was first amended to include the term \"successor agency.\" <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 106-78, Title VII § 767, 113 Stat. 1135 (codified as amended in 18 U.S.C. § 1014 (2000)). Appellants assert that prior to that date, § 1014 encompassed false statements or reports made only through the FHA, but not its successor agency, the FSA. Under this theory, a false statement to the FSA prior to October 22, 1999, did not qualify as a violation of § 1014; thus, appellants' acts were not criminal when they were committed.</p>\n<p>Between September 1998 and January 1999, the period when appellants were submitting fraudulent FSA applications, § 1014 read:</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report ... for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of... the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home Administration... upon any application ... or loan... shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both....</blockquote>\n<p>In 1994, however, Congress had eliminated the Farmers Home Administration, had provided for the creation of the FSA as its successor, and had given the FSA jurisdiction over all pre-existing FHA disaster loan programs and other lending programs. <i>See</i> 7 U.S.C. § 6932; <i>see also </i><i>Barreto-Barreto v. United States,</i> 551 F.3d 95, 97 (1st Cir.2008). In October <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> 1999, Congress eventually amended § 1014 to reflect this change by adding the phrase \"or successor agency\" after \"the Farmers Home Administration.\" <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 106-78, Title VII § 767, 113 Stat. 1135.</p>\n<p>Both before and after the 1999 amendment, § 1014 by its terms criminalized knowingly making any false statements \"for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of ...\" the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as a number of federal agencies, banks, and credit unions. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1014. It is clear from the comprehensive list of entities in § 1014 that the statute's primary concern is to protect a range of federal and affiliated lenders against the common harm of fraud perpetuated by third parties. It is also clear from 7 U.S.C. § 6932 that the FSA inherited substantive responsibility for the FHA disaster loan programs.</p>\n<p>In light of this context, we conclude that the 1999 amendment to § 1014 to include \"successor agency\" was merely a housekeeping statute that made § 1014 consistent with the transfer of responsibilities that 7 U.S.C. § 6932 had already effectuated. Whether the FSA or the FHA is the agency administering the loan program does not change the wrongfulness of the third party's fraudulent statements and does not affect the essential characteristics of the crime as defined in § 1014. <i>See </i><i>Blum v. United States,</i> 212 F.2d 907, 908-09 (5th Cir.1954) (finding no ex post facto violation where a defendant was convicted of knowingly filing false reports with the Public Housing Administration, previously known as the U.S. Housing Authority, despite the fact that the criminal statute was not amended to reflect the name change for four years). There is no statutory ambiguity that would warrant application of the rule of lenity here, as appellants urge.</p>\n<p>Because the 1999 amendment to § 1014 created no new criminal liability, imposed no greater punishment, and did not alter the rules of evidence, we hold that appellants' convictions do not violate the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Evidence Is Sufficient To Support Appellants' Convictions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to convict them. Alfonzo challenges the sufficiency of evidence for Counts 2-13, 22-30, 42, 44, 53 and 58-60, and Morales challenges the sufficiency of evidence for Count 20. This Court reviews Rule 29 motions for acquittal de novo. <i>United States v. Godin,</i> 534 F.3d 51, 62 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a court may acquit a defendant after the close of the prosecution's case if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider whether, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, \"a rational fact finder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Marin,</i> 523 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2008). We review appellants' challenges in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Bribery Charge Against Morales</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Count 20 charged both Morales and Alfonzo with aiding and abetting each other in bribing, and with directly and indirectly bribing and attempting to bribe, Torres, the FSA Program Director. The substantive offense against Morales was a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1); the aiding and abetting offense was a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2. The bribery charged was promising $130,000, and giving $18,000 in cash, to Torres to influence him to approve and authorize disbursement of unqualified loans to cattlemen in Arecibo.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> Morales argues that even if there were enough evidence that Alfonzo made a direct cash payment of $18,000 to Torres and forgave a $50,000 debt, there was insufficient evidence that she was directly involved or that she knew any money she was earning would be used to pay a bribe to Torres. Of course, she need not have actually been the person to pay the bribe to be culpable, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> 658 F.2d 181, 191 (3d Cir.1981), and she does not contend that. More specifically, she argues there was testimony that she was not present at the meeting where the scheme was hatched and that her arrangement with Irizarry was not sufficient to show her involvement with the scheme to bribe Torres. The mere fact that she and Torres were married alone would not be sufficient. But there was more evidence than that, and it was sufficient.</p>\n<p>The government introduced circumstantial evidence showing that Alfonzo coordinated the criminal scheme with Torres and Morales, and sent the cases to the Arecibo office for Morales to process. At the Arecibo office, Morales compiled the fraudulent loan applications, inflated the claimed damages, and submitted falsified documents to substantiate the claimed losses. There is also evidence showing that Alfonzo told Torres that he would get paid little by \"little as the cases were closed,\" and that Morales deducted money from the accounts to pay Torres. This is sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Morales consciously shared Alfonzo's knowledge of the scheme to defraud the FSA, and worked to further the scheme by processing numerous FSA applications with inflated damages and falsified invoices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Banco Santander Fraudulent Loan Charge</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Count 22 alleged that Alfonzo helped Alvarez obtain a commercial loan from Santander in which Alfonzo had a personal financial interest in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 208 and 216(a)(2). The government asserted that Alfonzo, in his capacity as a FSA loan manager, wrote a letter falsely stating that Alvarez had been approved for a $100,000 FSA loan that would be used to repay the commercial loan from Santander.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that there is insufficient evidence to show that he participated in the processing of the emergency loan request. However, whether Alfonzo personally participated in the processing of the emergency loan request is immaterial. To establish a violation of § 208, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) was an officer or employee of the executive branch or an independent agency; (2) participated personally and substantially in his official governmental capacity in a matter; and (3) knew that he had a financial interest in that particular matter. <i>United States v. Nevers,</i> 7 F.3d 59, 62 (5th Cir.1993). The elements of the crime under § 208 are supported by sufficient evidence. Alfonzo, while employed as a FSA loan manager, personally and substantially participated in his official capacity by sending a letter on behalf of the FSA to Santander. Alfonzo's letter falsely stated that Alvarez's FSA loan had been approved, when in fact, Alfonzo knew that it had not been approved. The government also established that Alfonzo had a personal financial interest in the Santander loan, which he intended to use to save his financially vulnerable farms. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence to support Alfonzo's conviction on Count 22.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Fraudulent Loan Charges</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 2-13, 23-30 and 42 charged Alfonzo with making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2(a) and 1014. Counts 2-13 concerned the Toledo family's emergency and operating loans for alleged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> damage to their dairy farms. Counts 23-30 concerned the Barreto family's loans. Count 42 concerned Jorge Delgado-Peréz's emergency loan for $500,000.</p>\n<p>To establish a violation of § 2(a), the government must prove that (1) the principal knowingly submitted false statements; and (2) the accomplice consciously shared knowledge of it, associated himself with it, and intended to help ensure its success. <i>García-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d at 130. To establish a violation of § 1014, the government must prove that (1) the defendant made a false statement; (2) the defendant acted knowingly; and (3) the false statement was made for the purpose of influencing action on the loan. <i>Tierney,</i> 266 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction in the absence of direct evidence showing his participation in submitting the fraudulent loan applications. In particular, Alfonzo asserts that in order to find him guilty, the jury improperly inferred that Morales \"told him about the infirmities\" in the loan applications. Direct evidence is not required to find him guilty, and juries are entitled to draw reasonable inferences at trial based on circumstantial evidence. <i>See Rodríguez-Durán,</i> 507 F.3d at 758; <i>Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d at 261.</p>\n<p>There is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the jury's finding that Alfonzo was guilty of making false statements to obtain FSA loans. Multiple witnesses at trial testified that Alfonzo's wife Morales intentionally inflated the damages on the loan applications and instructed the cattlemen to obtain falsified invoices. Other witnesses testified that they met with Alfonzo after applying for FSA loans and that he was concerned about their loan applications being investigated. The investigator testified that Alfonzo made excuses for failing to turn over the files in question and also made excuses for why these files contained discrepancies. Based on this evidence, the jury was permitted to infer that Alfonzo shared knowledge of the cattlemen's false statements in the loan applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>The Fraudulent Livestock Indemnity And Emergency Conservation Application Charges</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 44, 53 and 58 charged Alfonzo with making false statements in connection with applications relating to the Livestock Indemnity and Emergency Conservation Programs in violation of §§ 2(a) and 1014. Counts 44 and 58 alleged that Alfonzo knowingly and willfully made false statements in connection with applications for Livestock Indemnity funds in the amount of $18,868, and for Emergency Conservation funds in the amount of $14,837, on behalf of Nelson Ramos-Irizarry (\"Ramos\"). Count 53 alleged that Alfonzo knowingly and willfully made false statements and overvalued land, property, and security to fraudulently obtain Emergency Conservation funds in the amount of $19,200 for Teodoro Alfonzo-Toledo (\"Toledo\").</p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that the government did not elicit any testimony concerning Alfonzo's direct participation in the submission of false information. We disagree. For Count 44, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence including: the close relationship between Alfonzo and Ramos; several meetings between Alfonzo and Ramos to discuss intentional inflation of losses in cattle; and Alfonzo's instructions to obtain a letter from a veterinarian certifying the number of perished cattle to receive additional FSA incentives. For Count 58, there is also sufficient circumstantial evidence that Alfonzo met with Toledo on several occasions to discuss expediting falsified loans under the FSA, and that they shared tips on how to increase amount of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> falsified damages on the loan applications. For Count 53, Toledo testified that he contributed a $1,000 \"donation\" to Alfonzo for expediting the loans. Toledo also testified that he personally attended the \"donation\" meeting to ensure that Alfonzo would help the cattlemen obtain FSA benefits. Accordingly, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence upon which the jury can infer Alfonzo's guilt for Counts 44, 53, and 58.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>The Improper Income Supplementation Charge</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 59 and 60 charged Alfonzo with knowingly and willfully receiving improper payments from FSA clients in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 209 and 216. Count 59 alleged that Alfonzo received a cash payment of $10,000. Count 60 alleged that Alfonzo received payment in the form of auto body repairs to his wife's automobile.</p>\n<p>To establish a claim under § 209, the government must establish the following four elements: (1) a non-government party (2) makes a contribution or supplementation to (3) the salary of an executive branch official (4) as compensation for his services as an officer or employee of the executive branch. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Project on Gov't Oversight,</i> 543 F.Supp.2d 55, 62 (D.D.C.2008). The last element requires two inquiries: (1) what the disputed payment is for, i.e., what activity prompted the compensation; and (2) the subjective intent of the parties to determine what the payment was actually for, especially where there are various activities that could have motivated the payment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions on Counts 59 and 60 because the $10,000 cash payment and automobile repairs were \"gifts.\" Alfonzo also argues that no witnesses testified that they paid Alfonzo for his FSA services. These assertions are without merit. In support of Count 59, numerous cattlemen testified that they provided the cash payment to Alfonzo to place them \"in a better position to obtain\" future benefits through the FSA, and that they donated the money to Alfonzo \"in appreciation, because he had helped [them] get those benefits.\" In support of Count 60, several witnesses testified that they paid for the repairs performed on Alfonzo's wife's automobile to get on Alfonzo's \"good side\" and \"to please\" Alfonzo. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence that non-government parties improperly supplemented Alfonzo's income in exchange for the services he rendered as a FSA employee. This is sufficient to support Alfonzo's convictions on Counts 59 and 60.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Instructing The Jury On Sentencing Enhancements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Appellants argue that the district court erred in instructing the jury on definitions regarding certain sentencing enhancements. Appellants' trial commenced on June 8, 2004. At that time, <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) governed the law on sentencing. The <i>Apprendi</i> standard requires that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. On June 24, 2004, during the middle of the trial, the Supreme Court issued <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), which held that \"a sentence that was enhanced on the basis of factors found by the judge, rather than the jury, violated the defendant's constitutional right to a trial by jury.\" <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 380 F.3d 538, 541 n. 1 (1st Cir. 2004). It was unclear at the time whether <i>Blakely</i> applied to the Federal Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> Guidelines or had retroactive effect. To resolve the issue, the parties agreed to rely on the <i>Apprendi</i> standard. As a prophylactic measure, the judge asked the jurors to fill out a special verdict form.</p>\n<p>Appellants assert that they were prejudiced by the jury's consideration of certain sentencing enhancement questions. Morales objects to the jury's consideration of whether she took significant affirmative steps to conceal the offense; whether she applied more than minimal planning to accomplish the scheme; and whether Morales used \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public [that] usually requires substantial education, training or licensing.\" Alfonzo challenges the jury's consideration of whether he had a leadership role in the offense; the amount of loss; whether he applied more than minimal planning; and whether he abused the public trust.</p>\n<p>We understand the arguments to fall into two basic categories. The first is a claim that, since the case was not bifurcated into a guilt phase and then a penalty phase, it was error to have the jury focus on issues that assumed guilt. The district court, avoiding this risk, instructed that the jury should deliberate on these issues if and only if they had already concluded the defendants were guilty. This is not a situation in which a jury might reasonably do the reverse, as in <i>United States v. Spock,</i> 416 F.2d 165, 183 (1st Cir.1969). Further, there was strong evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p>Second, there is an objection to the content of the loss instruction, which Morales claims misstated the definition of the term \"loss\" as it was used in the Sentencing Guidelines. It is unclear that Morales timely objected to this instruction. Regardless of whether we review this instruction for an abuse of discretion rather than plain error, however, the district court's definition of loss did not materially diverge from the then-governing definition in the Sentencing Guidelines, and there is no indication of prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Its Pre-Trial Disqualification Of Morales' Attorney</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Morales argues that her Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because the district court disqualified her chosen attorney, Maria Sandoval, before trial. She was represented by other counsel at trial. The district court found that there was an actual and potential conflict of interest because Attorney Sandoval previously represented a government witness who was scheduled to testify against Morales' husband and co-defendant, Alfonzo. We review the district court's disqualification decision for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d 656, 663 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to the assistance of counsel in a trial for any serious crime. <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 343, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). An element of that right is \"the right of the defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> 548 U.S. 140, 144, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). In evaluating Sixth Amendment claims, \"the appropriate inquiry focuses on the adversarial process, not on the accused's relationship with his lawyer as such.\" <i>United States v. Cronic,</i> 466 U.S. 648, 657 n. 21, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). Accordingly, although a defendant may generally waive his Sixth Amendment right to a non-conflicted attorney, \"the essential aim of the [Sixth] Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> whom he prefers.\" <i>Wheat v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988); <i>see also </i><i>Morris v. Slappy,</i> 461 U.S. 1, 13-14, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983). Against this background, our review is deferential and the district court has broad latitude. <i>Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d at 663.</p>\n<p>Before trial, the magistrate judge disqualified Attorney Sandoval, finding that an \"actual conflict of interest exists\" and, in addition, warned of \"other potential conflicts which may metamorphose into actual conflicts as the case progresses.\" In support of this decision, the magistrate judge, after a hearing, found five \"crucial\" facts<sup>[5]</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>(i) Attorney Sandoval, previous to her involvement in this case, represented [government witness] \"GW\" in a drug conspiracy and money laundering case unrelated to this case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) Following his sentence in a drug case, GW became a government cooperator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iii) At the time GW approached the government to become a cooperator, Attorney Sandoval continued to represent him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iv) Besides cooperating in the drug-related matters subject of an ongoing investigation, GW was present at the time a co-defendant in this case was bribed. This co-defendant is Ismael Alfonzo-Reyes who is the defendant's husband;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(v) the [g]overnment has announced that GW will be a witness in the present case, which involves a conspiracy charge[ ] [sic].</blockquote>\n<p>Morales argues that there was no actual conflict warranting disqualification, and even if there were, any potential conflict could have been waived by both clients. In particular, she asserts that the government witness was willing to waive the attorney-client privilege and represented this willingness to the district court. There is no record that such a waiver actually occurred, so that argument is hypothetical.</p>\n<p>With respect to a potential conflict of interest, this Court has noted that such a conflict \"is a matter that is uniquely factual and presents a special dilemma for trial courts.\" <i>Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d at 663. Accordingly, \"[t]he evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case ... must be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court.\" <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U.S. at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692.</p>\n<p>In this case, Attorney Sandoval's representation may have placed her in the position of having to cross-examine her former client, a witness with whom she shared confidences protected by attorney-client privilege. The district court could conclude the matters were sufficiently related given some evidence linking the government's potential witness, GW, to co-defendant Morales.</p>\n<p>Morales argues that \"the prosecution neither called nor alluded to this purportedly `important' witness during the entire course of the trial,\" which \"only compound[ed] the error\" of disqualification. But a court's decision on disqualification is not made with the clarity of hindsight. The Supreme Court in <i>Wheat</i> explained that a district court's decision to disqualify counsel is based on the facts presented at the time of the disqualification motion, and does not turn upon subsequent events at triali.e., whether the witness ultimately takes the stand:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> [W]e think the district court must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists <i>which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses</i> ....</blockquote>\n<p>486 U.S. 153, 163, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988) (emphasis added). Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in disqualifying Attorney Sandoval.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Appellant Morales' Sentence Is Not Unreasonable</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Morales asserts that her 27-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court judge improperly treated the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review the reasonableness of sentences for abuse of discretion. <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p>Morales contends that the trial judge's statement that <i>Booker</i> \"directs sentencing courts to resort to the guidelines in order to structure a reasonable sentence\" demonstrates that the judge improperly treated the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, instead of advisory. We disagree. In light of the district court's reference to the \"now advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines,\" we find that the district court treated them as advisory. Nor did the court's analysis fail to consider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors. Indeed, the district court described Morales as \"a first time offender\" and a \"productive member within her community.\" As a result, the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom end of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range, demonstrating the individualized assessment. For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>The District Court Did Not Err In Awarding A Four-Point Leadership Role Enhancement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that the district court erred in giving him a four-point leadership role enhancement during sentencing. A court's decision to impose a sentencing enhancement for a leadership role based on the facts is reviewed for clear error. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d 29, 44 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant's base offense level is raised by four levels if he \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants....\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 3B1.1 (2004). We must also consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote>the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at cmt. 4. Alfonzo argues the evidence at trial showed that there were only four participants to the crime, which he asserts does not include his co-conspirators. This is not correct. Alfonzo's leadership role over his co-conspirators may be considered for a sentencing enhancement. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d at 44. The evidence at trial showed that Alfonzo had a leadership role in the criminal scheme involving five or more participants. Alfonzo recruited twenty cattlemen in Puerto Rico who testified that Alfonzo participated in inflating their damages and instructed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> them to obtain falsified estimates. Alfonzo also directed Morales to falsify the loan applications submitted by the cattlemen. Furthermore, Alfonzo bribed Torres for the required FSA authorization for loans over $300,000. Accordingly, based on this evidence, we find that Alfonzo's four-point leadership role enhancement was not clear error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> on all issues.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Honorable Arthur J.

The judgments found appellants guilty of defrauding the Farm Service Agency (\"FSA\") of emergency loans and incentives to qualified farmers following the damage inflicted on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Georges. Following an 82-day jury trial, appellants were convicted of fraud and bribery relating to various FSA loan applications. Appellants timely appealed their convictions. For the reasons stated below, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On September 21, 1998, Hurricane Georges swept through Puerto Rico causing significant structural and environmental damage to the island. The President of the United States declared the island a major disaster area, entitling the Commonwealth to various federal aid programs. In the wake of the hurricane, numerous Puerto Rican farmers applied for emergency loans through the FSA, the federal agency responsible for administering aid to eligible farmers after a natural disaster.</p>\n<p>Under the FSA program, farmers may qualify for an emergency loan up to $500,000 or for an operating loan up to $200,000 for rebuilding farming operations. Farmers may also qualify for loans under the Livestock Indemnity Program for perished livestock and the Emergency Conservation Program for debris removal and for fence and road repairs. The FSA program has several eligibility requirements, including the farm size and a farmer's ability to obtain commercial loans.</p>\n<p>Appellants Alfonzo and his wife<sup>[1]</sup> Morales were residents of Puerto Rico when Hurricane Georges struck the island. Alfonzo was employed as a FSA loan manager and Morales worked as a FSA contract employee in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Morales had previously worked at the law office of Efrén Irizarry-Colon (\"Irizarry\") in Arecibo, Puerto Rico preparing FSA loan applications and earning a four percent commission on the loans.</p>\n<p>Because appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict them on various counts, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2008). We outline the case here in general and analyze further facts as relevant to the sufficiency claims later in the analysis.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> In October 1998, Alfonzo met with José Torres-Correa (\"Torres\"), the FSA Program Director, to reveal his plan to defraud the FSA. Alfonzo explained that Morales would process the cattlemen's applications out of Irizarry's law firm for a four percent commission on the loans. Alfonzo offered Torres kickbacks of one percent of the loans, or approximately $130,000 ($80,000 in cash and forgiveness of $50,000 in debt) for expediting, approving, and disbursing these loans. Alfonzo needed Torres' participation in the scheme because Torres was authorized to approve loans in excess of $300,000 as the FSA Program Director.</p>\n<p>Between September 28, 1998, and January 22, 1999, appellants submitted FSA loan and incentive applications bearing false information on behalf of thirteen dairy farmers for alleged damage to various dairy farms owned by the Toledo family.<sup>[2]</sup> Morales inflated the damage and loss amounts in each application, and Alfonzo instructed the farmers to obtain falsified invoices, estimates, and certifications to support their claimed losses. Torres approved approximately $10 million in FSA relief. In exchange for approving the fraudulent loan applications, Torres received $18,000 in kickbacks and forgiveness of $50,000 in debt.</p>\n<p>According to numerous witnesses at trial, the criminal scheme was pervasive and systemic. It involved multiple actors throughout the Arecibo region of Puerto Rico. Farmers were required to obtain invoices demonstrating damage to their farms caused by the hurricane to support their FSA loan applications. As a result, a group of contractors, suppliers, and agronomists provided invoices, certifications, and estimates containing information they knew to be false or simply chose not to verify. Veterinarians provided false certifications to dairy farmers concerning the number of livestock killed as a result of Hurricane Georges. Doctor Rivera-Hernández (\"Rivera\"), a veterinarian, spoke to Alfonzo on the telephone to express his concern that a cattleman asked him to certify untrue information regarding the number of perished livestock. Alfonzo assured Rivera that he would not be held responsible for providing a false certification.</p>\n<p>Appellants accepted various bribes from cattlemen for their assistance in procuring fraudulent FSA loans. Alfonzo received hefty cash bribes. In January 2000, a number of cattlemen pooled together $10,000 in cash and gave it to Alfonzo in the Arecibo FSA office parking lot. The farmers included a list of the names of the contributors so that Alfonzo would know who gave him the money. The farmers provided cash donations to Alfonzo to put them in a \"better position to obtain\" future benefits through the FSA. They also made certain payments to Alfonzo \"in appreciation\" for helping them obtain the federal aid. In the fall of 2000, Morales accepted a bribe in the form of free auto body repairs from two cattlemen in Hatillo, Puerto Rico. The cattlemen provided the complimentary repairs of Morales' automobile \"in appreciation\" for Alfonzo's assistance in procuring past and future FSA incentives.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo also committed fraud regarding various loans provided by commercial banks in the Arecibo region. To obtain emergency loans through the FSA, farmers were required to show that they were financially unable to obtain a commercial loan. In July 1999, Alfonzo requested commercial loan denial letters from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> Arecibo branch of Puerto Rico Farm Credit. Esther Morales, a manager of the Arecibo branch, testified that Alfonzo requested loan denial letters for the Toledo Family dairy farms. Ester Morales had never before provided such a letter for a FSA employee. Other employees of commercial banks in the Arecibo region testified that cattlemen applied for loans with no serious expectation of receiving them because they offered insufficient collateral and sought a rate of interest well below prevailing market rates.</p>\n<p>FSA employees in the Arecibo office began to develop suspicions regarding statements and information contained in the loan applications. Arlette Arana, a contract employee in the Arecibo office, performed on-site farm inspections to verify the claimed damages used to calculate the Emergency Conservation Program incentive awards. Arana's estimates of the farmers' damages did not correlate with the farmers' invoices for repair costs. Despite the discrepancies, Alfonzo instructed Arana to increase the Emergency Conservation Program incentive awards even in cases where a farmer presented invoices claiming greater repair costs than her on-site damage estimates. Jorge Ramírez, a clerk in the FSA Arecibo office, also worked on Emergency Conservation Program payments. Ramírez spoke with Arana about the irregularities contained in the Emergency Conservation Program files. Ramírez and Arana shared their concerns with Alfonzo. Alfonzo instructed them to accept the files as submitted, told them it was not their duty to investigate, and assured them they were not responsible for the farmers providing false information.</p>\n<p>Employees from other FSA offices also developed suspicions. In December 1998, an unannounced investigation team of FSA employees led by Melissa Cummings reviewed some of the Arecibo office's files. Cummings issued a memorandum outlining the deficiencies and dearth of documentary support for damage claims. She noted the possibility of fraudulent inflation of the loan amounts based on the fact that Irizarry's office charged a commission based on the disbursed loan amount.</p>\n<p>In January 2000, Clarence Ropp, a senior loan officer of the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), visited the Arecibo office to review the loan applications handled by Irizarry's firm. In reviewing the loan applications, Ropp could not find any closing documentation. When Ropp questioned Alfonzo about the missing documents, Alfonzo admitted to handling those applications differently. Ropp observed that the investigation team's notes outlining the application deficiencies had been removed from the files. Alfonzo told Ropp that he discarded the notes after reviewing them and after making the necessary corrections in the loan files. Ropp also noted that the loan applications failed to disclose Irizarry's fee, although that information should have been clearly listed on the loan's settlement statement. Ropp's review concluded that Alfonzo had been approving loans based upon improper and incomplete loan applications.</p>\n<p>In March 2000, Ropp returned for a second visit to the Arecibo office to perform an internal review of all FSA loans made in Puerto Rico from 1999 to 2000. Ropp noted that, while a number of applications filed by other FSA offices contained inadvertent errors, the files from the Arecibo office contained intentional errors and deficiencies, e.g., lack of closing documents, untracked funds, and ambiguity regarding whether the files were open or closed. The mistakes Ropp observed in the Arecibo applications were not the type of mistakes made by the other FSA offices in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Ropp requested that the Arecibo applications be referred to an investigator. Ropp also testified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> that the fraudulent loans made as a result of Hurricane Georges' disaster depleted the FSA emergency funds in a single fiscal year for the first time in the program's history.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo was also involved in procuring a fraudulent loan for Angel Ramón Alvarez-Rodríguez (\"Alvarez\"), a produce farmer whose farm was damaged by Hurricane Georges. When Alvarez visited Alfonzo at the FSA office in Ponce, Alfonzo recommended that Alvarez apply for a commercial loan from Banco Santander (\"Santander\"). Alvarez applied for a $150,000 loan. Alfonzo provided Alvarez with a letter dated January 14, 1999, stating that Alvarez's FSA loan for $100,000 had been approved, and when issued, the proceeds could be used to repay the bank loan. This was false information because Alvarez's FSA loan was in fact not approved until almost a year later on December 13, 1999.</p>\n<p>After Alvarez applied for the Santander loan, Alfonzo asked him to personally lend him $100,000 to avoid losing his farms that were financially vulnerable. When Alvarez told Alfonzo that he did not have the funds to make such a loan, Alfonzo suggested that his Santander loan could be increased to $250,000. Alvarez agreed and amended his loan application requesting a loan for $250,000.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo subsequently sent a letter to Santander on January 21, 1999, stating that Alvarez had been approved for a $250,000 FSA loan. This letter was submitted to the bank's credit committee. Alfonzo later advised Fernando Fernández-Cintron (\"Fernández\"), the manager of the Ponce branch of Santander, that the earlier letter stating that Alvarez had been approved for only a $100,000 FSA loan was an error. Premised on the amended FSA letter, Alvarez received a $250,000 loan from Santander. He testified that Alfonzo was at the bank when he closed on the loan, asking for a $100,000 check. The check, however, was made payable to Ignacio Pintado, a well-reputed coffee farmer from Yauco to conceal the true nature of the transaction. Fernández corroborated Alvarez's story, testifying that Alfonzo and Pintado were present at the closing and had asked for temporary checks to be issued to Alvarez. Fernández also testified that if Santander knew Alvarez's FSA loan had not been approved, his loan through Santander would have been denied. On April 2, 2004, a grand jury returned a true bill on a superseding indictment<sup>[3]</sup> charging Alfonzo and Morales with various acts of fraud and bribery relating to the FSA loan applications. Count 1 charged appellants with willful conspiracy to defraud the FSA of $10 million in the process of evaluating, approving, and disbursing emergency and operating loans and incentives to qualified farmers following the Hurricane Georges disaster. Counts 2 through 19 charged appellants with making false statements to the FSA regarding emergency and operating loans for the Toledo dairy farms. Counts 20 and 21 charged Morales and Alfonzo, respectively, with bribery of the FSA Program Director, and Count 22 charged Alfonzo with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 208 for assisting a farmer in obtaining a commercial loan in which Alfonzo had a personal financial interest. Counts 23 through 42 charged Morales and Alfonzo with additional violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1014 in connection with emergency and operating loans for numerous cattlemen in the Arecibo region. Counts 43 through 62 charged Alfonzo with assisting in the submission of false applications for livestock indemnities and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> other FSA incentives, improper supplementation of income, and assisting in making false statements on the loan applications of two Toledo family members.</p>\n<p>Following an 82-day trial, a jury found appellants guilty of all Counts with the exception of Counts 41 and 47.<sup>[4]</sup> Morales was sentenced on February 13, 2006, and judgment was entered on February 17, 2006. Alfonzo was sentenced on February 17, 2006, and a judgment was entered on March 13, 2006. Appellants filed timely notices of appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Appellants raise multiple issues regarding their convictions. Morales and Alfonzo jointly appeal three issues: (A) whether appellants were charged with non-existent federal offenses in violation of the Constitution's <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause, (B) whether the evidence was sufficient to support appellants' convictions, and (C) whether the district court erred in submitting certain sentencing guideline enhancements to the jury. Morales individually raises two additional issues specific to her case, namely (D) whether the district court abused its discretion in disqualifying her attorney before trial, and (E) whether the district court committed reversible error by imposing an unreasonable sentence. Alfonzo individually appeals only an additional issue, namely (F) whether the district court erred in assessing a four-point leadership role enhancement to his sentence. We consider these issues in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Appellants' Convictions Do Not Violate The Ex Post Facto Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 1-19, 23-58 and 61-62 and Counts 2-13 and 23-42 charged Alfonzo and Morales, respectively, for submitting fraudulent reports to the FSA, a successor agency to the Farmers Home Administration (\"FHA\"), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1014. Appellants argue that § 1014 does not encompass fraud on the FSA before October 22, 1999, the date on which the statute was first amended to include the term \"successor agency.\" <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 106-78, Title VII § 767, 113 Stat. 1135 (codified as amended in 18 U.S.C. § 1014 (2000)). Appellants assert that prior to that date, § 1014 encompassed false statements or reports made only through the FHA, but not its successor agency, the FSA. Under this theory, a false statement to the FSA prior to October 22, 1999, did not qualify as a violation of § 1014; thus, appellants' acts were not criminal when they were committed.</p>\n<p>Between September 1998 and January 1999, the period when appellants were submitting fraudulent FSA applications, § 1014 read:</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report ... for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of... the Secretary of Agriculture acting through the Farmers Home Administration... upon any application ... or loan... shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both....</blockquote>\n<p>In 1994, however, Congress had eliminated the Farmers Home Administration, had provided for the creation of the FSA as its successor, and had given the FSA jurisdiction over all pre-existing FHA disaster loan programs and other lending programs. <i>See</i> 7 U.S.C. § 6932; <i>see also </i><i>Barreto-Barreto v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457324\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457324/barreto-barreto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 97 (1st Cir.2008). In October <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> 1999, Congress eventually amended § 1014 to reflect this change by adding the phrase \"or successor agency\" after \"the Farmers Home Administration.\" <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 106-78, Title VII § 767, 113 Stat. 1135.</p>\n<p>Both before and after the 1999 amendment, § 1014 by its terms criminalized knowingly making any false statements \"for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of ...\" the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as a number of federal agencies, banks, and credit unions. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 1014. It is clear from the comprehensive list of entities in § 1014 that the statute's primary concern is to protect a range of federal and affiliated lenders against the common harm of fraud perpetuated by third parties. It is also clear from 7 U.S.C. § 6932 that the FSA inherited substantive responsibility for the FHA disaster loan programs.</p>\n<p>In light of this context, we conclude that the 1999 amendment to § 1014 to include \"successor agency\" was merely a housekeeping statute that made § 1014 consistent with the transfer of responsibilities that 7 U.S.C. § 6932 had already effectuated. Whether the FSA or the FHA is the agency administering the loan program does not change the wrongfulness of the third party's fraudulent statements and does not affect the essential characteristics of the crime as defined in § 1014. <i>See </i><i>Blum v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"234076\"><a href=\"/opinion/234076/blum-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 908-09 (5th Cir.1954) (finding no ex post facto violation where a defendant was convicted of knowingly filing false reports with the Public Housing Administration, previously known as the U.S. Housing Authority, despite the fact that the criminal statute was not amended to reflect the name change for four years). There is no statutory ambiguity that would warrant application of the rule of lenity here, as appellants urge.</p>\n<p>Because the 1999 amendment to § 1014 created no new criminal liability, imposed no greater punishment, and did not alter the rules of evidence, we hold that appellants' convictions do not violate the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Evidence Is Sufficient To Support Appellants' Convictions</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to convict them. Alfonzo challenges the sufficiency of evidence for Counts 2-13, 22-30, 42, 44, 53 and 58-60, and Morales challenges the sufficiency of evidence for Count 20. This Court reviews Rule 29 motions for acquittal de novo. <i>United States v. Godin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203401\"><a href=\"/opinion/203401/united-states-v-godin/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a court may acquit a defendant after the close of the prosecution's case if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction. In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider whether, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, \"a rational fact finder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Marin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203236\"><a href=\"/opinion/203236/united-states-v-marin/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2008). We review appellants' challenges in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>The Bribery Charge Against Morales</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Count 20 charged both Morales and Alfonzo with aiding and abetting each other in bribing, and with directly and indirectly bribing and attempting to bribe, Torres, the FSA Program Director. The substantive offense against Morales was a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(1); the aiding and abetting offense was a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2. The bribery charged was promising $130,000, and giving $18,000 in cash, to Torres to influence him to approve and authorize disbursement of unqualified loans to cattlemen in Arecibo.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> Morales argues that even if there were enough evidence that Alfonzo made a direct cash payment of $18,000 to Torres and forgave a $50,000 debt, there was insufficient evidence that she was directly involved or that she knew any money she was earning would be used to pay a bribe to Torres. Of course, she need not have actually been the person to pay the bribe to be culpable, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Dixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393831\"><a href=\"/opinion/393831/united-states-v-dixon-john-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 191 (3d Cir.1981), and she does not contend that. More specifically, she argues there was testimony that she was not present at the meeting where the scheme was hatched and that her arrangement with Irizarry was not sufficient to show her involvement with the scheme to bribe Torres. The mere fact that she and Torres were married alone would not be sufficient. But there was more evidence than that, and it was sufficient.</p>\n<p>The government introduced circumstantial evidence showing that Alfonzo coordinated the criminal scheme with Torres and Morales, and sent the cases to the Arecibo office for Morales to process. At the Arecibo office, Morales compiled the fraudulent loan applications, inflated the claimed damages, and submitted falsified documents to substantiate the claimed losses. There is also evidence showing that Alfonzo told Torres that he would get paid little by \"little as the cases were closed,\" and that Morales deducted money from the accounts to pay Torres. This is sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Morales consciously shared Alfonzo's knowledge of the scheme to defraud the FSA, and worked to further the scheme by processing numerous FSA applications with inflated damages and falsified invoices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Banco Santander Fraudulent Loan Charge</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Count 22 alleged that Alfonzo helped Alvarez obtain a commercial loan from Santander in which Alfonzo had a personal financial interest in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 208 and 216(a)(2). The government asserted that Alfonzo, in his capacity as a FSA loan manager, wrote a letter falsely stating that Alvarez had been approved for a $100,000 FSA loan that would be used to repay the commercial loan from Santander.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that there is insufficient evidence to show that he participated in the processing of the emergency loan request. However, whether Alfonzo personally participated in the processing of the emergency loan request is immaterial. To establish a violation of § 208, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) was an officer or employee of the executive branch or an independent agency; (2) participated personally and substantially in his official governmental capacity in a matter; and (3) knew that he had a financial interest in that particular matter. <i>United States v. Nevers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6012\"><a href=\"/opinion/6012/united-states-v-nevers/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (5th Cir.1993). The elements of the crime under § 208 are supported by sufficient evidence. Alfonzo, while employed as a FSA loan manager, personally and substantially participated in his official capacity by sending a letter on behalf of the FSA to Santander. Alfonzo's letter falsely stated that Alvarez's FSA loan had been approved, when in fact, Alfonzo knew that it had not been approved. The government also established that Alfonzo had a personal financial interest in the Santander loan, which he intended to use to save his financially vulnerable farms. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence to support Alfonzo's conviction on Count 22.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Fraudulent Loan Charges</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 2-13, 23-30 and 42 charged Alfonzo with making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2(a) and 1014. Counts 2-13 concerned the Toledo family's emergency and operating loans for alleged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> damage to their dairy farms. Counts 23-30 concerned the Barreto family's loans. Count 42 concerned Jorge Delgado-Peréz's emergency loan for $500,000.</p>\n<p>To establish a violation of § 2(a), the government must prove that (1) the principal knowingly submitted false statements; and (2) the accomplice consciously shared knowledge of it, associated himself with it, and intended to help ensure its success. <i>García-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d at 130. To establish a violation of § 1014, the government must prove that (1) the defendant made a false statement; (2) the defendant acted knowingly; and (3) the false statement was made for the purpose of influencing action on the loan. <i>Tierney,</i> 266 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction in the absence of direct evidence showing his participation in submitting the fraudulent loan applications. In particular, Alfonzo asserts that in order to find him guilty, the jury improperly inferred that Morales \"told him about the infirmities\" in the loan applications. Direct evidence is not required to find him guilty, and juries are entitled to draw reasonable inferences at trial based on circumstantial evidence. <i>See Rodríguez-Durán,</i> 507 F.3d at 758; <i>Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d at 261.</p>\n<p>There is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the jury's finding that Alfonzo was guilty of making false statements to obtain FSA loans. Multiple witnesses at trial testified that Alfonzo's wife Morales intentionally inflated the damages on the loan applications and instructed the cattlemen to obtain falsified invoices. Other witnesses testified that they met with Alfonzo after applying for FSA loans and that he was concerned about their loan applications being investigated. The investigator testified that Alfonzo made excuses for failing to turn over the files in question and also made excuses for why these files contained discrepancies. Based on this evidence, the jury was permitted to infer that Alfonzo shared knowledge of the cattlemen's false statements in the loan applications.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. <i>The Fraudulent Livestock Indemnity And Emergency Conservation Application Charges</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 44, 53 and 58 charged Alfonzo with making false statements in connection with applications relating to the Livestock Indemnity and Emergency Conservation Programs in violation of §§ 2(a) and 1014. Counts 44 and 58 alleged that Alfonzo knowingly and willfully made false statements in connection with applications for Livestock Indemnity funds in the amount of $18,868, and for Emergency Conservation funds in the amount of $14,837, on behalf of Nelson Ramos-Irizarry (\"Ramos\"). Count 53 alleged that Alfonzo knowingly and willfully made false statements and overvalued land, property, and security to fraudulently obtain Emergency Conservation funds in the amount of $19,200 for Teodoro Alfonzo-Toledo (\"Toledo\").</p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that the government did not elicit any testimony concerning Alfonzo's direct participation in the submission of false information. We disagree. For Count 44, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence including: the close relationship between Alfonzo and Ramos; several meetings between Alfonzo and Ramos to discuss intentional inflation of losses in cattle; and Alfonzo's instructions to obtain a letter from a veterinarian certifying the number of perished cattle to receive additional FSA incentives. For Count 58, there is also sufficient circumstantial evidence that Alfonzo met with Toledo on several occasions to discuss expediting falsified loans under the FSA, and that they shared tips on how to increase amount of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> falsified damages on the loan applications. For Count 53, Toledo testified that he contributed a $1,000 \"donation\" to Alfonzo for expediting the loans. Toledo also testified that he personally attended the \"donation\" meeting to ensure that Alfonzo would help the cattlemen obtain FSA benefits. Accordingly, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence upon which the jury can infer Alfonzo's guilt for Counts 44, 53, and 58.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>The Improper Income Supplementation Charge</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Counts 59 and 60 charged Alfonzo with knowingly and willfully receiving improper payments from FSA clients in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 209 and 216. Count 59 alleged that Alfonzo received a cash payment of $10,000. Count 60 alleged that Alfonzo received payment in the form of auto body repairs to his wife's automobile.</p>\n<p>To establish a claim under § 209, the government must establish the following four elements: (1) a non-government party (2) makes a contribution or supplementation to (3) the salary of an executive branch official (4) as compensation for his services as an officer or employee of the executive branch. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Project on Gov't Oversight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460944\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460944/united-states-v-project-on-govt-oversight/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 62 (D.D.C.2008). The last element requires two inquiries: (1) what the disputed payment is for, i.e., what activity prompted the compensation; and (2) the subjective intent of the parties to determine what the payment was actually for, especially where there are various activities that could have motivated the payment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions on Counts 59 and 60 because the $10,000 cash payment and automobile repairs were \"gifts.\" Alfonzo also argues that no witnesses testified that they paid Alfonzo for his FSA services. These assertions are without merit. In support of Count 59, numerous cattlemen testified that they provided the cash payment to Alfonzo to place them \"in a better position to obtain\" future benefits through the FSA, and that they donated the money to Alfonzo \"in appreciation, because he had helped [them] get those benefits.\" In support of Count 60, several witnesses testified that they paid for the repairs performed on Alfonzo's wife's automobile to get on Alfonzo's \"good side\" and \"to please\" Alfonzo. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence that non-government parties improperly supplemented Alfonzo's income in exchange for the services he rendered as a FSA employee. This is sufficient to support Alfonzo's convictions on Counts 59 and 60.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Instructing The Jury On Sentencing Enhancements</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Appellants argue that the district court erred in instructing the jury on definitions regarding certain sentencing enhancements. Appellants' trial commenced on June 8, 2004. At that time, <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000) governed the law on sentencing. The <i>Apprendi</i> standard requires that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201204\"><a href=\"/opinion/201204/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 541 n. 1 (1st Cir. 2004). It was unclear at the time whether <i>Blakely</i> applied to the Federal Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> Guidelines or had retroactive effect. To resolve the issue, the parties agreed to rely on the <i>Apprendi</i> standard. As a prophylactic measure, the judge asked the jurors to fill out a special verdict form.</p>\n<p>Appellants assert that they were prejudiced by the jury's consideration of certain sentencing enhancement questions. Morales objects to the jury's consideration of whether she took significant affirmative steps to conceal the offense; whether she applied more than minimal planning to accomplish the scheme; and whether Morales used \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public [that] usually requires substantial education, training or licensing.\" Alfonzo challenges the jury's consideration of whether he had a leadership role in the offense; the amount of loss; whether he applied more than minimal planning; and whether he abused the public trust.</p>\n<p>We understand the arguments to fall into two basic categories. The first is a claim that, since the case was not bifurcated into a guilt phase and then a penalty phase, it was error to have the jury focus on issues that assumed guilt. The district court, avoiding this risk, instructed that the jury should deliberate on these issues if and only if they had already concluded the defendants were guilty. This is not a situation in which a jury might reasonably do the reverse, as in <i>United States v. Spock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286579\"><a href=\"/opinion/286579/united-states-v-benjamin-spock-united-states-of-america-v-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 183 (1st Cir.1969). Further, there was strong evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p>Second, there is an objection to the content of the loss instruction, which Morales claims misstated the definition of the term \"loss\" as it was used in the Sentencing Guidelines. It is unclear that Morales timely objected to this instruction. Regardless of whether we review this instruction for an abuse of discretion rather than plain error, however, the district court's definition of loss did not materially diverge from the then-governing definition in the Sentencing Guidelines, and there is no indication of prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Its Pre-Trial Disqualification Of Morales' Attorney</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Morales argues that her Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because the district court disqualified her chosen attorney, Maria Sandoval, before trial. She was represented by other counsel at trial. The district court found that there was an actual and potential conflict of interest because Attorney Sandoval previously represented a government witness who was scheduled to testify against Morales' husband and co-defendant, Alfonzo. We review the district court's disqualification decision for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Lanoue,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197829\"><a href=\"/opinion/197829/united-states-v-lanoue/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 663 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to the assistance of counsel in a trial for any serious crime. <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 343, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An element of that right is \"the right of the defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him.\" <i>United States v.

Accordingly, although a defendant may generally waive his Sixth Amendment right to a non-conflicted attorney, \"the essential aim of the [Sixth] Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> whom he prefers.\" <i>Wheat v.

Against this background, our review is deferential and the district court has broad latitude. <i>Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d at 663.</p>\n<p>Before trial, the magistrate judge disqualified Attorney Sandoval, finding that an \"actual conflict of interest exists\" and, in addition, warned of \"other potential conflicts which may metamorphose into actual conflicts as the case progresses.\" In support of this decision, the magistrate judge, after a hearing, found five \"crucial\" facts<sup>[5]</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>(i) Attorney Sandoval, previous to her involvement in this case, represented [government witness] \"GW\" in a drug conspiracy and money laundering case unrelated to this case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) Following his sentence in a drug case, GW became a government cooperator;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iii) At the time GW approached the government to become a cooperator, Attorney Sandoval continued to represent him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(iv) Besides cooperating in the drug-related matters subject of an ongoing investigation, GW was present at the time a co-defendant in this case was bribed. This co-defendant is Ismael Alfonzo-Reyes who is the defendant's husband;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(v) the [g]overnment has announced that GW will be a witness in the present case, which involves a conspiracy charge[ ] [sic].</blockquote>\n<p>Morales argues that there was no actual conflict warranting disqualification, and even if there were, any potential conflict could have been waived by both clients. In particular, she asserts that the government witness was willing to waive the attorney-client privilege and represented this willingness to the district court. There is no record that such a waiver actually occurred, so that argument is hypothetical.</p>\n<p>With respect to a potential conflict of interest, this Court has noted that such a conflict \"is a matter that is uniquely factual and presents a special dilemma for trial courts.\" <i>Lanoue,</i> 137 F.3d at 663. Accordingly, \"[t]he evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case ... must be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court.\" <i>Wheat,</i> 486 U.S. at 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1692</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In this case, Attorney Sandoval's representation may have placed her in the position of having to cross-examine her former client, a witness with whom she shared confidences protected by attorney-client privilege. The district court could conclude the matters were sufficiently related given some evidence linking the government's potential witness, GW, to co-defendant Morales.</p>\n<p>Morales argues that \"the prosecution neither called nor alluded to this purportedly `important' witness during the entire course of the trial,\" which \"only compound[ed] the error\" of disqualification. But a court's decision on disqualification is not made with the clarity of hindsight. The Supreme Court in <i>Wheat</i> explained that a district court's decision to disqualify counsel is based on the facts presented at the time of the disqualification motion, and does not turn upon subsequent events at triali.e., whether the witness ultimately takes the stand:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> [W]e think the district court must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists <i>which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses</i> ....</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 163, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span> (1988) (emphasis added). Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in disqualifying Attorney Sandoval.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Appellant Morales' Sentence Is Not Unreasonable</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Morales asserts that her 27-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court judge improperly treated the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). We review the reasonableness of sentences for abuse of discretion. <i>Gall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007).</p>\n<p>Morales contends that the trial judge's statement that <i>Booker</i> \"directs sentencing courts to resort to the guidelines in order to structure a reasonable sentence\" demonstrates that the judge improperly treated the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, instead of advisory. We disagree. In light of the district court's reference to the \"now advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines,\" we find that the district court treated them as advisory. Nor did the court's analysis fail to consider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors. Indeed, the district court described Morales as \"a first time offender\" and a \"productive member within her community.\" As a result, the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom end of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range, demonstrating the individualized assessment. For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>The District Court Did Not Err In Awarding A Four-Point Leadership Role Enhancement</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Alfonzo argues that the district court erred in giving him a four-point leadership role enhancement during sentencing. A court's decision to impose a sentencing enhancement for a leadership role based on the facts is reviewed for clear error. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203687\"><a href=\"/opinion/203687/united-states-v-rodriguez-lozada/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant's base offense level is raised by four levels if he \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants....\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 3B1.1 (2004). We must also consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote>the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at cmt. 4. Alfonzo argues the evidence at trial showed that there were only four participants to the crime, which he asserts does not include his co-conspirators. This is not correct. Alfonzo's leadership role over his co-conspirators may be considered for a sentencing enhancement. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez-Lozada,</i> 558 F.3d at 44. The evidence at trial showed that Alfonzo had a leadership role in the criminal scheme involving five or more participants. Alfonzo recruited twenty cattlemen in Puerto Rico who testified that Alfonzo participated in inflating their damages and instructed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> them to obtain falsified estimates. Alfonzo also directed Morales to falsify the loan applications submitted by the cattlemen. Furthermore, Alfonzo bribed Torres for the required FSA authorization for loans over $300,000. Accordingly, based on this evidence, we find that Alfonzo's four-point leadership role enhancement was not clear error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> on all issues.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Honorable Arthur J. Gajarsa, <i>Circuit Judge,</i> United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Appellants are no longer married.</p>\n<p>[2]  The dairy farms owned by various Toledo family relatives include the Toledo Dairy, Inc., Gregorio Toledo, Inc., J. Dairy, Inc., and Café Dairy, Inc. (hereinafter, \"the Toledo family dairy farms\").</p>\n<p>[3]  The original indictment issued approximately a year earlier on April 25, 2003 and charged Alfonzo and Morales with similar but fewer Counts relating to their fraudulent conduct involving various FSA loan applications.</p>\n<p>[4]  Count 41 charged Morales with making false statements on a FSA loan application in violation of § 1014; Count 47 charged Alfonzo with assisting with the submission of false applications for livestock indemnities in violation of § 1014.
