Sareth Kim is a native and citizen\n\nof Cambodia currently residing in the United States.             In January\n\n1983, Kim's status was adjusted to that of \"lawful permanent\n\nresident\" of the United States.           In December 1993, Kim shot and\n\nkilled    another   man    who--Kim's    sister   told    him--had   sexually\n\nassaulted her. In November 1994, Kim pled nolo contendere in Rhode\n\nIsland state court to a charge of manslaughter, R.I. Gen. Laws §\n\n11-23-3 (1993), and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n            In   January   1995,   deportation    proceedings    were   begun\n\nagainst Kim on the ground that he had committed an \"aggravated\n\nfelony\"     rendering       him    deportable     under      8   U.S.C.     §\n\n1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994) (now renumbered § 1227 (2000)).                 That\n\ncategory includes a \"crime of violence,\" id. § 1101(43)(F), which\n\nis itself defined to include any crime\n\n            that has as an element the use . . . of\n            physical force against the person . . . of\n            another . . . [or any felony] that, by its\n            nature, involves a substantial risk that\n            physical force against . . . another may be\n            used in the course of committing the offense.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 16 (1994).\n\n            In the administrative proceeding, the immigration judge\n\nfound from the evidence that Kim had confronted the victim with a\n\ngun and shot the victim as he sought to drive away; that the crime\n\nwas embraced by section 16's definition whether it comprised\n\nvoluntary or involuntary manslaughter under Rhode Island law; and\n\nthat Kim was not eligible for discretionary relief under section\n\n                                     -2-\n\f212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)\n\n(1994) (now repealed), because such relief was precluded for all\n\naggravated felons by a 1996 statutory amendment to the immigration\n\nlaws,       Antiterrorism    and   Effective    Death   Penalty   Act   of   1996\n\n(\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, § 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277.\n\n               Kim sought review before the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"Board\" or \"BIA\") which in 1998 affirmed in a brief per curiam\n\ndecision.      Kim did not seek judicial review.         However, on April 19,\n\n2005, Kim filed a motion to reopen with the BIA renewing his\n\nrequest for section 212(c) relief.             This new motion was based on a\n\nnew regulation allowing such applications to be filed by April 26,\n\n2005.1\n\n               The events leading up to the regulation are complicated\n\nbut relevant to this proceeding.               The immigration laws mandate\n\nexclusion--usually, a turning away at entry points--of aliens who\n\nhave committed certain criminal offenses.               See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)\n\n(2000).       Until its repeal, section 212(c) allowed the Attorney\n\nGeneral to grant a discretionary waiver from excludability in\n\ncertain instances.2         On its face, section 212(c) might appear to do\n\n\n        1\n      Exec. Office for Immigration Review, Section 212(c) Relief\nfor Aliens With Certain Criminal Convictions Before April 1, 1997,\n69 Fed. Reg. 57,826 (Sept. 28, 2004) (codified at 8 C.F.R. pts.\n1003, 1212, 1240 (2006)).\n        2\n      That subsection stated in relevant part that \"[a]liens\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded\nabroad voluntarily . . . and who are returning . . . may be\nadmitted in the discretion of the Attorney General without regard\n\n                                       -3-\n\fKim no good because (1) he is not being excluded and (2) it has\n\nsince been repealed. However, in 1976, another circuit court ruled\n\nthat it was a denial of equal protection not to extend the same\n\nwaiver opportunity to those being deported as was available to\n\nthose being excluded, Francis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268, 273 (2d Cir.\n\n1976), and the BIA thereafter accepted this position. In re Silva,\n\n16 I. & N. Dec. 26, 30 (BIA 1976).\n\n          In 1990, Congress limited section 212(c) waivers by\n\nprohibiting any alien convicted of an aggravated felony who had\n\nserved a term of at least five years from applying for such relief.\n\nImmigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 511, 104 Stat.\n\n4978, 5052.   In 1996, Congress further limited the availability of\n\nsection 212(c) waivers with the passage of AEDPA section 440(d),\n\nand then repealed section 212(c) entirely, Illegal Immigration\n\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-\n\n208, § 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-597.\n\n          Thereafter, the Supreme Court determined (for reasons\n\nthat need not concern us) that despite section 212(c)'s repeal,\n\nthose who had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere before the 1996\n\namendments should retain the opportunity to seek such waivers. INS\n\nv. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 326 (2001).    The Attorney General then\n\nadopted regulations allowing those (like Kim) protected by St. Cyr\n\nto reapply for section 212(c) relief by a date certain, see note 1,\n\n\nto the provisions of subsection (a).\"   8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994).\n\n                                -4-\n\fabove, and Kim's request for such relief was filed before the\n\ndeadline.\n\n            Although Kim's application was not untimely, the BIA in\n\nthe decision now before us for review determined that Kim was not\n\neligible to apply for such relief.     Its stated reason was that he\n\nhad been ordered deported for having committed a crime of violence-\n\n-a type of aggravated felony--and there was no counterpart ground\n\nof exclusion in section 212(a) from which one could seek a waiver\n\nof excludability under section 212(c).      The Board added that it\n\n\"appear[ed]\" that Kim had served more than five years and that\n\n\"[i]f this is true,\" he would in any event be ineligible for\n\nsection 212(c) relief.\n\n            Kim has now petitioned for review by this court of the\n\nBIA's decision.     Kim seeks reversal on two different grounds:\n\nfirst, that the immigration judge erred in classifying Kim's\n\nmanslaughter conviction as a crime of violence, and second, that in\n\nany event the BIA erred in saying that he was not eligible to be\n\nconsidered for section 212(c) relief.    Kim also says that the BIA\n\nerred in suggesting that he had served five years in prison, but we\n\ndoubt that the Board meant this conjecture as a ground for denying\n\nrelief (it said \"[i]f\") and in any event do not ourselves rely upon\n\nit.\n\n            Kim's first claim--that no crime of violence occurred\n\neven though Kim approached the victim with a cocked gun and shot\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fhim in the head as the victim fled--might seem frivolous to one not\n\nacquainted with immigration law.                But Congress' wording, coupled\n\nwith relevant court decisions, has resulted in a disregard of what\n\nactually happened and a focus instead upon the question whether the\n\ncrime    as    defined    by    statute    had    to    involve      the   identified\n\ncharacteristic (here, violence).                E.g., Dickson v. Ashcroft, 346\n\nF.3d 44, 48 (2d Cir. 2003).\n\n               Kim    argues    that    manslaughter      can   be    committed      by\n\naccident, and so under a categorical test does not qualify as a\n\ncrime of violence.        This argument is foreclosed.            Kim never sought\n\njudicial review of the BIA's ruling in 1998 which affirmed the\n\nimmigration judge's finding that he was an aggravated felon; the\n\ntime limit for doing so is jurisdictional, Ven v. Ashcroft, 386\n\nF.3d    357,    359    (1st    Cir.    2004),   and    cannot   be    end-run   by   a\n\ncollateral attack several years later.                 In fact, Kim did not even\n\nraise the issue in the new BIA proceeding seeking section 212(c)\n\nrelief and the BIA did not address it.\n\n               This brings us to Kim's second, more substantial claim\n\nwhich is fully preserved--namely, his claim that he is eligible to\n\nbe considered for section 212(c) relief.                Even if we agreed, this\n\nwould not by itself entitle him to remain in this country.                           It\n\nwould merely permit the Attorney General to grant a discretionary\n\nwaiver of deportability.          See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)(1994) (repealed).\n\nNor is it clear how far any court would have authority to review a\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fdenial of the waiver.       See Avendano-Espejo v. Dep't of Homeland\n\nSec., 448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam).\n\n            However, for several different reasons, this kind of\n\neligibility may itself be quite valuable to an applicant.               The\n\nlegal issue raised by Kim is not without difficulty because--\n\nalthough    formally   an     issue    of    statutory    construction--the\n\npossibility of such a waiver for deportees could not have been\n\nconsidered by Congress.       Rather, it was created by post-enactment\n\ndecisions of the courts.\n\n            As already explained, section 212(c) as written was part\n\nof a scheme that juxtaposed various grounds for exclusion (listed\n\nin section 212(a)) with qualified authority of the Attorney General\n\n(described in section 212(c)) to waive individual grounds in the\n\ncase of certain permanent residents who were seeking to reenter\n\nthis   country.    Under    the   Second      Circuit's   equal   protection\n\nanalysis, accepted by the BIA, any statutory waiver opportunity\n\navailable to an excludable person must be available to a deportable\n\nperson.    See Francis, 532 F.2d at 273.\n\n            But \"aggravated felony\" and \"crime of violence,\" although\n\nstatutory grounds for deportation under specified conditions, were\n\nnot themselves statutory grounds for exclusion; therefore the\n\nexclusion    statute   does    not     provide    authority   for   waivers\n\ncorresponding to those grounds.             Accordingly, Kim has not been\n\ndenied equal protection; Congress has not provided waivers for\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fexclusion on these grounds, so it need not provide waivers for\n\ndeportation on these grounds.\n\n              To get around this syllogism, Kim argues that because his\n\ncrime   was    voluntary   manslaughter,    he   was   guilty   of    \"a   crime\n\ninvolving     moral   turpitude,\"   which   is    a    statutory     ground   of\n\nexclusion, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (2000), and which also\n\nwas waivable–-before section 212(c) was repealed--so long as the\n\nindividual had not served a term of imprisonment of at least five\n\nyears for one or more aggravated felonies.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)\n\n(1994) (repealed).      So, Kim contends, the waiver authority should\n\nbe extended to him under St. Cyr and the regulations.\n\n              Now, it is probable that Kim's crime was voluntary\n\nmanslaughter but this is not certain; the immigration judge found\n\nit unnecessary to decide whether it was voluntary or involuntary\n\nmanslaughter.      Nor is it certain whether manslaughter of either\n\ntype would be classified as a crime of moral turpitude under\n\nsection 212(a).       The phrase \"moral turpitude\" is one of the most\n\nambiguous in the long list of ambiguous legal phrases, and the\n\ncases are far from consistent.\n\n              Some decisions use language that would apply to almost\n\nany serious crime with an aggravating element, e.g., Nguyen v.\n\nReno, 211 F.3d 692, 695 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[A]n assault may or may\n\nnot be a crime of moral turpitude\"; \"the dividing line is the\n\naggravating element.\").        Other decisions stress the element of\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcorruption or deceit.          E.g., Padilla v. Gonzales, 397 F.3d 1016,\n\n1020 (7th Cir. 2005) (\"Crimes . . . that include dishonesty or\n\nlying   as   an    essential    element   .   .    .    tend    to   involve   moral\n\nturpitude.\").\n\n             In all events, we conclude that it would not matter even\n\nif Kim's actions in this instance could be considered a crime of\n\nmoral turpitude as well as an aggravated felony and crime of\n\nviolence. As we read section 212(c), what the Attorney General had\n\nauthority to waive, under certain conditions and before section\n\n212(c)'s repeal, were particular grounds of exclusion; St. Cyr and\n\nthe regulations now extend such waiver authority to counterpart\n\ngrounds of deportation and preserve it for applicants who meet the\n\ntime deadline.\n\n             But, as we have noted, there is no waiver authority for\n\none who is excluded as an \"aggravated felon\" or one who commits a\n\n\"crime of violence\" (these not being grounds of exclusion).                    So it\n\nis beside the point that a different ground of deportation (e.g.,\n\nthe \"crimes of moral turpitude\" ground) might have been waived if\n\nit also had been invoked against him.                    If someone was found\n\ndeportable on two different grounds, waiver of one would hardly\n\navoid the other--for which waiver had not or could not be invoked.\n\n             Nor, as the Board has previously and correctly ruled, is\n\nthere any basis for saying that, in general, crimes of moral\n\nturpitude    and    aggravated    felonies    or       crimes   of    violence   are\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fessentially the same category.    In re Brieva, 23 I. & N. Dec. at\n\n772-73.   Aggravated felonies and crimes of violence are both\n\ncategories of crimes or types of crimes, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)\n\n(2000), 18 U.S.C. § 16 (2000); depending on the breadth of the\n\nphrase \"moral turpitude,\" it would include some but not necessarily\n\nall of those crimes and would surely encompass others not on the\n\nlist of defined crimes.\n\n          Our approach is the one taken by the Board, In re Brieva,\n\n23 I. & N. Dec. 766, 772-73 (BIA 2005), and the Ninth Circuit,\n\nKomarenko v. INS, 35 F.3d 432, 435 (9th Cir. 1994)--the latter\n\nbeing the only considered circuit precedent in point.    The Ninth\n\nCircuit case involved a different set of grounds, but it used the\n\nsame framework for analysis that we follow here.        Aside from\n\nconstitutional issues, the Board's reading of the statute and its\n\nregulations is entitled to weight.\n\n          If this rather mechanical reading of the law frustrated\n\nany evident congressional intent or policy, we would look twice;\n\nbut the opposite is true.    Congress never itself created waiver\n\nauthority for those deported for aggravated felonies or crimes of\n\nviolence (this resulted from judicial decision and administrative\n\naction), and Congress' own views on the subject of waivers are\n\nreflected in its repeal of section 212(c) in its entirety--an\n\nintention compromised by St. Cyr but only as to the effective date\n\nof the repeal.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            If one followed the approach urged upon us by Kim, it\n\nwould instead enlarge the frustration of Congress' own policy\n\npreference.    Given the possible breadth of the moral turpitude\n\nconcept, almost anyone could argue that although found deportable\n\nfor   a   serious   unwaivable   crime,   waiver   authority   should    be\n\ninterpolated because the crime was also one of moral turpitude.\n\nIndeed, the worse the crime, the stronger the argument would be.\n\n            It is not the business of the courts to tell Congress\n\nwhat to do about public policy choices, but we are entitled to warn\n\nwhen the machinery that we help administer is breaking down.            The\n\ncurrent structure of deportation law, greatly complicated by rapid\n\namendments and loop-hole plugging, is now something closer to a\n\nmany-layered archeological dig than a rational construct.               The\n\nregime is badly in need of an overhaul.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-649, &#167; 511, 104 Stat. 4978, 5052. In 1996, Congress further limited the availability of section 212(c) waivers with the passage of AEDPA section 440(d), and then repealed section 212(c) entirely, Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#167; 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-597.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the Supreme Court determined (for reasons that need not concern us) that despite section 212(c)'s repeal, those who had pleaded guilty or <i>nolo contendere</i> before the 1996 amendments should retain the opportunity to seek such waivers. <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). The Attorney General then adopted regulations allowing those (like Kim) protected by <i>St. Cyr</i> to <i>reapply</i> for section 212(c) relief by a date certain, <i>see</i> note 1, above, and Kim's request for such relief was filed before the deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Kim's application was not untimely, the BIA in the decision now before us for review determined that Kim was not eligible to apply for such relief. Its stated reason was that he had been ordered deported for having committed a crime of violence&#8212;a type of aggravated felony&#8212;and there was no counterpart ground of exclusion in section 212(a) from which one could seek a waiver of excludability under section 212(c). The Board added that it \"appear[ed]\" that Kim had served more than five years and that \"[i]f this is true,\" he would in any event be ineligible for section 212(c) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kim has now petitioned for review by this court of the BIA's decision. Kim seeks reversal on two different grounds: first, that the immigration judge erred in classifying Kim's manslaughter conviction as a crime of violence, and second, that in any event the BIA erred in saying that he was not eligible to be considered for section 212(c) relief. Kim also says that the BIA erred in suggesting that he had served five years in prison, but we doubt that the Board meant this conjecture as a ground for denying relief (it said \"[i]f\") and in any event do not ourselves rely upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kim's first claim&#8212;that no crime of violence occurred even though Kim approached the victim with a cocked gun and shot him in the head as the victim fled&#8212;might seem frivolous to one not acquainted with immigration law. But Congress' wording, coupled with relevant court decisions, has resulted in a disregard of what actually happened and a focus instead upon the question whether the crime as defined by statute <i>had</i> to involve the identified characteristic (here, violence). <i>E.g., Dickson v. Ashcroft,</i> 346 F.3d 44, 48 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kim argues that manslaughter can be committed by accident, and so under a categorical test does not qualify as a crime of violence. This argument is foreclosed. Kim never sought judicial review of the BIA's ruling in 1998 which affirmed the immigration judge's finding that he was an aggravated felon; the time limit for doing so is jurisdictional, <i>Ven v. Ashcroft,</i> 386 F.3d 357, 359 (1st Cir.2004), and cannot be end-run by a collateral attack several years later. In fact, Kim did not even raise the issue in the new BIA proceeding seeking section 212(c) relief and the BIA did not address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Kim's second, more substantial claim which is fully preserved&#8212;namely, his claim that he is eligible to be considered for section 212(c) relief. Even if we agreed, this would not by itself entitle him to remain in this country. It would merely permit the Attorney General to grant a <i>discretionary</i> waiver of deportability. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c)(1994) (repealed). Nor is it clear how far any court would have authority to review a denial of the waiver. <i>See Avendano-Espejo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> 448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, for several different reasons, this kind of eligibility may itself be quite valuable to an applicant. The legal issue raised by Kim is not without difficulty because&#8212;although formally an issue of statutory construction&#8212;the possibility of such a waiver for deportees could not have been considered by Congress. Rather, it was created by post-enactment decisions of the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, section 212(c) as written was part of a scheme that juxtaposed various grounds for <i>exclusion</i> (listed in section 212(a)) with qualified authority of the Attorney General (described in section 212(c)) to waive individual grounds in the case of certain permanent residents who were seeking to reenter this country. Under the Second Circuit's equal protection analysis, accepted by the BIA, any statutory waiver opportunity available to an excludable person must be available to a deportable person. <i>See Francis,</i> 532 F.2d at 273.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But \"aggravated felony\" and \"crime of violence,\" although statutory grounds for deportation under specified conditions, were <i>not</i> themselves statutory grounds for exclusion; therefore the exclusion statute does not provide authority for waivers corresponding to those grounds. Accordingly, Kim has not been denied equal protection; Congress has not provided waivers for exclusion on these grounds, so it need not provide waivers for deportation on these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To get around this syllogism, Kim argues that because his crime was voluntary manslaughter, he was guilty of \"a crime involving moral turpitude,\" which <i>is</i> a statutory ground of exclusion, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (2000), and which also was waivable&#8212;before section 212(c) was repealed&#8212;so long as the individual had not served a term of imprisonment of at least five years for one or more aggravated felonies. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1994) (repealed). So, Kim contends, the waiver authority should be extended to him under <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, it is probable that Kim's crime was voluntary manslaughter but this is not certain; the immigration judge found it unnecessary to decide whether it was voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. Nor is it certain whether manslaughter of either type would be classified as a crime of moral turpitude under section 212(a). The phrase \"moral turpitude\" is one of the most ambiguous in the long list of ambiguous legal phrases, and the cases are far from consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some decisions use language that would apply to almost any serious crime with an aggravating element, <i>e.g., Nguyen v. Reno,</i> 211 F.3d 692, 695 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[A]n assault may or may not be a crime of moral turpitude\"; \"the dividing line is the aggravating element.\"). Other decisions stress the element of corruption or deceit. <i>E.g., Padilla v. Gonzales,</i> 397 F.3d 1016, 1020 (7th Cir.2005) (\"Crimes ... that include dishonesty or lying as an essential element ... tend to involve moral turpitude.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we conclude that it would not matter even if Kim's actions in this instance could be considered a crime of moral turpitude <i>as well as</i> an aggravated felony and crime of violence. As we read section 212(c), what the Attorney General had authority to waive, under certain conditions and before section 212(c)'s repeal, were particular <i>grounds</i> of exclusion; <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulations now extend such waiver authority to counterpart grounds of deportation and preserve it for applicants who meet the time deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as we have noted, there is no waiver authority for one who is excluded as an \"aggravated felon\" or one who commits a \"crime of violence\" (these not being grounds of exclusion). So it is beside the point that a different ground of deportation (<i>e.g.,</i> the \"crimes of moral turpitude\" ground) might have been waived <i>if</i> it also had been invoked against him. If someone was found deportable on two different grounds, waiver of one would hardly avoid the other&#8212;for which waiver had not or could not be invoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, as the Board has previously and correctly ruled, is there any basis for saying that, in general, crimes of moral turpitude and aggravated felonies or crimes of violence are essentially the <i>same</i> category. <i>In re Brieva,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 772-73. Aggravated felonies and crimes of violence are both categories of crimes or types of crimes, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43) (2000), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16 (2000); depending on the breadth of the phrase \"moral turpitude,\" it would include some but not necessarily all of those crimes and would surely encompass others not on the list of defined crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our approach is the one taken by the Board, <i>In re Brieva-Perez,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 772-73 (BIA 2005), and the Ninth Circuit, <i>Komarenko v. INS,</i> 35 F.3d 432, 435 (9th Cir.1994)&#8212;the latter being the only considered circuit precedent in point. The Ninth Circuit case involved a different set of grounds, but it used the same framework for analysis that we follow here. Aside from constitutional issues, the Board's reading of the statute and its regulations is entitled to weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this rather mechanical reading of the law frustrated any evident congressional intent or policy, we would look twice; but the opposite is true. Congress never itself created waiver authority for those deported for aggravated felonies or crimes of violence (this resulted from judicial decision and administrative action), and Congress' own views on the subject of waivers are reflected in its repeal of section 212(c) in its entirety&#8212;an intention compromised by <i>St. Cyr</i> but only as to the effective date of the repeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If one followed the approach urged upon us by Kim, it would instead enlarge the frustration of Congress' own policy preference. Given the possible breadth of the moral turpitude concept, almost anyone could argue that although found deportable for a serious unwaivable crime, waiver authority should be interpolated <i>because</i> the crime was also one of moral turpitude. Indeed, the worse the crime, the stronger the argument would be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not the business of the courts to tell Congress what to do about public policy choices, but we are entitled to warn when the machinery that we help administer is breaking down. The current structure of deportation law, greatly complicated by rapid amendments and loop-hole plugging, is now something closer to a many-layered archeological dig than a rational construct. The regime is badly in need of an overhaul.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Exec.

The Attorney General then adopted regulations allowing those (like Kim) protected by <i>St. Cyr</i> to <i>reapply</i> for section 212(c) relief by a date certain, <i>see</i> note 1, above, and Kim's request for such relief was filed before the deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Kim's application was not untimely, the BIA in the decision now before us for review determined that Kim was not eligible to apply for such relief. Its stated reason was that he had been ordered deported for having committed a crime of violence&#8212;a type of aggravated felony&#8212;and there was no counterpart ground of exclusion in section 212(a) from which one could seek a waiver of excludability under section 212(c). The Board added that it \"appear[ed]\" that Kim had served more than five years and that \"[i]f this is true,\" he would in any event be ineligible for section 212(c) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kim has now petitioned for review by this court of the BIA's decision. Kim seeks reversal on two different grounds: first, that the immigration judge erred in classifying Kim's manslaughter conviction as a crime of violence, and second, that in any event the BIA erred in saying that he was not eligible to be considered for section 212(c) relief. Kim also says that the BIA erred in suggesting that he had served five years in prison, but we doubt that the Board meant this conjecture as a ground for denying relief (it said \"[i]f\") and in any event do not ourselves rely upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kim's first claim&#8212;that no crime of violence occurred even though Kim approached the victim with a cocked gun and shot him in the head as the victim fled&#8212;might seem frivolous to one not acquainted with immigration law. But Congress' wording, coupled with relevant court decisions, has resulted in a disregard of what actually happened and a focus instead upon the question whether the crime as defined by statute <i>had</i> to involve the identified characteristic (here, violence). <i>E.g., Dickson v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783809\"><a href=\"/opinion/783809/john-p-dickson-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 48 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kim argues that manslaughter can be committed by accident, and so under a categorical test does not qualify as a crime of violence. This argument is foreclosed. Kim never sought judicial review of the BIA's ruling in 1998 which affirmed the immigration judge's finding that he was an aggravated felon; the time limit for doing so is jurisdictional, <i>Ven v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201300\"><a href=\"/opinion/201300/ven-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 359 (1st Cir.2004), and cannot be end-run by a collateral attack several years later. In fact, Kim did not even raise the issue in the new BIA proceeding seeking section 212(c) relief and the BIA did not address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Kim's second, more substantial claim which is fully preserved&#8212;namely, his claim that he is eligible to be considered for section 212(c) relief. Even if we agreed, this would not by itself entitle him to remain in this country. It would merely permit the Attorney General to grant a <i>discretionary</i> waiver of deportability. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c)(1994) (repealed). Nor is it clear how far any court would have authority to review a denial of the waiver. <i>See Avendano-Espejo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794383\"><a href=\"/opinion/794383/roberto-gerardo-avendano-espejo-v-department-of-homeland-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 505 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, for several different reasons, this kind of eligibility may itself be quite valuable to an applicant. The legal issue raised by Kim is not without difficulty because&#8212;although formally an issue of statutory construction&#8212;the possibility of such a waiver for deportees could not have been considered by Congress. Rather, it was created by post-enactment decisions of the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, section 212(c) as written was part of a scheme that juxtaposed various grounds for <i>exclusion</i> (listed in section 212(a)) with qualified authority of the Attorney General (described in section 212(c)) to waive individual grounds in the case of certain permanent residents who were seeking to reenter this country. Under the Second Circuit's equal protection analysis, accepted by the BIA, any statutory waiver opportunity available to an excludable person must be available to a deportable person. <i>See Francis,</i> 532 F.2d at 273.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But \"aggravated felony\" and \"crime of violence,\" although statutory grounds for deportation under specified conditions, were <i>not</i> themselves statutory grounds for exclusion; therefore the exclusion statute does not provide authority for waivers corresponding to those grounds. Accordingly, Kim has not been denied equal protection; Congress has not provided waivers for exclusion on these grounds, so it need not provide waivers for deportation on these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To get around this syllogism, Kim argues that because his crime was voluntary manslaughter, he was guilty of \"a crime involving moral turpitude,\" which <i>is</i> a statutory ground of exclusion, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) (2000), and which also was waivable&#8212;before section 212(c) was repealed&#8212;so long as the individual had not served a term of imprisonment of at least five years for one or more aggravated felonies. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1994) (repealed). So, Kim contends, the waiver authority should be extended to him under <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, it is probable that Kim's crime was voluntary manslaughter but this is not certain; the immigration judge found it unnecessary to decide whether it was voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. Nor is it certain whether manslaughter of either type would be classified as a crime of moral turpitude under section 212(a). The phrase \"moral turpitude\" is one of the most ambiguous in the long list of ambiguous legal phrases, and the cases are far from consistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some decisions use language that would apply to almost any serious crime with an aggravating element, <i>e.g., Nguyen v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198928\"><a href=\"/opinion/198928/nguyen-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span>, 695 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[A]n assault may or may not be a crime of moral turpitude\"; \"the dividing line is the aggravating element.\"). Other decisions stress the element of corruption or deceit. <i>E.g., Padilla v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789214\"><a href=\"/opinion/789214/luis-fernando-padilla-v-alberto-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span>, 1020 (7th Cir.2005) (\"Crimes ... that include dishonesty or lying as an essential element ... tend to involve moral turpitude.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we conclude that it would not matter even if Kim's actions in this instance could be considered a crime of moral turpitude <i>as well as</i> an aggravated felony and crime of violence. As we read section 212(c), what the Attorney General had authority to waive, under certain conditions and before section 212(c)'s repeal, were particular <i>grounds</i> of exclusion; <i>St. Cyr</i> and the regulations now extend such waiver authority to counterpart grounds of deportation and preserve it for applicants who meet the time deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, as we have noted, there is no waiver authority for one who is excluded as an \"aggravated felon\" or one who commits a \"crime of violence\" (these not being grounds of exclusion). So it is beside the point that a different ground of deportation (<i>e.g.,</i> the \"crimes of moral turpitude\" ground) might have been waived <i>if</i> it also had been invoked against him. If someone was found deportable on two different grounds, waiver of one would hardly avoid the other&#8212;for which waiver had not or could not be invoked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, as the Board has previously and correctly ruled, is there any basis for saying that, in general, crimes of moral turpitude and aggravated felonies or crimes of violence are essentially the <i>same</i> category. <i>In re Brieva,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 772-73. Aggravated felonies and crimes of violence are both categories of crimes or types of crimes, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43) (2000), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16 (2000); depending on the breadth of the phrase \"moral turpitude,\" it would include some but not necessarily all of those crimes and would surely encompass others not on the list of defined crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our approach is the one taken by the Board, <i>In re Brieva-Perez,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 772-73 (BIA 2005), and the Ninth Circuit, <i>Komarenko v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677899\"><a href=\"/opinion/677899/alexander-komarenko-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 435 (9th Cir.1994)&#8212;the latter being the only considered circuit precedent in point. The Ninth Circuit case involved a different set of grounds, but it used the same framework for analysis that we follow here. Aside from constitutional issues, the Board's reading of the statute and its regulations is entitled to weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this rather mechanical reading of the law frustrated any evident congressional intent or policy, we would look twice; but the opposite is true. Congress never itself created waiver authority for those deported for aggravated felonies or crimes of violence (this resulted from judicial decision and administrative action), and Congress' own views on the subject of waivers are reflected in its repeal of section 212(c) in its entirety&#8212;an intention compromised by <i>St. Cyr</i> but only as to the effective date of the repeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If one followed the approach urged upon us by Kim, it would instead enlarge the frustration of Congress' own policy preference. Given the possible breadth of the moral turpitude concept, almost anyone could argue that although found deportable for a serious unwaivable crime, waiver authority should be interpolated <i>because</i> the crime was also one of moral turpitude. Indeed, the worse the crime, the stronger the argument would be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not the business of the courts to tell Congress what to do about public policy choices, but we are entitled to warn when the machinery that we help administer is breaking down. The current structure of deportation law, greatly complicated by rapid amendments and loop-hole plugging, is now something closer to a many-layered archeological dig than a rational construct. The regime is badly in need of an overhaul.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Exec.
