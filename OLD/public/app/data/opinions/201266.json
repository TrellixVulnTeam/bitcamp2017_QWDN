KENNEY,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n              COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS, ET AL.,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       [Hon. George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Richard F. Kenney on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Susanne G. Reardon,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           September 29, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam. We have reviewed the parties’ briefs and the\n\nrecord on appeal.    There was neither abuse of discretion nor error\n\nof law in the district court’s September 4, 2003 order dismissing\n\nappellant’s § 1983 complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A.                We\n\naffirm.\n\n           Contrary to appellant’s contention, neither the district\n\ncourt’s March 7, 2001 reinstatement of his complaint (after a\n\nprevious order of dismissal had mistakenly issued) nor this court’s\n\norder of May 17, 2001 barred the district court’s subsequent\n\ndismissal under § 1915A.      Neither action constituted a ruling on\n\nthe sufficiency of the complaint.         And, notwithstanding that the\n\ndistrict   court   had   issued    some   summonses   in   April   2001,   no\n\ndefendant had, as yet, been served        when the court conducted its §\n\n1915A screening in September 2003.\n\n           Moreover, as the district court correctly concluded,\n\nappellant’s civil rights claim for money damages is foreclosed by\n\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994). His request for declaratory\n\nrelief is barred as well.         See Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641\n\n(1997) (applying Heck rule to request for declaratory relief under\n\n§ 1983).    And, his request for injunctive relief (new trial or\n\nimmediate release), which is effectively relief appropriate only\n\nvia habeas corpus, fares no\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fbetter.   His current claim that his complaint was “an application\n\nfor writ of habeas corpus using § 1983 as a vehicle” is both newly\n\nraised and, ultimately, unavailing.         See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411\n\nU.S. 475, 489-90 (1973) (prisoner can not evade habeas requirement\n\nof exhaustion of remedies by labeling a petition seeking habeas-\n\ntype relief as a § 1983 action).\n\n           To the extent that appellant's § 1983 action alleged\n\ninterference with his access to court, appellant's appellate brief\n\nmentions only a gauzy allegation that the Massachusetts               Supreme\n\nJudicial Court improperly refused to remove his appointed counsel\n\nfrom   representing   him   on   appeal.     But,   there   is   no   federal\n\nconstitutional right to self representation on direct appeal from\n\na criminal conviction.      Martinez v. Ct. App. of Cal., 528 U.S. 152\n\n(2000).   Moreover, appellant was given the opportunity to file his\n\nown pro se appellate brief.          This claim, therefore, was also\n\nproperly dismissed pursuant to § 1915A.         We deem waived any other\n\nallegation regarding interference with access to court.\n\n           Finally, we note that appellant has filed a motion\n\ncomplaining that this court issued its notice taking this case upon\n\nthe submitted briefs and without oral argument before it had\n\nreceived his reply brief.        In fact, however, the time for filing\n\nthe reply brief had expired when the court issued its submission\n\nnotice on April 20.      A reply brief is due within 14 days after\n\nservice of the appellees’ brief.          1st Cir. Loc. R. 31(a)(1).      The\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fappellees’ brief was served on March 16 and filed in this court on\n\nMarch 17.   Appellant’s brief was received on April 27.   The reply\n\nbrief was, itself, dated April 21, which was 36 days after service\n\nof the appellees’ brief.   In any event, we have considered anew the\n\nmotion’s request for oral argument and it is denied.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
