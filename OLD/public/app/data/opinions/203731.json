This case involves a dispute over\n\nwhether insurance coverage is barred by the \"known loss\" doctrine\n\nunder Massachusetts law.              The appellants are Globe Newspaper\n\nCompany which owns the Boston Globe (we refer to both as \"the\n\nGlobe\") and Richard Knox, a former Globe columnist; plaintiff-\n\nappellee   is    the       insurer,    Employers   Reinsurance     Corporation\n\n(\"Employers\").         A    condensed    description   of    the   events   and\n\nlitigation will set the scene.\n\n           In November 1994, a doctor at the Dana-Farber Cancer\n\nInstitute in Boston mistakenly gave two breast cancer patients a\n\nchemotherapy dose four times greater than that specified in the\n\nexperimental treatment protocol.              One of the patients, Betsy\n\nLehman, then a Globe columnist, died of heart failure on December\n\n3, 1994.    The other patient survived but suffered debilitating\n\nheart damage.\n\n     After the cause of the deaths was uncovered in February 1995,\n\nthe Globe published a series of articles beginning on March 23,\n\n1995.    This first article, by columnist Richard Knox, identified\n\nDr. Lois Ayash, who was the protocol chair and chief investigator\n\nfor the treatment, as the \"leader of the team\" and said that she\n\nhad countersigned the mistaken overdose order.              In fact, Dr. Ayash\n\nhad become Lehman's attending physician on December 1, 1994, after\n\nthe overdose had been administered, and had not countersigned the\n\norder.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f     There followed Globe articles in March which criticized Dana-\n\nFarber in scorching terms; they did not mention Dr. Ayash, but she\n\nwas the only person the Globe had previously named.          On March 31,\n\n1995, Joan Lukey, a highly experienced litigator with a large\n\nBoston law firm, contacted the Globe's outside counsel, Jonathan\n\nAlbano, about the March 23 article.          After checking into these\n\ncomplaints, Albano concluded that Ayash had not countersigned the\n\norder but that she could properly be characterized as the \"leader\"\n\nof the team.\n\n       After further conversations by Lukey with Albano and Knox,\n\nKnox published an article on May 2, 1995, saying: \"Ayash did not\n\nsign the erroneous drug order, as the Globe reported on March 23,\n\nLukey said.\"   Lukey wrote a week later, complaining that the Globe\n\nhad not admitted its factual error but merely described Lukey's\n\nposition,   and   stating   that   it   \"would   also   appear   to   be   an\n\nappropriate time to discuss how the Globe will recompense Dr.\n\nAyash's damages.\"\n\n     Follow up discussions led to a Globe correction published on\n\nJune 4, 1995, which admitted that Dr. Ayash had been incorrectly\n\nidentified as countersigning the order in question.               Over the\n\nsummer, Lukey had further discussions with Knox about forthcoming\n\nstories about the incident and related matters but apparently did\n\nnot contact Albano again until late October. Albano had made clear\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthat the Globe was not planning to pay damages; but Lukey had not\n\nwithdrawn the request for damages included in her May letter.\n\n      On October 12, 1995, the Globe applied for an insurance policy\n\nwith Employers.          In its application, the Globe listed actual past\n\nand present litigation but did not list Lukey's demand, noting only\n\nthat it received many threats from people seeking to have the Globe\n\nprint   more       favorable    information    about    them    and   that        it   was\n\ndifficult to separate the inconsequential threats from the serious\n\nones.\n\n      Employers         opted   to   provide    coverage      for    various       torts\n\nincluding libel, and to provide defense costs for covered law\n\nsuits; the coverage began on October 20, 1995.                      The policy also\n\ncontained      a    prior   acts     endorsement,     which    covered      liability\n\nstemming from pre-policy acts as long as the Globe did not have\n\nnotice of them and no other insurer provided coverage.\n\n      On October 31, 1995, despite an objection by Lukey, the Globe\n\nran a new article referring to Ayash as the \"doctor in charge of\n\nthe   treatment         protocol\";    noted    that    she    had    been    formally\n\nreprimanded        by   Dana-Farber;    and    asserted      that   she     was    under\n\ninvestigation by the state medical licensing board--information\n\nLukey claimed to be confidential.              Thereafter, in February 1996,\n\nDr. Ayash sued the Globe and others including Knox in state court;\n\nthe claims against the Globe and its columnist included libel and\n\ninvasion of privacy.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f     During the state court proceedings, the Globe suffered a\n\nsanctions order (for refusing to disclose Knox's confidential\n\nsources for certain material) and ultimately a default judgment as\n\nto liability.       Ayash v. Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., No. 96-565-E,\n\n2001 WL 360054 (Mass. Super. Apr. 4, 2001).            A jury awarded Ayash\n\n$420,000 against Knox and $1.68 million against the Globe for\n\neconomic damages and emotional distress.        The judgment was upheld,\n\nAyash v. Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., 822 N.E.2d 667 (Mass.), cert.\n\ndenied, 546 U.S. 927 (2005), and Employers later paid the judgment\n\nand defense costs, with a reservation of rights.\n\n     The present case arises from a federal-court declaratory\n\njudgment suit begun earlier by Employers against the Globe to\n\ndetermine coverage; it was reactivated in the summer of 2005 when\n\nstate court proceedings ended.        In the district court, Employers'\n\ncomplaint denied coverage under the policy and advanced various\n\nclaims against the Globe; the Globe countered with a breach of\n\ncontract    claim   among   others.     Both   sides    moved   for   summary\n\njudgment.\n\n     On June 20, 2006, the district court granted partial summary\n\njudgment to Employers, holding that the policy did not cover the\n\nAyash state-court action either as to the damage judgment that the\n\nGlobe had suffered or the defense costs it had incurred. Employers\n\nReins. Corp. v. Globe Newspaper Co., Inc., No. 03-10388-RWZ, 2006\n\nWL 1738342 (D. Mass. 2006).       The court relied on the known loss\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fdoctrine under Massachusetts law, which prevents the insured from\n\nrecovering for a loss already known by the insured to have occurred\n\nwhen the policy was obtained or to be \"substantially probable\" at\n\nthat time.   SCA Servs., Inc. v. Transp. Ins. Co., 646 N.E.2d 394,\n\n397 (Mass. 1995).\n\n     The district court recognized that the October 31, 2005,\n\narticle, which was part of Ayash's suit, occurred after the policy\n\nhad been purchased.    But it held that the article republished\n\nmaterial from the earlier March 2005 article for which Lukey had\n\nsought compensation and that to allow recovery for republication\n\nwould \"pervert the purpose of the known loss doctrine . . . .\"\n\nEmployers Reins. Corp., 2006 WL 1738342, at *5.   Coverage for the\n\nearlier articles also failed, seemingly for this reason and under\n\nthe \"notice\" provision of the prior acts endorsement.\n\n     The court also granted summary judgment for Employers as to\n\nmirror claims by the Globe requesting a declaration that it had\n\ncoverage; but it denied Employers' request for summary judgment\n\nordering repayment of amounts advanced to or for the Globe, saying\n\nthat the request had not yet been justified.    However, the court\n\ngranted the parties' joint request that its decision be certified\n\nfor interlocutory appeal. 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b) (2006). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n     Our review on a grant of summary judgment is de novo.   Pineda\n\nv. Toomey, 533 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).   We\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fconclude that the known loss doctrine does not apply in this case,\n\nalthough coverage may well be barred or limited on other grounds.\n\nAdmittedly,    SCA    Services    uses   broad   language:   the    SJC    there\n\nexplained that \"the basic purpose of insurance is to protect\n\nagainst fortuitous events and not against known certainties\" and\n\nthat \"an insurable risk is eliminated in the instance where an\n\ninsured    knows,    when   it   purchases   a   policy,   that    there   is   a\n\nsubstantial probability that it will suffer or has already suffered\n\na loss.\"    SCA Servs., 646 N.E.2d at 397.\n\n     Loss in this context surely refers to the loss visited by a\n\njudgment (or settlement)--not the loss suffered by the plaintiff.\n\nAllmerica Fin. Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London,\n\n871 N.E.2d 418, 431 (Mass. 2007) (noting that \"Allmerica had\n\nknowledge of possible and actual claims . . . but not probable or\n\nactual losses\").      Liability insurance for the Globe is designed to\n\ncompensate its loss once the Globe's liability is established.\n\nConsonantly, coverage for past acts that have not resulted in\n\nliability is permissible if the policy so provides.\n\n     A refusal to allow recovery for known loss makes sense where\n\nthe insured, but not the insurer, already knows before the policy\n\nis procured that a loss has occurred or is certain.                       In SCA\n\nServices the policy was obtained after a court had already ordered\n\nthe town waste disposal site to be closed as a nuisance because the\n\nsite had contaminated the groundwater and polluted the environment.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f646 N.E.2d at 396.     The follow-on damage suit had to establish\n\ndamages but liability was virtually certain based on the nuisance\n\nfinding.   Id. at 397-98.\n\n           Accordingly, this court read SCA Services as requiring\n\nthat the insured know \"that a specific loss has already happened or\n\nis substantially certain to happen.\"       U.S. Liab. Ins. Co. v.\n\nSelman, 70 F.3d 684, 690 (1st Cir. 1995) (emphasis added).   And the\n\nSJC thereafter cited Selman's clarifying construction with approval\n\nin Allmerica, 871 N.E.2d at 431.   There, the SJC allowed insurance\n\ncoverage for law suits involving vanishing premium claims even\n\nthough the insured\n\n      knew when it purchased the excess policy that it faced\n      multiple individual 'vanishing premium' claims, and as\n      part of its policy application disclosed both the\n      specific claims against it and the fact that 'vanishing\n      premium claims' were being litigated against others in\n      the industry.\n\nId.\n\n      This reading makes good sense.   It is hard to see why as a\n\nmatter of policy the Globe should not be able to obtain insurance\n\nfor past acts that might lead to liability determinations in due\n\ncourse.    This is especially so where the insurance is for a class\n\nof contingent risks that are part of newspaper's ongoing business.\n\nWhether the Globe made adequate disclosure under the endorsement is\n\na different issue to which we will return.\n\n      Many but not all states follow some variant of the known loss\n\ndoctrine, using one of several labels, but the standard formulation\n\n                                 -8-\n\fis that \"the doctrine usually is applicable only when the insured\n\nactually knows [prior to securing the policy] . . . either that the\n\nloss has occurred or that one is substantially certain to occur.\"\n\n43 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance ยง 479 (2008).   The loss here may have been\n\nlikely, but it was not substantially certain or known by the Globe\n\nto be so when the policy was obtained.\n\n     Thus the early 1995 articles had been published when the\n\ninsurance was procured, but no law suit had been filed, let alone\n\nactually adjudicated (and the October article had not even been\n\npublished).   Nor, even if a suit were brought, was liability\n\ncertain.   Here, the SJC found that Ayash was a limited purpose\n\npublic figure in relation to the overdose, Ayash, 822 N.E.2d at\n\n683, which would have required her to make the heightened actual\n\nmalice showing to recover.   New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.\n\n254, 279-80 (1964).\n\n     The known loss doctrine aside, the Globe may well not enjoy\n\ncoverage for Ayash's law suit.   Although seven articles are cited\n\nin the Ayash state court complaint, the central inaccuracy appears\n\nto be the original March 23 statement that Dr. Ayash countersigned\n\nthe order and the further arguable inaccuracy--the Globe does not\n\nconcede this--that its \"leader\" references may have conveyed the\n\nfalse impression that Dr. Ayash had central clinical responsibility\n\nwhen the overdose was delivered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f     The   prior   acts   endorsement   has   two   different   coverage\n\nconditions that Employers asserts were not met.        One is that the\n\nGlobe not have had, prior to the new policy, \"notice or knowledge\"\n\nof the claim in question or of \"circumstances which would give rise\n\nto such claim.\"    The second, which Employers also says that the\n\nGlobe fails to meet, requires lack of \"other valid and collectible\n\ninsurance applicable to such claim.\"          Alternatively, Employers\n\nobjects to coverage on public policy grounds because the Ayash\n\njudgment allegedly resulted from \"purposeful disobedience\" of a\n\ncourt order.\n\n     Employers invites us to affirm the existing judgment on all or\n\nany of these grounds, and the Globe invites us to reject them.       But\n\nthe district court did not pass upon them; the district court\n\nbriefly invoked the endorsement's notice condition but not in\n\ndetail; nor does the notice condition appear to govern directly the\n\npost-policy October article. We do not propose to decide questions\n\nthat have not been squarely resolved by the district court or fully\n\nbriefed on this appeal.\n\n     The reason why this is so may be of some interest to the\n\nparties in deciding whether to pause now and consider whether a\n\nsettlement is possible.    As to articles published before October,\n\nEmployers' reliance on the first condition of the endorsement is\n\npromising; the condition bars insurance not for a known loss but\n\nmerely where there is notice on the insured's part, not conveyed to\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe insurer, of \"circumstances which would give rise to such\n\nclaim.\"    It is not clear just what answer the Globe has to this\n\ncondition.\n\n       Still, the October 31 article occurred after the policy went\n\ninto   effect   and   its    relationship     to   the   earlier   articles   is\n\ncomplicated.       Part of the October article connects to earlier\n\nallegations but part was the basis for a separate invasion of\n\nprivacy count in Ayash's state court complaint. While the Superior\n\nCourt dismissed that count prior to the sanctions order, Ayash v.\n\nDana-Farber Cancer Inst., No. Civ. A. 96-0565-E, 1997 WL 438769\n\n(Mass.    Super.   July     9,    1997),   conceivably    it   generated   some\n\ncoverage, at least as to defense costs.\n\n       On top of these primary concerns, Employers has other coverage\n\nobjections, one of which (the second condition) may raise factual\n\nand legal issues, while the Globe offers alternative arguments\n\nbased on policy language which, whether or not promising, further\n\ncomplicate analysis.        Finally, Massachusetts has case law directed\n\nto the situation in which damage awards may encompass both covered\n\nand uncovered claims.            Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass'n of\n\nMass. v. Hermitage Ins. Co., 644 N.E.2d 964, 969 (Mass. 1995).\n\n       So each side faces some risks and the outcome of litigation\n\nmight not be an all-or-nothing victory.            The Globe has to face some\n\nuncomfortable facts; the insurer, Massachusetts law that often\n\nfavors the insured.       With able law firms on both sides, the costs\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fof more litigation, including future appeals and even future\n\nremands, will doubtless be weighed by clients.   This case is not\n\nabout principle but about money.   We need not say more.\n\n     The judgment of the district court, denying coverage based on\n\nthe known loss doctrine, is vacated and the matter remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this decision. Each side\n\nwill bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

After checking into these\n\ncomplaints, Albano concluded that Ayash had not countersigned the\n\norder but that she could properly be characterized as the \"leader\"\n\nof the team.\n\n       After further conversations by Lukey with Albano and Knox,\n\nKnox published an article on May 2, 1995, saying: \"Ayash did not\n\nsign the erroneous drug order, as the Globe reported on March 23,\n\nLukey said.\"   Lukey wrote a week later, complaining that the Globe\n\nhad not admitted its factual error but merely described Lukey's\n\nposition,   and   stating   that   it   \"would   also   appear   to   be   an\n\nappropriate time to discuss how the Globe will recompense Dr.\n\nAyash's damages.\"\n\n     Follow up discussions led to a Globe correction published on\n\nJune 4, 1995, which admitted that Dr. Ayash had been incorrectly\n\nidentified as countersigning the order in question.               Over the\n\nsummer, Lukey had further discussions with Knox about forthcoming\n\nstories about the incident and related matters but apparently did\n\nnot contact Albano again until late October. Albano had made clear\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthat the Globe was not planning to pay damages; but Lukey had not\n\nwithdrawn the request for damages included in her May letter.\n\n      On October 12, 1995, the Globe applied for an insurance policy\n\nwith Employers.          In its application, the Globe listed actual past\n\nand present litigation but did not list Lukey's demand, noting only\n\nthat it received many threats from people seeking to have the Globe\n\nprint   more       favorable    information    about    them    and   that        it   was\n\ndifficult to separate the inconsequential threats from the serious\n\nones.\n\n      Employers         opted   to   provide    coverage      for    various       torts\n\nincluding libel, and to provide defense costs for covered law\n\nsuits; the coverage began on October 20, 1995.                      The policy also\n\ncontained      a    prior   acts     endorsement,     which    covered      liability\n\nstemming from pre-policy acts as long as the Globe did not have\n\nnotice of them and no other insurer provided coverage.\n\n      On October 31, 1995, despite an objection by Lukey, the Globe\n\nran a new article referring to Ayash as the \"doctor in charge of\n\nthe   treatment         protocol\";    noted    that    she    had    been    formally\n\nreprimanded        by   Dana-Farber;    and    asserted      that   she     was    under\n\ninvestigation by the state medical licensing board--information\n\nLukey claimed to be confidential.              Thereafter, in February 1996,\n\nDr. Ayash sued the Globe and others including Knox in state court;\n\nthe claims against the Globe and its columnist included libel and\n\ninvasion of privacy.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f     During the state court proceedings, the Globe suffered a\n\nsanctions order (for refusing to disclose Knox's confidential\n\nsources for certain material) and ultimately a default judgment as\n\nto liability.

Liability insurance for the Globe is designed to\n\ncompensate its loss once the Globe's liability is established.\n\nConsonantly, coverage for past acts that have not resulted in\n\nliability is permissible if the policy so provides.\n\n     A refusal to allow recovery for known loss makes sense where\n\nthe insured, but not the insurer, already knows before the policy\n\nis procured that a loss has occurred or is certain.                       In SCA\n\nServices the policy was obtained after a court had already ordered\n\nthe town waste disposal site to be closed as a nuisance because the\n\nsite had contaminated the groundwater and polluted the environment.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f646 N.E.2d at 396.     The follow-on damage suit had to establish\n\ndamages but liability was virtually certain based on the nuisance\n\nfinding.

And the\n\nSJC thereafter cited Selman's clarifying construction with approval\n\nin Allmerica, 871 N.E.2d at 431.   There, the SJC allowed insurance\n\ncoverage for law suits involving vanishing premium claims even\n\nthough the insured\n\n      knew when it purchased the excess policy that it faced\n      multiple individual 'vanishing premium' claims, and as\n      part of its policy application disclosed both the\n      specific claims against it and the fact that 'vanishing\n      premium claims' were being litigated against others in\n      the industry.\n\nId.\n\n      This reading makes good sense.   It is hard to see why as a\n\nmatter of policy the Globe should not be able to obtain insurance\n\nfor past acts that might lead to liability determinations in due\n\ncourse.    This is especially so where the insurance is for a class\n\nof contingent risks that are part of newspaper's ongoing business.\n\nWhether the Globe made adequate disclosure under the endorsement is\n\na different issue to which we will return.\n\n      Many but not all states follow some variant of the known loss\n\ndoctrine, using one of several labels, but the standard formulation\n\n                                 -8-\n\fis that \"the doctrine usually is applicable only when the insured\n\nactually knows [prior to securing the policy] . . . either that the\n\nloss has occurred or that one is substantially certain to occur.\"\n\n43 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance ยง 479 (2008).   The loss here may have been\n\nlikely, but it was not substantially certain or known by the Globe\n\nto be so when the policy was obtained.\n\n     Thus the early 1995 articles had been published when the\n\ninsurance was procured, but no law suit had been filed, let alone\n\nactually adjudicated (and the October article had not even been\n\npublished).   Nor, even if a suit were brought, was liability\n\ncertain.   Here, the SJC found that Ayash was a limited purpose\n\npublic figure in relation to the overdose, Ayash, 822 N.E.2d at\n\n683, which would have required her to make the heightened actual\n\nmalice showing to recover.

Although seven articles are cited\n\nin the Ayash state court complaint, the central inaccuracy appears\n\nto be the original March 23 statement that Dr. Ayash countersigned\n\nthe order and the further arguable inaccuracy--the Globe does not\n\nconcede this--that its \"leader\" references may have conveyed the\n\nfalse impression that Dr. Ayash had central clinical responsibility\n\nwhen the overdose was delivered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f     The   prior   acts   endorsement   has   two   different   coverage\n\nconditions that Employers asserts were not met.        One is that the\n\nGlobe not have had, prior to the new policy, \"notice or knowledge\"\n\nof the claim in question or of \"circumstances which would give rise\n\nto such claim.\"    The second, which Employers also says that the\n\nGlobe fails to meet, requires lack of \"other valid and collectible\n\ninsurance applicable to such claim.\"          Alternatively, Employers\n\nobjects to coverage on public policy grounds because the Ayash\n\njudgment allegedly resulted from \"purposeful disobedience\" of a\n\ncourt order.\n\n     Employers invites us to affirm the existing judgment on all or\n\nany of these grounds, and the Globe invites us to reject them.       But\n\nthe district court did not pass upon them; the district court\n\nbriefly invoked the endorsement's notice condition but not in\n\ndetail; nor does the notice condition appear to govern directly the\n\npost-policy October article. We do not propose to decide questions\n\nthat have not been squarely resolved by the district court or fully\n\nbriefed on this appeal.\n\n     The reason why this is so may be of some interest to the\n\nparties in deciding whether to pause now and consider whether a\n\nsettlement is possible.    As to articles published before October,\n\nEmployers' reliance on the first condition of the endorsement is\n\npromising; the condition bars insurance not for a known loss but\n\nmerely where there is notice on the insured's part, not conveyed to\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe insurer, of \"circumstances which would give rise to such\n\nclaim.\"    It is not clear just what answer the Globe has to this\n\ncondition.\n\n       Still, the October 31 article occurred after the policy went\n\ninto   effect   and   its    relationship     to   the   earlier   articles   is\n\ncomplicated.       Part of the October article connects to earlier\n\nallegations but part was the basis for a separate invasion of\n\nprivacy count in Ayash's state court complaint. While the Superior\n\nCourt dismissed that count prior to the sanctions order, Ayash v.\n\nDana-Farber Cancer Inst., No. Civ.
