Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge, and\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Sheila Zakre, with whom Amy Messer and Disabilities Rights\nCenter, Inc. were on brief, for appellees.\n\n     Daniel J.

Plaintiffs suffer from acquired\n\nbrain disorders and have the option to receive medical care for\n\nthat condition under the Medicaid program.     They would prefer to\n\nreceive those services in a home care setting through a model\n\nprogram New Hampshire has established under a Medicaid waiver\n\napproved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396n(c) (2000).     The difficulty is that there are more people\n\nwho want to be in the model program than there is room in the\n\nprogram.\n\n            The patients sued, on behalf of a class, relying on\n\nMedicaid statutory language, id. § 1396n(c)(10), and arguing that\n\nif New Hampshire set up a model program at all, Congress required\n\nthat the waiver program have at least as many slots as the number\n\nof applicants, up to a limit of 200.      They also argued that New\n\nHampshire did not fill even the available slots within a reasonable\n\ntime.    Finally, they argued that the notices given to those on the\n\nwaiting list were inadequate.\n\n            The district court agreed that New Hampshire was mandated\n\nby the Medicaid statute to create more slots in its model program\n\nand also that notice was inadequate.   It did not address the second\n\nissue.     We reverse the district court's ruling on the first issue\n\nand remand the other two issues, vacating the notice ruling and the\n\ninjunction.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                                        I.\n\n            Bonnie Bryson and Claire Shepardson have acquired brain\n\ndisorders (ABDs), which manifest before age sixty, are neither\n\ncongenital nor caused by birth trauma, and present \"a severe and\n\nlife-long    disabling      condition      which   significantly       impairs   a\n\nperson's ability to function in society.\" N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann.\n\nthe plaintiff class they represent are being treated in a variety\n\nof settings, from nursing homes to psychiatric hospitals to private\n\nhomes.1\n\n             Medicaid is an optional plan under which the federal\n\ngovernment, through the states, partially funds medical assistance\n\nto needy individuals.        See § 1396; Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n, 496\n\nU.S. 498, 502 (1990). Not everyone is eligible for Medicaid-funded\n\ntreatment;    to    be    eligible,   an      individual   must   have    limited\n\nresources and must fit into an eligibility category.               For disabled\n\nadults,     the    most   common   route      to   eligibility    is    receiving\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) on the basis of disability. See\n\n§ 1396a(a)(10)(i)(II).       Some states, including New Hampshire, also\n\nelect to cover some medically needy individuals who are not poor\n\n\n     1\n       While the waiver program under § 1396n(c) is designed for\nindividuals who \"require the level of care provided in a hospital\nor nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally\nretarded,\" § 1396n(c)(1), some individuals who would be eligible\nfor the waiver program, including members of the plaintiff class,\nare currently in private homes, covered either by private insurance\nor personal funds. J. Perkins & R.T. Boyle, Addressing Long Waits\nfor Home and Community-Based Care Through Medicaid and the ADA, 45\nSt. Louis U. L.J. 117, 117 (2001) (describing individual cases).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fenough to be covered by SSI.         J. Perkins, Medicaid: Past Successes\n\nand Future Challenges, 12 Health Matrix 7, 12 n.21 (2002); see\n\n§ 1396a(a)(10)(C).\n\n            In 1993, New Hampshire2 requested federal approval to\n\nprovide home and community-based services for individuals with ABDs\n\nunder the Medicaid waiver provisions. Section 1915(c) of the Social\n\nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), permits states to include in\n\ntheir Medicaid plans non-medical services, such as case management,\n\nhabilitation services, and respite care.                Id. § 1396n(c)(4)(B).\n\nStates must apply for a waiver and be approved in order to include\n\nsuch services in their Medicaid plans. Id. § 1396n(c)(1). Programs\n\napproved    under     this   subsection    are     waived     from    many   Medicaid\n\nstrictures,     id.    §    1396n(c)(3),   such    as   the    requirements     that\n\nprograms be in place statewide, see id. § 1396a(a)(1), and that\n\nmedical assistance be made available to all individuals equally, see\n\nid. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).          Waivers are initially approved for three\n\nyears     and   may    be    re-approved     for   five-year         periods.     Id.\n\n§ 1396n(c)(1).        The waiver program is designed to allow states to\n\nexperiment with methods of care, or to provide care on a targeted\n\nbasis, without adhering to the strict mandates of the Medicaid\n\nsystem.\n\n\n     2\n       The defendants in this case are Donald Shumway, Commissioner\nof the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, which\napplied for the Medicaid waiver, and Susan Fox, Director of\nDevelopmental Services, which administers the waiver program. We\nwill refer to the two defendants collectively as \"New Hampshire.\"\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           There are three primary types of home and community-based\n\nwaivers.   The first type, at issue here, concerns the treatment of\n\nindividuals who would otherwise be treated in an institutional\n\nsetting such as a hospital or nursing home.    See id. § 1396n(c); 42\n\nC.F.R. §§ 440.180, 441.300-.302 (2002).       The second type is for\n\nindividuals over sixty-five who would otherwise be in a nursing\n\nhome.   See § 1396n(d).   The third type targets children under age\n\nfive who have AIDS or are born dependent on drugs.           See id.\n\n§ 1396n(e).   There are currently about 240 home and community-based\n\nwaiver programs nationwide.    J. Perkins & R.T. Boyle, Addressing\n\nLong Waits for Home and Community-Based Care Through Medicaid and\n\nthe ADA, 45 St. Louis U. L.J. 117, 126 (2001).\n\n           To participate in the waiver program, states must apply\n\nto the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS).\n\n42 C.F.R. § 430.25(e).    The Administrator of CMS has the authority\n\nto approve or deny requests, but must consult with the Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) before denying a request.        Id.\n\n§ 430.25(f)(2)(ii).\n\n           In theory, the waiver plans are expenditure-neutral; the\n\naverage estimated per capita expenditure under the waiver plans must\n\nnot be more than the average estimated expenditure absent the waiver\n\nprogram.   § 1396n(c)(2)(D).   In practice, the waiver programs may\n\nbe costly to the states, because even though the individuals served\n\nby the waiver plan are no longer being served by nursing homes or\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fother care facilities, other patients may take those nursing home\n\nspots.   Many patients not currently being served under Medicaid may\n\nalso apply for the waiver program.     See Perkins & Boyle, supra, at\n\n119.     The states thus have a financial incentive to keep their\n\nwaiver programs small, or at least, to begin with small programs and\n\ngrow them incrementally.\n\n            New Hampshire applied for a model waiver, which differs\n\nfrom regular waivers primarily in that model waivers, by HHS\n\nregulation, may not serve more than 200 individuals at any one time.\n\n42 C.F.R. § 441.305(b)(1).    New Hampshire's model waiver request,\n\nhowever, proposed to serve a far smaller number of individuals than\n\nthe 200 person maximum.    The original waiver request proposed that\n\n15 individuals be served in the first year (1993 - 1994), 26 in the\n\nsecond year, and 37 in the third year.        In 1996, New Hampshire\n\nrequested and HHS approved an amendment to the waiver to accommodate\n\n74 individuals in the third year of the program instead of 37.    The\n\nState also requested a renewal of the waiver for five more years,\n\nfrom 1996 through 2001; HHS approved this request in 1997.        New\n\nHampshire initially requested funding for only 74 slots for each of\n\nthe five years of the waiver renewal, but in 1998 it requested, and\n\nHHS approved, an amendment to the renewal, such that the program\n\nwould serve 77 individuals in the fifth year, 81 in the sixth year,\n\n85 in the seventh year, and 89 in the eighth year.    In August 2001,\n\nNew Hampshire requested an extension for the waiver, which HHS\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fgranted through January 2002.   New Hampshire has since applied for\n\nand was granted a five-year renewal of the waiver program, with an\n\nincreasing number of slots from 117 up to 130 over the five-year\n\nperiod.\n\n          There have always been more applicants for home and\n\ncommunity-based ABD services in New Hampshire than there have been\n\navailable slots.   The waiting list has ranged from 25 people in the\n\nfirst year to a height of 87 in the 1997-1998 year.\n\n          It is undisputed that up until recently, some of the\n\napproved waiver slots have not been filled.   The parties differ as\n\nto how many slots have historically gone unused, for how long and\n\nfor what reasons; furthermore, there is no agreement as to whether\n\nthere continues to be any unused waiver slots.\n\n          Bryson, Shepardson, and the plaintiff class have applied\n\nfor community-based services under the New Hampshire Home and\n\nCommunity Based Waiver for Persons with Acquired Brain Disorders.\n\nThey have not received these services; New Hampshire instead has\n\nplaced them on a waiting list, where they remain.\n\n                                II.\n\n          On December 2, 1999, Bryson and Shepardson sued the two\n\nNew Hampshire state officials, on behalf of themselves and all\n\nothers similarly situated, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   The suit challenged the defendants'\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\ffailure to provide home and community-based services under the model\n\nwaiver program to the plaintiff class afflicted with ABD.\n\n          The complaint pled seven distinct counts; only two counts\n\nare relevant to this appeal.3    The first, Count II of the complaint,\n\nalleged that under federal law, Medicaid services must be furnished\n\nwith \"reasonable promptness\" under § 1396a(a)(8) and that the New\n\nHampshire defendants were in violation of this provision.         The\n\nsecond, Count VII of the complaint, alleged that federal law\n\nrequires that the plaintiffs receive notice and the opportunity for\n\na hearing when they have been placed on a waiting list, id.\n\n§ 1396a(a)(3), and that New Hampshire has not provided such notice.\n\n          On October 23, 2001, the District Court for the District\n\nof New Hampshire granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment\n\nas to Count VII, the notice allegation.     Bryson v. Shumway, 117 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 78, 81 (D.N.H. 2001).    The court found that § 1396a(a)(3),\n\nwhich requires an opportunity for a fair hearing when a \"claim for\n\nmedical assistance . . . is denied,\" is triggered when applicants\n\nare placed on the waiting list for waiver services.      Id. at 98.\n\n\n     3\n       The plaintiffs' other five counts are as follows: Count I\nalleged that the waiver program was insufficiently funded, relying\non §§ 1396a(a)(17), (19), and regulatory provisions; Count III\nalleged a violation of the integration mandates of Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (2000);\nCount IV alleged disability-based discrimination in violation of\nTitle II of the ADA and section 504; Count V alleged that the\nstandards by which the ABD waiver program was operated constituted\na due process violation; and Count VI restated the notice complaint\nof Count VII as a due process violation.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              On December 10, 2001, the district court granted judgment\n\nin    favor    of   the    plaintiffs    on    Count   II,    ruling   that   the\n\n\"[d]efendants have violated the reasonable promptness requirement\n\nof the Medicaid Act\" and requiring that they \"request enough waiver\n\nslots to serve the plaintiff class and to provide Medicaid funded\n\nwaiver services to Plaintiff class in a period not to exceed 12\n\nmonths, absent extraordinary circumstances.\" Bryson v. Shumway, No.\n\n99-558-M, at 5 (D.N.H. Dec. 10, 2001).            This appeal followed.\n\n                                        III.\n\n              We review grants of summary judgment \"de novo, construing\n\nthe   record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and\n\nresolving     all    reasonable    inferences     in   that    party's   favor.\"\n\nRochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).         We review a district court's interpretation of a\n\nstatute de novo.          Riva v. Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003, 1007 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n              Other rules govern the issue of statutory interpretation.\n\nIf the meaning of a statute is clear, we enforce that meaning.\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n\n837, 842-43 (1984).           Here, the statute        in    question has been\n\ninterpreted by a federal administrative agency in a rule promulgated\n\nthrough notice and comment.        That interpretation is governed by the\n\nsecond-level Chevron standard: if Congress has not spoken to the\n\nquestion at issue, we may not substitute our own reading of the\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fstatute unless the agency's interpretation is unreasonable.   Id. at\n\n843-44.\n\nA.   Reasonable Promptness\n\n          The statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8),      requires that\n\n\"medical assistance . . . shall be furnished with reasonable\n\npromptness to all eligible individuals.\"    The plaintiffs contend\n\nthat New Hampshire's operation of the ABD waiver program violates\n\n§ 1396a(a)(8) by failing to furnish the waiver services with\n\n\"reasonable promptness.\"      They seek to enforce this provision\n\nthrough 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs make alternative arguments\n\nfor why they believe that New Hampshire has failed to meet its\n\nduties under § 1396a(a)(8).\n\n1.   Requirement of 200 Waiver Slots\n\n          Plaintiffs first argue that New Hampshire is required by\n\nstatute to request a waiver to accommodate at least 200 individuals.\n\nThey rely on statutory language governing waiver programs, which\n\nstates:\n\n           (c) Waiver respecting medical assistance requirement in\n           State plan: scope, etc.; \"habilitation services\" defined;\n           imposition of certain regulatory limits prohibited;\n           computation   of   expenditures  for   certain   disabled\n           patients;    coordinated   services;    substitution   of\n           participants\n\n           . . .\n\n           (10) The Secretary shall not limit to fewer than 200 the\n           number of individuals in the State who may receive home\n           and community-based services under a waiver under this\n           subsection.\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f§ 1396n(c)(10).   Plaintiffs interpret this statute to require that\n\nstates requesting waivers design plans that accommodate at least 200\n\nindividuals, arguing that is the plain meaning of the statute itself\n\nand the thrust of the surrounding legislative history.     The core\n\nstatutory argument is that because the waiver programs must receive\n\nthe Secretary's approval, this 200-person minimum should be read as\n\na limit on both the state applying for the waiver as well as on the\n\nSecretary.   Plaintiffs argue that the states are restricted from\n\noffering less than 200 slots and the Secretary is restricted from\n\napproving less than 200 slots.\n\na.   Plain Reading of the Statute\n\n          We turn first to the language of the statute itself. If\n\na statute is unambiguous, we use neither legislative history,4 Dep't\n\n\n     4\n       At times, though, we use legislative history as a check to\nconfirm the correctness of our interpretation in very complex areas\nof regulation. Cablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Pub. Improvement\nComm'n, 184 F.3d 88, 101 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A] court should go\nbeyond the literal language of a statute if reliance on that\nlanguage would defeat the plain purpose of the statute . . . .\").\nEven were we to rely on the legislative history of § 1396n(c)(10),\nas plaintiffs request, it would not require the conclusion that\n§ 1396n(c)(10) was meant to mandate that waiver plans serve at\nleast 200 individuals.\n     Paragraph 1396n(c)(10), as originally written, stated that\n\"[n]o waiver under this subsection shall limit by an amount less\nthan 200 the number of individuals who may receive home and\ncommunity-based services.\" Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of\n1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, § 4118(b), 101 Stat. 1330-1, 1330-155.\nThe paragraph was amended to the current language the next year.\nSee Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-\n360, § 411(k)(10)(A), 102 Stat. 683, 794.      The plaintiffs have\nsubmitted no legislative history with regard to this change, and\nthere appears to be little discussion in the relevant committee\nreports. See H.R. Rep. No. 100-105(I) (1987), reprinted in 1988\n\n                                 -11-\n\fof Hous. & Urban Dev. v. Rucker, 122 S. Ct. 1230, 1234 (2002), nor\n\nadministrative agency interpretation, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.\n\n             Neither the language nor the structure of § 1396n(c)(10)\n\nsupports     plaintiffs'      reading;    the        statute    does    not   require\n\napplications for state waiver programs to serve at least 200\n\nindividuals.       The language of the paragraph, by its very terms,\n\ngoverns only the Secretary's ability to deny approval of waiver\n\nplans.      See    §   1396n(c)(10)     (\"The    Secretary       shall    not   limit\n\n. . . .\").     The statute does not purport to govern the behavior of\n\nthe   states   or      the   contents    of    the    waiver    plans    themselves.\n\nMoreover,    the    paragraph    does    not,    by     its    terms,    prevent   the\n\nSecretary from approving plans unless there are a certain number of\n\nslots.     It only governs the Secretary's actions when she or he is\n\nacting to limit the content of waiver plans as to the number of\n\nindividuals to be served.\n\n             Comparing the language of § 1396n(c)(10) to the remainder\n\nof § 1396n(c), which governs waiver services, makes this reading\n\n\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 803; H.R. Rep. No. 100-105(II) (1987), reprinted in\n1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 857; H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-661, at 269 (1988),\nreprinted in 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 923, 1047.\n     The only legislative history the plaintiffs cite, that of the\n1987 statute, see H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-495, at 760 (1987),\nreprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2313-1245, 2313-1506, is inapposite.\nAll we are left with is the simple fact that Congress altered the\nlanguage of paragraph 10 by striking language that supported the\nplaintiffs' contentions. Even were we to construe the legislative\nhistory, then, we would find that if it has any effect at all, it\nis to bolster the interpretation that the statute in its current\nform governs only the actions of the Secretary.\n\n                                        -12-\n\feven more compelling.       Some provisions of subsection (c) directly\n\ngovern the content of the waiver plans; these clearly state their\n\npurpose in limiting the content of the plans directly.                   See id.\n\n§ 1396n(c)(2) (\"A waiver may not be granted under this subsection\n\nunless . . . .\"). By contrast, § 1396n(c)(10) does not contain such\n\nlanguage limiting the content of the plans themselves.\n\n            Other provisions of subsection (c), like (c)(10), operate\n\nto prevent the Secretary from unduly restraining the state plans.5\n\nFor instance, the Secretary may not restrict \"the number of hours\n\nor   days   of   respite   care\"    provided    under    a    waiver   plan,   id.\n\n§ 1396n(c)(4), nor may he require that the waiver plan spend no more\n\nmoney than the approved estimates as a condition of waiver approval,\n\nid. § 1396n(c)(6).     These provisions merely prevent the Secretary\n\nfrom   imposing    conditions      onto   the   waiver   plans.        Similarly,\n\n§ 1396n(c)(10) restricts the Secretary's ability to limit the size\n\nand funding of waiver plans.        Read together, these provisions, like\n\nparagraph 10, ensure that the states will be able to receive funding\n\nfor waiver plans up to a certain size and free from restrictions on\n\nhow much care is provided to each individual.                They do not dictate\n\nto the states the content of their waiver applications.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       This is also consistent with the language of § 1396n(c), the\ntitle of which includes such subjects as \"imposition of certain\nregulatory limits prohibited,\" obviously a reference to paragraph\n10.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f             Finally, it is evident that § 1396n(c) contemplates state\n\nwaiver plans with definite limits on the number of individuals\n\nserved.     Paragraph 9 permits state plans to replace individuals who\n\ndie or become ineligible with other individuals \"[i]n the case of\n\nany waiver under this subsection which contains a limit on the\n\nnumber of individuals who shall receive home or community-based\n\nservices.\"     Id. § 1396n(c)(9).        State plans, then, certainly have\n\nthe right to include a limit on the number of waiver slots they\n\nrequest.6\n\n             This statute, § 1396n(c)(10), is most plausibly read as\n\nlimiting     only   the   ability   of    the    Secretary   to   impose    such\n\nrestrictions, and not the ability of the states to propose or the\n\nSecretary     to    approve   waiver     plans    serving    fewer   than    200\n\nindividuals.\n\nb.   Administrative Deference\n\n             Even if there were doubt as to the plain meaning of\n\n§ 1396n(c)(10) on its face, the administrative interpretation of HHS\n\ndoes not support the plaintiffs' position.              If Congress has not\n\nspoken on the precise question at issue, we respect the statutory\n\n\n     6\n       Our reading is also most consistent with another paragraph\nof subsection (c), which plainly permits states to set limits on\nthe number of individuals served. Section 1396n(c)(4)(A) permits\nwaiver plans to limit the individuals served to those for whom the\nstate has determined that the amount of medical assistance under\nthe waiver will not exceed the amount that would be provided if the\nwaiver did not apply.        This paragraph does not reference\n§ 1396n(c)(10), nor does it restrict a state's ability to limit the\nnumber of individuals served by waiver plans.\n\n                                       -14-\n\finterpretation of the federal administrative agency given that\n\ninterpretative task, unless the interpretation is unreasonable.\n\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 842-44.\n\n          Congress has authorized HHS to interpret the statutes in\n\nquestion and implement regulations in this area.   42 U.S.C. § 1302.\n\nHHS has interpreted § 1396n(c)(10) through a regulation governing\n\nmodel waivers, which decrees that the number of individuals served\n\nunder a model waiver program \"may not exceed 200 recipients.\"    42\n\nC.F.R. § 441.305(b).   It is possible to read the regulation, which\n\npermits no more than 200 recipients under a model waiver program,\n\nand § 1396n(c)(10), which plaintiffs urge permits no fewer than 200\n\nunder any waiver program, to result in a scheme in which all model\n\nprograms must serve exactly 200 individuals.   Nonetheless, that is\n\nnot the most likely reading.     The regulation's use of the term\n\n\"exceed\" indicates that HHS contemplates model waiver programs that\n\nserve fewer than 200 individuals.\n\n          This conclusion is bolstered by the comments accompanying\n\nthe announcement of the final rule.      HHS concluded that while\n\n§ 1396n(c)(10) \"could, arguably, be read to limit the actual number\n\nof individuals who may receive model waiver services to no less than\n\n200, . . . we believe that this reading is unsupportable.\" Medicaid\n\nProgram; Home and Community-Based Services and Respiratory Care for\n\nVentilator-Dependant Individuals, 59 Fed. Reg. 37,702, 37,711 (July\n\n25, 1994).\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f           HHS's interpretation of this statute is certainly not\n\nunreasonable. HHS reads § 1396n(c)(10) as allowing states to choose\n\nthe size of their waiver programs, rather than requiring that the\n\nwaiver programs be at least a certain size.   This interpretation is\n\nconsistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of the\n\nwaiver program.     See Medicaid Program; Home and Community-Based\n\nServices, 50 Fed. Reg. 10,013, 10,021 (Mar. 13, 1985) (stating that\n\nHHS \"believes that Congress intended to give the States maximum\n\nflexibility in operating their waiver programs\").\n\n           The policy reasons are obvious: states, and particularly\n\nsmall states, may be discouraged from applying for model waiver\n\nprograms at all if the choices are a program serving 200 individuals\n\nat the partial expense of the state, or not creating a model program\n\nat all and providing only the standard Medicaid services.   Rather,\n\nCongress wished to encourage the states to pursue waiver programs,\n\nso that    the   states would create the types of model programs\n\ncontemplated.    Sympathetic as these plaintiffs are, the long-term\n\nlogic of their argument may lead to the constriction, not the\n\nexpansion, of these types of alternative programs.     In sum, even\n\nwere we to find this statute ambiguous, the interpretation offered\n\nby HHS is reasonable, given the structure and language of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           The Secretary has also interpreted this statute in a\n\ndifferent context.    He has approved waiver plans that anticipate\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fserving fewer than 200 individuals, such as the plan at issue here.\n\nBecause the approval process did not utilize formal procedures, it\n\nmay not be entitled to Chevron deference, see Christensen v. Harris\n\nCounty, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000), but there remains the deference\n\nowed agencies due to their \"specialized experience.\"          Skidmore v.\n\nSwift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 139 (1944); see United States v. Mead\n\nCorp., 533 U.S. 218, 234-39 (2001) (applying Skidmore deference).\n\nThe Secretary has interpreted the statute to permit waiver plans\n\nwith fewer than 200 slots, and we defer to his expertise in the\n\nconstruction and purpose of the statute.\n\n2.    Unfilled Waiver Slots\n\n           The district court rested its finding for the plaintiffs\n\non the ground we have rejected: that the state waiver plan must\n\nserve at least 200 individuals.            Bryson, No. 99-558-M, at 4.\n\nPlaintiffs have, however, asserted a separate and distinct argument\n\nalleging a violation of the \"reasonable promptness\" provision of\n\n§ 1396a(a)(8).    They argue that New Hampshire has failed to fill\n\neven the number of individual waiver slots it has requested, and so\n\nthe   plaintiff   class   members   have   not   been   furnished   medical\n\nassistance \"with reasonable promptness.\" We first consider whether\n\nthere is an actionable claim.\n\na.    § 1983 Cause of Action\n\n           There is liability against persons who act under color of\n\nlaw to deprive individuals of \"any rights, privileges, or immunities\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fsecured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983. This provision creates a cause of action for federal\n\nstatutory as well as constitutional rights, Maine v. Thiboutot, 448\n\nU.S. 1, 4-8 (1980), including, in some circumstances, violations of\n\nthe Medicaid Act, Wilder, 496 U.S. at 524.\n\n           Not all violations of federal law result in a cause of\n\naction under § 1983.      \"A plaintiff must assert the violation of a\n\nfederal right, not merely the violation of federal law.\"                 Blessing\n\nv. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997) (emphasis in original).\n\nMoreover, a federal right must be \"unambiguously conferred\" in order\n\nto support a cause of action under § 1983.               Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe,\n\n122 S. Ct. 2268, 2275 (2002).\n\n           Blessing    set     out   a    three-part     test   for   guidance   in\n\ndetermining whether a statutory provision confers an enforceable\n\nfederal   right.      First,    Congress        must   have   intended   that    the\n\nprovision benefit the plaintiff.                Second, the right must not be\n\n\"vague and amorphous.\" Third, the statute must unambiguously impose\n\na binding obligation on the states.              Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-41.\n\nUltimately, of course, this is an issue of congressional intent, and\n\nthe three tests are just a guide.                Gonzaga, 122 S. Ct. at 2279\n\n(Breyer, J., concurring).        The statute satisfies the three tests as\n\nto claims about unfilled waiver slots that are part of an approved\n\nstate Medicaid plan.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f           First, the statute, on its face, does intend to benefit\n\nthe plaintiffs.   Section 1396a(a)(8) requires that state Medicaid\n\nplans provide that medical assistance \"shall be furnished with\n\nreasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\"   This paragraph\n\nis a part of the litany of procedural and substantive protections\n\nwhich state Medicaid plans must provide, such as the opportunity for\n\na hearing, see § 1396a(a)(3), and safeguards against the disclosure\n\nof private information, see id. § 1396a(a)(7).     By its terms, it\n\nbenefits \"eligible individuals.\" Id. § 1396a(a)(8). Those patients\n\nwho are on the waiting list and for whom slots are available7 are,\n\nwe think, \"eligible\" under the statute such that they are entitled\n\nto reasonable promptness.   See Boulet v. Celluci, 107 F. Supp. 2d\n\n61, 77 (D. Mass. 2000) (\"The cap on waiver services is simply a\n\nconstraint on eligibility.\").   The first prong of Blessing has been\n\nmet.\n\n           Second, the right conferred is not vague or amorphous.\n\n\"A statute is not impermissibly vague simply because it requires\n\njudicial inquiry into 'reasonableness.'\"   Albiston v. Maine Comm'r\n\nof Human Servs., 7 F.3d 258, 267 (1st Cir. 1993) (construing the\n\n\"reasonable promptness\" provision of 42      U.S.C. § 602(a)(10)).\n\n\n\n       7\n       The parties advise us that it is not an easy matter to\ndetermine the patients on the waiting list for whom slots are\navailable. It is not a matter, necessarily, of who is next on the\nlist. The slots opening up may be in one geographic location; a\nparticular patient may be in another. These are issues that can be\nconsidered on remand.\n\n                                -19-\n\fCommon law courts have reviewed actions for reasonableness since\n\ntime immemorial.       See, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *77\n\n(analyzing the reasonableness of customs).\n\n           Finally, § 1396a(a)(8) does unambiguously bind the states.\n\nThe subsection mandates that state plans \"must\" provide that medical\n\nassistance \"shall\" be provided with reasonable promptness.              These\n\nare not mere guidelines, but rather requirements which states must\n\nmeet under the Medicaid system.\n\n           One other circuit court has found that the reasonable\n\npromptness provision of § 1396a(a)(8) provides a cause of action\n\nunder § 1983.     See Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709, 719 (11th Cir.\n\n1998); cf. Cospito v. Heckler, 742 F.2d 72, 81 n.14 (3rd Cir. 1984)\n\n(interpreting § 1396a(a)(8) in a procedural due process context and\n\nfinding   that   \"eligible   patients    have   a   legitimate    claim    of\n\nentitlement to be able to avail themselves of Medicaid benefits\").\n\nWhile this Court has never before addressed this precise question,\n\nwe did uphold a § 1983 cause of action under the \"reasonable\n\npromptness\" provision of the Social Security Act.        Albiston, 7 F.3d\n\nat 264 (finding that 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(10) provides \"reasonably\n\nclear,    judicially    enforceable     obligations    directly    on     the\n\nparticipating States\").\n\n           The strictures of § 1396a(a)(8) should apply with no less\n\nforce to opt-in plans such as the waiver program.        Once the waiver\n\nplan is created and approved, it becomes part of the state plan and\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\ftherefore subject to federal law; the waiver plans must meet all\n\nrequirements not expressly waived.    See Doe, 136 F.3d at 714-15\n\n(upholding a § 1983 cause of action under § 1396a(a)(8) as applied\n\nto an optional program).\n\n           In sum, we find that there is a § 1983 cause of action\n\narising from the \"reasonable promptness\" provision of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396a(a)(8) under the state model waiver plan as approved.\n\nb.   Factual Development\n\n          It is not clear to us, though, whether there is a live\n\ncontroversy on this issue or, if so, what the dimensions of it are.\n\nNo facts have been developed on this point.    New Hampshire claims\n\nthat there are no longer any unfilled waiver slots, while the\n\nplaintiffs believe that the issue may continue to be a live one.\n\nEven if there are currently unfilled waiver slots, we know nothing\n\nabout the history of each waiver slot and the process and procedure\n\nof replacing individuals who held those slots.\n\n          When an individual ceases to use the waiver plan services,\n\nthere is necessarily a time gap while an individual on the waiting\n\nlist is chosen to take the unfilled slot and while services are made\n\navailable.   Because of that lag in time, the fact that some slots\n\nare unfilled may be consistent with New Hampshire diligently filling\n\nthe empty slots with reasonable promptness.    It may also indicate\n\nthat New Hampshire is not being reasonably prompt in its provision\n\nof medical assistance.\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f           The parties have stipulated that absent extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, ABD waiver services can be implemented within one\n\nyear from the time that an individual is found to be eligible. More\n\ninformation is necessary in order to ascertain whether or not the\n\nguarantee of reasonable promptness has been satisfied.     We remand\n\nthis aspect of plaintiff's claim to the district court.\n\nB.   Notice\n\n           42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) requires that state Medicaid plans\n\n\"provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the\n\nState agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance\n\nunder the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable\n\npromptness.\"   See also 42 C.F.R. § 431.220(a)(1) (mirroring the\n\nlanguage of § 1396a(a)(3)). State plans must also notify applicants\n\nof the right to obtain a hearing and the method of obtaining one\n\nwhen the applicant first applies to Medicaid or when any action is\n\ntaken which affects the applicant's claim.   42 C.F.R. § 431.206(b)-\n\n(c). The specific contents of the notice are governed by § 431.210.\n\nOverall, HHS has made clear that \"[t]he hearing system must meet the\n\ndue process standards set forth by Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254\n\n(1970).\"   § 431.205(d).   The defendants do not contest that § 1983\n\nmay be used to enforce these notice provisions, so we assume that\n\nit may.\n\n           Plaintiffs allege that New Hampshire has violated their\n\nright to notice by failing to notify applicants of their right to\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fa hearing when they were notified of their eligibility and placed\n\non a waiting list.    The district court agreed, granting summary\n\njudgment to the plaintiffs on this count and holding that \"a finding\n\nof eligibility coupled with an indefinite deferral of services\n\nconstitutes a denial of services,\" thereby triggering the notice\n\nrequirement under § 1396a(a)(3).    Bryson, 177 F. Supp. 2d at 97.\n\nWhile applicants were notified of their placement on the waiting\n\nlist, the notifications often did not contain information concerning\n\nthe right to request a hearing or the method of obtaining one.\n\n          As the district court noted, its ruling on notice depended\n\nto a certain extent on its view of whether New Hampshire had to\n\ncreate slots for all applicants.    Id.   We have negated that view.\n\nThere is also a significant question about the precise purpose of\n\na hearing under the approved plan.        It is one thing to have a\n\nhearing if New Hampshire is obligated to create slots for up to 200\n\nindividuals,   as the district court ruled.       It is another to\n\ncontemplate a hearing if there are no available slots and there is\n\nno requirement to give the first available slot to the next person\n\non the list.   It is yet another thing if there is an available slot\n\nand the sole issue, applying pre-set criteria for priority status,\n\nis who on the waiting list should be placed in that slot.\n\n          New Hampshire has said that it has since modified its\n\nsystem of eligibility notice to conform to the statutory and\n\nregulatory requirements.   There is thus a danger that the issue of\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fnotice is not a live one.          See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486,\n\n495-97   (1969).        A   moot   issue   does    not   meet    the   \"case\"   or\n\n\"controversy\" requirement of the Constitution.                  U.S. Const. art.\n\nIII, § 2; Liner v. Jafco, Inc., 375 U.S. 301, 306 n.3 (1964).\n\nMootness   must    be   considered     even   if   ignored      by   the   parties\n\nthemselves.8      St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S.\n\n531, 537 (1978).\n\n           Given the context of New Hampshire's recent claim that it\n\nhas modified its notification procedure and is now in accord with\n\nstatutory and constitutional requirements, we think it better to\n\nvacate the district court's ruling.           We remand this issue to the\n\ndistrict court for further factual findings.               If New Hampshire's\n\ncurrent notice system is adequate, then this count should be\n\ndismissed.     We are optimistic that if further notice issues remain,\n\nthe parties will work out the matter by agreement.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n             For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district\n\ncourt's ruling that the waiver plan must include 200 slots, vacate\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        If mootness evolves upon appeal, \"the judgment below\nnormally is vacated with directions to dismiss the complaint.\"\nCity of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 288 n.9\n(1982). Mootness may evolve during the course of a case for a\nvariety of reasons, including the provision of relief by the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Honig v. Students of the Cal. Sch. for the\nBlind, 471 U.S. 148 (1985); Deposit Guar. Nat'l Bank v. Roper, 445\nU.S. 326 (1980); Commissioner v. Shapiro, 424 U.S. 614, 622 n.7\n(1976).\n\n                                      -24-\n\fthe notice ruling and the injunction, and remand the other two\n\nissues.\n\n\n\n\n                             -25-\n\f",

They would prefer to\n\nreceive those services in a home care setting through a model\n\nprogram New Hampshire has established under a Medicaid waiver\n\napproved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396n(c) (2000).     The difficulty is that there are more people\n\nwho want to be in the model program than there is room in the\n\nprogram.\n\n            The patients sued, on behalf of a class, relying on\n\nMedicaid statutory language, id. § 1396n(c)(10), and arguing that\n\nif New Hampshire set up a model program at all, Congress required\n\nthat the waiver program have at least as many slots as the number\n\nof applicants, up to a limit of 200.      They also argued that New\n\nHampshire did not fill even the available slots within a reasonable\n\ntime.    Finally, they argued that the notices given to those on the\n\nwaiting list were inadequate.\n\n            The district court agreed that New Hampshire was mandated\n\nby the Medicaid statute to create more slots in its model program\n\nand also that notice was inadequate.   It did not address the second\n\nissue.     We reverse the district court's ruling on the first issue\n\nand remand the other two issues, vacating the notice ruling and the\n\ninjunction.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                                        I.\n\n            Bonnie Bryson and Claire Shepardson have acquired brain\n\ndisorders (ABDs), which manifest before age sixty, are neither\n\ncongenital nor caused by birth trauma, and present \"a severe and\n\nlife-long    disabling      condition      which   significantly       impairs   a\n\nperson's ability to function in society.\" N.H.

Not everyone is eligible for Medicaid-funded\n\ntreatment;    to    be    eligible,   an      individual   must   have    limited\n\nresources and must fit into an eligibility category.

Perkins, Medicaid: Past Successes\n\nand Future Challenges, 12 Health Matrix 7, 12 n.21 (2002); see\n\n§ 1396a(a)(10)(C).\n\n            In 1993, New Hampshire2 requested federal approval to\n\nprovide home and community-based services for individuals with ABDs\n\nunder the Medicaid waiver provisions. Section 1915(c) of the Social\n\nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), permits states to include in\n\ntheir Medicaid plans non-medical services, such as case management,\n\nhabilitation services, and respite care.                Id. § 1396n(c)(4)(B).\n\nStates must apply for a waiver and be approved in order to include\n\nsuch services in their Medicaid plans. Id. § 1396n(c)(1). Programs\n\napproved    under     this   subsection    are     waived     from    many   Medicaid\n\nstrictures,     id.    §    1396n(c)(3),   such    as   the    requirements     that\n\nprograms be in place statewide, see id. § 1396a(a)(1), and that\n\nmedical assistance be made available to all individuals equally, see\n\nid. § 1396a(a)(10)(B).          Waivers are initially approved for three\n\nyears     and   may    be    re-approved     for   five-year         periods.     Id.\n\n§ 1396n(c)(1).        The waiver program is designed to allow states to\n\nexperiment with methods of care, or to provide care on a targeted\n\nbasis, without adhering to the strict mandates of the Medicaid\n\nsystem.\n\n\n     2\n       The defendants in this case are Donald Shumway, Commissioner\nof the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, which\napplied for the Medicaid waiver, and Susan Fox, Director of\nDevelopmental Services, which administers the waiver program. We\nwill refer to the two defendants collectively as \"New Hampshire.\"\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           There are three primary types of home and community-based\n\nwaivers.   The first type, at issue here, concerns the treatment of\n\nindividuals who would otherwise be treated in an institutional\n\nsetting such as a hospital or nursing home.    See id. § 1396n(c); 42\n\nC.F.R. §§ 440.180, 441.300-.302 (2002).       The second type is for\n\nindividuals over sixty-five who would otherwise be in a nursing\n\nhome.   See § 1396n(d).   The third type targets children under age\n\nfive who have AIDS or are born dependent on drugs.           See id.\n\n§ 1396n(e).   There are currently about 240 home and community-based\n\nwaiver programs nationwide.    J. Perkins & R.T. Boyle, Addressing\n\nLong Waits for Home and Community-Based Care Through Medicaid and\n\nthe ADA, 45 St. Louis U. L.J. 117, 126 (2001).\n\n           To participate in the waiver program, states must apply\n\nto the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS).\n\n42 C.F.R. § 430.25(e).    The Administrator of CMS has the authority\n\nto approve or deny requests, but must consult with the Secretary of\n\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) before denying a request.        Id.\n\n§ 430.25(f)(2)(ii).\n\n           In theory, the waiver plans are expenditure-neutral; the\n\naverage estimated per capita expenditure under the waiver plans must\n\nnot be more than the average estimated expenditure absent the waiver\n\nprogram.   § 1396n(c)(2)(D).   In practice, the waiver programs may\n\nbe costly to the states, because even though the individuals served\n\nby the waiver plan are no longer being served by nursing homes or\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fother care facilities, other patients may take those nursing home\n\nspots.   Many patients not currently being served under Medicaid may\n\nalso apply for the waiver program.     See Perkins & Boyle, supra, at\n\n119.     The states thus have a financial incentive to keep their\n\nwaiver programs small, or at least, to begin with small programs and\n\ngrow them incrementally.\n\n            New Hampshire applied for a model waiver, which differs\n\nfrom regular waivers primarily in that model waivers, by HHS\n\nregulation, may not serve more than 200 individuals at any one time.\n\n42 C.F.R. § 441.305(b)(1).    New Hampshire's model waiver request,\n\nhowever, proposed to serve a far smaller number of individuals than\n\nthe 200 person maximum.    The original waiver request proposed that\n\n15 individuals be served in the first year (1993 - 1994), 26 in the\n\nsecond year, and 37 in the third year.        In 1996, New Hampshire\n\nrequested and HHS approved an amendment to the waiver to accommodate\n\n74 individuals in the third year of the program instead of 37.    The\n\nState also requested a renewal of the waiver for five more years,\n\nfrom 1996 through 2001; HHS approved this request in 1997.        New\n\nHampshire initially requested funding for only 74 slots for each of\n\nthe five years of the waiver renewal, but in 1998 it requested, and\n\nHHS approved, an amendment to the renewal, such that the program\n\nwould serve 77 individuals in the fifth year, 81 in the sixth year,\n\n85 in the seventh year, and 89 in the eighth year.    In August 2001,\n\nNew Hampshire requested an extension for the waiver, which HHS\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fgranted through January 2002.   New Hampshire has since applied for\n\nand was granted a five-year renewal of the waiver program, with an\n\nincreasing number of slots from 117 up to 130 over the five-year\n\nperiod.\n\n          There have always been more applicants for home and\n\ncommunity-based ABD services in New Hampshire than there have been\n\navailable slots.   The waiting list has ranged from 25 people in the\n\nfirst year to a height of 87 in the 1997-1998 year.\n\n          It is undisputed that up until recently, some of the\n\napproved waiver slots have not been filled.   The parties differ as\n\nto how many slots have historically gone unused, for how long and\n\nfor what reasons; furthermore, there is no agreement as to whether\n\nthere continues to be any unused waiver slots.\n\n          Bryson, Shepardson, and the plaintiff class have applied\n\nfor community-based services under the New Hampshire Home and\n\nCommunity Based Waiver for Persons with Acquired Brain Disorders.\n\nThey have not received these services; New Hampshire instead has\n\nplaced them on a waiting list, where they remain.\n\n                                II.\n\n          On December 2, 1999, Bryson and Shepardson sued the two\n\nNew Hampshire state officials, on behalf of themselves and all\n\nothers similarly situated, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   The suit challenged the defendants'\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\ffailure to provide home and community-based services under the model\n\nwaiver program to the plaintiff class afflicted with ABD.\n\n          The complaint pled seven distinct counts; only two counts\n\nare relevant to this appeal.3    The first, Count II of the complaint,\n\nalleged that under federal law, Medicaid services must be furnished\n\nwith \"reasonable promptness\" under § 1396a(a)(8) and that the New\n\nHampshire defendants were in violation of this provision.         The\n\nsecond, Count VII of the complaint, alleged that federal law\n\nrequires that the plaintiffs receive notice and the opportunity for\n\na hearing when they have been placed on a waiting list, id.\n\n§ 1396a(a)(3), and that New Hampshire has not provided such notice.\n\n          On October 23, 2001, the District Court for the District\n\nof New Hampshire granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment\n\nas to Count VII, the notice allegation.     Bryson v. Shumway, 117 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 78, 81 (D.N.H. 2001).    The court found that § 1396a(a)(3),\n\nwhich requires an opportunity for a fair hearing when a \"claim for\n\nmedical assistance . . . is denied,\" is triggered when applicants\n\nare placed on the waiting list for waiver services.      Id. at 98.\n\n\n     3\n       The plaintiffs' other five counts are as follows: Count I\nalleged that the waiver program was insufficiently funded, relying\non §§ 1396a(a)(17), (19), and regulatory provisions; Count III\nalleged a violation of the integration mandates of Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and\nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (2000);\nCount IV alleged disability-based discrimination in violation of\nTitle II of the ADA and section 504; Count V alleged that the\nstandards by which the ABD waiver program was operated constituted\na due process violation; and Count VI restated the notice complaint\nof Count VII as a due process violation.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f              On December 10, 2001, the district court granted judgment\n\nin    favor    of   the    plaintiffs    on    Count   II,    ruling   that   the\n\n\"[d]efendants have violated the reasonable promptness requirement\n\nof the Medicaid Act\" and requiring that they \"request enough waiver\n\nslots to serve the plaintiff class and to provide Medicaid funded\n\nwaiver services to Plaintiff class in a period not to exceed 12\n\nmonths, absent extraordinary circumstances.\" Bryson v.

Reasonable Promptness\n\n          The statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8),      requires that\n\n\"medical assistance . . . shall be furnished with reasonable\n\npromptness to all eligible individuals.\"    The plaintiffs contend\n\nthat New Hampshire's operation of the ABD waiver program violates\n\n§ 1396a(a)(8) by failing to furnish the waiver services with\n\n\"reasonable promptness.\"      They seek to enforce this provision\n\nthrough 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs make alternative arguments\n\nfor why they believe that New Hampshire has failed to meet its\n\nduties under § 1396a(a)(8).\n\n1.   Requirement of 200 Waiver Slots\n\n          Plaintiffs first argue that New Hampshire is required by\n\nstatute to request a waiver to accommodate at least 200 individuals.\n\nThey rely on statutory language governing waiver programs, which\n\nstates:\n\n           (c) Waiver respecting medical assistance requirement in\n           State plan: scope, etc.; \"habilitation services\" defined;\n           imposition of certain regulatory limits prohibited;\n           computation   of   expenditures  for   certain   disabled\n           patients;    coordinated   services;    substitution   of\n           participants\n\n           . . .\n\n           (10) The Secretary shall not limit to fewer than 200 the\n           number of individuals in the State who may receive home\n           and community-based services under a waiver under this\n           subsection.\n\n\n                              -10-\n\f§ 1396n(c)(10).   Plaintiffs interpret this statute to require that\n\nstates requesting waivers design plans that accommodate at least 200\n\nindividuals, arguing that is the plain meaning of the statute itself\n\nand the thrust of the surrounding legislative history.     The core\n\nstatutory argument is that because the waiver programs must receive\n\nthe Secretary's approval, this 200-person minimum should be read as\n\na limit on both the state applying for the waiver as well as on the\n\nSecretary.   Plaintiffs argue that the states are restricted from\n\noffering less than 200 slots and the Secretary is restricted from\n\napproving less than 200 slots.\n\na.

If\n\na statute is unambiguous, we use neither legislative history,4 Dep't\n\n\n     4\n       At times, though, we use legislative history as a check to\nconfirm the correctness of our interpretation in very complex areas\nof regulation.

The language of the paragraph, by its very terms,\n\ngoverns only the Secretary's ability to deny approval of waiver\n\nplans.      See    §   1396n(c)(10)     (\"The    Secretary       shall    not   limit\n\n. . . .\").

It only governs the Secretary's actions when she or he is\n\nacting to limit the content of waiver plans as to the number of\n\nindividuals to be served.\n\n             Comparing the language of § 1396n(c)(10) to the remainder\n\nof § 1396n(c), which governs waiver services, makes this reading\n\n\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 803; H.R.

Even were we to construe the legislative\nhistory, then, we would find that if it has any effect at all, it\nis to bolster the interpretation that the statute in its current\nform governs only the actions of the Secretary.\n\n                                        -12-\n\feven more compelling.       Some provisions of subsection (c) directly\n\ngovern the content of the waiver plans; these clearly state their\n\npurpose in limiting the content of the plans directly.                   See id.\n\n§ 1396n(c)(2) (\"A waiver may not be granted under this subsection\n\nunless . . . .\"). By contrast, § 1396n(c)(10) does not contain such\n\nlanguage limiting the content of the plans themselves.\n\n            Other provisions of subsection (c), like (c)(10), operate\n\nto prevent the Secretary from unduly restraining the state plans.5\n\nFor instance, the Secretary may not restrict \"the number of hours\n\nor   days   of   respite   care\"    provided    under    a    waiver   plan,   id.\n\n§ 1396n(c)(4), nor may he require that the waiver plan spend no more\n\nmoney than the approved estimates as a condition of waiver approval,\n\nid. § 1396n(c)(6).     These provisions merely prevent the Secretary\n\nfrom   imposing    conditions      onto   the   waiver   plans.        Similarly,\n\n§ 1396n(c)(10) restricts the Secretary's ability to limit the size\n\nand funding of waiver plans.        Read together, these provisions, like\n\nparagraph 10, ensure that the states will be able to receive funding\n\nfor waiver plans up to a certain size and free from restrictions on\n\nhow much care is provided to each individual.                They do not dictate\n\nto the states the content of their waiver applications.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       This is also consistent with the language of § 1396n(c), the\ntitle of which includes such subjects as \"imposition of certain\nregulatory limits prohibited,\" obviously a reference to paragraph\n10.\n\n                                      -13-\n\f             Finally, it is evident that § 1396n(c) contemplates state\n\nwaiver plans with definite limits on the number of individuals\n\nserved.     Paragraph 9 permits state plans to replace individuals who\n\ndie or become ineligible with other individuals \"[i]n the case of\n\nany waiver under this subsection which contains a limit on the\n\nnumber of individuals who shall receive home or community-based\n\nservices.\"     Id. § 1396n(c)(9).        State plans, then, certainly have\n\nthe right to include a limit on the number of waiver slots they\n\nrequest.6\n\n             This statute, § 1396n(c)(10), is most plausibly read as\n\nlimiting     only   the   ability   of    the    Secretary   to   impose    such\n\nrestrictions, and not the ability of the states to propose or the\n\nSecretary     to    approve   waiver     plans    serving    fewer   than    200\n\nindividuals.\n\nb.   Administrative Deference\n\n             Even if there were doubt as to the plain meaning of\n\n§ 1396n(c)(10) on its face, the administrative interpretation of HHS\n\ndoes not support the plaintiffs' position.              If Congress has not\n\nspoken on the precise question at issue, we respect the statutory\n\n\n     6\n       Our reading is also most consistent with another paragraph\nof subsection (c), which plainly permits states to set limits on\nthe number of individuals served. Section 1396n(c)(4)(A) permits\nwaiver plans to limit the individuals served to those for whom the\nstate has determined that the amount of medical assistance under\nthe waiver will not exceed the amount that would be provided if the\nwaiver did not apply.        This paragraph does not reference\n§ 1396n(c)(10), nor does it restrict a state's ability to limit the\nnumber of individuals served by waiver plans.\n\n                                       -14-\n\finterpretation of the federal administrative agency given that\n\ninterpretative task, unless the interpretation is unreasonable.\n\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 842-44.\n\n          Congress has authorized HHS to interpret the statutes in\n\nquestion and implement regulations in this area.   42 U.S.C. § 1302.\n\nHHS has interpreted § 1396n(c)(10) through a regulation governing\n\nmodel waivers, which decrees that the number of individuals served\n\nunder a model waiver program \"may not exceed 200 recipients.\"    42\n\nC.F.R. § 441.305(b).   It is possible to read the regulation, which\n\npermits no more than 200 recipients under a model waiver program,\n\nand § 1396n(c)(10), which plaintiffs urge permits no fewer than 200\n\nunder any waiver program, to result in a scheme in which all model\n\nprograms must serve exactly 200 individuals.   Nonetheless, that is\n\nnot the most likely reading.     The regulation's use of the term\n\n\"exceed\" indicates that HHS contemplates model waiver programs that\n\nserve fewer than 200 individuals.\n\n          This conclusion is bolstered by the comments accompanying\n\nthe announcement of the final rule.      HHS concluded that while\n\n§ 1396n(c)(10) \"could, arguably, be read to limit the actual number\n\nof individuals who may receive model waiver services to no less than\n\n200, . . . we believe that this reading is unsupportable.\" Medicaid\n\nProgram; Home and Community-Based Services and Respiratory Care for\n\nVentilator-Dependant Individuals, 59 Fed. Reg. 37,702, 37,711 (July\n\n25, 1994).\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f           HHS's interpretation of this statute is certainly not\n\nunreasonable. HHS reads § 1396n(c)(10) as allowing states to choose\n\nthe size of their waiver programs, rather than requiring that the\n\nwaiver programs be at least a certain size.   This interpretation is\n\nconsistent with the agency's longstanding interpretation of the\n\nwaiver program.     See Medicaid Program; Home and Community-Based\n\nServices, 50 Fed. Reg. 10,013, 10,021 (Mar. 13, 1985) (stating that\n\nHHS \"believes that Congress intended to give the States maximum\n\nflexibility in operating their waiver programs\").\n\n           The policy reasons are obvious: states, and particularly\n\nsmall states, may be discouraged from applying for model waiver\n\nprograms at all if the choices are a program serving 200 individuals\n\nat the partial expense of the state, or not creating a model program\n\nat all and providing only the standard Medicaid services.   Rather,\n\nCongress wished to encourage the states to pursue waiver programs,\n\nso that    the   states would create the types of model programs\n\ncontemplated.    Sympathetic as these plaintiffs are, the long-term\n\nlogic of their argument may lead to the constriction, not the\n\nexpansion, of these types of alternative programs.     In sum, even\n\nwere we to find this statute ambiguous, the interpretation offered\n\nby HHS is reasonable, given the structure and language of the\n\nstatute.\n\n           The Secretary has also interpreted this statute in a\n\ndifferent context.    He has approved waiver plans that anticipate\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fserving fewer than 200 individuals, such as the plan at issue here.\n\nBecause the approval process did not utilize formal procedures, it\n\nmay not be entitled to Chevron deference, see Christensen v.

By its terms, it\n\nbenefits \"eligible individuals.\" Id. § 1396a(a)(8).

Factual Development\n\n          It is not clear to us, though, whether there is a live\n\ncontroversy on this issue or, if so, what the dimensions of it are.\n\nNo facts have been developed on this point.    New Hampshire claims\n\nthat there are no longer any unfilled waiver slots, while the\n\nplaintiffs believe that the issue may continue to be a live one.\n\nEven if there are currently unfilled waiver slots, we know nothing\n\nabout the history of each waiver slot and the process and procedure\n\nof replacing individuals who held those slots.\n\n          When an individual ceases to use the waiver plan services,\n\nthere is necessarily a time gap while an individual on the waiting\n\nlist is chosen to take the unfilled slot and while services are made\n\navailable.   Because of that lag in time, the fact that some slots\n\nare unfilled may be consistent with New Hampshire diligently filling\n\nthe empty slots with reasonable promptness.    It may also indicate\n\nthat New Hampshire is not being reasonably prompt in its provision\n\nof medical assistance.\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f           The parties have stipulated that absent extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, ABD waiver services can be implemented within one\n\nyear from the time that an individual is found to be eligible. More\n\ninformation is necessary in order to ascertain whether or not the\n\nguarantee of reasonable promptness has been satisfied.     We remand\n\nthis aspect of plaintiff's claim to the district court.\n\nB.   Notice\n\n           42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) requires that state Medicaid plans\n\n\"provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the\n\nState agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance\n\nunder the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable\n\npromptness.\"   See also 42 C.F.R. § 431.220(a)(1) (mirroring the\n\nlanguage of § 1396a(a)(3)). State plans must also notify applicants\n\nof the right to obtain a hearing and the method of obtaining one\n\nwhen the applicant first applies to Medicaid or when any action is\n\ntaken which affects the applicant's claim.   42 C.F.R. § 431.206(b)-\n\n(c). The specific contents of the notice are governed by § 431.210.\n\nOverall, HHS has made clear that \"[t]he hearing system must meet the\n\ndue process standards set forth by Goldberg v. Kelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108100\"><a href=\"/opinion/108100/goldberg-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1970).\"   § 431.205(d).   The defendants do not contest that § 1983\n\nmay be used to enforce these notice provisions, so we assume that\n\nit may.\n\n           Plaintiffs allege that New Hampshire has violated their\n\nright to notice by failing to notify applicants of their right to\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fa hearing when they were notified of their eligibility and placed\n\non a waiting list.    The district court agreed, granting summary\n\njudgment to the plaintiffs on this count and holding that \"a finding\n\nof eligibility coupled with an indefinite deferral of services\n\nconstitutes a denial of services,\" thereby triggering the notice\n\nrequirement under § 1396a(a)(3).    Bryson, 177 F. Supp. 2d at 97.\n\nWhile applicants were notified of their placement on the waiting\n\nlist, the notifications often did not contain information concerning\n\nthe right to request a hearing or the method of obtaining one.\n\n          As the district court noted, its ruling on notice depended\n\nto a certain extent on its view of whether New Hampshire had to\n\ncreate slots for all applicants.    Id.   We have negated that view.\n\nThere is also a significant question about the precise purpose of\n\na hearing under the approved plan.        It is one thing to have a\n\nhearing if New Hampshire is obligated to create slots for up to 200\n\nindividuals,   as the district court ruled.       It is another to\n\ncontemplate a hearing if there are no available slots and there is\n\nno requirement to give the first available slot to the next person\n\non the list.   It is yet another thing if there is an available slot\n\nand the sole issue, applying pre-set criteria for priority status,\n\nis who on the waiting list should be placed in that slot.\n\n          New Hampshire has said that it has since modified its\n\nsystem of eligibility notice to conform to the statutory and\n\nregulatory requirements.   There is thus a danger that the issue of\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fnotice is not a live one.          See Powell v.
