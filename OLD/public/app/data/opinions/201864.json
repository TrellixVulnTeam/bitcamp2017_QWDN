The National Labor Relations Board\n\n(the Board) found that Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Inc. (Saint-Gobain)\n\nviolated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations\n\nAct (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(a)(1) and (5), when Saint-Gobain\n\nunilaterally reduced the work hours of a particular cadre of\n\nemployees within a collective bargaining unit.         The Board now\n\napplies for judicial enforcement of its order.          Saint-Gobain\n\nchallenges the validity of the remedy selected by the Board and\n\nopposes enforcement on that basis. We conclude that we are without\n\njurisdiction to entertain the challenges pressed by Saint-Gobain\n\nand, consequently, enforce the Board's order.\n\n          Saint-Gobain, a multinational corporation, is the largest\n\nabrasives manufacturer in the world.        It maintains a 138-acre\n\nmanufacturing   complex   in   Worcester,   Massachusetts,   where   it\n\nproduces abrasives and ceramics.\n\n          We focus the lens of our inquiry on Plant No. 8 at the\n\nWorcester facility and, more particularly, on the employees in the\n\n\"mix-and-mold\" department.     These men and women, over 100 strong,\n\nwork Monday through Friday, in three shifts.      Their jobs involve\n\ncombining raw materials to form a mixture and then molding the\n\nmixture into grinding wheels.\n\n          For many years, mix-and-mold employees worked 7.5-hour\n\ndays (with a half hour unpaid lunch break).     In September of 2000,\n\nhowever, Saint-Gobain instituted a new production regimen that\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\frequired overlapping shifts.        To facilitate this change, it placed\n\nmix-and-mold employees on 8-hour shifts (again with a half hour\n\nunpaid lunch break).\n\n            Saint-Gobain's business is cyclical.           Typically, fewer\n\nwork-hours are needed in the winter months.          On February 2, 2001,\n\nafter     exhausting    voluntary    furloughs      in    the   mix-and-mold\n\ndepartment, Saint-Gobain reinstituted the 7.5-hour work day.            When\n\nbusiness picked up in the spring, Saint-Gobain reverted to 8-hour\n\nshifts.    It made all of these modifications unilaterally.\n\n            That    August,   unionization   came    to   the   mix-and-mold\n\ndepartment.        As a result of a Board-supervised election, the\n\nemployees selected the International Union of Automobile, Aerospace\n\nand Agricultural Implement Workers of America, Region 9A, AFL-CIO\n\n(the Union) as their collective bargaining representative.            Saint-\n\nGobain challenged the election. The Board overruled Saint-Gobain's\n\nobjections, certified the Union, and notified Saint-Gobain of the\n\ncertification.\n\n            On December 17, 2001, Saint-Gobain reinstituted 7.5-hour\n\nshifts for mix-and-mold employees, effective January 5, 2002.\n\nSaint-Gobain put the shortened shifts into effect as scheduled.\n\nOnce again, the company acted unilaterally; it did not give prior\n\nnotice of its decision to the Union, nor did it afford the Union an\n\nopportunity to bargain before reducing employee hours.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                 Still    overstaffed,      Saint-Gobain     offered        voluntary\n\nfurloughs to its workforce in January of 2002.                    When that step\n\nproved ineffectual, it negotiated a voluntary separation agreement\n\nwith the Union.           That pact, which was executed in March of 2002,\n\nresulted in a number of permanent layoffs.               Since then, the size of\n\nthe mix-and-mold workforce has declined through normal attrition.\n\nThe remaining employees continue to work 7.5-hour shifts.\n\n                 Saint-Gobain and the Union have engaged in extensive\n\nnegotiations over the terms and conditions of employment (including\n\nhours       of   work).       These   discussions    have   failed     to    yield   a\n\ncomprehensive collective bargaining agreement. At last report, the\n\nnegotiations had reached an impasse as to working hours.\n\n                 On   March   8,   2002,   the   Union   filed   an   unfair   labor\n\npractice charge with the Board.             It filed an amended charge on May\n\n29, 2002. In the charging documents, the Union alleged that Saint-\n\nGobain violated the NLRA when it unilaterally reduced working hours\n\nin January of 2002 without prior notice to, or any bargaining with,\n\nthe Union.1\n\n                 Faced with a set of undisputed facts, the administrative\n\nlaw judge (ALJ) recommended that the Board find that Saint-Gobain\n\nhad committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of\n\nsections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the NLRA.              He recommended a remedy that\n\n\n        1\n      The Union also alleged that Saint-Gobain committed another\nunfair labor practice when it unilaterally switched employees'\nmedical insurance plans. That issue is not before us.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fwould require Saint-Gobain to:            (i) reinstate the 8-hour work day;\n\n(ii) award backpay to adversely affected employees up to the date\n\nof that reinstatement; and (iii) engage in collective bargaining\n\nwith the Union as to hours of work and related conditions of\n\nemployment.\n\n              Saint-Gobain filed exceptions to the ALJ's decision. The\n\nBoard    rejected       these      exceptions        and     adopted     the   ALJ's\n\nrecommendations in their entirety.                  See Saint-Gobain Abrasives,\n\nInc., 343 N.L.R.B. No. 68 (Oct. 29, 2004).                 The Board now petitions\n\nfor enforcement of its order.           The Union has intervened in support\n\nof the Board's petition but has not filed a brief.\n\n              In this venue, Saint-Gobain concedes its liability for\n\nthe charged unfair labor practice and contests only the remedial\n\nportion of the Board's order.                  It claims that the remedy is\n\npunitive and contravenes the tenets undergirding the NLRA.                        See,\n\ne.g., NLRB v. Strong, 393 U.S. 357, 359 (1969) (explaining that,\n\nthough      broad,   the    NLRA's    grant    of    remedial    power   \"does    not\n\nauthorize punitive measures\").                More specifically, Saint-Gobain\n\nclaims that the Board erred (i) by not tolling backpay as of March\n\n7,   2002    (the    date   when     management     and    the   Union   signed   the\n\nvoluntary separation agreement) and (ii) by directing reinstatement\n\nof the 8-hour work day (inasmuch as the voluntary separation\n\nagreement eliminated the need for such reinstatement as well).\n\nSince the Union agreed to layoffs in March of 2002, this thesis\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fruns, it surely would have agreed to a reduction in hours of work\n\nat that point in time.\n\n            Saint-Gobain also assigns error to the final feature of\n\nthe Board's designated remedy:       its directive that Saint-Gobain\n\nbargain further with the Union. In this regard, Saint-Gobain notes\n\nthat the parties already have engaged in extensive bargaining and\n\nhave reached an impasse.        Further negotiations are, therefore,\n\nunnecessary — and might even prove to be counterproductive.\n\n            The Board's initial response to this asseverational array\n\nis that all of these arguments have been waived.                   The Board\n\nmaintains that, by only objecting generally to the ALJ's proposed\n\nremedy, Saint-Gobain did not adequately raise before the Board the\n\nchallenges that it now seeks to mount and, therefore, cannot raise\n\nthose points in response to a petition for enforcement.               Saint-\n\nGobain's rejoinder is that its objections were not so vague as to\n\npreclude judicial review.\n\n            The   general   exhaustion    requirement   that     prevails   in\n\nadministrative matters is a bedrock principle:              \"as a general\n\nrule[,] courts should not topple over administrative decisions\n\nunless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred\n\nagainst objection made at the [appropriate] time.\"              United States\n\nv. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952).             We have\n\ndescribed    this   raise-or-waive       rule   as   creating    \"a   win-win\n\nsituation\" because \"adhering to it simultaneously enhances the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fefficacy of the agency, fosters judicial efficiency, and safeguards\n\nthe integrity of the inter-branch review relationship.\" P. Gioioso\n\n& Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC, 115 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n             Section     10(e)    of   the   NLRA,     29    U.S.C.    §   160(e),\n\nunreservedly embraces this rule.             In relevant part, the statute\n\nprovides that when the Board petitions for judicial enforcement,\n\n\"[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board, its\n\nmember, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless\n\nthe failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused\n\nbecause of extraordinary circumstances.\"                Id.     That statutory\n\nmandate is clear:        if a particular objection has not been raised\n\nbefore      the   Board,   a     reviewing    court,    in    the     absence    of\n\nextraordinary circumstances, is without jurisdiction to consider\n\nthe issue in a subsequent enforcement proceeding.                      See, e.g.,\n\nWoelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 665 (1982)\n\n(holding that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider\n\nan issue not raised by either party before the Board); Local Union\n\nNo. 25 v. NLRB, 831 F.2d 1149, 1155 (1st Cir. 1987) (similar); cf.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 102.46(b)(2) (\"Any exception to a ruling, finding,\n\nconclusion, or recommendation which is not specifically urged shall\n\nbe deemed to have been waived.\").\n\n             The case before us is not as cut-and-dried as one in\n\nwhich no pertinent objection was made.           See, e.g., Local Union No.\n\n25,   831    F.2d   at   1155.     Here,     Saint-Gobain,     in     addition   to\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fcontesting liability, filed a general objection to the remedial\n\nportion of the ALJ's recommended order.     That objection stated in\n\nrelevant part that \"[t]he ALJ erred in recommending . . . the\n\nremedies set forth in the decision [because those remedies] are not\n\nsupported by the evidence or by the law.\"    In its supporting brief\n\nbefore the Board, Saint-Gobain again made a general averment that\n\n\"the ALJ's findings and conclusions are inconsistent with the\n\nrecord evidence and applicable law [and that as] a result, the\n\nALJ's recommended remedy and order are also inconsistent with the\n\nrecord evidence and applicable law, and therefore should not be\n\nadopted.\"   But Saint-Gobain's references to the ALJ's recommended\n\nremedy end there.2   Consequently, we must decide whether, in the\n\nlabor law context, a general objection, like this one, suffices to\n\npreserve a more specific (but encompassed) issue for judicial\n\nreview.\n\n            Although our own case law is silent on this precise\n\nquestion, the legal landscape is replete with guidance.          The\n\nseminal case is Marshall Field & Co. v. NLRB, 318 U.S. 253 (1943)\n\n(per curiam). There, the Supreme Court held that an objection that\n\n\n     2\n      Saint-Gobain's claim that it raised other, more specific\nremedy-related arguments to the Board's regional counsel is\nunsupported by the record.      Moreover, it is doubtful whether\npresentation of an argument at that stage and in that manner,\nwithout more, would suffice to preserve a claim of error. Cf. NLRB\nv. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 445 F.2d 633, 634 (1st Cir. 1971)\n(concluding that registering a complaint through a \"letter to the\nregional compliance officer and in a conference with the acting\nregional director\" was insufficient for section 10(e) purposes).\n\n                                -8-\n\fthe examiner erred \"in making each and every recommendation\" was\n\ninsufficient to grant jurisdiction for judicial review of a more\n\nparticularized challenge.    Id. at 255.   The test is whether the\n\nobjection, fairly read, apprises the Board that the objector\n\nintended to pursue the issue later presented to the court.     Id.\n\nThe objection in Marshall Field was too general to pass this test.\n\nId.\n\n          Other courts of appeals have embroidered the basic rule\n\nof Marshall Field.   A representative case is Quazite v. NLRB, 87\n\nF.3d 493 (D.C. Cir. 1996).   The court there made it pellucid that\n\nwhen a party files only a blanket objection to the recommended\n\nremedy without providing any indication of the thrust of that\n\nobjection, the objection alone furnishes inadequate notice to the\n\nBoard of the objecting party's particular argument and, thus, does\n\nnot satisfy section 10(e).     See id. at 497-98.     There is no\n\nshortage of other cases to the same effect.     See, e.g., NLRB v.\n\nPrice's Pic-Pac Supermarkets, Inc., 707 F.2d 236, 241 (6th Cir.\n\n1983) (per curiam) (holding that an objection \"to each and every\n\nprovision of the Remedy\" did not pass muster under section 10(e));\n\nSinger Co. v. NLRB, 429 F.2d 172, 180-81 (8th Cir. 1970) (holding\n\nthat an exception to \"[t]he Recommended Order in its entirety [as]\n\nagainst the preponderance of the evidence and the law\" was too\n\nvague to preserve the court's jurisdiction over a specific issue\n\nnot otherwise argued before the Board).\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f                Saint-Gobain's objection falls well within the compass of\n\nthese authorities.            It is a general objection to the remedy as a\n\nwhole, and the supplemental brief adds nothing of substance to it.\n\nTogether, those documents merely reassert Saint-Gobain's contention\n\nthat       it   did   not   violate   the   NLRA   and,   therefore,   that   the\n\nimposition of any remedy would be inappropriate.                  This general\n\nobjection is wholly insufficient to put the Board on notice of the\n\nspecific arguments that Saint-Gobain now attempts to advance.\n\nUnder section 10(e), then, we are without jurisdiction to entertain\n\nthose arguments.3           See Alwin Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, 192 F.3d 133, 144\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (\"Where . . . a party excepts to the entire\n\nremedy, and provides no indication of the basis for its objection,\n\nthe exception alone provides insufficient notice to the Board of\n\nthe party's particular arguments to satisfy section 10(e).\");\n\nQuazite, 87 F.3d at 497 (concluding that an objection to a remedial\n\norder \"in its entirety\" was \"far too broad to preserve a particular\n\nissue for appeal\").\n\n                The raise-or-waive rule is, of course, not absolute.\n\nHowever, the two exceptions that come to mind afford no succor to\n\nSaint-Gobain.\n\n\n\n       3\n      This holding is consistent with our treatment of exceptions\nin other administrative law contexts. See, e.g., P. Gioioso, 115\nF.3d at 107 (holding that, under the Occupational Safety and Health\nAct, a party desiring to preserve an issue for judicial review must\nraise the issue clearly before the agency and articulate the issue\nin its petition for judicial review).\n\n                                        -10-\n\f          The first exception involves section 10(e)'s caveat that,\n\neven without proper objection, an issue may be appropriate for\n\njudicial review under \"extraordinary circumstances.\"          Saint-Gobain\n\ndoes not argue that extraordinary circumstances obtained here, and\n\nin all events, the record would not support such a claim.                The\n\nprocedural history of this case is pedestrian and Saint-Gobain,\n\ndespite its waiver, still may challenge the salient portions of the\n\nBoard's remedial order in a later compliance proceeding.              See,\n\ne.g., Pegasus Broad. of San Juan, Inc. v. NLRB, 82 F.3d 511, 513\n\nn.3 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that \"[s]uch a bifurcated procedure is\n\ncommon and has met with approval\").\n\n          A   second,   exogenous    exception   is   also   available    in\n\ncertain circumstances.     Notwithstanding the mandate of section\n\n10(e), the court of appeals retains residual jurisdiction to\n\nconsider a first-time challenge to a remedy on the ground that the\n\nremedy is obviously beyond the Board's authority.             See Detroit\n\nEdison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U.S. 301, 311 n.10 (1979).           In this case,\n\nhowever, the Board's authority to impose remedies such as backpay,\n\nreinstatement, and compulsory bargaining is unquestioned.\n\n          We need go no further. Concluding, as we do, that Saint-\n\nGobain's objection to the remedial portion of the Board's order\n\nlacked the requisite specificity to preserve for judicial review\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe issues that it has now briefed,4 we grant the Board's petition\n\nfor enforcement.\n\n\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      This conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to consider the\nparties' substantive arguments anent the appropriateness of the\nBoard's remedial order.\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

It filed an amended charge on May 29, 2002. In the charging documents, the Union alleged that Saint-Gobain violated the NLRA when it unilaterally reduced working hours in January of 2002 without prior notice to, or any bargaining with, the Union.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with a set of undisputed facts, the administrative law judge (ALJ) recommended that the Board find that Saint-Gobain had committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the NLRA. He recommended a remedy that would require Saint-Gobain to: (i) reinstate the 8-hour work day; (ii) award backpay to adversely affected employees up to the date of that reinstatement; and (iii) engage in collective bargaining with the Union as to hours of work and related conditions of employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saint-Gobain filed exceptions to the ALJ's decision.

It claims that the remedy is punitive and contravenes the tenets undergirding the NLRA. <i>See, e.g., NLRB v. Strong,</i> 393 U.S. 357, 359, 89 S.Ct. 541, 21 L.Ed.2d 546 (1969) (explaining that, though broad, the NLRA's grant of remedial power \"does not authorize punitive measures\"). More specifically, Saint-Gobain claims that the Board erred (i) by not tolling backpay as of March 7, 2002 (the date when management and the Union signed the voluntary separation agreement) and (ii) by directing reinstatement of the 8-hour work day (inasmuch as the voluntary separation agreement eliminated the need for such reinstatement as well). Since the Union agreed to layoffs in March of 2002, this thesis runs, it surely would have agreed to a reduction in hours of work at that point in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saint-Gobain also assigns error to the final feature of the Board's designated remedy: its directive that Saint-Gobain bargain further with the Union. In this regard, Saint-Gobain notes that the parties already have engaged in extensive bargaining and have reached an impasse. Further negotiations are, therefore, unnecessary &#8212; and might even prove to be counterproductive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's initial response to this asseverational array is that all of these arguments have been waived. The Board maintains that, by only objecting generally to the ALJ's proposed remedy, Saint-Gobain did not adequately raise before the Board the challenges that it now seeks to mount and, therefore, cannot raise those points in response to a petition for enforcement. Saint-Gobain's rejoinder is that its objections were not so vague as to preclude judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general exhaustion requirement that prevails in administrative matters is a bedrock principle: \"as a general rule[,] courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the [appropriate] time.\" <i>United States v. L.A.</i> <i>Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> 344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952). We have described this raise-or-waive rule as creating \"a win-win situation\" because \"adhering to it simultaneously enhances the efficacy of the agency, fosters judicial efficiency, and safeguards the integrity of the inter-branch review relationship.\" <i>P. Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. v. OSHRC,</i> 115 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10(e) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(e), unreservedly embraces this rule. In relevant part, the statute provides that when the Board petitions for judicial enforcement, \"[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> That statutory mandate is clear: if a particular objection has not been raised before the Board, a reviewing court, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is without jurisdiction to consider the issue in a subsequent enforcement proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 456 U.S. 645, 665, 102 S.Ct. 2071, 72 L.Ed.2d 398 (1982) (holding that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider an issue not raised by either party before the Board); <i>Local Union No. 25 v. NLRB,</i> 831 F.2d 1149, 1155 (1st Cir.1987) (similar); <i>cf.</i> 29 C.F.R. &#167; 102.46(b)(2) (\"Any exception to a ruling, finding, conclusion, or recommendation which is not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case before us is not as cut-and-dried as one in which no pertinent objection was made. <i>See, e.g., Local Union No. 25,</i> 831 F.2d at 1155. Here, Saint-Gobain, in addition to contesting liability, filed a general objection to the remedial portion of the ALJ's recommended order. That objection stated in relevant part that \"[t]he ALJ erred in recommending. . . the remedies set forth in the decision [because those remedies] are not supported by the evidence or by the law.\" In its supporting brief before the Board, Saint-Gobain again made a general averment that \"the ALJ's findings and conclusions are inconsistent with the record evidence and applicable law [and that as] a result, the ALJ's recommended remedy and order are also inconsistent with the record evidence and applicable law, and therefore should not be adopted.\" But Saint-Gobain's references to the ALJ's recommended remedy end there.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, we must decide whether, in the labor law context, a general objection, like this one, suffices to preserve a more specific (but encompassed) issue for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our own case law is silent on this precise question, the legal landscape is replete with guidance. The seminal case is <i>Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. NLRB,</i> 318 U.S. 253, 63 S.Ct. 585, 87 L.Ed. 744 (1943) (per curiam). There, the Supreme Court held that an objection that the examiner erred \"in making each and every recommendation\" was insufficient to grant jurisdiction for judicial review of a more particularized challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 255, 63 S.Ct. 585. The test is whether the objection, fairly read, apprises the Board that the objector intended to pursue the issue later presented to the court. <i>Id.</i> The objection in <i>Marshall Field</i> was too general to pass this test. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts of appeals have embroidered the basic rule of <i>Marshall Field.</i> A representative case is <i>Quazite v. NLRB,</i> 87 F.3d 493 (D.C.Cir.1996). The court there made it pellucid that when a party files only a blanket objection to the recommended remedy without providing any indication of the thrust of that objection, the objection alone furnishes inadequate notice to the Board of the objecting party's particular argument and, thus, does not satisfy section 10(e). <i>See id.</i> at 497-98. There is no shortage of other cases to the same effect. <i>See, e.g., NLRB v. Price's Pic-Pac Supermarkets, Inc.,</i> 707 F.2d 236, 241 (6th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (holding that an objection \"to each and every provision of the Remedy\" did not pass muster under section 10(e)); <i>Singer Co. v. NLRB,</i> 429 F.2d 172, 180-81 (8th Cir.1970) (holding that an exception to \"[t]he Recommended Order in its entirety [as] against the preponderance of the evidence and the law\" was too vague to preserve the court's jurisdiction over a specific issue not otherwise argued before the Board).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saint-Gobain's objection falls well within the compass of these authorities. It is a general objection to the remedy as a whole, and the supplemental brief adds nothing of substance to it. Together, those documents merely reassert Saint-Gobain's contention that it did not violate the NLRA and, therefore, that the imposition of any remedy would be inappropriate. This general objection is wholly insufficient to put the Board on notice of the specific arguments that Saint-Gobain now attempts to advance. Under section 10(e), then, we are without jurisdiction to entertain those arguments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Alwin Mfg. Co. v. NLRB,</i> 192 F.3d 133, 144 (D.C.Cir.1999) (\"Where . . . a party excepts to the entire remedy, and provides no indication of the basis for its objection, the exception alone provides insufficient notice to the Board of the party's particular arguments to satisfy section 10(e).\"); <i>Quazite,</i> 87 F.3d at 497 (concluding that an objection to a remedial order \"in its entirety\" was \"far too broad to preserve a particular issue for appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The raise-or-waive rule is, of course, not absolute. However, the two exceptions that come to mind afford no succor to Saint-Gobain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first exception involves section 10(e)'s caveat that, even without proper objection, an issue may be appropriate for judicial review under \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Saint-Gobain does not argue that extraordinary circumstances obtained here, and in all events, the record would not support such a claim. The procedural history of this case is pedestrian and Saint-Gobain, despite its waiver, still may challenge the salient portions of the Board's remedial order in a later compliance proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Pegasus Broadcasting of San Juan, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 82 F.3d 511, 513 n. 3 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that \"[s]uch a bifurcated procedure is common and has met with approval\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, exogenous exception is also available in certain circumstances. Notwithstanding the mandate of section 10(e), the court of appeals retains residual jurisdiction to consider a first-time challenge to a remedy on the ground that the remedy is obviously beyond the Board's authority. <i>See Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB,</i> 440 U.S. 301, 311 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 1123, 59 L.Ed.2d 333 (1979). In this case, however, the Board's authority to impose remedies such as backpay, reinstatement, and compulsory bargaining is unquestioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Concluding, as we do, that Saint-Gobain's objection to the remedial portion of the Board's order lacked the requisite specificity to preserve for judicial review the issues that it has now briefed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we grant the Board's petition for enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Union also alleged that Saint-Gobain committed another unfair labor practice when it unilaterally switched employees' medical insurance plans. That issue is not before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Saint-Gobain's claim that it raised other, more specific remedy-related arguments to the Board's regional counsel is unsupported by the record. Moreover, it is doubtful whether presentation of an argument at that stage and in that manner, without more, would suffice to preserve a claim of error<i>Cf. NLRB v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.,</i> 445 F.2d 633, 634 (1st Cir.1971) (concluding that registering a complaint through a \"letter to the regional compliance officer and in a conference with the acting regional director\" was insufficient for section 10(e) purposes).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This holding is consistent with our treatment of exceptions in other administrative law contexts<i>See, e.g., P. Gioioso,</i> 115 F.3d at 107 (holding that, under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, a party desiring to preserve an issue for judicial review must raise the issue clearly before the agency and articulate the issue in its petition for judicial review).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to consider the parties' substantive arguments anent the appropriateness of the Board's remedial order</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Strong,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107822\"><a href=\"/opinion/107822/nlrb-v-strong/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 359, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107822\"><a href=\"/opinion/107822/nlrb-v-strong/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

More specifically, Saint-Gobain claims that the Board erred (i) by not tolling backpay as of March 7, 2002 (the date when management and the Union signed the voluntary separation agreement) and (ii) by directing reinstatement of the 8-hour work day (inasmuch as the voluntary separation agreement eliminated the need for such reinstatement as well). Since the Union agreed to layoffs in March of 2002, this thesis runs, it surely would have agreed to a reduction in hours of work at that point in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saint-Gobain also assigns error to the final feature of the Board's designated remedy: its directive that Saint-Gobain bargain further with the Union. In this regard, Saint-Gobain notes that the parties already have engaged in extensive bargaining and have reached an impasse. Further negotiations are, therefore, unnecessary &#8212; and might even prove to be counterproductive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's initial response to this asseverational array is that all of these arguments have been waived. The Board maintains that, by only objecting generally to the ALJ's proposed remedy, Saint-Gobain did not adequately raise before the Board the challenges that it now seeks to mount and, therefore, cannot raise those points in response to a petition for enforcement. Saint-Gobain's rejoinder is that its objections were not so vague as to preclude judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general exhaustion requirement that prevails in administrative matters is a bedrock principle: \"as a general rule[,] courts should not topple over administrative decisions unless the administrative body not only has erred but has erred against objection made at the [appropriate] time.\" <i>United States v.

In relevant part, the statute provides that when the Board petitions for judicial enforcement, \"[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> That statutory mandate is clear: if a particular objection has not been raised before the Board, a reviewing court, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is without jurisdiction to consider the issue in a subsequent enforcement proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Woelke &amp; Romero Framing, Inc. v.

Here, Saint-Gobain, in addition to contesting liability, filed a general objection to the remedial portion of the ALJ's recommended order. That objection stated in relevant part that \"[t]he ALJ erred in recommending. . . the remedies set forth in the decision [because those remedies] are not supported by the evidence or by the law.\" In its supporting brief before the Board, Saint-Gobain again made a general averment that \"the ALJ's findings and conclusions are inconsistent with the record evidence and applicable law [and that as] a result, the ALJ's recommended remedy and order are also inconsistent with the record evidence and applicable law, and therefore should not be adopted.\" But Saint-Gobain's references to the ALJ's recommended remedy end there.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Consequently, we must decide whether, in the labor law context, a general objection, like this one, suffices to preserve a more specific (but encompassed) issue for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our own case law is silent on this precise question, the legal landscape is replete with guidance. The seminal case is <i>Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103784\"><a href=\"/opinion/103784/marshall-field-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></span> (1943) (per curiam). There, the Supreme Court held that an objection that the examiner erred \"in making each and every recommendation\" was insufficient to grant jurisdiction for judicial review of a more particularized challenge. <i>Id.</i> at 255, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></span>. The test is whether the objection, fairly read, apprises the Board that the objector intended to pursue the issue later presented to the court. <i>Id.</i> The objection in <i>Marshall Field</i> was too general to pass this test. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts of appeals have embroidered the basic rule of <i>Marshall Field.</i> A representative case is <i>Quazite v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720629\"><a href=\"/opinion/720629/quazite-division-of-morrison-molded-fiberglass-co-v-national-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1996). The court there made it pellucid that when a party files only a blanket objection to the recommended remedy without providing any indication of the thrust of that objection, the objection alone furnishes inadequate notice to the Board of the objecting party's particular argument and, thus, does not satisfy section 10(e). <i>See id.</i> at 497-98. There is no shortage of other cases to the same effect. <i>See, e.g., NLRB v. Price's Pic-Pac Supermarkets, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418204\"><a href=\"/opinion/418204/national-labor-relations-board-v-prices-pic-pac-supermarkets-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 241 (6th Cir.1983) (per curiam) (holding that an objection \"to each and every provision of the Remedy\" did not pass muster under section 10(e)); <i>Singer Co. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291195\"><a href=\"/opinion/291195/the-singer-company-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 180-81 (8th Cir.1970) (holding that an exception to \"[t]he Recommended Order in its entirety [as] against the preponderance of the evidence and the law\" was too vague to preserve the court's jurisdiction over a specific issue not otherwise argued before the Board).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Saint-Gobain's objection falls well within the compass of these authorities. It is a general objection to the remedy as a whole, and the supplemental brief adds nothing of substance to it. Together, those documents merely reassert Saint-Gobain's contention that it did not violate the NLRA and, therefore, that the imposition of any remedy would be inappropriate. This general objection is wholly insufficient to put the Board on notice of the specific arguments that Saint-Gobain now attempts to advance. Under section 10(e), then, we are without jurisdiction to entertain those arguments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Alwin Mfg. Co. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184950\"><a href=\"/opinion/184950/alwin-mfg-co-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 144 (D.C.Cir.1999) (\"Where . . . a party excepts to the entire remedy, and provides no indication of the basis for its objection, the exception alone provides insufficient notice to the Board of the party's particular arguments to satisfy section 10(e).\"); <i>Quazite,</i> 87 F.3d at 497 (concluding that an objection to a remedial order \"in its entirety\" was \"far too broad to preserve a particular issue for appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The raise-or-waive rule is, of course, not absolute. However, the two exceptions that come to mind afford no succor to Saint-Gobain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first exception involves section 10(e)'s caveat that, even without proper objection, an issue may be appropriate for judicial review under \"extraordinary circumstances.\" Saint-Gobain does not argue that extraordinary circumstances obtained here, and in all events, the record would not support such a claim. The procedural history of this case is pedestrian and Saint-Gobain, despite its waiver, still may challenge the salient portions of the Board's remedial order in a later compliance proceeding. <i>See, e.g., Pegasus Broadcasting of San Juan, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717467\"><a href=\"/opinion/717467/pegasus-broadcasting-of-san-juan-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 513 n. 3 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that \"[s]uch a bifurcated procedure is common and has met with approval\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, exogenous exception is also available in certain circumstances. Notwithstanding the mandate of section 10(e), the court of appeals retains residual jurisdiction to consider a first-time challenge to a remedy on the ground that the remedy is obviously beyond the Board's authority. <i>See Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110030\"><a href=\"/opinion/110030/detroit-edison-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 311 n. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110030\"><a href=\"/opinion/110030/detroit-edison-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span> (1979). In this case, however, the Board's authority to impose remedies such as backpay, reinstatement, and compulsory bargaining is unquestioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Concluding, as we do, that Saint-Gobain's objection to the remedial portion of the Board's order lacked the requisite specificity to preserve for judicial review the issues that it has now briefed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we grant the Board's petition for enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Union also alleged that Saint-Gobain committed another unfair labor practice when it unilaterally switched employees' medical insurance plans.
