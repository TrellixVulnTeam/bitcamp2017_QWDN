Petitioner Engjell Ceribashi,\n\na native and citizen of Albania, entered the United States in June\n\n2001 on a six-month visitor’s visa and applied early the next year\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United\n\nNations       Convention           Against    Torture     (“CAT”).        Finding     that\n\npetitioner’s tale of persecution lacked credibility, an immigration\n\njudge       (\"IJ\")    deemed       him   ineligible      for    relief;   the   Board   of\n\nImmigration          Appeals       (“BIA”)    affirmed     without    opinion.       After\n\ncarefully examining the record, we are unpersuaded that “any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to” reach a different\n\noutcome,       8   U.S.C.      §    1252(b)(4)(B),        and   we   consequently    deny\n\nCeribashi’s petition for review.\n\n     Ceribashi’s allegations of persecution prominently feature his\n\nfather’s role as a political activist in Albania in the 1940s and\n\nthe father’s execution by the Communist regime in 1946, when\n\npetitioner         was   ten       years     old.    He    claims    that   the     family\n\nexperienced various forms of ill treatment through the following\n\ndecades, including his confinement in labor camps between 1965 and\n\n1985.        Petitioner’s circumstances improved when the Democratic\n\nParty (“DP”) controlled the Albanian government in the 1990s and he\n\nwas involved in DP activities,1 but the danger returned when the\n\nSocialist Party came to power in 1997.\n\n\n        1\n        He   claims  that   he  participated   in  DP   protests,\ndemonstrations and meetings, that he was a speaker for the party,\nand that he served in the DP administration as an “inspector.”\n\n                                               -2-\n\f     Ceribashi points to two specific incidents, in addition to his\n\nfamily history, to substantiate his claim of persecution.          First,\n\nhe asserts that in May 1998 he was deliberately hit by a car as he\n\nrode a bicycle to his home in Tirana.      He was hospitalized for five\n\ndays and, concerned about his safety, spent most of his time at\n\nhome for the next two years.      He returned to the hospital in March\n\n2000 for surgery on his leg, and he said the second incident\n\noccurred   upon   his   release   about   two   weeks   later.    Two   men\n\nconfronted him after he left the hospital, warning that “[w]e are\n\nnot done with you and your family” and threatening to cut off his\n\nlegs or kill him if he continued his support for the Democratic\n\nParty.   Petitioner said he recognized the men as active supporters\n\nof the Socialist Party.\n\n     Petitioner stated that his reports of the incidents to the\n\npolice   were   ignored   because   the   police   also   were   Socialist\n\nsupporters who recognized him and knew of his family background and\n\nDP affiliation.    Fearing for his life after the second assault,\n\npetitioner went into hiding for six months and then applied for a\n\nvisa at the American embassy.       He was granted a visitor’s visa in\n\nDecember 2000, but did not leave Albania until June 2001 because he\n\nlacked the funds to make the trip earlier.\n\n     Petitioner claims that if he is forced to return to Albania\n\nhis life will be at risk because of his family history and his\n\nsupport for, and activities on behalf of, the Democratic Party.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fThe   IJ,   however,     had    “serious   issues   with    [petitioner’s]\n\ncredibility,” concluding that it is “highly unlike[ly] that [he]\n\nwould have been targeted in the year 1998 or even in the year 2000\n\nby those who perhaps might have remembered his father some 53 to 55\n\nyears ago.”      The IJ further noted that, even if petitioner’s\n\nversion of events were credible, “he has failed to state a claim\n\nthat is rational[] and reasonable based upon the country conditions\n\nin Albania as reported by the United States State Department.”\n\nAccordingly, the IJ denied all of petitioner’s claims.\n\n      Our review is limited: we consider only whether substantial\n\nevidence    in   the   record   supports   the   IJ’s   finding   that   the\n\npetitioner failed to show a well founded fear of persecution and\n\nthus did not establish his asylum claim; if the finding has\n\nsufficient support, it must stand unless a reasonable factfinder\n\nwould be compelled to make a contrary determination.              Lumaj v.\n\nGonzales, 446 F.3d 194, 198 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Olujoke v.\n\nGonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005)).2            The record here is\n\nadequate to sustain the IJ’s ruling.3\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       We review the IJ’s decision, as the BIA affirmed without\nopinion. Lumaj v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 194, 198 (1st Cir. 2006).\n      3\n       If the IJ’s asylum ruling is supported, petitioner’s\nalternative request for withholding of removal necessarily will\nfail. Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005). The\nCAT claim has been forfeited, as it was not referenced in\npetitioner’s appeal to the BIA. See Un v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205,\n210-11 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f     The IJ’s doubts about petitioner’s credibility stem in part\n\nfrom variations in his story about the bicycle incident and from\n\nthe judge’s skepticism that animosity toward petitioner’s father\n\nsixty       years   ago   would   continue   to   fuel   persecution   against\n\npetitioner.         The IJ noted that petitioner told the asylum officer\n\nwho initially interviewed him that a car door opened suddenly and\n\nknocked him off his bicycle, but later testified that a car drove\n\nstraight at him.4          Of more significance in supporting the IJ’s\n\ncredibility judgment is that petitioner consistently reported that\n\nno one else was on the street when the bicycle incident occurred,\n\nbut he produced a photograph of the suspect car taken by a friend\n\nnearly two years later; the friend supposedly “was close to the\n\nstreet where the incident happened,” remembered the license plate\n\nnumber, and recognized the vehicle.\n\n     The IJ also observed that petitioner’s son remains in Albania,\n\napparently safely, and the record reveals that two of petitioner’s\n\nsiblings live there as well. Although petitioner claims that he is\n\n\n\n        4\n       Petitioner suggests that the content of the asylum officer’s\nreport may not be considered because the officer was not subject to\ncross-examination.    Petitioner, however, was given a chance to\nrespond to the report at his hearing. Asked about the discrepancy,\nhe stated that he could not remember the specifics of his comments\nto the asylum officer “because a long time passed since that day\nthat I was interviewing but I know that what I said today is true\nthat I was riding the bicycle and the car came toward me and the\nreason was to kill me.” The IJ admitted the report into evidence\nas a hearsay document, noting that “I understand that you can’t\ncross-examine on it.” Given this context, it does not appear that\nthe report was given undue weight in the IJ’s ruling.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fa target while they are not because of his DP activity and because\n\nhis brother and sister are elderly, petitioner was beyond 65 when\n\nhe left Albania and is now nearly seventy years old.\n\n     Moreover, the IJ was skeptical that petitioner played a\n\nsignificant role in the DP, and the record permits such doubts.   In\n\nhis application for asylum, petitioner said that he supported the\n\ndemocratic movement and “took part in . . . all the demonstrations\n\nto overthrow the communist system” and also stated that he wrote\n\narticles in the Democratic Party newspaper.   He testified that he\n\nattended “all the meetings of the democratic party” and that he was\n\n“a speaker for the democratic system in that time.”    So far as we\n\ncan tell, however, none of the newspaper articles he authored are\n\nin the record, and his DP membership card was dated July 2001 –\n\nwhich was after his arrival in the United States.5    He offered no\n\nother specific evidence of a leadership role in the DP, and thus\n\nleft largely unexplained why he would be targeted for harm – other\n\nthan to rely on his father’s activity half a century earlier.6\n\n\n\n     5\n       The IJ noted that petitioner had said he came to the United\nStates with his certificate of DP membership but that the\ncertificate was dated a month after his arrival; whether he\nactually traveled with it is of little significance, but its date\ndoes permit an inference that petitioner was not a longtime DP\nactivist and that he joined to bolster his asylum claim.\n     6\n       Petitioner complains that the IJ failed to give weight to\nthe years of persecution his family experienced as a result of his\nfather’s political activity. We think it evident that the judge\nconsidered that evidence, but deemed it largely irrelevant to the\nissue of petitioner’s current risk of persecution.\n\n                               -6-\n\fAdditionally, the IJ could have discounted the seriousness of any\n\nthreat because petitioner remained in his home without incident for\n\ntwo years after the bicycle episode and then waited a year after\n\nthe hospital episode to leave the country.           Although he reported\n\nthat he was in hiding for that final year, he also testified, in\n\nresponse to a question, that he lived in the same residence between\n\n1998 and 2001, the year of his departure.\n\n      The IJ also pointed to other weaknesses he perceived in\n\npetitioner’s story: he said it was implausible that Socialist Party\n\ngang members would be driving late-model Mercedes vehicles, as\n\npetitioner had alleged; he doubted that local police officials\n\nwould recognize petitioner as the son of a political activist whose\n\ninvolvement had been a half-century earlier, or that such identity\n\nwould “make any difference to them”; and he thought the possibility\n\nthat a U.S. embassy official would issue a visitor’s visa to an\n\nindividual who said he wanted to apply for political asylum was “so\n\nhighly unlikely as to be on the verge of being preposterous.”\n\n      While these latter observations must be characterized as\n\nspeculation rather than fact-finding based on record evidence, the\n\nultimate inferences drawn by the IJ were not unreasonable given the\n\nsum   total   of   petitioner’s      presentation.       The   generalities,\n\ninconsistency      and   gaps   in     his   narrative     diminished   its\n\npersuasiveness, and the U.S. Department of State’s Profile of\n\nAsylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania, on which the IJ\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\frelied, gave weight to the judge’s view that petitioner’s account\n\nwas, in various respects, implausible.             The IJ noted that the\n\nreport, dated May 2001, stated that “[t]here is virtually no\n\nevidence    that   individuals   are    targeted    for   mistreatment    on\n\npolitical   grounds,”   observing      that   “[f]ar   more   prevalent   is\n\norganized and amateur crime,” exacerbated by, inter alia, police\n\ncorruption, widespread availability of firearms, “and a culture of\n\nblood feud that is wholly independent of political activity.”7\n\n     Petitioner complains that the IJ ignored record evidence of\n\npolitically motivated violence, but the serious incidents described\n\nin the documents submitted on his behalf occurred in 2001 or\n\nearlier, and the most recent report in the record – the State\n\nDepartment’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices in 2002\n\n(dated March 2003) – noted that there were no confirmed cases of\n\npolitical killings by the government or its agents, no reports of\n\npolitically motivated disappearances, and “no confirmed cases of\n\ndetainees being held strictly for political reasons.”           From these\n\nreports, the IJ reasonably could have concluded that conditions in\n\nAlbania with respect to politically motivated violence had improved\n\nsince petitioner’s departure.\n\n\n\n     7\n       In Waweru v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 199, 202 n.1 (1st Cir.\n2006), we noted that “[t]he Board of Immigration Appeals is\nentitled to rely on the State Department’s country reports as proof\nof country conditions described therein, although it must also\nconsider evidence in the record that contradicts the State\nDepartment’s descriptions and conclusions.”\n\n                                    -8-\n\f     To be sure, the record materials make it clear that human\n\nrights abuses by the police and other institutions continued to\n\noccur; that evidence does not lead inevitably, however, to a\n\nconclusion that petitioner would be at risk on account of his\n\npolitical affiliation if he returned to Albania.             Indeed, Amnesty\n\nInternational’s report noted that similar brutality existed under\n\nthe DP regime as well.        Also relevant to the IJ’s assessment of\n\npetitioner’s    claim   is   that   the   two   most   recent    episodes      of\n\npolitically    motivated     violence   reported   –   the    death   of   a   DP\n\n“leader” in police custody in 2001 and the killing of a DP\n\n“activist” in 2000 – affected DP members who appeared to have\n\nsignificantly more involvement than petitioner.              In addition, the\n\n2002 Country Report on Human Rights Practices stated that the\n\nAlbanian government completed its investigation into a 1998 murder\n\nof a DP leader, with four suspects convicted and sentenced to\n\nprison terms between 2 1/2 years to life, allowing the IJ to infer\n\nthat violence against DP supporters was not – or at least not\n\nalways – condoned by the government.\n\n     Also of note, from a different perspective, are a 2002 World\n\nReport from Human Rights Watch and a 2001 report from Amnesty\n\nInternational, which stated that the head of the DP’s Tropoja\n\nbranch was arrested at his home in January 2001, allegedly for his\n\nrole in a November 2000 attack on a police station, and later was\n\nbrutally assaulted.     The IJ reasonably could have concluded that,\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fif petitioner were truly a political target, he, too, would have\n\nbeen pursued at home.\n\n     The    country   condition   material   thus    did   not   compel    the\n\nconclusion that petitioner would be at risk based on his and his\n\nfather’s support of the Democratic Party if he were to return to\n\nAlbania.      Given   petitioner’s    age,   the    apparent     decline   in\n\npolitically motivated incidents, and the not unreasonable inference\n\nof partial fabrication drawn by the IJ from petitioner’s hearing\n\ntestimony and other statements, his ruling was supportable.                 On\n\nthis record, even if we credited petitioner’s accounts of the two\n\nassaults, we would lack the authority to override the IJ’s finding\n\nthat petitioner lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nSee Lumaj, 446 F.3d at 198 n.4. (government may rebut presumption\n\nregarding future persecution that arises from past persecution)8;\n\nsee also Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004) (“[A]\n\nreviewing    court    can   reverse   the    BIA    only   if    the   record\n\nunequivocally indicates error.”).9\n\n\n     8\n      If an asylum applicant can establish past persecution, he is\npresumed to be a refugee for purposes of eligibility for asylum.\nMakhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004). “This\npresumption shifts the burden to the government to show that\nconditions in the applicant’s home country have changed to such an\nextent that he has no well-founded fear of future persecution.”\nId. (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).\n     9\n       In his brief to this court, petitioner invokes “humanitarian\nasylum,” a discretionary doctrine sometimes available even when\nthere is little likelihood of future persecution. See Waweru, 437\nF.3d at 205 (“[T]his is granted only in cases of ‘extraordinary\nsuffering . . . .’”); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A);\n\n                                   -10-\n\f     Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\nMatter of Chen, 20 I. & N. Dec. 16, 19-21 (BIA 1989). Because this\nbasis for relief was not previously raised, we do not consider it.\nSee Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

Petitioner said he recognized the men as active supporters\n\nof the Socialist Party.\n\n     Petitioner stated that his reports of the incidents to the\n\npolice   were   ignored   because   the   police   also   were   Socialist\n\nsupporters who recognized him and knew of his family background and\n\nDP affiliation.    Fearing for his life after the second assault,\n\npetitioner went into hiding for six months and then applied for a\n\nvisa at the American embassy.       He was granted a visitor’s visa in\n\nDecember 2000, but did not leave Albania until June 2001 because he\n\nlacked the funds to make the trip earlier.\n\n     Petitioner claims that if he is forced to return to Albania\n\nhis life will be at risk because of his family history and his\n\nsupport for, and activities on behalf of, the Democratic Party.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fThe   IJ,   however,     had    “serious   issues   with    [petitioner’s]\n\ncredibility,” concluding that it is “highly unlike[ly] that [he]\n\nwould have been targeted in the year 1998 or even in the year 2000\n\nby those who perhaps might have remembered his father some 53 to 55\n\nyears ago.”      The IJ further noted that, even if petitioner’s\n\nversion of events were credible, “he has failed to state a claim\n\nthat is rational[] and reasonable based upon the country conditions\n\nin Albania as reported by the United States State Department.”\n\nAccordingly, the IJ denied all of petitioner’s claims.\n\n      Our review is limited: we consider only whether substantial\n\nevidence    in   the   record   supports   the   IJ’s   finding   that   the\n\npetitioner failed to show a well founded fear of persecution and\n\nthus did not establish his asylum claim; if the finding has\n\nsufficient support, it must stand unless a reasonable factfinder\n\nwould be compelled to make a contrary determination.

The IJ noted that petitioner told the asylum officer\n\nwho initially interviewed him that a car door opened suddenly and\n\nknocked him off his bicycle, but later testified that a car drove\n\nstraight at him.4          Of more significance in supporting the IJ’s\n\ncredibility judgment is that petitioner consistently reported that\n\nno one else was on the street when the bicycle incident occurred,\n\nbut he produced a photograph of the suspect car taken by a friend\n\nnearly two years later; the friend supposedly “was close to the\n\nstreet where the incident happened,” remembered the license plate\n\nnumber, and recognized the vehicle.\n\n     The IJ also observed that petitioner’s son remains in Albania,\n\napparently safely, and the record reveals that two of petitioner’s\n\nsiblings live there as well. Although petitioner claims that he is\n\n\n\n        4\n       Petitioner suggests that the content of the asylum officer’s\nreport may not be considered because the officer was not subject to\ncross-examination.    Petitioner, however, was given a chance to\nrespond to the report at his hearing. Asked about the discrepancy,\nhe stated that he could not remember the specifics of his comments\nto the asylum officer “because a long time passed since that day\nthat I was interviewing but I know that what I said today is true\nthat I was riding the bicycle and the car came toward me and the\nreason was to kill me.” The IJ admitted the report into evidence\nas a hearsay document, noting that “I understand that you can’t\ncross-examine on it.” Given this context, it does not appear that\nthe report was given undue weight in the IJ’s ruling.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fa target while they are not because of his DP activity and because\n\nhis brother and sister are elderly, petitioner was beyond 65 when\n\nhe left Albania and is now nearly seventy years old.\n\n     Moreover, the IJ was skeptical that petitioner played a\n\nsignificant role in the DP, and the record permits such doubts.   In\n\nhis application for asylum, petitioner said that he supported the\n\ndemocratic movement and “took part in . . . all the demonstrations\n\nto overthrow the communist system” and also stated that he wrote\n\narticles in the Democratic Party newspaper.   He testified that he\n\nattended “all the meetings of the democratic party” and that he was\n\n“a speaker for the democratic system in that time.”    So far as we\n\ncan tell, however, none of the newspaper articles he authored are\n\nin the record, and his DP membership card was dated July 2001 –\n\nwhich was after his arrival in the United States.5    He offered no\n\nother specific evidence of a leadership role in the DP, and thus\n\nleft largely unexplained why he would be targeted for harm – other\n\nthan to rely on his father’s activity half a century earlier.6\n\n\n\n     5\n       The IJ noted that petitioner had said he came to the United\nStates with his certificate of DP membership but that the\ncertificate was dated a month after his arrival; whether he\nactually traveled with it is of little significance, but its date\ndoes permit an inference that petitioner was not a longtime DP\nactivist and that he joined to bolster his asylum claim.\n     6\n       Petitioner complains that the IJ failed to give weight to\nthe years of persecution his family experienced as a result of his\nfather’s political activity. We think it evident that the judge\nconsidered that evidence, but deemed it largely irrelevant to the\nissue of petitioner’s current risk of persecution.\n\n                               -6-\n\fAdditionally, the IJ could have discounted the seriousness of any\n\nthreat because petitioner remained in his home without incident for\n\ntwo years after the bicycle episode and then waited a year after\n\nthe hospital episode to leave the country.           Although he reported\n\nthat he was in hiding for that final year, he also testified, in\n\nresponse to a question, that he lived in the same residence between\n\n1998 and 2001, the year of his departure.\n\n      The IJ also pointed to other weaknesses he perceived in\n\npetitioner’s story: he said it was implausible that Socialist Party\n\ngang members would be driving late-model Mercedes vehicles, as\n\npetitioner had alleged; he doubted that local police officials\n\nwould recognize petitioner as the son of a political activist whose\n\ninvolvement had been a half-century earlier, or that such identity\n\nwould “make any difference to them”; and he thought the possibility\n\nthat a U.S. embassy official would issue a visitor’s visa to an\n\nindividual who said he wanted to apply for political asylum was “so\n\nhighly unlikely as to be on the verge of being preposterous.”\n\n      While these latter observations must be characterized as\n\nspeculation rather than fact-finding based on record evidence, the\n\nultimate inferences drawn by the IJ were not unreasonable given the\n\nsum   total   of   petitioner’s      presentation.       The   generalities,\n\ninconsistency      and   gaps   in     his   narrative     diminished   its\n\npersuasiveness, and the U.S. Department of State’s Profile of\n\nAsylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania, on which the IJ\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\frelied, gave weight to the judge’s view that petitioner’s account\n\nwas, in various respects, implausible.             The IJ noted that the\n\nreport, dated May 2001, stated that “[t]here is virtually no\n\nevidence    that   individuals   are    targeted    for   mistreatment    on\n\npolitical   grounds,”   observing      that   “[f]ar   more   prevalent   is\n\norganized and amateur crime,” exacerbated by, inter alia, police\n\ncorruption, widespread availability of firearms, “and a culture of\n\nblood feud that is wholly independent of political activity.”7\n\n     Petitioner complains that the IJ ignored record evidence of\n\npolitically motivated violence, but the serious incidents described\n\nin the documents submitted on his behalf occurred in 2001 or\n\nearlier, and the most recent report in the record – the State\n\nDepartment’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices in 2002\n\n(dated March 2003) – noted that there were no confirmed cases of\n\npolitical killings by the government or its agents, no reports of\n\npolitically motivated disappearances, and “no confirmed cases of\n\ndetainees being held strictly for political reasons.”           From these\n\nreports, the IJ reasonably could have concluded that conditions in\n\nAlbania with respect to politically motivated violence had improved\n\nsince petitioner’s departure.\n\n\n\n     7\n       In Waweru v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202091\"><a href=\"/opinion/202091/waweru-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 n.1 (1st Cir.\n2006), we noted that “[t]he Board of Immigration Appeals is\nentitled to rely on the State Department’s country reports as proof\nof country conditions described therein, although it must also\nconsider evidence in the record that contradicts the State\nDepartment’s descriptions and conclusions.”\n\n                                    -8-\n\f     To be sure, the record materials make it clear that human\n\nrights abuses by the police and other institutions continued to\n\noccur; that evidence does not lead inevitably, however, to a\n\nconclusion that petitioner would be at risk on account of his\n\npolitical affiliation if he returned to Albania.             Indeed, Amnesty\n\nInternational’s report noted that similar brutality existed under\n\nthe DP regime as well.        Also relevant to the IJ’s assessment of\n\npetitioner’s    claim   is   that   the   two   most   recent    episodes      of\n\npolitically    motivated     violence   reported   –   the    death   of   a   DP\n\n“leader” in police custody in 2001 and the killing of a DP\n\n“activist” in 2000 – affected DP members who appeared to have\n\nsignificantly more involvement than petitioner.              In addition, the\n\n2002 Country Report on Human Rights Practices stated that the\n\nAlbanian government completed its investigation into a 1998 murder\n\nof a DP leader, with four suspects convicted and sentenced to\n\nprison terms between 2 1/2 years to life, allowing the IJ to infer\n\nthat violence against DP supporters was not – or at least not\n\nalways – condoned by the government.\n\n     Also of note, from a different perspective, are a 2002 World\n\nReport from Human Rights Watch and a 2001 report from Amnesty\n\nInternational, which stated that the head of the DP’s Tropoja\n\nbranch was arrested at his home in January 2001, allegedly for his\n\nrole in a November 2000 attack on a police station, and later was\n\nbrutally assaulted.     The IJ reasonably could have concluded that,\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fif petitioner were truly a political target, he, too, would have\n\nbeen pursued at home.\n\n     The    country   condition   material   thus    did   not   compel    the\n\nconclusion that petitioner would be at risk based on his and his\n\nfather’s support of the Democratic Party if he were to return to\n\nAlbania.      Given   petitioner’s    age,   the    apparent     decline   in\n\npolitically motivated incidents, and the not unreasonable inference\n\nof partial fabrication drawn by the IJ from petitioner’s hearing\n\ntestimony and other statements, his ruling was supportable.                 On\n\nthis record, even if we credited petitioner’s accounts of the two\n\nassaults, we would lack the authority to override the IJ’s finding\n\nthat petitioner lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nSee Lumaj, 446 F.3d at 198 n.4.
