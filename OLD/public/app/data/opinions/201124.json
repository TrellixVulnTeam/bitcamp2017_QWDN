We apply that rule here.  In this complex case involving numerous issues of both fact and law, appellants have argued that their arguments derive from the same legal and factual positions of their co-defendants.  However, they have failed to explain why this is so beyond noting that they were co-defendants in the district court, were tried in front of one judge, and were sentenced by another judge.  \"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument . . . , leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Because appellants have argued for adoption by reference in a perfunctory manner, we deem the arguments waived.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">A.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Conviction</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">1.

A grand jury promptly issued a second indictment.  One day before the defendant-appellant's STA deadline, a  grand jury issued a superseding indictment that added a second defendant.  This court found no STA violation but expressed concern because the government, \"after once violating the appellant's STA rights, . . . filed the superseding indictment only one day before the STA clock was to expire </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">again</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> at 259 (emphasis in original).

Nor do we agree with appellants' assertion that the delay was caused by the judicial system's inability to cope with a case this size.  From our review of the record, the district court disposed of the co-defendants' numerous motions in a timely manner and moved the case along to trial.  Instead, it appears that delays were due in large part to the resolution of pre-trial matters concerning appellants and their co-defendants.</span>\n</p><p>10:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">We note that four of the appellants -- Nicolai, Correy, Pizarro, and Bonilla -- filed motions to continue trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Further, while a case of this size is certainly unwieldy, the joint prosecution of defendants involved in the same drug trafficking conspiracy is justified as a means of serving the efficient administration of justice.

R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1) (sentence must be imposed \"without unnecessary delay\").  While the delay between conviction and sentence was, again, unusually long in this case, it was not without good reason.  It was necessary for transcripts of the seven-month trial to be prepared and reviewed in order to produce pre-sentence reports (PSRs) for the defendants.  In addition, a number of post-trial motions were filed by appellants and their co-defendants.  Nicolai filed twenty-two motions following his conviction, at least three of which requested continuances or extensions of time.  Pizarro filed seventeen motions, requesting seven continuances or extensions of time.  Neither appellant claims to have asserted a constitutional right to a speedy sentence.  Nor do they explain what prejudice resulted from the delay, except to suggest that they were prejudiced by having to wait to file the instant appeal.  We are not convinced that they were prejudiced, especially since some of the sentencing delay was to give defendants the opportunity to file Rule 29 motions for acquittal and motions for a new trial, which might have mooted the appeal had they been successful.  Thus, we find that the delay between appellants' conviction and sentencing caused no violation of their rights under the Sixth Amendment.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.7000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">c.

The claim is without merit.  The organizer was nonfunctional because its batteries were dead, and rather than risk losing data by changing the batteries, investigators transcribed its contents before it lost power.  The district court considered and overruled objections to admitting the transcribed information, holding that there was no evidence of intentional tampering and that the incomplete record of the contents was a topic appropriate for cross-examination.

The court once again admonished all counsel to behave appropriately.  (TT 9/1/99: 65-73).  Finally, on October 26, the defense raised concerns that the behavior of the prosecutor demonstrated a lack of respect for the court's authority and might lead the jury to conclude that the government attorneys enjoyed more latitude than defense counsel.  The judge was aware of two such instances, one in which she had to admonish the prosecutor to abide by an evidentiary ruling, and another in which the prosecutor threw his pen after receiving an adverse ruling.  She admonished him to keep his behavior in check and to respect the court's authority.  (TT 10/26/99: 175-77).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">The trial judge was in a far better position than we to determine whether the alleged gestures and other behavior occurred, whether they appeared to be intentional or inadvertent, and whether they had any influence on witnesses or the jury.  We will not second-guess her rulings on the record before us.  With regard to those gestures that the court did observe -- nodding at the witnesses, disregarding a ruling, and throwing a pen -- whether they were intentional or not, they were unprofessional and inappropriate.  However, they occurred in the context of a seven-month jury trial, were addressed by admonishments from the court, and, from the record, do not appear to have prejudiced Correy or the other defendants.  Within the overall framework of this lengthy trial, they were unlikely to have affected the outcome of trial.  Thus, they fall short of rendering the trial so unfair as to require a new one.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">In sum, we find that none of the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct was likely to have affected the outcome of the trial, and thus none requires a new trial.

Although the juror initially denied the comment, she eventually made a number of assertions that raised concerns about jury bias, including that some female jurors \"liked\" certain defendants, that she knew Nicolai was in jail, and that jurors had expressed the opinion that Nicolai was a \"cabesilla [sic]\"</span>\n<p>31:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While the transcript's spelling of the word is \"cabesilla\", the correct spelling is \"cabecilla.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';zquez Spanish and English Dictionary 123 (1984).</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> (kingpin) of a gang.

This response assumes the existence of a drug conspiracy or organization about which no facts had yet been offered into evidence.  No objection, however, was made by the defense.

Bonilla also had a CHC of I and was found responsible for over 150 kilograms of cocaine.  The court declined to add a weapons enhancement, sentencing Bonilla to the lower end of the Guidelines range at 235 months.  Pizarro was held accountable for more than 150 kilograms of cocaine, along with a two-level enhancement for weapon possession and a three-level role enhancement, for a TOL of 43.  Combined with a CHC of II, the Guidelines mandated a life sentence.  Flores received a sentence based on a BOL of 38, representing 150 kilograms or more of cocaine, and a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.  Combined with a CHC of I, the applicable Guidelines range was 292 to 365 months.  Flores was sentenced to the bottom of that range, 292 months.

The trial record in this case is of daunting proportions, and we are all too aware that a thorough review is a time-consuming process, but it is not so insurmountable a task as to render the committee's decision to reassign the case an abuse of discretion.  There was no error in the committee's reassignment of the instant case prior to sentencing.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">2.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Sentencing judge's familiarity with record</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Appellants next argue that the sentencing judge abused his discretion in refusing to return the case to the trial judge and in proceeding with sentencing because he lacked sufficient familiarity with the record.  As we noted above, a replacement judge is ordinarily \"capable of assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the evidence at trial by a thorough review of the record.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Courts of Appeals \"give great deference to the district judge's decision to proceed with sentencing.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Larios</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">see also</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">McGuinness</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 769 F.2d 695, 696 (11th Cir. 1985) (stating that \"[a] sentencing judge enjoys broad discretion to determine whether he can perform sentencing duties in a case he did not try\").</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">In the instant case, approximately one-third of the trial days had not been transcribed at the time of sentencing and thus were unavailable to the sentencing judge for review.  This absence of transcripts initially gives us pause, both because of the amount of unavailable transcripts and because credibility was an important issue in appellants' trial.  However, after carefully reviewing the record, our concern is lessened due to several factors.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">First, our review of the record reveals that, while most of the appellants requested transcripts at one time or another  (Docket Nos. 1644, 1645, 1647, 1736, 2143), the transcripts that they requested were made available by the time of their sentencing.</span>\n</p><p>41:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">It is true that Flores filed a request for all of the transcripts on December 23, 1999.  (Docket No. 1658).  However, it appears that the transcripts that he wanted were provided pursuant to an order issued by Judge Cerezo on February 29, 2000.  This order instructed the court reporter to prepare transcripts of certain witnesses' testimonies and stated that it had considered Flores's motion.  It appears that Judge Cerezo considered Flores's motion, along with the motions of the other appellants, before ordering the transcripts she felt were relevant to their sentencing.  (Docket No. 1715).</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Second, the original trial judge ordered only the transcripts that she felt were relevant for sentencing the appellants.  (Docket No. 1715).  These transcripts were available to the successor sentencing judge.  Third, the sentencing judge repeatedly stated that he had reviewed the portions of the record pertinent to defendants' sentencing and cited to specific passages of the transcripts in determining the drug quantity attributable to each defendant.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';] the more the case depends on the credibility, and especially the demeanor, of the witnesses, the more a judge needs to do to become adequately familiar with it.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Larios</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 640 F.2d at 943.  While we agree with </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Larios</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">'s proposition, we need not analyze the merits of appellants' complaints on this issue further because we are remanding their cases for re-sentencing -- at which appellants and the sentencing judge will have access to all of the transcripts -- due to </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> error and violations of Fed.

R. Crim. P. 32(b).  Per amendments effective December 1, 2002, Rule 32 was renumbered and the notice requirements were moved to Rule 32(e).</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Bonilla argues that, pursuant to an order from Judge Cerezo, the Probation Office was required to prepare a revised PSR that contained findings regarding the quantities and types of drugs attributable to Bonilla.  Bonilla never received a revised PSR prior to his sentencing hearing.  Before addressing this argument, we pause to briefly provide background.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Bonilla, along with the other appellants, was convicted of Count I, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute approximately 1400 grams of heroin and 9445 kilograms of cocaine.  We have consistently held that</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">when a district court determines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted of participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.

On July 11, 2000, Bonilla was scheduled for his sentencing hearing before Judge Cerezo.  At the hearing Judge Cerezo found that the PSR contained no findings as to the quantities or types of drugs attributable to Bonilla.</span>\n</p><p>45:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">The offense conduct in the PSR was based solely on the overt acts alleged in the indictment as to the entire conspiracy.  However, the jury did not issue a special verdict or rule on the overt acts alleged in the indictment.  The PSR thus contained no findings as to drug type or quantities attributable to Bonilla based on evidence in the record.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  In accordance with the principles set out in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';lveda</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, Judge Cerezo vacated Bonilla's sentencing hearing.  She then instructed the U.S. Probation Officer</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">to utilize methods of calculation based on these principles [in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';lveda</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">] and on the evidence presented at trial which is relevant to Mr. Bonilla-Lugo.  Since this case was a lengthy trial, and compliance with this order shall require the Officer to read voluminous trial transcripts, as she/(he) must do as to the other defendants waiting sentence, a term of forty five (45) days is granted for the U.S. Probation Officer to comply with this order.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';10, 2002, before Judge Laffitte.  However, neither Bonilla nor his counsel had received the revised PSR which Judge Cerezo had ordered.</span>\n</p><p>46:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">The Probation Officer confirmed this fact at the sentencing hearing, telling the sentencing judge that \"I was directly ordered by the Honorable Judge Cerezo, and my response was sent directly to her.  I was not ordered to disclose that information to any of the parties.\"  The record does not show any such limitation on disclosure being ordered by Judge Cerezo and, of course, it would be improper for the Probation Office to fail to disclose to counsel a PSR that was to be relied upon by the court.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Bonilla's counsel apprised the sentencing judge of this fact.  The judge, who had received the updated PSR, allowed Bonilla's counsel to read the supplement.  After reading it, Bonilla's counsel asked for more time, stating \"I've read this memorandum, and it's wrong, Your Honor, and I need time to prove that, and I have it in the record.  I can proof (sic) it from the record.\"</span>\n<p>47:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While counsel did not utter the word \"continuance,\" it is obvious from her statement that she was requesting a continuance.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Specifically, Bonilla's counsel insisted that, if she had more time, she could refute the quantity of drugs that the PSR attributed to Bonilla.  The sentencing judge refused to grant a continuance and sentenced Bonilla to 235 months imprisonment.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">\"We ordinarily review the district court's failure to continue the sentencing hearing for abuse of discretion.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';pez</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 295 F.3d 165, 169 (1st Cir. 2002).

There could very well be other reasons the district court would have departed under discretionary guidelines.  We note that Flores has argued that his sentence was enhanced above the maximum sentence authorized by jury fact-finding or admitted facts, and that, in such a situation, a judge's \"'factual certainty alone' in support of such enhancements 'would not be sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting under an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the same sentence on the basis of those factors.'\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Fornia-Castillo</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 408 F.3d 52, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';zquez-Rivera</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 407 F.3d at 489-90).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Further, the district judge sentenced Flores at the low end of the guideline range, rejecting the government's request for a sentence at the upper-end of the guideline range.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';zquez-Rivera</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 407 F.3d at 490 (stating that \"our doubt . . . is enhanced by the fact that, while the applicable Guidelines constrained the sentencing judge to the upper margin of sentences available under [the relevant statute], the sentence he chose was at the low end of that margin\").

While the district court mentioned </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, it did so in an off-hand manner while responding to Casas's arguments regarding sentence disparity.

Because, as we discuss below, we find plain error, we will merely assume, without deciding, that Correy failed to preserve a </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> claim.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">We review unpreserved </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> claims for plain error.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Antonakopoulos</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 399 F.3d at 75.

To meet the other two prongs, defendants must ordinarily show \"a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence [that is] more favorable to the defendant under the new 'advisory Guidelines' </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> regime.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  In </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Antonakopoulos</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, we stated that a procedural error in the application of the Guidelines that would have led us to remand a case for re-sentencing pre-</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> would likely provide a basis for remanding unpreserved </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> claims.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> at 81.  We find that such an error occurred regarding both Casas and Correy in that, like Bonilla, Fed. R. Crim.

R. Crim. P. 32 and Bonilla, Judge Cerezo vacated Bonilla's original sentencing hearing because the PSR contained no findings as to the quantities or types of drugs attributable to Bonilla.  Judge Cerezo also issued an order instructing the Probation Office</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">to utilize methods of calculation based on these principles [in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';lveda</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">] and on the evidence presented at trial which is relevant to Mr. Bonilla-Lugo.  Since this case was a lengthy trial, and compliance with this order shall require the Officer to read voluminous trial transcripts, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">as she/(he) must do as to the other defendants waiting sentence</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, a term of forty five (45) days is granted for the U.S. Probation Officer to comply with this order.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">(emphasis added).  On May 1, 2002, Casas requested that his sentencing hearing, scheduled for May 7, 2002, be continued until he received a revised updated PSR containing findings of the quantities or types of drugs attributable to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">At his sentencing, Casas again requested a continuance.  He stated that he had understood Judge Cerezo's order to apply to all the defendants and thought that his PSR \"would be amended to show the [drug] calculations as to specific amounts.\" [2359, 5/7/02, p. 4, l. 5-6].  Casas then protested that he had never received the revised PSR.  The Probation Officer stated that she had applied Judge Cerezo's order only to Bonilla and therefore did not prepare a revised PSR for anyone but Bonilla.  After reading the order, the sentencing judge concluded that it applied only to Bonilla.  The government then explained what evidence it relied upon regarding the quantity of drugs it believed were attributable to Casas.  This explanation was based on information from the government's response to Casas's motion for a continuance.  Casas, however, had not received the government's response, which had been put in the mail on May 3, 2002, two business days before the May 7 sentencing hearing.  Casas's counsel objected to the evidence used by the government, arguing that he should have an opportunity to address the government's evidence with specificity.  The sentencing judge initially denied this objection and began to discuss trial transcripts regarding the quantities of drugs attributable to Casas.</span>\n</p><p>51:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';nez in determining the quantity of drugs attributable to Casas.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  However, after Casas's counsel strenuously objected, the sentencing judge agreed to continue sentencing until 9:30 the following morning.  After Casas's counsel again vigorously protested, the sentencing judge continued the sentencing hearing for three days.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">On May 10, 2002, Casas again requested a continuance in order to have time to dispute the evidence relied upon by the government regarding the drug quantities attributable to Casas.  This request was denied, and Casas was sentenced to 235 months imprisonment.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';11, 2000 order applied to all of the co-defendants, not just Bonilla.  We believe that it did.  First, the language Judge Cerezo used in her order indicates that it applied to all of the defendants.  The order stated that \"compliance with this Order shall require the Officer to read voluminous transcripts, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">as she/(he) must do as to the other defendants awaiting sentence</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Second, consideration of the circumstances surrounding the order bolsters our conclusion that it applied to all of the co-defendants.  All of the co-defendants had been tried before Judge Cerezo and convicted of the same count.  A review of the original PSRs of several of the co-defendants, including Casas, Bonilla and Correy, reveals that they were all identical in that they did not contain findings as to the quantities or types of drugs attributable to the individual defendants.</span>\n</p><p>52:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">As with Bonilla, the offense conduct in the other PSRs was based solely on the overt acts alleged in the indictment as to the entire conspiracy and not evidence in the record, even though the jury did not issue a special verdict or rule on the overt acts alleged in the indictment.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  In other words, all of the PSRs contained the same defect that caused Judge Cerezo to vacate the sentencing hearing of Bonilla, who was the first of the appellants scheduled for sentencing before Judge Cerezo.</span>\n<p>53:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While Bonilla was the first of the appellants scheduled for sentencing before Judge Cerezo, Casas was the first scheduled for sentencing before Judge Laffitte.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Further, these PSRs had been submitted to Judge Cerezo prior to her order on July 11, 2000.  It is highly improbable that Judge Cerezo would have ordered the Probation Office to revise Bonilla's PSR so that it contained individualized drug quantities for Bonilla but did not mean for the Probation Office to do the same for Bonilla's co-defendants who had been convicted of the same count and whose PSRs contained the same defect.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">In light of the order's language and the surrounding circumstances, we conclude that the order applied to all the defendants.  The Probation Office, which failed to deliver the revised PSR to Bonilla, therefore also failed to prepare a revised PSR for Casas.  Like Bonilla, this is contrary to Rule 32(e)(2), in that neither Casas nor his attorney received the updated PSR at least thirty-five days prior to sentencing.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> Fed.

We disagree, essentially for the same reasons that we found the claimed error in Bonilla's case not to be harmless.  We believe this to be true even considering the fact that Casas was given a three-day continuance by the sentencing judge.  In this complex case, which involved a seven-month trial with trial transcripts totaling over 8500 pages, we do not think that three days was enough time for Casas to adequately challenge the government's drug quantity calculations.  Casas should have been given the thirty-five days required by Rule 32(e) to review a revised PSR.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">This violation of Rule 32(e) was a procedural error that would have led us to remand for re-sentencing pre-</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Antonakopoulos</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 399 F.3d 68.  As we stated in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Antonakopoulos</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, such a procedural error will likely provide a basis for remanding unpreserved </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> claims.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Given the violation of Rule 32(e), we believe that there is a reasonable probability that the district court will impose a more favorable sentence on remand.  We base this belief on the fact that, in addition to being sentenced under advisory Guidelines, Casas will have adequate time to review the trial transcripts in order to attempt to rebut the government's claim as to the amount of drugs attributable to him.  We therefore remand Casas's case for re-sentencing.  In doing so, we make no \"suggestion or . . . prediction that the sentence will necessarily be altered.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Heldeman</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 402 F.3d at 224.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:2.2000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">ii.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Correy</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';26.  On May 31 and June 5, Correy filed objections to the amended PSR.</span>\n</p><p>54:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">At his sentencing hearing on May 7, 2002, the government claimed  it had not received objections to the amended PSR.  However, the docket sheet shows entries on both May 31, 2000 and June 5, 2000 for objections by John Correy to his amended PSR.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Like Bonilla's PSR, Correy's amended PSR was based solely on the overt acts alleged in the indictment, and not on any evidence in the record.  In his objections filed June 5, 2000, Correy specifically argued that the PSR should have been based on evidence in the record, and not just the overt acts alleged in the indictment.  All of this occurred before Judge Cerezo's order on July 11, 2000, which, as we have already discussed, applied to all defendants.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';30, 2002, Correy filed a motion to join Nicolai's motion to transfer and noted that he, too, had not yet received a revised PSR.</span>\n</p><p>55:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">It is unclear whether Correy based his objection on Judge Cerezo's order or on the fact that there had been no response to his June 2, 2000 objection that the PSR was based solely on statements in the indictment and not on evidence in the record.  However, we do not believe it makes any difference, as the substance of Correy's objection, that the PSR did not contain any findings as to the quantities of drugs attributable to him individually, remained the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  At his sentencing hearing, Correy told the district court that he still had not received a final PSR.  As with Casas and Bonilla, the district court attempted to get around the problem by referring to a trial transcript that contained witness testimony dealing with Correy's individual drug quantities.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">We believe that, as with Bonilla and Casas, Rule 32(e) was violated in connection with Correy's sentencing.  Correy never received a revised PSR before sentencing, as he should have pursuant to Judge Cerezo's order.  Correy objected to the lack of individualized drug quantity findings and also joined a motion that made an objection based on Rule 32's thirty-five day notice requirement.  While the district court referred to record evidence at Correy's sentencing, this does not change the fact that Correy never received a revised PSR.  Nor are we persuaded that any error resulting from this violation was harmless, for the same reasons that we did not find that the error was harmless in Bonilla's or Casas's case.  Finally, we believe that there is a reasonable probability that the district court will impose a more favorable sentence under advisory Guidelines, as Correy will have adequate time to review the trial transcripts in order to attempt to rebut the government's claim as to the amount of drugs attributable to him.  We therefore remand Correy's case for re-sentencing.</span>\n</p><p>56:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';nez as to drug quantity was not necessarily accepted as credible by the jury.

When Nicolai was indicted in Puerto Rico, he was already serving a sentence of eleven years to life in New York state prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics.  Nicolai was transferred to federal custody in Puerto Rico pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum (\"writ\") issued in October 1996.  At his sentencing on July 31, 2002, Nicolai asked that he be transferred back to New York state prison in order to be closer to his family.  On September 17, 2002, the sentencing judge executed an Amended Judgement of Conviction.  In committing Nicolai to the care of the United States Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\"), the sentencing judge recommended that Nicolai serve his sentence in the state of New York.  The sentencing judge noted that his recommendation was non-binding because \"any decision regarding prison assignment or custody falls squarely within the power of the executive branch.\"  On September 27, 2002, the New York Department of Correctional Services received a letter from the U.S. Attorney requesting that New York release jurisdiction of Nicolai so that he could serve his federal sentence in federal prison.  It complied, and Nicolai is currently in federal prison.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; 2, he must be returned to New York state prison because that is where he was before he was transferred to federal custody pursuant to the writ.  We disagree.  From our review of the record, it appears that Nicolai was brought into federal custody by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, not a detainer.</span>\n</p><p>59:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While Nicolai states that he was moved to Puerto Rico via a \"detainer pursuant to a writ by the District of Puerto Rico,\" he does not point to any evidence that supports this assertion.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  While the use of a detainer invokes the IADA, the use of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum does not.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Mauro</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Beard</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 41 F.3d 1486, 1489 (11th Cir. 1995).

Nor do we agree with appellants' assertion that the delay was caused by the judicial system's inability to cope with a case this size.  From our review of the record, the district court disposed of the co-defendants' numerous motions in a timely manner and moved the case along to trial.  Instead, it appears that delays were due in large part to the resolution of pre-trial matters concerning appellants and their co-defendants.</span>\n</p><p>10:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">We note that four of the appellants -- Nicolai, Correy, Pizarro, and Bonilla -- filed motions to continue trial.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Further, while a case of this size is certainly unwieldy, the joint prosecution of defendants involved in the same drug trafficking conspiracy is justified as a means of serving the efficient administration of justice.

While the delay between conviction and sentence was, again, unusually long in this case, it was not without good reason.  It was necessary for transcripts of the seven-month trial to be prepared and reviewed in order to produce pre-sentence reports (PSRs) for the defendants.  In addition, a number of post-trial motions were filed by appellants and their co-defendants.  Nicolai filed twenty-two motions following his conviction, at least three of which requested continuances or extensions of time.  Pizarro filed seventeen motions, requesting seven continuances or extensions of time.  Neither appellant claims to have asserted a constitutional right to a speedy sentence.  Nor do they explain what prejudice resulted from the delay, except to suggest that they were prejudiced by having to wait to file the instant appeal.  We are not convinced that they were prejudiced, especially since some of the sentencing delay was to give defendants the opportunity to file Rule 29 motions for acquittal and motions for a new trial, which might have mooted the appeal had they been successful.  Thus, we find that the delay between appellants' conviction and sentencing caused no violation of their rights under the Sixth Amendment.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.7000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">c.

The claim is without merit.  The organizer was nonfunctional because its batteries were dead, and rather than risk losing data by changing the batteries, investigators transcribed its contents before it lost power.  The district court considered and overruled objections to admitting the transcribed information, holding that there was no evidence of intentional tampering and that the incomplete record of the contents was a topic appropriate for cross-examination.

The court once again admonished all counsel to behave appropriately.  (TT 9/1/99: 65-73).  Finally, on October 26, the defense raised concerns that the behavior of the prosecutor demonstrated a lack of respect for the court's authority and might lead the jury to conclude that the government attorneys enjoyed more latitude than defense counsel.  The judge was aware of two such instances, one in which she had to admonish the prosecutor to abide by an evidentiary ruling, and another in which the prosecutor threw his pen after receiving an adverse ruling.  She admonished him to keep his behavior in check and to respect the court's authority.  (TT 10/26/99: 175-77).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">The trial judge was in a far better position than we to determine whether the alleged gestures and other behavior occurred, whether they appeared to be intentional or inadvertent, and whether they had any influence on witnesses or the jury.  We will not second-guess her rulings on the record before us.  With regard to those gestures that the court did observe -- nodding at the witnesses, disregarding a ruling, and throwing a pen -- whether they were intentional or not, they were unprofessional and inappropriate.  However, they occurred in the context of a seven-month jury trial, were addressed by admonishments from the court, and, from the record, do not appear to have prejudiced Correy or the other defendants.  Within the overall framework of this lengthy trial, they were unlikely to have affected the outcome of trial.  Thus, they fall short of rendering the trial so unfair as to require a new one.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">In sum, we find that none of the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct was likely to have affected the outcome of the trial, and thus none requires a new trial.

The trial record in this case is of daunting proportions, and we are all too aware that a thorough review is a time-consuming process, but it is not so insurmountable a task as to render the committee's decision to reassign the case an abuse of discretion.

This absence of transcripts initially gives us pause, both because of the amount of unavailable transcripts and because credibility was an important issue in appellants' trial.

(Docket No. 1658).  However, it appears that the transcripts that he wanted were provided pursuant to an order issued by Judge Cerezo on February 29, 2000.  This order instructed the court reporter to prepare transcripts of certain witnesses' testimonies and stated that it had considered Flores's motion.  It appears that Judge Cerezo considered Flores's motion, along with the motions of the other appellants, before ordering the transcripts she felt were relevant to their sentencing.  (Docket No. 1715).</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Second, the original trial judge ordered only the transcripts that she felt were relevant for sentencing the appellants.  (Docket No. 1715).  These transcripts were available to the successor sentencing judge.  Third, the sentencing judge repeatedly stated that he had reviewed the portions of the record pertinent to defendants' sentencing and cited to specific passages of the transcripts in determining the drug quantity attributable to each defendant.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';] the more the case depends on the credibility, and especially the demeanor, of the witnesses, the more a judge needs to do to become adequately familiar with it.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Larios</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 640 F.2d at 943.

Since this case was a lengthy trial, and compliance with this order shall require the Officer to read voluminous trial transcripts, as she/(he) must do as to the other defendants waiting sentence, a term of forty five (45) days is granted for the U.S. Probation Officer to comply with this order.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';10, 2002, before Judge Laffitte.  However, neither Bonilla nor his counsel had received the revised PSR which Judge Cerezo had ordered.</span>\n</p><p>46:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">The Probation Officer confirmed this fact at the sentencing hearing, telling the sentencing judge that \"I was directly ordered by the Honorable Judge Cerezo, and my response was sent directly to her.  I was not ordered to disclose that information to any of the parties.\"  The record does not show any such limitation on disclosure being ordered by Judge Cerezo and, of course, it would be improper for the Probation Office to fail to disclose to counsel a PSR that was to be relied upon by the court.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Bonilla's counsel apprised the sentencing judge of this fact.  The judge, who had received the updated PSR, allowed Bonilla's counsel to read the supplement.  After reading it, Bonilla's counsel asked for more time, stating \"I've read this memorandum, and it's wrong, Your Honor, and I need time to prove that, and I have it in the record.  I can proof (sic) it from the record.\"</span>\n<p>47:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While counsel did not utter the word \"continuance,\" it is obvious from her statement that she was requesting a continuance.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Specifically, Bonilla's counsel insisted that, if she had more time, she could refute the quantity of drugs that the PSR attributed to Bonilla.  The sentencing judge refused to grant a continuance and sentenced Bonilla to 235 months imprisonment.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">\"We ordinarily review the district court's failure to continue the sentencing hearing for abuse of discretion.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';pez</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200033\"><a href=\"/opinion/200033/united-states-v-lopez-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span>, 169 (1st Cir. 2002).

At his sentencing, Pizarro objected that the jury did not make a finding on the issue of drug quantity.

However, we see no distinction between what occurred at Flores's sentencing and what occurred at Pizarro's.  At his sentencing, Flores objected that \"the jury didn't render any sort of special verdict concerning the amounts [of drugs] that were attributable [to Flores].\"  The district court asserted that \"there is no </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> issue,\" to which Flores replied \"we do not concede that.\"  Flores made the same argument that Pizarro made at his sentencing: that because the jury did not make a finding as to drug quantity he could not be sentenced above the default statutory maximum based on findings made by the judge.</span>\n</p><p>49:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">In his </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> argument, Nicolai also objected that \"the jury was not given a special verdict and that jury did not come back with specific quantities.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  As with Pizarro, the district judge understood the argument as an </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> argument and replied that there were no </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> issue.  Also as with Pizarro, Flores expressed a belief that there was an </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> issue when he stated that he did not concede </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Apprendi</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">.

There could very well be other reasons the district court would have departed under discretionary guidelines.  We note that Flores has argued that his sentence was enhanced above the maximum sentence authorized by jury fact-finding or admitted facts, and that, in such a situation, a judge's \"'factual certainty alone' in support of such enhancements 'would not be sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, acting under an advisory Guidelines system, would have applied the same sentence on the basis of those factors.'\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Fornia-Castillo</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201662\"><a href=\"/opinion/201662/united-states-v-fornia-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';zquez-Rivera</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 407 F.3d at 489-90).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Further, the district judge sentenced Flores at the low end of the guideline range, rejecting the government's request for a sentence at the upper-end of the guideline range.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';zquez-Rivera</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 407 F.3d at 490 (stating that \"our doubt . . . is enhanced by the fact that, while the applicable Guidelines constrained the sentencing judge to the upper margin of sentences available under [the relevant statute], the sentence he chose was at the low end of that margin\").

We find that such an error occurred regarding both Casas and Correy in that, like Bonilla, Fed. R. Crim.

R. Crim. P. 32 and Bonilla, Judge Cerezo vacated Bonilla's original sentencing hearing because the PSR contained no findings as to the quantities or types of drugs attributable to Bonilla.  Judge Cerezo also issued an order instructing the Probation Office</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">to utilize methods of calculation based on these principles [in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';lveda</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">] and on the evidence presented at trial which is relevant to Mr. Bonilla-Lugo.  Since this case was a lengthy trial, and compliance with this order shall require the Officer to read voluminous trial transcripts, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">as she/(he) must do as to the other defendants waiting sentence</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, a term of forty five (45) days is granted for the U.S. Probation Officer to comply with this order.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">(emphasis added).  On May 1, 2002, Casas requested that his sentencing hearing, scheduled for May 7, 2002, be continued until he received a revised updated PSR containing findings of the quantities or types of drugs attributable to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">At his sentencing, Casas again requested a continuance.  He stated that he had understood Judge Cerezo's order to apply to all the defendants and thought that his PSR \"would be amended to show the [drug] calculations as to specific amounts.\" [2359, 5/7/02, p. 4, l. 5-6].  Casas then protested that he had never received the revised PSR.  The Probation Officer stated that she had applied Judge Cerezo's order only to Bonilla and therefore did not prepare a revised PSR for anyone but Bonilla.  After reading the order, the sentencing judge concluded that it applied only to Bonilla.  The government then explained what evidence it relied upon regarding the quantity of drugs it believed were attributable to Casas.  This explanation was based on information from the government's response to Casas's motion for a continuance.  Casas, however, had not received the government's response, which had been put in the mail on May 3, 2002, two business days before the May 7 sentencing hearing.  Casas's counsel objected to the evidence used by the government, arguing that he should have an opportunity to address the government's evidence with specificity.  The sentencing judge initially denied this objection and began to discuss trial transcripts regarding the quantities of drugs attributable to Casas.</span>\n</p><p>51:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';nez in determining the quantity of drugs attributable to Casas.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  However, after Casas's counsel strenuously objected, the sentencing judge agreed to continue sentencing until 9:30 the following morning.  After Casas's counsel again vigorously protested, the sentencing judge continued the sentencing hearing for three days.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">On May 10, 2002, Casas again requested a continuance in order to have time to dispute the evidence relied upon by the government regarding the drug quantities attributable to Casas.  This request was denied, and Casas was sentenced to 235 months imprisonment.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';11, 2000 order applied to all of the co-defendants, not just Bonilla.  We believe that it did.  First, the language Judge Cerezo used in her order indicates that it applied to all of the defendants.  The order stated that \"compliance with this Order shall require the Officer to read voluminous transcripts, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">as she/(he) must do as to the other defendants awaiting sentence</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Second, consideration of the circumstances surrounding the order bolsters our conclusion that it applied to all of the co-defendants.  All of the co-defendants had been tried before Judge Cerezo and convicted of the same count.  A review of the original PSRs of several of the co-defendants, including Casas, Bonilla and Correy, reveals that they were all identical in that they did not contain findings as to the quantities or types of drugs attributable to the individual defendants.</span>\n</p><p>52:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">As with Bonilla, the offense conduct in the other PSRs was based solely on the overt acts alleged in the indictment as to the entire conspiracy and not evidence in the record, even though the jury did not issue a special verdict or rule on the overt acts alleged in the indictment.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  In other words, all of the PSRs contained the same defect that caused Judge Cerezo to vacate the sentencing hearing of Bonilla, who was the first of the appellants scheduled for sentencing before Judge Cerezo.</span>\n<p>53:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While Bonilla was the first of the appellants scheduled for sentencing before Judge Cerezo, Casas was the first scheduled for sentencing before Judge Laffitte.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Further, these PSRs had been submitted to Judge Cerezo prior to her order on July 11, 2000.  It is highly improbable that Judge Cerezo would have ordered the Probation Office to revise Bonilla's PSR so that it contained individualized drug quantities for Bonilla but did not mean for the Probation Office to do the same for Bonilla's co-defendants who had been convicted of the same count and whose PSRs contained the same defect.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">In light of the order's language and the surrounding circumstances, we conclude that the order applied to all the defendants.  The Probation Office, which failed to deliver the revised PSR to Bonilla, therefore also failed to prepare a revised PSR for Casas.  Like Bonilla, this is contrary to Rule 32(e)(2), in that neither Casas nor his attorney received the updated PSR at least thirty-five days prior to sentencing.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e)(2).</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">At oral argument, the government argued that any error was harmless.  We disagree, essentially for the same reasons that we found the claimed error in Bonilla's case not to be harmless.  We believe this to be true even considering the fact that Casas was given a three-day continuance by the sentencing judge.  In this complex case, which involved a seven-month trial with trial transcripts totaling over 8500 pages, we do not think that three days was enough time for Casas to adequately challenge the government's drug quantity calculations.  Casas should have been given the thirty-five days required by Rule 32(e) to review a revised PSR.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">This violation of Rule 32(e) was a procedural error that would have led us to remand for re-sentencing pre-</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Antonakopoulos</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>.  As we stated in </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Antonakopoulos</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, such a procedural error will likely provide a basis for remanding unpreserved </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Booker</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> claims.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Id.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Given the violation of Rule 32(e), we believe that there is a reasonable probability that the district court will impose a more favorable sentence on remand.  We base this belief on the fact that, in addition to being sentenced under advisory Guidelines, Casas will have adequate time to review the trial transcripts in order to attempt to rebut the government's claim as to the amount of drugs attributable to him.  We therefore remand Casas's case for re-sentencing.  In doing so, we make no \"suggestion or . . . prediction that the sentence will necessarily be altered.\"  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Heldeman</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, 402 F.3d at 224.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:2.2000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">ii.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Correy</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';26.  On May 31 and June 5, Correy filed objections to the amended PSR.</span>\n</p><p>54:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">At his sentencing hearing on May 7, 2002, the government claimed  it had not received objections to the amended PSR.  However, the docket sheet shows entries on both May 31, 2000 and June 5, 2000 for objections by John Correy to his amended PSR.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  Like Bonilla's PSR, Correy's amended PSR was based solely on the overt acts alleged in the indictment, and not on any evidence in the record.  In his objections filed June 5, 2000, Correy specifically argued that the PSR should have been based on evidence in the record, and not just the overt acts alleged in the indictment.  All of this occurred before Judge Cerezo's order on July 11, 2000, which, as we have already discussed, applied to all defendants.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';30, 2002, Correy filed a motion to join Nicolai's motion to transfer and noted that he, too, had not yet received a revised PSR.</span>\n</p><p>55:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">It is unclear whether Correy based his objection on Judge Cerezo's order or on the fact that there had been no response to his June 2, 2000 objection that the PSR was based solely on statements in the indictment and not on evidence in the record.  However, we do not believe it makes any difference, as the substance of Correy's objection, that the PSR did not contain any findings as to the quantities of drugs attributable to him individually, remained the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  At his sentencing hearing, Correy told the district court that he still had not received a final PSR.  As with Casas and Bonilla, the district court attempted to get around the problem by referring to a trial transcript that contained witness testimony dealing with Correy's individual drug quantities.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">We believe that, as with Bonilla and Casas, Rule 32(e) was violated in connection with Correy's sentencing.  Correy never received a revised PSR before sentencing, as he should have pursuant to Judge Cerezo's order.  Correy objected to the lack of individualized drug quantity findings and also joined a motion that made an objection based on Rule 32's thirty-five day notice requirement.  While the district court referred to record evidence at Correy's sentencing, this does not change the fact that Correy never received a revised PSR.  Nor are we persuaded that any error resulting from this violation was harmless, for the same reasons that we did not find that the error was harmless in Bonilla's or Casas's case.  Finally, we believe that there is a reasonable probability that the district court will impose a more favorable sentence under advisory Guidelines, as Correy will have adequate time to review the trial transcripts in order to attempt to rebut the government's claim as to the amount of drugs attributable to him.  We therefore remand Correy's case for re-sentencing.</span>\n</p><p>56:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';nez as to drug quantity was not necessarily accepted as credible by the jury.

When Nicolai was indicted in Puerto Rico, he was already serving a sentence of eleven years to life in New York state prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics.  Nicolai was transferred to federal custody in Puerto Rico pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum (\"writ\") issued in October 1996.  At his sentencing on July 31, 2002, Nicolai asked that he be transferred back to New York state prison in order to be closer to his family.  On September 17, 2002, the sentencing judge executed an Amended Judgement of Conviction.  In committing Nicolai to the care of the United States Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\"), the sentencing judge recommended that Nicolai serve his sentence in the state of New York.  The sentencing judge noted that his recommendation was non-binding because \"any decision regarding prison assignment or custody falls squarely within the power of the executive branch.\"  On September 27, 2002, the New York Department of Correctional Services received a letter from the U.S. Attorney requesting that New York release jurisdiction of Nicolai so that he could serve his federal sentence in federal prison.  It complied, and Nicolai is currently in federal prison.</span>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; 2, he must be returned to New York state prison because that is where he was before he was transferred to federal custody pursuant to the writ.  We disagree.  From our review of the record, it appears that Nicolai was brought into federal custody by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, not a detainer.</span>\n</p><p>59:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:0.0000inch;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">While Nicolai states that he was moved to Puerto Rico via a \"detainer pursuant to a writ by the District of Puerto Rico,\" he does not point to any evidence that supports this assertion.</span>\n</p>\n<p/>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">  While the use of a detainer invokes the IADA, the use of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum does not.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Mauro</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Beard</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70136\"><a href=\"/opinion/70136/united-states-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1486</span></a></span>, 1489 (11th Cir. 1995).  Therefore, the IADA is inapplicable.</span>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;text-indent:1.0000inch;line-height:2.000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">We note further that, generally, a state that sends a prisoner in state custody to federal authorities pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum retains jurisdiction over the prisoner because the prisoner is merely \"on loan\" to the federal authorities.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">e.g.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Jake</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Herschberger</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">United States</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Evans</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New'; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Thomas</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Brewer</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554940\"><a href=\"/opinion/554940/james-ray-thomas-v-rd-brewer-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1361</span></a></span>, 1366-67 (9th Cir. 1991).  However, in the instant case, the federal and state authorities reached an agreement allowing the United States to keep Nicolai in federal prison.  </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">See</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Weekes</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\"> v. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">Fleming</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: 'Courier New';\">, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778968\"><a href=\"/opinion/778968/johnny-horton-weekes-v-le-fleming-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span>, 1181 (10th Cir. 2002) (stating that a state may choose \"to relinquish or transfer its primary custody to the United States\").
