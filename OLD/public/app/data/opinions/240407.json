In Senate Report No. 1013, March 16, 1948, United States Code Congressional Service, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., 1948, vol. 2, we find the following significant expressions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally, a power of appointment is not an `interest in property'. * * *\" [Page 1225.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The amount of the marital deduction is determined by the value at the date of the decedent's death of the interest in property which passes or has passed to the surviving spouse, * * *.\" [Page 1225.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In determining whether an interest in property is a terminable interest and whether the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) [supra] are met, the situation is viewed as at the date of the decedent's death * * *.\" [Page 1232.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The election of the executor to determine the value of the gross estate as of a date subsequent to the decedent's death, as provided in section 811(j) of the code, does not extend to such later date the time for determining the character of the interest passing to the surviving spouse and its deductibility under subparagraph (B).\" [Page 1232.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the foregoing legal principles to the case at bar, we cannot say that on November 1, 1949, the date of Mr. Shedd's death, it could have been foretold with any degree of certainty that Mrs. Shedd would file written instructions with the executor-trustee on October 16, 1950, exercising her power of appointment in favor of herself. So far as the record shows, it took the widow nearly a year to make up her mind. The scales could well have tipped the other way. There is no legal presumption that Mrs. Shedd would \"reach out her hand\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Men &#8212; and women too &#8212; have been known to decline bequests. As recently as June 29, 1956, <i>The Sacramento Bee</i> carried a local news story to the effect that Mrs. Doris Nemetz, of Milwaukee, Wis., had \"refused an outright gift of $5,766.54 * * * her share of the estate left by her father\".

Bowers, 1930, 281 U.S. 376, 378, 50 S.Ct. 336, 337, 74 L.Ed. 916, in which Mr. Justice Holmes stated that \"The income that is subject to a man's unfettered command and that he is free to enjoy at his own option may be taxed to him as his income, whether he sees fit to enjoy it or not.\" But the learned justice was there dealing with an <i>income</i> tax, not an <i>estate</i> tax. That fact alone at once distinguishes <i>Corliss</i> from the case at bar. As we have seen, an estate tax is <i>sui generis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it was Mr. Justice Holmes who, in Edwards v. Slocum, supra, followed Hanson's dictum, quoted with approval in Knowlton v. Moore, supra, to the effect that an estate tax is not upon \"`the interest to which some person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceased by reason of the death.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finality of death in this as in other respects is strikingly indicated by Hanson's careful use of tense-forms. He refers to \"the interest to which some person succeeds,\" using the <i>present</i> tense in connection with the <i>successor's</i> interest, which may be increased later by some act of his own, or otherwise. But Hanson employs the <i>past</i> tense in speaking of \"the interest which ceased by reason of the death.\" And it is <i>that</i> interest which the <i>estate</i> tax, as contradistinguished from a <i>succession</i> tax, reaches. Death freezes the estate's tax obligation into immutability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with an overwhelming weight of authority contrary to its position, the petitioner grudgingly admits the soundness of its adversary's contention \"that the controlling consideration is not what happened after the decedent dies, but what existed at the time of his death\". The petitioner comments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally speaking we agree * * * But the rule stated has striking, and necessary, exceptions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the petitioner has recourse to the \"yes-but\" type of argument, so frequently heard from unsuccessful litigants below: <i>\"Yes,</i> but <i>our</i> case is different: the rules don't apply to <i>us.</i>\" In the present instance, at least, we are not impressed with that sort of reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we hold that the question of whether Mrs. Shedd's interest was terminable and the estate disentitled to the marital deduction, must be viewed <i>as of the time that Mr. Shedd died.</i> The fact that she later exercised her power is immaterial. As of the date of her husband's death, Mrs. Shedd's interest in one-half of the corpus of the trust estate was \"terminable\", and his estate was therefore not entitled to the marital deduction claimed under &#167; 812(e) (1) (A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>The Two Arizona Cases Are Not in Point.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner places great stress upon two cases decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona &#8212; In re Anderson's Will, 16 Ariz. 185, 141 P. 723, and In re Hayward's Estate, 57 Ariz. 51, 110 P.2d 956, hereinafter <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Hayward,</i> respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) The Anderson Case</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anderson, the wife's will, after describing the property, granted, bargained, and sold it to her husband, if he was to survive her, \"To have and to hold unto the said Peter Anderson in life rent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> subject to the terms of the trust hereinafter written.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The will read in part as follows [16 Ariz. 185, 141 P. 724]:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"`Third.

On the death of the survivor, his or her whole estate shall be divided equally share and share alike among the nearest heirs at law of the parties of the first and second parts and a like share shall also become the property of the said Violet Thompson should she then be alive.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Arizona held that the above words, as well as the will itself, transferred at once the fee simple to the husband. The court used the following language: \"If established and admitted to probate as such will, then the question first to arise would be whether, under the terms of the will, Peter Anderson would take the residue of the property, after setting aside the sums to Blom and Violet Thompson and paying all the debts, as a life estate, or would he take the entire estate in fee simple? It is clear that the survivor, Peter Anderson, would take a fee-simple title both under the terms of the will and under the express provisions of the statute (paragraph 723, Rev.St.Ariz.1901) [<i>infra</i>]. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Peter Anderson, the survivor, could not grant, bargain, sell and convey the property during his lifetime, according to the express terms of the will, if he acquired only a life estate. Under the statute, and also under the common-law rule of construction, Peter Anderson would take a fee-simple estate in the lands through the will. The will in terms devises that estate, and the statute would give him that estate. From the terms of the will the clear intention of the testator was to transfer a fee-simple estate to the survivor, and that clear intention must prevail, if the instrument is established as the will of Isabella Anderson.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Arizona statute referred to in the above excerpt read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Every estate in lands which shall hereafter be granted, conveyed or devised to one, although other words heretofore necessary at common law to transfer an estate in fee simple be not added, shall be deemed a fee simple, if a less estate be not limited by express words or do not appear to have been granted, conveyed or devised by construction or operation of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For several reasons, Anderson is not controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in the instant case, all of Mr. Shedd's property &#8212; real, personal, and mixed &#8212; was his \"sole and separate property\". In Anderson, all the property of the husband and wife was community property. The Supreme Court's opinion in that case bears internal evidence that this fact exerted an influence upon the thinking of that tribunal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us glance at the facts in the Anderson case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Isabella Anderson died childless on July 20, 1903. Peter Anderson, the husband, survived her. After the death of Isabella, Peter continued in the sole possession and control of all the property involved, until his death on August 5, 1911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, under the community property law of Arizona, the spouses own their common property, and the wife's interest is equal to that of the husband's. Coe v. Winchester, 1934, 43 Ariz. 500, 33 P. 2d 286, 287. The wife has a \"vested right\" in the community property. Grimditch v. Grimditch, 1951, 71 Ariz. 198, 225 P.2d 489, 492.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent to which the community character of the property influenced the State Supreme Court's holding in <i>Anderson</i> is indicated by the following paragraph of the opinion, which the petitioner has neglected to quote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The instrument, considered as a whole, may be, and it is, both a <i>mutual</i> or <i>reciprocal</i> will of the parties, and a separate will of the survivor. That part of the instrument preceding the `fourth' paragraph of the conditions of trust deals with the <i>community property</i> making testamentary disposition of the said property. That part of the instrument preceding the terms of the trust is in form an absolute deed from the husband to the wife, and from the wife to the husband. The property purported to be conveyed by the husband to the wife is different in description from the property purported to be conveyed by the wife to the husband, but a general description of `all personal property and other real estate owned by' each party at the time of his or her death is added to the specific description of the real property in each instance, and, <i>all property owned being conceded to be community</i> <i>property,</i> the difference in description is immaterial to the disposition of this case. The conveyance is declared to have been made `for the disposition of all their property that <i>they or either of them</i> may own at the date of their death.'\" 16 Ariz. at page 189, 141 P. at page 724. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, there was no mutuality or reciprocity in the will of Harrison Shedd. No community property was involved. The facts are simply different from those of <i>Anderson.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Anderson</i> in no way involved a life estate plus a power of appointment, the law concerning which power we have already discussed at considerable length. <i>Anderson</i> is simply a fairly typical instance of a situation that occurs when a life tenant is given the full right to sell or expend the corpus of property. In that case, a remainder over is repugnant to the provisions relating to the life estate. No such situation exists here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Anderson</i> was bottomed primarily upon the necessity of <i>consistency</i> in the interpretation of a legal document. This is spelled out for us in the following sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Peter Anderson, the survivor, could not grant, bargain, sell, and convey the property during his lifetime, according to the express terms of the will, <i>if he acquired only a life estate.\"</i> [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above observation by the Supreme Court of Arizona was apparently evoked by the fact that, in one part of the will, Peter Anderson is devised a \"life rent\", or life estate, in the property. Then in Paragraph Third, Peter, as the survivor, is given the remainder of the estate as \"`[his] sole property'\", with \"`the power to dispose of any or all of said real estate and personal property and grant, bargain, sell and convey the same'\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How can a person &#8212; so runs the Arizona argument &#8212; acquire only a life estate, and at the same time sell or otherwise dispose of the property?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a second inconsistency, in Paragraph Third itself, that does not seem to have been noticed either by the State Supreme Court or by counsel here. After being given the right to dispose of the property, he is <i>also</i> &#8212; and apparently at the same time &#8212; to <i>enjoy</i> it during his lifetime. The language \"`convey the same <i>and</i> enjoy the same during * * * his lifetime'\" is, on its face, inconsistent. Probably the disjunctive \"<i>or</i>\" rather that the conjunctive \"<i>and</i>\" was intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Be that as it may, State Supreme Court thought that the various broad and sweeping terms of conveyance &#8212; not restricted to the power of sale &#8212; used in that case were <i>inconsistent</i> with the creation of only a life estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there is no such inconsistency. The wife is given the power to appoint, either by written instructions during her lifetime, or by will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled, of course, that the legal effect of the survivor's instructions or testament is determined by <i>state</i> law. But <i>before</i> the widow makes her election, there is a <i>vacuum,</i> so far as state law is concerned. And, as we have seen, that vacuum is filled, <i>at the instant of the husband's death,</i> by the Federal taxing power, which looks not to what the widow <i>may</i> do, but to what she has done, which here was exactly nothing. In the instant case, her period of inaction continued for an entire year. Is the Federal Government to be deprived of its fisc in the face of such inaction? If she can wait one year, she could wait two, three, five years before making her decision, all the while assuming that her husband's estate will be exempt from paying a tax on her \"interest\" in that estate in case she finally makes up her mind to \"reach out her hand\" and exercise her power of appointment to herself. How long must the tax collector cool his heels in the executor's anteroom?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>(b) The Hayward Case</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we should point out that the petitioner has slightly misconceived the facts of the <i>Hayward</i> case. In its brief, it repeatedly refers to the \"testatrix\". Although there <i>was</i> a testatrix in that case, the will around which the controversy centered, and from which the petitioner quotes in its brief, was that of John Watson Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Briefly, the pertinent facts were these:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Theodora L. Hayward, hereinafter <i>Hayward,</i> a resident of Colorado, died in that State in 1939. Her will was admitted to probate in Colorado, and her executor applied to an Arizona Superior Court for ancillary letters, representing that at the time of her death she \"owned an undivided one-half interest in the residue of the estate of * * * Thompson,\" at that time being probated in that court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Thompson will bequeathed the residue of his estate to Hayward and to another niece, Winifred Van Hagen, \"in equal shares, and if either of them shall have died before my decease, without issue living at the time of my death, then her share shall pass to my said sister [and others], or the survivor or survivors of them, share and share alike.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since both nieces outlived the testator, each inherited one-half of the residue of the Thompson estate. One of the questions raised was whether under the will Hayward's one-half interest died with her, and another was whether before her death she had voluntarily created a trust of her interest in the estate, with Van Hagen as the beneficiary. The trial court decided both questions in the negative, and directed that letters ancillary issue to Hayward's executor. The contesting heirs appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson's will contained the following closing statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is my wish, though this is not a restriction or a limitation upon the use and enjoyment of the legacies and bequests herein made, that my estate, after the payment of my debts, * * * shall be kept among the descendants of my late father and mother.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court inquired into the nature and extent of the interest Hayward acquired in the Arizona property under the Thompson will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' contention was that when the will was properly construed it gave Hayward a fee in the Arizona property, subject to an executory devise vesting in the appellants immediately upon Hayward's death without issue. The Court pointed out that the implication in the will was clear that if either Hayward or Van Hagen should have living issue at the time of Thompson's death, although she be not then alive, her portion would pass to such living issue. But neither niece had died at the time of Thompson's death, and the contingency of living issue had failed; hence, by apt and direct language, the appellants were eliminated as devisees. They were to take Hayward's portion only if she should die before Thompson without issue living at the time of Thompson's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, however, further contended that they were made devisees by the final statement in Thompson's will, already quoted. They took the position that the testator used the word \"wish\" in a testamentary sense and not a precatory sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held against such a view, saying [57 Ariz. 51, 110 P.2d 960]:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We think the rule stated in 19 American Jurisprudence 575, section 120, is the one controlling the situation here. It reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"`The general rule is well established that whenever an estate is given to a person generally or indefinitely with an unlimited power of disposition annexed, invariably the absolute fee is vested in the first taker, and an executory limitation over is repugnant and void. * * *'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Arizona held that \"the gift of the Arizona property to Theodora L. Hayward gave her a fee simple title to the property, with the right and power of disposition as she saw fit, and that the `wish' expressed in the will was merely precatory and therefore did not have the effect of destroying the gift.\" 110 P.2d at page 960.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have summarized Hayward at such length so as to make evident its utter inapplicability to the case at bar. There was no suggestion &#8212; much less outright mention &#8212; of a power of appointment. Even the appellants conceded that the will gave Hayward a fee, subject to an executory devise vesting in them immediately after Hayward's death without issue. The terms of the will plainly showed that Hayward received one-half of Thompson's residual estate, subject only to the condition &#8212; which did not occur &#8212; that if she predeceased him without issue living at the time of his death, the property would go to others. In <i>Hayward,</i> there was no vacuum, no period during which her rights would be <i>in suspenso</i> until she made up her mind. Hayward's title came into being immediately, under the ancient French legal maxim, \"<i>Le mort saisit le vif</i>\" (\"The dead invests the living\"). In the present case, however, Mrs. Shedd's title, as we have seen, most assuredly did <i>not</i> come into being at the instant of her husband's death. At that instant, she acquired no \"estate\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Anderson</i> and <i>Hayward</i> simply are not in point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were to assume that <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Hayward</i> are in point &#8212; which we do not believe &#8212; they are not controlling here. The legislative history of &#167; 812(e) indicates that Congress did not intend its tax-levying powers, under that section at least, to be subjected to the vagaries of state legislation. In Senate Report No. 1013, op. cit., 2 U.S.Code Cong.Serv.1948, p. 1229, we find the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Subparagraph (B) is intended to be all encompassing with respect to various kinds of contingencies and conditions.

Any theory that the interest which she could have taken under the local law did pass to her in such a case and was used by her to purchase the interest under the will is contrary to the intended application of this section.\" [Page 1233.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>There Was No \"Substantial Compliance\" with</i> &#167; <i>812(e) (1) (F).</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner contends that, even assuming that only a power of appointment over property actually placed in trust was conferred upon Mrs. Shedd, the estate is nevertheless entitled to the marital deduction, under &#167; 812(e) (1) (F), supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section, it will be recalled, provides that if, under the terms of the trust the surviving spouse is entitled for life to <i>ALL</i> the income from the corpus of the trust, etc., the estate is entitled to the marital deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner argues that \"where a spouse receives two-thirds of the income for life from an <i>entire</i> residue and the power to appoint <i>one-half</i> of that residue, she has received all and in fact something more than the minimum that the law requires in order to entitle the estate to the marital deduction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court held that \"an income interest in and a power of appointment over a part of the corpus of a single trust does not satisfy the requirements of section 812(e) (1) (F) as written, and therefore the deduction is not allowable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree.

It was in no way passing upon the nature of the title, if any, that Mrs. Shedd took <i>as of the date of Mr. Shedd's death,</i> which, as we have seen, is the crucial time here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, the State Court's decree specifically and unequivocally recites that it is being made under Mr. Shedd's will and the codicils thereto, \"<i>and in accordance with the exercise by Mary Redding Shedd of the power of appointment granted to her under the Second Codicil,</i>\" etc. [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus see that it was the \"exercise\" of the power, and not the testamentary <i>grant</i> thereof, that the Arizona Court considered determinative.

Bowers, 1930, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101568\"><a href=\"/opinion/101568/corliss-v-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>, 378, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span>, in which Mr. Justice Holmes stated that \"The income that is subject to a man's unfettered command and that he is free to enjoy at his own option may be taxed to him as his income, whether he sees fit to enjoy it or not.\" But the learned justice was there dealing with an <i>income</i> tax, not an <i>estate</i> tax. That fact alone at once distinguishes <i>Corliss</i> from the case at bar. As we have seen, an estate tax is <i>sui generis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it was Mr. Justice Holmes who, in Edwards v. Slocum, supra, followed Hanson's dictum, quoted with approval in Knowlton v. Moore, supra, to the effect that an estate tax is not upon \"`the interest to which some person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceased by reason of the death.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finality of death in this as in other respects is strikingly indicated by Hanson's careful use of tense-forms. He refers to \"the interest to which some person succeeds,\" using the <i>present</i> tense in connection with the <i>successor's</i> interest, which may be increased later by some act of his own, or otherwise. But Hanson employs the <i>past</i> tense in speaking of \"the interest which ceased by reason of the death.\" And it is <i>that</i> interest which the <i>estate</i> tax, as contradistinguished from a <i>succession</i> tax, reaches. Death freezes the estate's tax obligation into immutability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with an overwhelming weight of authority contrary to its position, the petitioner grudgingly admits the soundness of its adversary's contention \"that the controlling consideration is not what happened after the decedent dies, but what existed at the time of his death\". The petitioner comments:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally speaking we agree * * * But the rule stated has striking, and necessary, exceptions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, the petitioner has recourse to the \"yes-but\" type of argument, so frequently heard from unsuccessful litigants below: <i>\"Yes,</i> but <i>our</i> case is different: the rules don't apply to <i>us.</i>\" In the present instance, at least, we are not impressed with that sort of reasoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, we hold that the question of whether Mrs. Shedd's interest was terminable and the estate disentitled to the marital deduction, must be viewed <i>as of the time that Mr. Shedd died.</i> The fact that she later exercised her power is immaterial. As of the date of her husband's death, Mrs. Shedd's interest in one-half of the corpus of the trust estate was \"terminable\", and his estate was therefore not entitled to the marital deduction claimed under &#167; 812(e) (1) (A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>The Two Arizona Cases Are Not in Point.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner places great stress upon two cases decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona &#8212; In re Anderson's Will, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></span>, and In re Hayward's Estate, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></span>, hereinafter <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Hayward,</i> respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) The Anderson Case</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anderson, the wife's will, after describing the property, granted, bargained, and sold it to her husband, if he was to survive her, \"To have and to hold unto the said Peter Anderson in life rent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> subject to the terms of the trust hereinafter written.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The will read in part as follows [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span>, 141 P. 724]:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"`Third.

The court used the following language: \"If established and admitted to probate as such will, then the question first to arise would be whether, under the terms of the will, Peter Anderson would take the residue of the property, after setting aside the sums to Blom and Violet Thompson and paying all the debts, as a life estate, or would he take the entire estate in fee simple? It is clear that the survivor, Peter Anderson, would take a fee-simple title both under the terms of the will and under the express provisions of the statute (paragraph 723, Rev.St.Ariz.1901) [<i>infra</i>]. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Peter Anderson, the survivor, could not grant, bargain, sell and convey the property during his lifetime, according to the express terms of the will, if he acquired only a life estate. Under the statute, and also under the common-law rule of construction, Peter Anderson would take a fee-simple estate in the lands through the will. The will in terms devises that estate, and the statute would give him that estate. From the terms of the will the clear intention of the testator was to transfer a fee-simple estate to the survivor, and that clear intention must prevail, if the instrument is established as the will of Isabella Anderson.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Arizona statute referred to in the above excerpt read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Every estate in lands which shall hereafter be granted, conveyed or devised to one, although other words heretofore necessary at common law to transfer an estate in fee simple be not added, shall be deemed a fee simple, if a less estate be not limited by express words or do not appear to have been granted, conveyed or devised by construction or operation of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For several reasons, Anderson is not controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in the instant case, all of Mr. Shedd's property &#8212; real, personal, and mixed &#8212; was his \"sole and separate property\". In Anderson, all the property of the husband and wife was community property.

That part of the instrument preceding the `fourth' paragraph of the conditions of trust deals with the <i>community property</i> making testamentary disposition of the said property. That part of the instrument preceding the terms of the trust is in form an absolute deed from the husband to the wife, and from the wife to the husband. The property purported to be conveyed by the husband to the wife is different in description from the property purported to be conveyed by the wife to the husband, but a general description of `all personal property and other real estate owned by' each party at the time of his or her death is added to the specific description of the real property in each instance, and, <i>all property owned being conceded to be community</i> <i>property,</i> the difference in description is immaterial to the disposition of this case. The conveyance is declared to have been made `for the disposition of all their property that <i>they or either of them</i> may own at the date of their death.'\" 16 Ariz. at page 189, 141 P. at page 724. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case before us, there was no mutuality or reciprocity in the will of Harrison Shedd. No community property was involved. The facts are simply different from those of <i>Anderson.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Anderson</i> in no way involved a life estate plus a power of appointment, the law concerning which power we have already discussed at considerable length. <i>Anderson</i> is simply a fairly typical instance of a situation that occurs when a life tenant is given the full right to sell or expend the corpus of property. In that case, a remainder over is repugnant to the provisions relating to the life estate. No such situation exists here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, <i>Anderson</i> was bottomed primarily upon the necessity of <i>consistency</i> in the interpretation of a legal document. This is spelled out for us in the following sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Peter Anderson, the survivor, could not grant, bargain, sell, and convey the property during his lifetime, according to the express terms of the will, <i>if he acquired only a life estate.\"</i> [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above observation by the Supreme Court of Arizona was apparently evoked by the fact that, in one part of the will, Peter Anderson is devised a \"life rent\", or life estate, in the property. Then in Paragraph Third, Peter, as the survivor, is given the remainder of the estate as \"`[his] sole property'\", with \"`the power to dispose of any or all of said real estate and personal property and grant, bargain, sell and convey the same'\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How can a person &#8212; so runs the Arizona argument &#8212; acquire only a life estate, and at the same time sell or otherwise dispose of the property?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a second inconsistency, in Paragraph Third itself, that does not seem to have been noticed either by the State Supreme Court or by counsel here. After being given the right to dispose of the property, he is <i>also</i> &#8212; and apparently at the same time &#8212; to <i>enjoy</i> it during his lifetime. The language \"`convey the same <i>and</i> enjoy the same during * * * his lifetime'\" is, on its face, inconsistent. Probably the disjunctive \"<i>or</i>\" rather that the conjunctive \"<i>and</i>\" was intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Be that as it may, State Supreme Court thought that the various broad and sweeping terms of conveyance &#8212; not restricted to the power of sale &#8212; used in that case were <i>inconsistent</i> with the creation of only a life estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there is no such inconsistency. The wife is given the power to appoint, either by written instructions during her lifetime, or by will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is settled, of course, that the legal effect of the survivor's instructions or testament is determined by <i>state</i> law. But <i>before</i> the widow makes her election, there is a <i>vacuum,</i> so far as state law is concerned. And, as we have seen, that vacuum is filled, <i>at the instant of the husband's death,</i> by the Federal taxing power, which looks not to what the widow <i>may</i> do, but to what she has done, which here was exactly nothing. In the instant case, her period of inaction continued for an entire year. Is the Federal Government to be deprived of its fisc in the face of such inaction? If she can wait one year, she could wait two, three, five years before making her decision, all the while assuming that her husband's estate will be exempt from paying a tax on her \"interest\" in that estate in case she finally makes up her mind to \"reach out her hand\" and exercise her power of appointment to herself. How long must the tax collector cool his heels in the executor's anteroom?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>(b) The Hayward Case</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we should point out that the petitioner has slightly misconceived the facts of the <i>Hayward</i> case. In its brief, it repeatedly refers to the \"testatrix\". Although there <i>was</i> a testatrix in that case, the will around which the controversy centered, and from which the petitioner quotes in its brief, was that of John Watson Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Briefly, the pertinent facts were these:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Theodora L. Hayward, hereinafter <i>Hayward,</i> a resident of Colorado, died in that State in 1939. Her will was admitted to probate in Colorado, and her executor applied to an Arizona Superior Court for ancillary letters, representing that at the time of her death she \"owned an undivided one-half interest in the residue of the estate of * * * Thompson,\" at that time being probated in that court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Thompson will bequeathed the residue of his estate to Hayward and to another niece, Winifred Van Hagen, \"in equal shares, and if either of them shall have died before my decease, without issue living at the time of my death, then her share shall pass to my said sister [and others], or the survivor or survivors of them, share and share alike.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since both nieces outlived the testator, each inherited one-half of the residue of the Thompson estate. One of the questions raised was whether under the will Hayward's one-half interest died with her, and another was whether before her death she had voluntarily created a trust of her interest in the estate, with Van Hagen as the beneficiary. The trial court decided both questions in the negative, and directed that letters ancillary issue to Hayward's executor. The contesting heirs appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thompson's will contained the following closing statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is my wish, though this is not a restriction or a limitation upon the use and enjoyment of the legacies and bequests herein made, that my estate, after the payment of my debts, * * * shall be kept among the descendants of my late father and mother.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court inquired into the nature and extent of the interest Hayward acquired in the Arizona property under the Thompson will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' contention was that when the will was properly construed it gave Hayward a fee in the Arizona property, subject to an executory devise vesting in the appellants immediately upon Hayward's death without issue. The Court pointed out that the implication in the will was clear that if either Hayward or Van Hagen should have living issue at the time of Thompson's death, although she be not then alive, her portion would pass to such living issue. But neither niece had died at the time of Thompson's death, and the contingency of living issue had failed; hence, by apt and direct language, the appellants were eliminated as devisees. They were to take Hayward's portion only if she should die before Thompson without issue living at the time of Thompson's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants, however, further contended that they were made devisees by the final statement in Thompson's will, already quoted. They took the position that the testator used the word \"wish\" in a testamentary sense and not a precatory sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held against such a view, saying [<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, 110 P.2d 960]:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We think the rule stated in 19 American Jurisprudence 575, section 120, is the one controlling the situation here. It reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"`The general rule is well established that whenever an estate is given to a person generally or indefinitely with an unlimited power of disposition annexed, invariably the absolute fee is vested in the first taker, and an executory limitation over is repugnant and void. * * *'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Arizona held that \"the gift of the Arizona property to Theodora L. Hayward gave her a fee simple title to the property, with the right and power of disposition as she saw fit, and that the `wish' expressed in the will was merely precatory and therefore did not have the effect of destroying the gift.\" 110 P.2d at page 960.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have summarized Hayward at such length so as to make evident its utter inapplicability to the case at bar. There was no suggestion &#8212; much less outright mention &#8212; of a power of appointment. Even the appellants conceded that the will gave Hayward a fee, subject to an executory devise vesting in them immediately after Hayward's death without issue. The terms of the will plainly showed that Hayward received one-half of Thompson's residual estate, subject only to the condition &#8212; which did not occur &#8212; that if she predeceased him without issue living at the time of his death, the property would go to others. In <i>Hayward,</i> there was no vacuum, no period during which her rights would be <i>in suspenso</i> until she made up her mind. Hayward's title came into being immediately, under the ancient French legal maxim, \"<i>Le mort saisit le vif</i>\" (\"The dead invests the living\"). In the present case, however, Mrs. Shedd's title, as we have seen, most assuredly did <i>not</i> come into being at the instant of her husband's death. At that instant, she acquired no \"estate\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Anderson</i> and <i>Hayward</i> simply are not in point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if we were to assume that <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Hayward</i> are in point &#8212; which we do not believe &#8212; they are not controlling here. The legislative history of &#167; 812(e) indicates that Congress did not intend its tax-levying powers, under that section at least, to be subjected to the vagaries of state legislation. In Senate Report No. 1013, op. cit., 2 U.S.Code Cong.Serv.1948, p. 1229, we find the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Subparagraph (B) is intended to be all encompassing with respect to various kinds of contingencies and conditions. Thus, it is immaterial whether the interest passing to the surviving spouse is considered as a vested interest subject to divestment or as a contingent interest.

Any theory that the interest which she could have taken under the local law did pass to her in such a case and was used by her to purchase the interest under the will is contrary to the intended application of this section.\" [Page 1233.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>There Was No \"Substantial Compliance\" with</i> &#167; <i>812(e) (1) (F).</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner contends that, even assuming that only a power of appointment over property actually placed in trust was conferred upon Mrs. Shedd, the estate is nevertheless entitled to the marital deduction, under &#167; 812(e) (1) (F), supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section, it will be recalled, provides that if, under the terms of the trust the surviving spouse is entitled for life to <i>ALL</i> the income from the corpus of the trust, etc., the estate is entitled to the marital deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner argues that \"where a spouse receives two-thirds of the income for life from an <i>entire</i> residue and the power to appoint <i>one-half</i> of that residue, she has received all and in fact something more than the minimum that the law requires in order to entitle the estate to the marital deduction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court held that \"an income interest in and a power of appointment over a part of the corpus of a single trust does not satisfy the requirements of section 812(e) (1) (F) as written, and therefore the deduction is not allowable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. Under the will and the first codicil Mrs. Shedd was entitled to <i>two-thirds</i> of the net income from the trust estate. Under the second codicil, she had a power of appointment over <i>one-half</i> of the corpus of the trust estate. The statute requires that the surviving spouse shall receive <i>all</i> the income from the corpus, with power to appoint the <i>entire</i> corpus free of the trust, in order to entitle the estate to the marital deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A difference of 33 1/3% in one respect, and of 50% in another respect, does not come within the <i>de minimis</i> rule!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. <i>The Decree of the Arizona Court, Awarding to Mrs. Shedd an Undivided One-Half Interest in the Residue of the Estate, Is Not Determinative of the Present Tax Question.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, distributed one-half of the residue of the Shedd estate to Mrs. Shedd free of any trust. This distribution was made on April 18, 1951, or nearly a year and a half after the death of Mr. Shedd.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From that decree, the petitioner seeks to spell out a \"construction\" of the Second Codicil, supra that \"is binding upon the United States\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We in no way question the correctness of the Arizona decree, <i>as of the date of which it speaks.</i> The State Court was not there considering a Federal tax problem. It was in no way passing upon the nature of the title, if any, that Mrs. Shedd took <i>as of the date of Mr. Shedd's death,</i> which, as we have seen, is the crucial time here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, the State Court's decree specifically and unequivocally recites that it is being made under Mr. Shedd's will and the codicils thereto, \"<i>and in accordance with the exercise by Mary Redding Shedd of the power of appointment granted to her under the Second Codicil,</i>\" etc. [Emphasis supplied]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus see that it was the \"exercise\" of the power, and not the testamentary <i>grant</i> thereof, that the Arizona Court considered determinative. On the other hand, we are interested in the quality of the title <i>bequeathed</i> by Mr. Shedd, <i>as it stood at the instant of his death.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we agree with the petitioner that \"Had the decree been based only upon the widow's exercise of her power of appointment, [the State Court] would have ordered, not distribution to the widow direct, but distribution to the trustee with instructions to deliver to the widow\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to believe that the petitioner is serious in making this contention.

These adjustments were waived pending appeal. At the conclusion hereof, it was understood that such adjustments are to be allowed in the recomputation to be entered in accordance with the \"findings\" of this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore order that a recomputation be made under the rules of the Tax Court, in reduction of the deficiency, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">8. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that statutory exemptions from taxes of this kind should be strictly construed against the taxpayer, and are held applicable only to subject matter or beneficiaries clearly within their terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 85 C.J.S., Taxation, &#167; 1157, p. 965, the rule is thus succinctly stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The power of exemption from an inheritance or a similar tax is an essential element of sovereignty.
