Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                   Selya and Siler,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Susanne G. Reardon, Assistant Attorney General, Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts, with whom Martha Coakely, Attorney General, was\non brief, for appellant\n     John M. Thompson, with whom Linda J. Thompson and Thompson &\nThompson, P.C. were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                             June 29, 2009\n\n_______________\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           SELYA,     Circuit    Judge.          This   habeas   appeal     presents\n\nseveral challenging questions.              Two of these are particularly\n\nintriguing.     The first involves the effect of an eyewitness's\n\nexpression of less than complete certitude about a crucial out-of-\n\ncourt identification that he previously made.                    The second is a\n\nmulti-part question. The initial part deals with the cut-off point\n\nfor determining what constitutes \"clearly established Federal law\"\n\nwithin the purview of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), a provision of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.\n\nL. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.                 The next part of that question\n\nconcerns the selection of the relevant precedent from the Supreme\n\nCourt's evolving Confrontation Clause jurisprudence — a question\n\nmade relevant by the Supreme Court's decision, in 1998, of Gray v.\n\nMaryland, 523 U.S. 185 (1998).              Because Gray has not been made\n\nretroactive to cases under collateral review, this case turns on\n\nthe   applicability     vel    non   of    that    precedent     to   the   redacted\n\nstatement of a nontestifying codefendant under circumstances in\n\nwhich his objecting codefendant's name has been replaced with a\n\ncryptic designation (\"Mr. X\").            As matters turn out, the answer to\n\nthis part of the inquiry depends on the answer to the initial part.\n\n           These questions arise in the context of a state-court\n\nconviction for second-degree murder. In the proceedings below the\n\ndistrict court, acting under habeas jurisdiction, granted relief\n\nbecause   it   deemed    the    evidence         insufficient    to   support   the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fconviction and, secondarily, because it deemed the admission of the\n\nnontestifying codefendant's statement violative of the petitioner's\n\nrights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.         See\n\nFoxworth v. Massachusetts (Foxworth III), No. 03-11844, slip op. at\n\n27 (D. Mass. May 14, 2008) (unpublished); Foxworth v. Maloney\n\n(Foxworth I), No. 03-11844, slip op. at 19 (D. Mass. Aug. 17, 2006)\n\n(unpublished).\n\n           After a lengthy exegesis through this maze of problems,\n\nwe reverse in part, retain jurisdiction, and certify a critical\n\nquestion of state law to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(SJC).\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n           Because this appeal involves a challenge to evidentiary\n\nsufficiency, we rehearse the facts in the light most compatible\n\nwith the verdict rendered by the state-court jury, consistent with\n\nrecord support. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).\n\nIn   a   wrinkle   peculiar   to   the   exercise   of   federal   habeas\n\njurisdiction we grant a presumption of correctness to the state\n\ncourts' factual determinations.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n\n           Roxbury is an enclave in Boston, Massachusetts.         On May\n\n23, 1991, a group of men went to the Roxbury home of Kenneth McLean\n\nbent on buying drugs.   After they arrived, matters got out of hand.\n\nApparently, McLean was beaten.       He then broke free and ran.      At\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fleast one of the men chased McLean and shot him as he fled.\n\nMcLean's wounds proved fatal.\n\n            In July of 1991, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted\n\npetitioner-appellee Robert Foxworth for the murder.           By way of a\n\nsuperceding indictment, the grand jury also charged two other men,\n\nTroy Logan and Ronald Christian, with the murder.             As the case\n\nunfolded,   many   of   the   facts    were   undisputed;   the   shooter's\n\nidentity, however, was hotly contested.            This factual dispute\n\nbecame the focal point of the ensuing trial.\n\n            The prosecution's case against the petitioner hinged on\n\nan eyewitness identification by Derek Hobson. The petitioner filed\n\na pretrial motion to suppress the identification testimony.             His\n\nmotion was denied.\n\n            At trial, Hobson testified that, at approximately 6:00\n\np.m. on May 23, he was walking down Brookford Street in Roxbury.\n\nHe observed a man run out of a building located at 5 Brookford\n\nStreet.   The man yelled: \"Those people are crazy.\"         Then, another\n\nman (later identified as Kenneth McLean) exited the premises and\n\nran pell-mell down the street.        He had blood on his mouth and tape\n\non one arm.\n\n            Not heroically inclined, Hobson hid behind a car parked\n\ndirectly across from 5 Brookford Street.         From that vantage point,\n\nhe observed another man emerge from the building with a gun.          That\n\nman fired three or four shots at McLean, who collapsed.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Hobson saw the shooter for at least forty seconds from a\n\ndistance of approximately fifteen to twenty feet.          When the police\n\narrived, he described the shooter as a medium-complected black\n\nmale, six feet or six feet one inch in height, weighing one hundred\n\nforty pounds, and sporting a one inch \"tail\" that protruded from\n\nthe back of his head.     At trial, Hobson added that the shooter was\n\nwearing a black baseball cap and that the \"tail\" stuck out from\n\nunder the back of the cap.\n\n           On June 17, Detective Daniel Flynn, the officer in charge\n\nof the investigation, visited Hobson and presented him with a photo\n\narray.     The    array   contained    twenty    photographs,     including\n\nphotographs of all three men eventually accused of the murder.\n\nHobson   selected   the   petitioner's    photograph   from     the   array,\n\nidentifying him as the shooter.       Flynn testified that Hobson acted\n\n\"without hesitation.\"\n\n           Later that month, the police showed Hobson another photo\n\narray. Once more, Hobson selected the petitioner's photograph from\n\nthe array and identified him as the shooter.\n\n           At    trial,   Hobson   did   not    make   a   live   in-court\n\nidentification but confirmed that the petitioner was the person he\n\nhad identified from the photo arrays.           On cross-examination, he\n\nacknowledged that he had not seen the shooter head-on but had \"seen\n\nthe whole like side of his face.\"        He also admitted that he had\n\nbased his selections from the photo arrays in part on the fact that\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe man he remembered had a \"tail\" (and the petitioner was the only\n\nperson with a \"tail\" whose picture was displayed). When pressed by\n\ndefense counsel to gauge his confidence in the identification,\n\nHobson stated that he was \"eighty percent sure.\"\n\n          Anthony McAfee, who was strolling along with Hobson\n\nimmediately before the shooting, testified that he first observed\n\na man running from the house, yelling \"[t]hose people are crazy.\"\n\nThen, McLean scampered from the building.   Two other men followed.\n\nOne of that pair got into a car parked at the curb on Brookford\n\nStreet and passed a black object to the other man.      The latter\n\nproceeded to fire five or six shots at McLean.          When Flynn\n\npresented McAfee with the same photo array that he initially had\n\npresented to Hobson, McAfee identified Logan as the man who handed\n\nover the black object.   McAfee could not identify the shooter.\n\n          The petitioner had filed a pretrial motion to sever his\n\ntrial from that of his codefendants.    He premised that motion on\n\nthe potential prejudice inherent in a statement made by Logan to\n\nthe police.   The motion was unsuccessful, and the statement was\n\nprominently featured at the joint trial.\n\n          Detective Flynn read the statement into evidence over the\n\npetitioner's timely objection.    In an effort to avert the feared\n\nprejudice, the trial justice ordered redaction of the statement.\n\nIn its redacted form, the petitioner's name was replaced with the\n\npseudonym \"Mr. X\" and the statement was altered so that, after the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffirst reference to \"Mr. X,\" it appeared (falsely) that Logan had\n\nstated: \"Cause that's how I know him by.            I don't know his real\n\nname.\"   The trial justice also admitted a copy of the redacted\n\nstatement into evidence.\n\n           In the statement, Logan related that, on the evening in\n\nquestion, he met two men named \"Tea Lover\" and \"Mr. X\" at a\n\nsandwich shop.     \"Tea Lover\" and Logan resolved to go to McLean's\n\napartment to buy cocaine.       \"Mr. X\" accompanied them because McLean\n\nowed him money as a result of a prior sale of \"bad\" cocaine.\n\nShortly after the group's arrival, \"Mr. X\" and McLean argued. \"Mr.\n\nX\" left the premises.     Logan opted to do likewise.          As he made his\n\nway downstairs, \"Mr. X\" was coming back upstairs.              Logan noticed\n\nthat \"Mr. X\" had a gun tucked into his waistband.             Logan continued\n\nhis descent and, as he was getting into a cab, heard shots.\n\n           The statement indicated that Logan had identified \"Mr. X\"\n\nfrom a photo array.     Flynn testified that the photo array was the\n\nsame one that had been employed earlier in the investigation.               On\n\ncross-examination by Christian's counsel, Flynn revealed that the\n\ndesignation \"Mr. X\" did not refer to Christian.          Moreover, it was\n\na   replacement   for   the   name   Logan   actually   had     used   in   his\n\nstatement.\n\n           The    prosecution    offered     the   redacted    statement    as\n\nevidence only against Logan.         The trial justice gave a limiting\n\ninstruction both after the reading of the redacted statement and\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbefore jury deliberations began.       The gist of the instruction was\n\ntwofold: that the statement could only be considered against Logan\n\n(who was being tried on a \"joint venture\" theory) and that the jury\n\nshould not speculate about who \"Mr. X\" might be.\n\n           At the close of the prosecution's case, each of the three\n\ndefendants moved for a required finding of not guilty.              The trial\n\njustice granted Christian's motion in its entirety and granted the\n\nother defendants' motions with respect to the charge of first-\n\ndegree murder.    These rulings preserved the second-degree murder\n\ncharges against the petitioner and Logan.          On March 31, 1992, the\n\njury convicted the petitioner and acquitted Logan.              In due course,\n\nthe trial justice sentenced the petitioner to life imprisonment.\n\n           The petitioner filed a new trial motion under Mass. R.\n\nCrim. P. 30.      The motion alleged a Bruton violation based on\n\nadmission of Logan's statement.            It also cited purported newly\n\ndiscovered   evidence,     alleged     prosecutorial       misconduct,    and\n\nchallenged the photo spread used to identify the petitioner.              The\n\ntrial   justice   denied   the   motion      on   August   8,    1994.    The\n\npetitioner's timely direct appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt from the conviction, which advanced similar claims, was\n\nconsolidated with his subsequent appeal from the denial of the\n\nmotion.   On October 21, 1996, the Appeals Court, in an unpublished\n\ndecision, affirmed both the conviction and the denial of the new\n\ntrial motion.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           The petitioner had twenty days in which to seek further\n\nreview by the SJC by filing an application for leave to obtain\n\nfurther appellate review (ALOFAR).    Mass. R. App. P. 27.1(a).   The\n\npetitioner made no such filing within the prescribed period.\n\n           Ordinarily, then, the conviction would have become final\n\nin 1996.   Here, however, the petitioner some four years later (on\n\nOctober 25, 2000) filed a pro se ALOFAR in the SJC seeking further\n\nreview of the Appeals Court decision.    The pro se ALOFAR included\n\na \"motion to file late application for further appellate review,\"\n\nwhich asked the SJC to excuse his untimely filing on two grounds.\n\n           The pro se ALOFAR argued that the petitioner's Sixth\n\nAmendment rights under Bruton had been violated by the introduction\n\nof Logan's statement but made no mention of Gray (which had been\n\ndecided on March 9, 1998).   The ALOFAR also raised several other\n\nchallenges to the 1996 Appeals Court ruling, none of which are\n\nmaterial here.\n\n           The SJC did not rule either on the ALOFAR or on the\n\npetitioner's motion to file out of time because, on November 15,\n\n2000, the petitioner asked the SJC to stay consideration of his\n\nALOFAR pending the resolution of a second new trial motion.       The\n\nSJC granted the petitioner's request for a stay on February 1,\n\n2001, and ordered petitioner to file regular status reports on the\n\nprogress of his second new trial motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f            The petitioner filed his second new trial motion before\n\nthe trial court on December 11, 2000.    That motion, filed pursuant\n\nto Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, attacked the conviction on four grounds.\n\nFirst, it claimed, based on a later affidavit by McAfee, that the\n\nprosecutor knowingly and intentionally used perjured testimony and\n\nallowed false evidence to go uncorrected.    Second, it claimed that\n\nthe petitioner's previous counsel provided ineffective assistance\n\nbecause he failed to submit affidavits anent newly discovered\n\nevidence.    Third, it claimed that the trial justice erred in not\n\ninstructing the jury on manslaughter.    Fourth, it claimed that the\n\njudge gave an incorrect instruction as to malice.\n\n            After the trial court denied the second new trial motion,\n\nthe Appeals Court, on April 17, 2002, affirmed the decision,\n\nholding that all the claims in the second new trial motion were\n\neither previously decided or waived.\n\n            The petitioner then moved to consolidate his appeal from\n\nthe denial of the second new trial motion with his previous ALOFAR.\n\nThe SJC appointed counsel on May 22, 2002, and on May 28 granted\n\nthe petitioner's motion to extend the time for filing to June 24,\n\n2002.   On June 27, 2002, counsel informed the SJC that an amended\n\nALOFAR would be filed.\n\n            On July 22, 2002, the petitioner filed a \"motion to file\n\nan amended FAR application late,\" which was allowed by a docket\n\nnotation of the same day, without comment.      It appears from the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\frecord     that    the    allowance    of     this   motion    related    to   the\n\npetitioner's non-observance of the June 24 deadline for filing\n\nbriefs.    It is unclear whether that order may have applied to the\n\npetitioner's failure, under Mass. R. App. P. 27.1(a), to file and\n\nALOFAR within twenty days of either the October 21, 1996 Appeals\n\nCourt decision affirming the conviction and the denial of the first\n\nnew trial motion or the April 17, 2002 Appeals Court decision\n\naffirming the denial of the second new trial motion.\n\n            Also     on   July   22,   the   petitioner,      through    appointed\n\ncounsel, filed his amended ALOFAR.            The July 22 amended ALOFAR was\n\nbased primarily on the Bruton claim; here, for the first time, the\n\npetitioner raised Gray as an explicit basis for his claim.                     The\n\namended ALOFAR also raised challenges to the photo array and to the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.             Although the amended ALOFAR was\n\nconsolidated with the appeal from the denial of the second new\n\ntrial motion, it did not raise any challenges to the Appeals\n\nCourt's 2002 decision.\n\n            On September 6, 2002, the SJC denied the ALOFAR without\n\ncomment.\n\n            The petitioner repaired to the federal district court in\n\nsearch of a writ of habeas corpus.              See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244-2254.\n\nNaming an appropriate correctional official as the respondent, his\n\nhabeas petition raised three fully exhausted claims: (i) that his\n\nconviction        violated   due   process      because    the    evidence     was\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconstitutionally insufficient under the rule of Jackson, 443 U.S.\n\nat   319;   (ii)   that   the   use   of    an   unreliable   eyewitness\n\nidentification violated due process, see Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S.\n\n188, 198 (1972); and (iii) that the admission at trial of Logan's\n\nincriminating statement violated his Sixth Amendment rights as\n\nannounced in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 126 (1968), and\n\nelaborated in Gray.\n\n            On August 17, 2006, the district court ruled in favor of\n\nthe petitioner on his Bruton claim.        The court regarded the two-\n\npart inference that \"Mr. X\" was the shooter and that the petitioner\n\nwas \"Mr. X\" as obvious; therefore, \"[t]he statement — given by a\n\ncodefendant with powerful motive to incriminate petitioner, and\n\nunchallenged by cross-examination — violated petitioner's Sixth\n\nAmendment rights.\"    Foxworth I, slip op. at 19.    The district court\n\ndeemed consideration of the petitioner's two remaining claims\n\nunnecessary, vacated the conviction, and ordered the Commonwealth\n\neither to retry or to release the petitioner.        Id. at 23.\n\n            The respondent appealed.       We remanded the case to the\n\ndistrict court to address the sufficiency of the evidence claim,\n\nnoting that a finding in the petitioner's favor on that claim would\n\npreclude a retrial. See Foxworth v. Maloney (Foxworth II), 515 F.3d\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The district court sensibly ordered the petitioner's\n\nrelease on bail and proceeded to address the unadjudicated claims.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fWith respect to the due process/eyewitness identification claim,\n\nthe court determined that although the identification procedure was\n\nsuggestive to a degree, the state court's conclusion that any\n\nsuggestiveness was outweighed by Hobson's ability to observe at the\n\ntime of the incident was not objectively unreasonable.                 Foxworth\n\nIII, slip op. at 17.       Thus, the admission of Hobson's testimony did\n\nnot transgress due process.        Id.     As to the insufficiency claim,\n\nthe court concluded that \"it was objectively unreasonable for the\n\n[Massachusetts] Appeals Court to do no more than cite the general\n\nstandard when, even after crediting the entire testimony of the\n\nwitness, there was still significant doubt in his identification of\n\nFoxworth.\"      Id. at 26 (emphasis in original).           On that basis, the\n\ncourt   set    aside   the   conviction    and    ordered    the   petitioner's\n\nrelease.      Id. at 28.\n\n              This timely appeal ensued.         In it, the respondent seeks\n\nto test the mettle of the petitioner's insufficiency and Sixth\n\nAmendment claims. The due process/eyewitness identification ruling\n\nhas not been challenged.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\n              We begin our substantive discussion by laying out the\n\nground rules for federal habeas review of state-court convictions.\n\nWe then address sequentially the two constitutional claims that are\n\nbefore us.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f                             A. Standards of Review.\n\n            Federal habeas review of a state-court conviction is\n\ngoverned by the AEDPA, which permits federal courts to grant habeas\n\nrelief    after    a    final   state-court      adjudication     of   a    federal\n\nconstitutional claim if that adjudication can be shown to be\n\n\"contrary to,\" or to have involved, \"an unreasonable application\n\nof, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States\" or in the alternative, to have been\n\n\"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n\nthe evidence presented in the State court proceedings.\"                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d).      In administering these standards, the state court's\n\nfactual findings are presumed to be correct, and they can be\n\novercome    only       by   clear   and    convincing   evidence.          See   id.\n\n§ 2254(e)(1); see also Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n            A     state-court       decision     is   \"contrary    to\"      clearly\n\nestablished Federal law if \"the state court arrives at a conclusion\n\nopposite from that reached by the U.S. Supreme Court on a question\n\nof law, or if the state court decides the case differently than the\n\nU.S. Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable\n\nfacts.\"    Sleeper v. Spencer, 510 F.3d 32, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405 (2000)).                 This is an\n\n\"unreasonable application\" case; no colorable arguments are made\n\n\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fsuggesting that the relevant state-court rulings are directly\n\n\"contrary to\" clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\n              An     unreasonable   application      of   clearly      established\n\nFederal law occurs when\n\n              the state court correctly identifies the\n              governing legal principles, but (i) applies\n              those principles to the facts of the case in\n              an objectively unreasonable manner; (ii)\n              unreasonably extends clearly established legal\n              principles to a new context where they should\n              not apply; or (iii) unreasonably refuses to\n              extend established principles to a new context\n              where they should apply.\n\nId. at 38.           \"The habeas question of whether the state court\n\ndecision is objectively unreasonable is layered on top of the\n\nunderlying standard governing the constitutional right asserted.\"\n\nHurtado v. Tucker, 245 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir. 2001).                So viewed, the\n\nstate court's decision is not vulnerable unless it evinces some\n\nincrement of incorrectness beyond mere error. McCambridge v. Hall,\n\n303 F.3d 24, 36 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc).\n\n              In     probing   whether    a     state-court   decision      is   an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, the\n\nnature of the legal rule — that is, the extent to which the rule is\n\nspecific rather than general — makes a substantial difference.                   If\n\nthe legal rule is specific, the range of reasonable judgments is\n\ncorrespondingly narrow.         Conversely, if the legal rule is general,\n\nthe   range     of    reasonable    judgments      is   likely    to   be   broad.\n\nYarborough v. Alvardo, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004).                 In other words,\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f\"[t]he more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in\n\nreaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\"                   Id.\n\n             Even if a state-court decision is determined to involve\n\nan unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law,\n\nhabeas relief will not follow automatically.                     The error must be\n\nshown to have \"had a substantial and injurious effect or influence\n\nin determining the jury's verdict.\"                 Delaney v. Bartee, 522 F.3d\n\n100, 105 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S.\n\n619, 631 (1993)).\n\n             Finally, we note that these ground rules apply equally to\n\nthe   district      court     and   to      the     court   of     appeals    alike.\n\nConsequently, we review a district court's grant or denial of a\n\nstate prisoner's habeas corpus petition de novo.                   Lynch v. Ficco,\n\n438 F.3d 35, 44 (1st Cir. 2006).                With these background rules in\n\nplace, we turn next to the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n             B.   Due Process: Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n             In   criminal    cases,     the    constitutional      benchmark     for\n\nevidentiary sufficiency is familiar: \"If the evidence presented,\n\ntaken in the light most flattering to the prosecution, together\n\nwith all reasonable inferences favorable to it, permits a rational\n\njury to find each essential element of the crime charged beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, then the evidence is legally sufficient.\" United\n\nStates v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Jackson,\n\n443   U.S.   at   319).     Due   largely      to   the   expansiveness      of   this\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fstandard, a sufficiency analysis requires a degree of intellectual\n\nrigor.   In particular, a reviewing court must refrain from giving\n\ncredence to \"evidentiary interpretations and illations that are\n\nunreasonable, insupportable, or overly speculative.\" United States\n\nv. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          In exercising federal habeas jurisdiction we typically\n\nlook to the rationale of the intermediate appellate court where, as\n\nhere, the state's highest court has summarily denied further\n\nappellate review.    See, e.g., Niland v. Hall, 280 F.3d 6, 11-12\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).    In this instance, the measuring stick that the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court applied to the sufficiency analysis\n\nmeets federal constitutional criteria.   Although that court relied\n\non a state case, Commonwealth v. Latimore, 393 N.E.2d 370 (Mass.\n\n1979), in reaching a conclusion about evidentiary sufficiency, a\n\nstate-court adjudication of an issue framed in terms of state law\n\nis nonetheless entitled to deference under section 2254(d)(1) as\n\nlong as the state and federal issues are for all practical purposes\n\nsynonymous and the state standard is at least as protective of the\n\ndefendant's rights as its federal counterpart.    See McCambridge,\n\n303 F.3d at 35.     Since the sufficiency issue is essentially the\n\nsame under both federal and state law and the Latimore court\n\ntransplanted the appropriate federal constitutional standard into\n\nthe jurisprudence of Massachusetts, see Latimore, 393 N.E.2d at 374\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f(citing Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318-19), we can confidently apply the\n\nAEDPA standard to this issue.\n\n          The Appeals Court concluded that:\n\n                 The judge properly denied Foxworth's\n          motion for a required finding of not guilty,\n          on the basis, if no other, of the eyewitness\n          testimony identifying Foxworth as the person\n          who shot the fleeing McLean several times and\n          then escaped in a car — testimony that was\n          corroborated in all respects, except the\n          identification of Foxworth as the shooter, by\n          a second eyewitness. That evidence, taken in\n          the light most favorable to the Commonwealth\n          (a premise that Foxworth fails to recognize),\n          was sufficient for a rational jury to find\n          beyond a reasonable doubt that Foxworth was a\n          principal actor in the second degree murder,\n          with malice inferable from the intentional use\n          of a deadly weapon. Foxworth's presentation\n          of an alibi defense did not serve to take the\n          issue from the jury.\n\nThe question, then, is whether this determination constitutes an\n\nunreasonable application of the Jackson standard.\n\n          The petitioner asserts that the only evidence of his\n\ninvolvement was the testimony of a single eyewitness and that this\n\ntestimony lacked the force necessary to prove guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.   The district court agreed; it found multiple\n\nweaknesses in Hobson's testimony, including discrepancies between\n\nhis account and McAfee's, inconsistencies in his description of the\n\nshooter, the lack of an in-court identification, flaws in the photo\n\narray, and the witness's admission that he was less than certain\n\nabout the identification.   See Foxworth III, slip op. at 22.   The\n\nrespondent assigns error to this ruling.\n\n                                -18-\n\f               The question is close, and the district court is correct\n\nthat       Hobson's   testimony     is    the    only    evidence    that    directly\n\nimplicates      the   petitioner     as    the    shooter.1         Nevertheless,     a\n\ncriminal       conviction    can    rest    on    the    testimony     of   a     single\n\neyewitness.       Even if the eyewitness's testimony is uncorroborated\n\nand comes from an individual of dubious veracity, it can suffice to\n\nground a conviction.        See, e.g., Hayes v. Battaglia, 403 F.3d 935,\n\n938 (7th Cir. 2005).          Hobson's first-hand testimony was neither\n\ninherently      improbable    nor    materially         undermined    by    any   other\n\nunimpeachable proof.         It placed the petitioner at the scene of the\n\nmurder and identified him as the shooter.                 No more was exigible to\n\nsatisfy the Jackson standard.\n\n               That is not to say that a rational jury had to accept the\n\neyewitness identification.               Hobson was exposed to a withering\n\ncross-examination, which disclosed a number of weaknesses in his\n\ntestimony.       It is well-established, though, that determining a\n\nwitness's credibility, even in the face of a furious attack, is a\n\nfunction that falls squarely within the province of the jury. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Lipscomb, 539 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2008);\n\nRamonez v. Berghuis, 490 F.3d 482, 490 (6th Cir. 2007); United\n\nStates v. Calderón, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       Although Logan's statement also implicated the petitioner,\nsee infra Part II(C)(2), the statement was admitted solely against\nLogan.\n\n                                          -19-\n\f          In defending the district court's sufficiency ruling, the\n\npetitioner notes that some of the details to which Hobson testified\n\ndid not match his original statements to the police.           In a similar\n\nvein, he points out that Hobson's testimony was not entirely\n\ncongruent with McAfee's testimony.        But such discrepancies do not\n\nas a matter of law render a witness's testimony unworthy of belief.\n\nRather, they are for the jury to sort out and weigh.           \"The actual\n\nresolution   of    the   conflicting    evidence,   the     credibility   of\n\nwitnesses,   and   the   plausibility    of   competing    explanations   is\n\nexactly the task to be performed by a rational jury, considering a\n\ncase presented by competent counsel on both sides.\"            Matthews v.\n\nAbramajtys, 319 F.3d 780, 790 (6th Cir. 2003).            It is rare that a\n\nkey witness survives a murder trial unscathed, and the jurors in\n\nthis case were free to credit Hobson's version of the events or\n\nnot, as they saw fit.\n\n          The absence of an in-court identification does not tip\n\nthe sufficiency scales.     Extrajudicial witness identifications are\n\nroutinely used as substantive evidence of guilt.                See, e.g.,\n\nSamuels v. Mann, 13 F.3d 522, 527 (2d Cir. 1993); see also Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801(d)(1)(C) (excluding prior out-of-court identifications\n\nfrom the definition of hearsay).        There is no requirement, either\n\nin the Constitution or in the usual rules that apply to the\n\nadmission of evidence, that a witness who makes an extrajudicial\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fidentification must repeat the identification in the courtroom.2\n\nConsequently, the fact that Hobson never identified the petitioner\n\nat trial does not alter the constitutional calculus.\n\n                 The petitioner offers a closely related argument.              He\n\nmaintains that Hobson's out-of-court identification was itself so\n\nunreliable that a rational jury could not rely on it.                    In this\n\nregard, he stresses that the district court characterized the photo\n\narray as suggestive.         See Foxworth III, slip op. at 16.\n\n                 The bottom line, however, is that the district court\n\nconcluded that it was not objectively unreasonable for the state\n\ncourt       to    find   enough   indicia     of   reliability    to   allow   the\n\nintroduction of the identification testimony into evidence without\n\noffending any constitutional safeguard.               See id. at 16-17.        The\n\npetitioner has not challenged that conclusion on appeal.\n\n                 Moreover, the alleged flaws in the photo array were fully\n\nvetted at the trial; the cross-examiner dwelt on them and argued\n\nthe   point       vociferously    to   the   jury.    He   also   exploited    the\n\ntestimony about viewing angles (i.e., that the view Hobson had of\n\nthe petitioner was in profile).              Despite the force of this multi-\n\npronged attack, the jury credited Hobson's identification.                      On\n\n\n\n        2\n       This paradigm makes good sense: it is designed to facilitate\nthe introduction of eyewitness identifications made \"when memory\nwas fresher and there had been less opportunity for influence to be\nexerted upon [the witness].\"     United States v. Lewis, 565 F.2d\n1248, 1251 (2d Cir. 1977) (quoting United States v. Marchand, 564\nF.2d 983, 996 (2d Cir. 1977)).\n\n                                        -21-\n\fcollateral review, we cannot disturb its judgment.                  Ramonez, 490\n\nF.3d at 490.\n\n             Finally, the district court gave significant weight to\n\nthe fact that Hobson admitted that he was only \"eighty percent\n\nsure\" of his identification.         The court reasoned that even if the\n\ntestimony was fully credited by the jury, it carried with it a\n\nsignificant     measure     of   doubt    and,    therefore,    \"it    would    be\n\nirrational to find that fact beyond a reasonable doubt [when] the\n\neyewitness himself was not sure of the fact . . . .\"                Foxworth III,\n\nslip op. at 24-25. On appeal, the respondent savages this analysis\n\nwhile the petitioner embraces it.\n\n             Although the district court's reasoning has a patina of\n\nplausibility, it does not withstand close scrutiny.                        A prior\n\nidentification is not stripped of probative force merely because\n\nthe witness confesses that he harbors some doubt about it.                     Cf.\n\nSamuels, 13 F.3d at 527 (holding that a jury could credit a\n\nwitness's     earlier     identification     of    the   defendant     over    the\n\nwitness's in-court identification of a different person).                      The\n\nwitness's certainty vel non is properly viewed as a factor that\n\nmust be evaluated by the jury as the trier of the facts — but a\n\njury is no more bound to find reasonable doubt based on an\n\neyewitness's profession that he is \"eighty percent certain\" than it\n\nwould   be   bound   to    accept   the   identification       if    the   witness\n\nprofessed to being \"one hundred percent certain.\"\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f               This conclusion is rooted in human experience and common\n\nsense.     Self-esteem is a wild card.          Some witnesses may be over-\n\nconfident about their powers of perception or recall; others may be\n\ndiffident or overly cautious.          Moreover, \"some witnesses verbalize\n\ntheir assurances of being correct with more positiveness than\n\nothers.\"       United States v. Smith, 563 F.2d 1361, 1363 (9th Cir.\n\n1977).    And, finally, there is no necessary correlation between a\n\nwitness's        self-confidence       and     the   correctness     of    his\n\nidentification.       In the last analysis, it is up to the jury to\n\ngauge    the     accuracy   of   an    identification,   factoring    in   any\n\nprotestations of assurance or self-doubt.3\n\n               In this case, there is no principled way to label the\n\njury's choice as irrational.             Hobson selected the petitioner's\n\npicture from each of two separate (constitutionally adequate) photo\n\narrays.     The first time, he signed the back of the photograph to\n\nconfirm the identification.           Detective Flynn testified that Hobson\n\nacted \"without hesitation.\"           He later made a second identification\n\nfrom another photo array. These identifications were made in close\n\nproximity to the time of the murder.            In addition, the petitioner\n\nresembled the general description given by Hobson at that time.\n\nHobson's subsequent expression of less than complete certitude\n\nabout the identifications came nearly a year later (after his\n\n\n     3\n      The trial justice instructed the jurors that the identity of\nthe shooter was of paramount importance in this case and that it\nwas up to them to decide the accuracy of Hobson's identification.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fmemory   arguably   had    dulled).      Given   the    totality   of     the\n\ncircumstances, we conclude that Hobson's eyewitness testimony could\n\nreasonably be thought to comprise part of a constitutionally\n\nadequate foundation for the ensuing conviction.\n\n           Of course, the fact that each weakness in Hobson's\n\ntestimony can be overcome does not mean that, in the aggregate,\n\nthey can be overcome.      Cf. Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S.\n\n171, 179-80 (1987) (explaining that \"individual pieces of evidence,\n\ninsufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation\n\nprove it\"). The district court made this point quite forcefully.\n\nSee Foxworth III, slip op. at 25-26.      Under the AEDPA, however, the\n\nquestion is not whether the outcome reached by the state court is\n\ncorrect in an absolute sense but, rather, the reasonableness of\n\nthat court's application of clearly established Federal law in\n\nreaching that outcome.     See Hurtado, 245 F.3d at 20.\n\n           We mention one last point.            We have said that the\n\nunderlying constitutional question is close. The very closeness of\n\nthe question solidifies the result that we must reach in this case.\n\nHabeas relief is precluded when \"it is a close question whether the\n\nstate decision is in error.\"    Evans v. Thompson, 518 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir.   2008)   (quoting   McCambridge,   303   F.3d    at   36).   That   is\n\nespecially so when the state court is tasked with applying a\n\ngeneral standard, such as that contemplated by Jackson.                   See\n\nYarborough, 541 U.S. at 664; see also Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277,\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f308 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (identifying Jackson as enunciating\n\na   general    standard).    The   generalized        nature   of   the   Jackson\n\nstandard reinforces our conclusion that it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe Appeals Court to hold that Hobson's testimony, together with\n\nthe other evidence of record, was sufficient to undergird the\n\nconviction.\n\n              The petitioner, ably represented, tries yet another tack.\n\nArguing for a finding of unreasonableness, he emphasizes the\n\npaucity of reasoning in the Appeals Court's decision. In his view,\n\nthis perceived flaw is aggravated by that court's ostensible\n\noverstatement of the corrobative effect of McAfee's testimony.\n\nThese arguments have some bite but, on habeas review, the ultimate\n\ninquiry is not the degree to which the state court's decision is or\n\nis not smoothly reasoned; the ultimate inquiry is whether the\n\noutcome is reasonable.       See Hurtado, 245 F.3d at 20.            A sparsely\n\nreasoned state-court decision may set off warning bells, but such\n\na decision does not necessarily mean that the outcome represents an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.                 Id.\n\n              So it is here. Although the Appeals Court's reasoning on\n\nthis   issue    seems   perfunctory    (a    single    paragraph    with   scant\n\nanalysis), the outcome reached by the court appears to be both\n\nplausible and adequately supported.           Phrased in the idiom of the\n\nAEDPA, we cannot say on this record that the outcome was an\n\nunreasonable application of the Jackson standard.              Accordingly, we\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\freverse the district court's decision insofar as it purposes to\n\ngrant the petitioner relief on this claim.\n\n                C.    Sixth Amendment: Confrontation.\n\n          The petitioner argued below that the trial justice's\n\naffirmed ruling allowing Logan's redacted statement into evidence\n\nviolated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.        The district\n\ncourt concurred with the petitioner's appraisal.    Foxworth I, slip\n\nop. at 19.   The respondent takes exception.\n\n          To begin, the panel has identified a pivotal issue\n\nconcerning the date upon which the petitioner's conviction became\n\nfinal; that is, the date when the process of direct review of the\n\nconviction in the state courts was exhausted.    The district court,\n\nbelieving that the respondent had conceded the point, assumed that\n\nthe conviction became final in 2002 (when the SJC denied the\n\namended ALOFAR).     See Foxworth I, slip op. at 4 n.3.    The parties\n\nhave not explicitly addressed the date of finality in their briefs\n\nin this court (although the respondent consistently has argued that\n\nGray should not be applied retroactively to this case).        For our\n\npart, we have been unable either to locate an outright concession\n\nor to agree upon an answer to the finality question of when direct\n\nreview ended.   As we explain below, the issue turns out to be a\n\ndispositive one.4\n\n\n     4\n       There is some room for doubt as to whether the respondent\nhas waived or forfeited the date-of-finality issue by failing to\ncontest the district court's unfounded statement, by failing to\n\n                                 -26-\n\f           1.    The Finality Question.    We set the stage.     In federal\n\nhabeas cases, there is a requirement, spelled out in 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d), that a state-court decision be measured against \"clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States.\"     In most cases (and, specifically, in this case),\n\nthe date of finality of the state court conviction determines the\n\ntime line to be used for determining what Supreme Court decisions\n\ncomprise the corpus of this \"clearly established Federal law.\"\n\n           Here, the jury convicted the petitioner on March 31,\n\n1992; the petitioner's first new trial motion was denied on August\n\n8, 1994; and both the conviction and the denial of the first new\n\ntrial motion were affirmed by the Appeals Court on October 21,\n\n1996.   The normal time for seeking direct review of that decision\n\nexpired twenty days later.       See Mass. R. App. P. 27.1(a).            The\n\npetitioner took no action; and his conviction became final.               At\n\nthat time, the Supreme Court's Confrontation Clause jurisprudence\n\nincluded Bruton and Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987).\n\n           The    petitioner   applied    for   leave   to   obtain   further\n\nappellate review four years later (on October 25, 2000).              In that\n\n\n\nraise the issue squarely in his appellate briefs, and/or by his\ncounsel's statements at oral argument in this court. The panel is\ndivided on this point: Chief Judge Lynch and Judge Siler find\nneither waiver nor forfeiture; Judge Selya would hold the point\nwaived or, at least, forfeited.    Since a majority of the panel\nbelieves that the question of finality is properly before us, no\nuseful purpose would be served by rehearsing the arguments for and\nagainst waiver.\n\n                                   -27-\n\ftemporal gap, the Supreme Court decided Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S.\n\n185 (1998).       That opinion refined and extended the Bruton rule.\n\n              The petitioner's 2000 pro se ALOFAR did not cite Gray.\n\nThe proceedings were stayed while petitioner filed and litigated a\n\nsecond      new   trial    motion.     On    July   22,   2002,   the   petitioner\n\nsubmitted an amended ALOFAR which cited Gray and argued that, under\n\nGriffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 328 (1987), he was entitled to\n\nits benefit.       The amended ALOFAR was accompanied by a \"motion to\n\nfile an amended FAR application late,\" which the SJC allowed.                   The\n\nSJC denied further appellate review without comment on September 6,\n\n2002.\n\n              Given this chronology, there are two possible dates of\n\nfinality: November 18, 1996 or September 6, 2002.5                   We know that\n\nthe SJC has the power to overlook the untimeliness of an ALOFAR and\n\nsometimes considers a late application on the merits.                   See, e.g.,\n\nCommonwealth v. O'Neil, 765 N.E.2d 767, 767 n.1 (Mass. 2002).                   But\n\nthe   question     is     whether    the   SJC's    actions   here   reopened   the\n\nfinality of the criminal conviction in 2002.               See 2 R. Hertz & J.S.\n\nLiebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice & Procedure § 25.6 (5th ed.\n\n2001) (suggesting that a state court may choose to delay the point\n\n\n\n        5\n      In fact, the latter date may well be extended by ninety days\nto encompass the period in which a petition for certiorari to the\nSupreme Court of the United States could be filed.      See, e.g.,\nGriffith, 479 U.S. at 321 n.6. Because this ninety-day shift makes\nno difference here, we use September 6, 2002 as a convenient\nshorthand.\n\n                                           -28-\n\fof finality of a criminal judgment and that, since the non-\n\nretroactivity doctrine serves the interests of the states, a\n\nfederal court may be required to respect this decision on habeas\n\nreview).\n\n            The answer to these questions will be conclusive here.\n\nAfter all, if the petitioner's conviction became final in 2002,\n\nthen Gray applies because it was decided beforehand.             Otherwise,\n\nRichardson controls.        As we explain below, the result of our\n\nanalysis of the confrontation issue hinges on which of these\n\nprecedents governs.\n\n            2.    The Effect if 2002 is the Date of Finality.          We turn\n\nnext to the effect of a 2002 date of finality on the constitutional\n\npropriety    of    the   trial   justice's   evidentiary     ruling.      The\n\nrespondent consistently has argued that the date for determining\n\nclearly established law was in 1996.          But the respondent gave a\n\nparticular reason, and that reason is wrong: the respondent posits\n\nthat because the SJC summarily denied further appellate review, the\n\ncontours of \"clearly established Federal law\" should be defined\n\nwith reference to the date of the Appeals Court decision (which\n\nantedated    Gray).        The   district    court   found    this     theory\n\nunconvincing, see Foxworth I, slip op. at 5, and so do we.\n\n            The respondent's theory is based on an incorrect premise.\n\nTo support it, the respondent cites Justice O'Connor's locution\n\nthat, under the AEDPA, the term \"clearly established Federal law\"\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fmeans \"the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's\n\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\"\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 412.           The respondent reads the phrase\n\n\"relevant state-court decision\" as referring for all purposes to\n\nthe last reasoned state-court decision.\n\n           This   reading   is    untenable.      Close   perscrutation    of\n\nWilliams discloses nothing in the Court's constituent opinions that\n\nindicates any intention on Justice O'Connor's part either to modify\n\nor to undercut the bright-line rule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.\n\n288, 310 (1989) (effectively limiting the consideration of new\n\nconstitutional rules of criminal procedure in cases on collateral\n\nreview to those rules announced before the petitioner's conviction\n\nbecame final).    The opposite is true.         Justice O'Connor's opinion\n\nstated that \"whatever would qualify as an old rule under our Teague\n\njurisprudence will constitute 'clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined   by   the   Supreme   Court    of   the   United   States'   under\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).\"    529 U.S. at 412.     That is a frank recognition that\n\nthe AEDPA has neither altered nor eroded the marker laid down by\n\nTeague.   This recognition is fully consistent with Part III of\n\nJustice Stevens's lead opinion, joined by Justice O'Connor; there,\n\nJustice Stevens stated that \"[t]he threshold question under AEDPA\n\nis whether [the petitioner] seeks to apply a rule of law that was\n\nclearly established at the time his state-court conviction became\n\nfinal.\"   Williams, 529 U.S. at 390 (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\f           Griffith removes any vestige of doubt. We have read that\n\ndecision as establishing that \"[i]f [a] conviction is not yet final\n\nwhen the Supreme Court announces [a] rule, then inferior courts\n\nmust apply that rule to the defendant's case.\"     Derman v. United\n\nStates, 298 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Griffith, 479 U.S.\n\nat 322).   By contrast, if the conviction is already final, then the\n\ndefendant ordinarily — there are special circumstances, but none\n\nthat are relevant here — may not avail himself of the newly\n\nannounced rule.     See Teague, 439 U.S. at 310.   It is, therefore,\n\nevident that finality, not the date of the last reasoned decision,\n\nis the principal determinant of whether a \"new\" rule can be applied\n\nto an \"old\" case.\n\n           Finality means that \"a judgment of conviction has been\n\nrendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a\n\npetition for certiorari [has] elapsed or a petition for certiorari\n\n[filed and] finally denied.\"   Griffith, 479 U.S. at 321 n.6.   Under\n\nthis definition, if the petitioner's conviction was final no\n\nearlier than September 6, 2002, Gray would control.    See Currie v.\n\nMatesanz, 281 F.3d 261, 266 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           To recapitulate, both Teague and Griffith remain good\n\nlaw.   Those cases mean what they say.   Together, they lead to the\n\ninexorable conclusion that if the petitioner's conviction was not\n\n\"final\" until after Gray was decided by the Supreme Court, the\n\npetitioner is entitled to the benefit of Gray.\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\f            We    add    a   coda.     While   this   result     is    dictated    by\n\nprecedent, it also makes good sense from a policy standpoint.                      The\n\nconstruct advocated by the respondent would allow a state court to\n\nsubvert Griffith and deny criminal defendants the benefit of new\n\nSupreme Court precedent by the simple expedient of summarily\n\naffirming a lower court's decision.             That would give state courts\n\na perverse incentive to avoid addressing constitutional claims in\n\ncontemporaneous         terms   while     insulating     their        actions    from\n\nsubsequent federal habeas review.              That would be an unattractive\n\nprospect.\n\n            The respondent has yet another string to his bow.                      He\n\nargues that even if Gray applies, the trial justice's ruling should\n\nbe upheld.       Initially, that argument requires us to consider the\n\nstandard of review applicable to the state court's rejection of the\n\nSixth Amendment claim.\n\n            On this point, the respondent urges us to use AEDPA's\n\ncustomary    \"unreasonable           application\"     standard.          28     U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1). The petitioner resists. He notes that this standard\n\napplies only to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits in\n\nState court proceedings.\" Id. § 2254(d).               Because Gray was never\n\naddressed by the state courts, he proposes de novo review.                        See\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that a\n\nfederal court \"can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that\n\nthe state court did not address\"); cf. Brown v. Maloney, 267 F.3d\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f36, 40 (1st Cir. 2001) (declaring that absent \"reasoning on a\n\nholding from the state court on [an] issue,\" it cannot be said that\n\nthe claim was adjudicated on the merits).\n\n           The precise question raised by the dueling arguments is\n\nwhether    a    state-court     decision    disposing     of    a   federal\n\nconstitutional claim on the merits without a reasoned application\n\nof the most pertinent Supreme Court authority is an adjudication\n\nthat   comes   within   the   AEDPA's   purview.   This    is   a   question\n\ndifferent from that which we confronted in Fortini.             The Appeals\n\nCourt, citing Bruton, squarely decided the Sixth Amendment claim\n\nand elaborated its reasoning.           But that decision did not take\n\naccount of Gray; indeed, it could not have done so; the Supreme\n\nCourt decided Gray after the Appeals Court issued its decision. In\n\nthese uncharted waters, ascertainment of the appropriate level of\n\nreview presents a vexing question.\n\n           Deferring the answers to difficult procedural questions\n\nuntil the law develops is often the path of prudence.           We have the\n\nluxury of taking that path here because nothing turns on the\n\nstandard of review.       Even were we to accept the respondent's\n\nargument and evaluate the state court's resolution of the Sixth\n\nAmendment claim through the AEDPA's more deferential prism, we\n\nwould conclude that the petitioner is entitled to relief. Thus, we\n\nassume for ease in administration — but do not decide — that the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fAEDPA's \"unreasonable application\" standard pertains to the state\n\ncourts' resolution of the Sixth Amendment claim.\n\n              This    brings   us    to    the    merits     of    the   respondent's\n\ncontention that even if the petitioner's conviction did not become\n\nfinal until 2002 and Gray therefore applies, the trial justice's\n\nruling was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of\n\nGray. This argument requires us to exercise the trilogy of Supreme\n\nCourt cases that collectively constitute the controlling precedents\n\nfor the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim.                         This trilogy\n\nincludes Bruton, Richardson, and Gray.                      We start with a brief\n\nsynopsis of each decision.\n\n              In Bruton, the Supreme Court proscribed the introduction\n\nof a nontestifying defendant's extrajudicial statements that are\n\n\"powerfully incriminating\" as to a jointly-tried codefendant.                      391\n\nU.S. at 135.         The Court made pellucid that the vice inherent in\n\nsuch a tactic cannot reliably be abated through the use of limiting\n\ninstructions.        Id. (explaining that \"the risk that the jury will\n\nnot, or cannot, follow [such] instructions is so great, and the\n\nconsequences     of    failure      so    vital   to   the    defendant,    that   the\n\npractical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be\n\nignored\").\n\n              In Richardson, the Court refined the Bruton rule.                    It\n\nheld   that    \"the    Confrontation        Clause     is    not   violated   by   the\n\nadmission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession with a proper\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\flimiting instruction when . . . the confession is redacted to\n\neliminate not only the [objecting] defendant's name, but any\n\nreference to his or her existence.\"                    481 U.S. 211.        Under this\n\nrefinement, \"[s]tatements that are incriminating only when linked\n\nto other evidence in the case do not trigger application of\n\nBruton's preclusionary rule.\"               United States v. Vega Molina, 407\n\nF.3d 511, 520 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Richardson left open the question of whether Bruton's\n\nprophylaxis      extended     to    a     statement      in   which   the    objecting\n\ndefendant's   name      has   been      replaced       with   a   symbol    or   neutral\n\npronoun.   Gray answered that question, holding that \"redactions\n\nthat   replace    a    proper      name    with   an    obvious    blank,     the   word\n\n'delete,' a symbol, or similarly notify the jury that a name has\n\nbeen deleted are similar enough to Bruton's unredacted confessions\n\nas to warrant the same legal results.\"                   523 U.S. at 195.           Under\n\nthis   regime,    an    inquiring         court   must    judge    the     efficacy   of\n\nredaction on a case-by-case basis, paying careful attention to both\n\na statement's text and the context in which it is offered.                          Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d at 520.\n\n           In this corner of the law, one size does not fit all.\n\nOne case may involve numerous actors and events, such that no\n\ncompelling inference can be drawn that a symbol or neutral pronoun\n\nrefers to a specific defendant.              A different case may involve few\n\nactors and events, such that a symbol or neutral pronoun becomes\n\n\n                                           -35-\n\ftransparent and leaves little doubt in the listener's mind about\n\nthe identity of the person whose name has been removed.\n\n           This brings us to the instant case.                  In affirming the\n\ntrial justice's admission of Logan's statement, the Appeals Court\n\nwrote:\n\n           Foxworth's reliance [on Bruton] is misplaced,\n           however, because (a) the challenged statement\n           as redacted did not name or necessarily\n           implicate    Foxworth;   (b)   it    was   not\n           \"powerfully\"    inculpatory,    since    Logan\n           concededly had left the premises before and\n           did not personally observe the shooting; (c)\n           the Commonwealth's case rested primarily on\n           the eyewitness identification of Foxworth as\n           the shooter; (d) the prosecutor did not use\n           the statement as substantive evidence against\n           Foxworth but rather against Logan and in\n           support of a joint venture theory; and (e) the\n           judge provided an appropriate instruction to\n           obviate the Bruton concerns.\n\nEvaluating   the     Appeals    Court's     ruling       against       Bruton     and\n\nRichardson, we hold that it was not an unreasonable application of\n\nclearly established Federal law.          See infra Part II(C)(3).              Thus,\n\nthe   petitioner's   claim     depends    wholly    on    the    refinement       and\n\nextension of the doctrine that Gray heralded.\n\n           Here    (as   in    the   district      court),       the    petitioner\n\nchallenges   the   Appeals     Court's    recitation      on    several    levels,\n\nprimarily arguing that the redacted statement left no doubt as to\n\nhis identity and, in the bargain, powerfully incriminated him.                     He\n\nsucceeded in convincing the district court that the Appeals Court's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\frejection of this challenge constituted an unreasonable application\n\nof Gray.    See Foxworth I, slip op. at 19.\n\n            The respondent assigns error, maintaining that Gray and\n\nthis case are horses of a different hue.       In a sense, that is so.\n\nIn Gray, the redaction — a blank space — was clear on the face of\n\nthe statement.    Here, a clumsy attempt was made to redact Logan's\n\nstatement in a way that might serve to conceal from the jury the\n\nfact that a redaction had been made.\n\n            Still, this difference seems to be of little moment.          As\n\nsaid, this is an \"unreasonable application\" case; thus, the mere\n\nexistence of a slight factual distinction does not signify that the\n\nstatement    in   question    necessarily   spins    outside      of   Gray's\n\nprecedential orbit.     What matters is that the situation at hand\n\nfits   comfortably   within    the    parameters    of   Gray's    doctrinal\n\nteachings.\n\n            We have carefully examined both the text of the redacted\n\nstatement and the context in which it was admitted.            We conclude\n\nthat its admission was an unreasonable application of Gray.              Our\n\nreasons follow.\n\n            First, the redaction is obvious.        In and of itself, the\n\nuse of the designation \"Mr. X\" would have caused any rational juror\n\nto raise an eyebrow.    See United States v. Peterson, 140 F.3d 819,\n\n822 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding Bruton error where \"person X\" was\n\nsubstituted for defendant's name); see also Malinski v. New York,\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\f324 U.S. 401, 430 (1945) (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (describing\n\nsubstitution of a name in a confession with \"X\" or \"Y\" as \"devices\n\n. . . so obvious as perhaps to emphasize the identity of those they\n\npurported to conceal\").\n\n           Here, however, we need not muse about raised eyebrows and\n\nother such subtleties.           Detective Flynn drove this point home,\n\ntestifying that \"Mr. X\" was a substitute for the name of the person\n\nactually identified by Logan. Furthermore, the prosecutor referred\n\nto   Logan's    statement   as    \"the    redacted     statement.\"      To   cinch\n\nmatters, the copy given to the jury had the phrase \"Mr. X\" in a\n\ndifferent font (which did not exactly fit the spaces left by the\n\nexcision of the petitioner's name).               It follows inexorably from\n\nthese facts that the use of the pseudonym \"Mr. X\" represented an\n\n\"obvious deletion\" that \"encourag[ed] the jury to speculate about\n\nthe reference.\"     Gray, 523 U.S. at 193.\n\n           With knowledge of the redaction, it was child's play for\n\nthe jury to identify the petitioner as \"Mr. X.\"                 There were only\n\nthree defendants — Logan, Christian, and the petitioner — and no\n\nother suspects. Logan, as the author of the statement, could not\n\nhave been \"Mr. X.\" Flynn's testimony unambiguously eliminated\n\nChristian from consideration.            That left the petitioner.\n\n           Of    course,    the    fact    that   it    was   obvious   that   the\n\npetitioner was \"Mr. X\" does not necessarily render Logan's redacted\n\nstatement powerfully incriminating. In this regard, the respondent\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\fpoints out that the statement did not designate \"Mr. X\" as the\n\nshooter.    That disclaimer is true as far as it goes, but it does not\n\ntake the respondent very far.\n\n            To recapitulate, the redacted statement revealed that \"Mr.\n\nX\" had gone to McLean's apartment because McLean had sold him some\n\nbad cocaine; once there, \"Mr. X\" argued with McLean; then, after\n\n\"Mr. X\" had departed, Logan saw him reentering the building with a\n\ngun   tucked   into     his   waistband;    and   shots    were    heard   shortly\n\nthereafter.       Given the chain of events chronicled in Logan's\n\nredacted statement, the inference that the petitioner shot McLean\n\nwas virtually inescapable.         As a practical matter, the statement\n\ndirectly implicated the petitioner and powerfully incriminated him.6\n\nUnder Gray, the redacted statement should have been excluded.\n\n            That conclusion does not end our odyssey. Even though the\n\nadmission    of   the   redacted   statement      violated    Gray,    the   AEDPA\n\nstandard    requires     more   than    a   showing   of   trial    error.     See\n\nMcCambridge, 303 F.3d at 36.           At a bare minimum, the error must be\n\nsufficiently egregious to comprise an unreasonable application of\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        The Appeals Court made much of the trial justice's\ninstructions limiting the jury's use of the statement to the case\nagainst Logan. Where a nontestifying codefendant's statement is\npowerfully incriminating, however, a limiting instruction is cold\ncomfort. See Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135. That is especially so in\nthis case since Logan was charged with murder under a joint-venture\ntheory, and the petitioner was a likely candidate for membership in\nany such joint venture.\n\n                                        -39-\n\fclearly established federal constitutional principles.         28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).     That standard is satisfied here.\n\n             We need not tarry.   The range of reasonable outcomes here\n\nis small because the applicable constitutional rule — explained in\n\nGray — is narrow, see United States v. Thayer, 204 F.3d 1352, 1355\n\n(11th Cir. 2000) (describing Bruton rule as \"narrow\").       The outcome\n\nreached by the Appeals Court (albeit understandable because Gray had\n\nnot yet been decided) is patently offensive to that rule.       There is\n\nsimply no way to defend it: the inferences necessary to conclude\n\nthat the petitioner was \"Mr. X\" and that \"Mr. X\" was the shooter are\n\nnose-on-the-face plain, and the inculpatory thrust of the statement\n\nis potent. We hold, therefore, that if the state conviction was not\n\nfinal until 2002, Gray applies; and, applying Gray to this case, it\n\nwould run afoul of clearly established Federal law to find no\n\nviolation of Gray on these facts.\n\n             As a rear-guard action, the respondent suggests that any\n\nSixth Amendment violation was harmless.           This suggestion lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n             Once again, we pause to clarify the applicable standard\n\nof review.    Although the Appeals Court did not find a Bruton error,\n\nit nevertheless hedged its bets.          It added that \"[e]ven if there\n\nwere error, [in connection with the admission of Logan's statement],\n\nit was harmless, because the evidence related to a noncrucial issue\n\n. . . and was at most merely cumulative of evidence properly before\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fthe jury.\"    The court cited Commonwealth v. Sinnott, 507 N.E.2d 699\n\n(Mass. 1987), which holds that a Bruton error does not require\n\nreversal if it was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"               Id. at\n\n705.   In other words, it applied the federal standard for harmless\n\nconstitutional error applicable on direct review.              See Chapman v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).\n\n             That determination of harmlessness does not engender AEDPA\n\ndeference.     The Supreme Court recently instructed federal habeas\n\ncourts to perform a straightforward harmless error analysis under\n\nBrecht, 507 U.S. at 638,           rather than review a state court's\n\nharmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt                     determination        for\n\nunreasonableness.     Fry v. Pliler, 127 S. Ct. 2321, 2327 (2007); see\n\nDelaney, 522 F.3d at 105.         This is so because the more forgiving\n\nBrecht test subsumes the hybrid Chapman/AEDPA test.              Fry, 127 St.\n\nCt. at 2327.      We proceed accordingly.\n\n             On collateral review of trial error, the test for harmless\n\nerror is whether the error had a \"substantial and injurious effect\n\nor influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"             Sinnott v. Duval,\n\n139 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637).\n\nThe burden of establishing harmlessness rests with the state qua\n\nrespondent.      O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 437 (1995).         If the\n\nhabeas   court    entertains     \"grave   doubt   as   to   harmlessness,   the\n\npetitioner must win.\"      Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\f             The identification of the shooter was the pivotal issue\n\nin    this   case.       The   prosecution's        case    in    chief,    though\n\nconstitutionally sufficient, was painfully thin.                  See supra Part\n\nII(B).    Other than Logan's statement, the only evidence bearing on\n\nidentification was Hobson's testimony.            That testimony was scarcely\n\nunassailable.        Logan's statement bolstered Hobson's account by\n\nplacing the petitioner at the murder scene, armed and with a motive,\n\nimmediately before the shooting. It also supported Hobson's version\n\nof the events leading up to the slaying as it suggested that McLean\n\nwas chased by one man rather than two.\n\n             At the trial-court level, this case was close.                In close\n\ncases, there is often a tipping point. We think that it is probable\n\nthat Logan's statement tipped the balance.                  The statement lent\n\nsignificant weight to the word of the lone witness who identified\n\nthe petitioner as the shooter and, as the Bruton Court recognized,\n\n391 U.S. at 135, the trial justice's limiting instructions were not\n\nan    effective    safeguard   against      the    jury's    exposure      to    such\n\npowerfully incriminating evidence.                Indeed, the impact of the\n\nstatement is adequately evinced by the fact that the jury convicted\n\nthe petitioner while acquitting Logan.\n\n             In sum, we agree with the district court, Foxworth I, slip\n\nop. at 23, that the admission of the redacted statement likely had\n\na    substantial   and   injurious   influence       on    the   outcome    of    the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\fproceedings. At the very least, there is grave doubt. Accordingly,\n\nthe petitioner is entitled to a new trial if Gray applies.\n\n             3.    The Effect if 1996 is the Date of Finality.               If the\n\npetitioner's conviction became final in 1996 rather than final in\n\n2002, the case plays out differently. Because the Supreme Court had\n\nnot yet decided Gray,7 the relevant \"clearly established Federal\n\nlaw\" would be capped by Richardson.               Under that precedent — and\n\nwithout the benefit of Gray — the Appeals Court's decision cannot\n\nbe said to be either contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n\nclearly     established    Supreme      Court   precedent.      After   all,      the\n\nRichardson Court specifically left open the question, implicated in\n\nthis case, of whether a Confrontation Clause problem exists when\n\n\"the defendant's name has been replaced by a symbol or neutral\n\npronoun.\"     481 U.S. at 211 n.5.       The Court's acknowledgment that an\n\nissue remains fairly debatable precludes any credible argument that\n\na   state   court's    decision    on    the    issue   is   contrary   to   or    an\n\nunreasonable       application    of    clearly   established     Supreme     Court\n\nprecedent.8       See L'Abbe v. DiPaolo, 311 F.3d 93, 98 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       We note that the Court has not directed that Gray should be\napplied retroactively.    See Teague, 489 U.S. at 310; see also\nGarcia v. United States, 278 F.3d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir. 2002)\n(refusing to apply Gray retroactively).\n      8\n       The closeness of the question left open in Richardson is\nemphasized by the fact that in the subsequent decision in Gray four\njustices dissented.     See Gray, 523 U.S. at 200 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n                                        -43-\n\f           4.   The Decision to Certify.        It thus appears that the\n\ndate of finality, which will determine whether Gray or Richardson\n\nis the controlling precedent, will be dispositive of this aspect of\n\nthe respondent's appeal.        The SJC has offered no real guidance on\n\nthat issue, and the correct answer remains shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, the case is obviously important: a murder conviction hangs\n\nin the balance. Consequently, we deem it appropriate to certify the\n\nquestion concerning the date of finality to the SJC.            See, e.g., In\n\nre Engage, Inc., 544 F.3d 50, 57 n.10 (1st Cir. 2008) (approving sua\n\nsponte certification in appropriate cases); Brown v. Crown Equip.\n\nCorp., 501 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 2007) (similar).\n\n           This case fits the model for certification.                We may\n\ncertify doubtful questions to a state supreme court in cases, such\n\nas this, where we find no controlling precedent, where the answer\n\nis unclear, and where the answer will be determinative of an issue\n\nin the litigation.      See Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., 529\n\nF.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2008); Nieves v. Univ. of P.R., 7 F.3d 270, 274\n\n(1st   Cir.   1993).     And,    moreover,    the   SJC   has   indicated   a\n\nwillingness,    under    such    circumstances,     to    answer   certified\n\nquestions.    See Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.     For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reverse the district court's ukase holding the evidence of the\n\npetitioner's guilt insufficient.           At the same time, however, we\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\fwithhold decision on the district court's ruling that the petitioner\n\nis entitled to relief on the basis of a Sixth Amendment violation.\n\nThe outcome of that question turns on whether the petitioner's\n\nconviction became final in 1996 or 2002.   We certify that question\n\nto the SJC as per the order filed in conjunction herewith.   Pending\n\nthat court's response, we retain appellate jurisdiction.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\f",

This   habeas   appeal     presents\n\nseveral challenging questions.              Two of these are particularly\n\nintriguing.     The first involves the effect of an eyewitness's\n\nexpression of less than complete certitude about a crucial out-of-\n\ncourt identification that he previously made.                    The second is a\n\nmulti-part question. The initial part deals with the cut-off point\n\nfor determining what constitutes \"clearly established Federal law\"\n\nwithin the purview of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), a provision of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.\n\nL. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.                 The next part of that question\n\nconcerns the selection of the relevant precedent from the Supreme\n\nCourt's evolving Confrontation Clause jurisprudence — a question\n\nmade relevant by the Supreme Court's decision, in 1998, of Gray v.\n\nMaryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118184\"><a href=\"/opinion/118184/gray-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).              Because Gray has not been made\n\nretroactive to cases under collateral review, this case turns on\n\nthe   applicability     vel    non   of    that    precedent     to   the   redacted\n\nstatement of a nontestifying codefendant under circumstances in\n\nwhich his objecting codefendant's name has been replaced with a\n\ncryptic designation (\"Mr. X\").            As matters turn out, the answer to\n\nthis part of the inquiry depends on the answer to the initial part.\n\n           These questions arise in the context of a state-court\n\nconviction for second-degree murder. In the proceedings below the\n\ndistrict court, acting under habeas jurisdiction, granted relief\n\nbecause   it   deemed    the    evidence         insufficient    to   support   the\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fconviction and, secondarily, because it deemed the admission of the\n\nnontestifying codefendant's statement violative of the petitioner's\n\nrights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.

BACKGROUND\n\n           Because this appeal involves a challenge to evidentiary\n\nsufficiency, we rehearse the facts in the light most compatible\n\nwith the verdict rendered by the state-court jury, consistent with\n\nrecord support. See Jackson v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1979).\n\nIn   a   wrinkle   peculiar   to   the   exercise   of   federal   habeas\n\njurisdiction we grant a presumption of correctness to the state\n\ncourts' factual determinations.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n\n           Roxbury is an enclave in Boston, Massachusetts.         On May\n\n23, 1991, a group of men went to the Roxbury home of Kenneth McLean\n\nbent on buying drugs.   After they arrived, matters got out of hand.\n\nApparently, McLean was beaten.       He then broke free and ran.      At\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fleast one of the men chased McLean and shot him as he fled.\n\nMcLean's wounds proved fatal.\n\n            In July of 1991, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted\n\npetitioner-appellee Robert Foxworth for the murder.           By way of a\n\nsuperceding indictment, the grand jury also charged two other men,\n\nTroy Logan and Ronald Christian, with the murder.             As the case\n\nunfolded,   many   of   the   facts    were   undisputed;   the   shooter's\n\nidentity, however, was hotly contested.            This factual dispute\n\nbecame the focal point of the ensuing trial.\n\n            The prosecution's case against the petitioner hinged on\n\nan eyewitness identification by Derek Hobson. The petitioner filed\n\na pretrial motion to suppress the identification testimony.             His\n\nmotion was denied.\n\n            At trial, Hobson testified that, at approximately 6:00\n\np.m. on May 23, he was walking down Brookford Street in Roxbury.\n\nHe observed a man run out of a building located at 5 Brookford\n\nStreet.   The man yelled: \"Those people are crazy.\"         Then, another\n\nman (later identified as Kenneth McLean) exited the premises and\n\nran pell-mell down the street.        He had blood on his mouth and tape\n\non one arm.\n\n            Not heroically inclined, Hobson hid behind a car parked\n\ndirectly across from 5 Brookford Street.         From that vantage point,\n\nhe observed another man emerge from the building with a gun.          That\n\nman fired three or four shots at McLean, who collapsed.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Hobson saw the shooter for at least forty seconds from a\n\ndistance of approximately fifteen to twenty feet.          When the police\n\narrived, he described the shooter as a medium-complected black\n\nmale, six feet or six feet one inch in height, weighing one hundred\n\nforty pounds, and sporting a one inch \"tail\" that protruded from\n\nthe back of his head.     At trial, Hobson added that the shooter was\n\nwearing a black baseball cap and that the \"tail\" stuck out from\n\nunder the back of the cap.\n\n           On June 17, Detective Daniel Flynn, the officer in charge\n\nof the investigation, visited Hobson and presented him with a photo\n\narray.     The    array   contained    twenty    photographs,     including\n\nphotographs of all three men eventually accused of the murder.\n\nHobson   selected   the   petitioner's    photograph   from     the   array,\n\nidentifying him as the shooter.       Flynn testified that Hobson acted\n\n\"without hesitation.\"\n\n           Later that month, the police showed Hobson another photo\n\narray. Once more, Hobson selected the petitioner's photograph from\n\nthe array and identified him as the shooter.\n\n           At    trial,   Hobson   did   not    make   a   live   in-court\n\nidentification but confirmed that the petitioner was the person he\n\nhad identified from the photo arrays.           On cross-examination, he\n\nacknowledged that he had not seen the shooter head-on but had \"seen\n\nthe whole like side of his face.\"        He also admitted that he had\n\nbased his selections from the photo arrays in part on the fact that\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe man he remembered had a \"tail\" (and the petitioner was the only\n\nperson with a \"tail\" whose picture was displayed). When pressed by\n\ndefense counsel to gauge his confidence in the identification,\n\nHobson stated that he was \"eighty percent sure.\"\n\n          Anthony McAfee, who was strolling along with Hobson\n\nimmediately before the shooting, testified that he first observed\n\na man running from the house, yelling \"[t]hose people are crazy.\"\n\nThen, McLean scampered from the building.   Two other men followed.\n\nOne of that pair got into a car parked at the curb on Brookford\n\nStreet and passed a black object to the other man.      The latter\n\nproceeded to fire five or six shots at McLean.          When Flynn\n\npresented McAfee with the same photo array that he initially had\n\npresented to Hobson, McAfee identified Logan as the man who handed\n\nover the black object.   McAfee could not identify the shooter.\n\n          The petitioner had filed a pretrial motion to sever his\n\ntrial from that of his codefendants.    He premised that motion on\n\nthe potential prejudice inherent in a statement made by Logan to\n\nthe police.   The motion was unsuccessful, and the statement was\n\nprominently featured at the joint trial.\n\n          Detective Flynn read the statement into evidence over the\n\npetitioner's timely objection.    In an effort to avert the feared\n\nprejudice, the trial justice ordered redaction of the statement.\n\nIn its redacted form, the petitioner's name was replaced with the\n\npseudonym \"Mr. X\" and the statement was altered so that, after the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffirst reference to \"Mr. X,\" it appeared (falsely) that Logan had\n\nstated: \"Cause that's how I know him by.            I don't know his real\n\nname.\"   The trial justice also admitted a copy of the redacted\n\nstatement into evidence.\n\n           In the statement, Logan related that, on the evening in\n\nquestion, he met two men named \"Tea Lover\" and \"Mr. X\" at a\n\nsandwich shop.     \"Tea Lover\" and Logan resolved to go to McLean's\n\napartment to buy cocaine.       \"Mr. X\" accompanied them because McLean\n\nowed him money as a result of a prior sale of \"bad\" cocaine.\n\nShortly after the group's arrival, \"Mr. X\" and McLean argued. \"Mr.\n\nX\" left the premises.     Logan opted to do likewise.          As he made his\n\nway downstairs, \"Mr. X\" was coming back upstairs.              Logan noticed\n\nthat \"Mr. X\" had a gun tucked into his waistband.             Logan continued\n\nhis descent and, as he was getting into a cab, heard shots.\n\n           The statement indicated that Logan had identified \"Mr. X\"\n\nfrom a photo array.     Flynn testified that the photo array was the\n\nsame one that had been employed earlier in the investigation.               On\n\ncross-examination by Christian's counsel, Flynn revealed that the\n\ndesignation \"Mr. X\" did not refer to Christian.          Moreover, it was\n\na   replacement   for   the   name   Logan   actually   had     used   in   his\n\nstatement.\n\n           The    prosecution    offered     the   redacted    statement    as\n\nevidence only against Logan.         The trial justice gave a limiting\n\ninstruction both after the reading of the redacted statement and\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fbefore jury deliberations began.       The gist of the instruction was\n\ntwofold: that the statement could only be considered against Logan\n\n(who was being tried on a \"joint venture\" theory) and that the jury\n\nshould not speculate about who \"Mr. X\" might be.\n\n           At the close of the prosecution's case, each of the three\n\ndefendants moved for a required finding of not guilty.              The trial\n\njustice granted Christian's motion in its entirety and granted the\n\nother defendants' motions with respect to the charge of first-\n\ndegree murder.    These rulings preserved the second-degree murder\n\ncharges against the petitioner and Logan.          On March 31, 1992, the\n\njury convicted the petitioner and acquitted Logan.              In due course,\n\nthe trial justice sentenced the petitioner to life imprisonment.\n\n           The petitioner filed a new trial motion under Mass. R.\n\nCrim. P. 30.      The motion alleged a Bruton violation based on\n\nadmission of Logan's statement.            It also cited purported newly\n\ndiscovered   evidence,     alleged     prosecutorial       misconduct,    and\n\nchallenged the photo spread used to identify the petitioner.              The\n\ntrial   justice   denied   the   motion      on   August   8,    1994.    The\n\npetitioner's timely direct appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt from the conviction, which advanced similar claims, was\n\nconsolidated with his subsequent appeal from the denial of the\n\nmotion.   On October 21, 1996, the Appeals Court, in an unpublished\n\ndecision, affirmed both the conviction and the denial of the new\n\ntrial motion.\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           The petitioner had twenty days in which to seek further\n\nreview by the SJC by filing an application for leave to obtain\n\nfurther appellate review (ALOFAR).    Mass. R. App. P. 27.1(a).   The\n\npetitioner made no such filing within the prescribed period.\n\n           Ordinarily, then, the conviction would have become final\n\nin 1996.   Here, however, the petitioner some four years later (on\n\nOctober 25, 2000) filed a pro se ALOFAR in the SJC seeking further\n\nreview of the Appeals Court decision.    The pro se ALOFAR included\n\na \"motion to file late application for further appellate review,\"\n\nwhich asked the SJC to excuse his untimely filing on two grounds.\n\n           The pro se ALOFAR argued that the petitioner's Sixth\n\nAmendment rights under Bruton had been violated by the introduction\n\nof Logan's statement but made no mention of Gray (which had been\n\ndecided on March 9, 1998).   The ALOFAR also raised several other\n\nchallenges to the 1996 Appeals Court ruling, none of which are\n\nmaterial here.\n\n           The SJC did not rule either on the ALOFAR or on the\n\npetitioner's motion to file out of time because, on November 15,\n\n2000, the petitioner asked the SJC to stay consideration of his\n\nALOFAR pending the resolution of a second new trial motion.       The\n\nSJC granted the petitioner's request for a stay on February 1,\n\n2001, and ordered petitioner to file regular status reports on the\n\nprogress of his second new trial motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f            The petitioner filed his second new trial motion before\n\nthe trial court on December 11, 2000.    That motion, filed pursuant\n\nto Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, attacked the conviction on four grounds.\n\nFirst, it claimed, based on a later affidavit by McAfee, that the\n\nprosecutor knowingly and intentionally used perjured testimony and\n\nallowed false evidence to go uncorrected.    Second, it claimed that\n\nthe petitioner's previous counsel provided ineffective assistance\n\nbecause he failed to submit affidavits anent newly discovered\n\nevidence.    Third, it claimed that the trial justice erred in not\n\ninstructing the jury on manslaughter.    Fourth, it claimed that the\n\njudge gave an incorrect instruction as to malice.\n\n            After the trial court denied the second new trial motion,\n\nthe Appeals Court, on April 17, 2002, affirmed the decision,\n\nholding that all the claims in the second new trial motion were\n\neither previously decided or waived.\n\n            The petitioner then moved to consolidate his appeal from\n\nthe denial of the second new trial motion with his previous ALOFAR.\n\nThe SJC appointed counsel on May 22, 2002, and on May 28 granted\n\nthe petitioner's motion to extend the time for filing to June 24,\n\n2002.   On June 27, 2002, counsel informed the SJC that an amended\n\nALOFAR would be filed.\n\n            On July 22, 2002, the petitioner filed a \"motion to file\n\nan amended FAR application late,\" which was allowed by a docket\n\nnotation of the same day, without comment.      It appears from the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\frecord     that    the    allowance    of     this   motion    related    to   the\n\npetitioner's non-observance of the June 24 deadline for filing\n\nbriefs.    It is unclear whether that order may have applied to the\n\npetitioner's failure, under Mass. R. App. P. 27.1(a), to file and\n\nALOFAR within twenty days of either the October 21, 1996 Appeals\n\nCourt decision affirming the conviction and the denial of the first\n\nnew trial motion or the April 17, 2002 Appeals Court decision\n\naffirming the denial of the second new trial motion.\n\n            Also     on   July   22,   the   petitioner,      through    appointed\n\ncounsel, filed his amended ALOFAR.            The July 22 amended ALOFAR was\n\nbased primarily on the Bruton claim; here, for the first time, the\n\npetitioner raised Gray as an explicit basis for his claim.                     The\n\namended ALOFAR also raised challenges to the photo array and to the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.             Although the amended ALOFAR was\n\nconsolidated with the appeal from the denial of the second new\n\ntrial motion, it did not raise any challenges to the Appeals\n\nCourt's 2002 decision.\n\n            On September 6, 2002, the SJC denied the ALOFAR without\n\ncomment.\n\n            The petitioner repaired to the federal district court in\n\nsearch of a writ of habeas corpus.              See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244-2254.\n\nNaming an appropriate correctional official as the respondent, his\n\nhabeas petition raised three fully exhausted claims: (i) that his\n\nconviction        violated   due   process      because    the    evidence     was\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconstitutionally insufficient under the rule of Jackson, 443 U.S.\n\nat   319;   (ii)   that   the   use   of    an   unreliable   eyewitness\n\nidentification violated due process, see Neil v.

The court regarded the two-\n\npart inference that \"Mr. X\" was the shooter and that the petitioner\n\nwas \"Mr. X\" as obvious; therefore, \"[t]he statement — given by a\n\ncodefendant with powerful motive to incriminate petitioner, and\n\nunchallenged by cross-examination — violated petitioner's Sixth\n\nAmendment rights.\"    Foxworth I, slip op. at 19.

ANALYSIS\n\n              We begin our substantive discussion by laying out the\n\nground rules for federal habeas review of state-court convictions.\n\nWe then address sequentially the two constitutional claims that are\n\nbefore us.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f                             A. Standards of Review.\n\n            Federal habeas review of a state-court conviction is\n\ngoverned by the AEDPA, which permits federal courts to grant habeas\n\nrelief    after    a    final   state-court      adjudication     of   a    federal\n\nconstitutional claim if that adjudication can be shown to be\n\n\"contrary to,\" or to have involved, \"an unreasonable application\n\nof, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt of the United States\" or in the alternative, to have been\n\n\"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n\nthe evidence presented in the State court proceedings.\"                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d).      In administering these standards, the state court's\n\nfactual findings are presumed to be correct, and they can be\n\novercome    only       by   clear   and    convincing   evidence.

Since the sufficiency issue is essentially the\n\nsame under both federal and state law and the Latimore court\n\ntransplanted the appropriate federal constitutional standard into\n\nthe jurisprudence of Massachusetts, see Latimore, 393 N.E.2d at 374\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f(citing Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318-19), we can confidently apply the\n\nAEDPA standard to this issue.\n\n          The Appeals Court concluded that:\n\n                 The judge properly denied Foxworth's\n          motion for a required finding of not guilty,\n          on the basis, if no other, of the eyewitness\n          testimony identifying Foxworth as the person\n          who shot the fleeing McLean several times and\n          then escaped in a car — testimony that was\n          corroborated in all respects, except the\n          identification of Foxworth as the shooter, by\n          a second eyewitness. That evidence, taken in\n          the light most favorable to the Commonwealth\n          (a premise that Foxworth fails to recognize),\n          was sufficient for a rational jury to find\n          beyond a reasonable doubt that Foxworth was a\n          principal actor in the second degree murder,\n          with malice inferable from the intentional use\n          of a deadly weapon. Foxworth's presentation\n          of an alibi defense did not serve to take the\n          issue from the jury.\n\nThe question, then, is whether this determination constitutes an\n\nunreasonable application of the Jackson standard.\n\n          The petitioner asserts that the only evidence of his\n\ninvolvement was the testimony of a single eyewitness and that this\n\ntestimony lacked the force necessary to prove guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.   The district court agreed; it found multiple\n\nweaknesses in Hobson's testimony, including discrepancies between\n\nhis account and McAfee's, inconsistencies in his description of the\n\nshooter, the lack of an in-court identification, flaws in the photo\n\narray, and the witness's admission that he was less than certain\n\nabout the identification.   See Foxworth III, slip op. at 22.   The\n\nrespondent assigns error to this ruling.\n\n                                -18-\n\f               The question is close, and the district court is correct\n\nthat       Hobson's   testimony     is    the    only    evidence    that    directly\n\nimplicates      the   petitioner     as    the    shooter.1         Nevertheless,     a\n\ncriminal       conviction    can    rest    on    the    testimony     of   a     single\n\neyewitness.       Even if the eyewitness's testimony is uncorroborated\n\nand comes from an individual of dubious veracity, it can suffice to\n\nground a conviction.        See, e.g., Hayes v. Battaglia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789843\"><a href=\"/opinion/789843/clarence-hayes-v-deirdre-battaglia-warden-stateville-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n938 (7th Cir. 2005).          Hobson's first-hand testimony was neither\n\ninherently      improbable    nor    materially         undermined    by    any   other\n\nunimpeachable proof.         It placed the petitioner at the scene of the\n\nmurder and identified him as the shooter.                 No more was exigible to\n\nsatisfy the Jackson standard.\n\n               That is not to say that a rational jury had to accept the\n\neyewitness identification.               Hobson was exposed to a withering\n\ncross-examination, which disclosed a number of weaknesses in his\n\ntestimony.       It is well-established, though, that determining a\n\nwitness's credibility, even in the face of a furious attack, is a\n\nfunction that falls squarely within the province of the jury.

But such discrepancies do not\n\nas a matter of law render a witness's testimony unworthy of belief.\n\nRather, they are for the jury to sort out and weigh.           \"The actual\n\nresolution   of    the   conflicting    evidence,   the     credibility   of\n\nwitnesses,   and   the   plausibility    of   competing    explanations   is\n\nexactly the task to be performed by a rational jury, considering a\n\ncase presented by competent counsel on both sides.\"            Matthews v.\n\nAbramajtys, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780860\"><a href=\"/opinion/780860/lorenzo-matthews-v-joseph-abramajtys-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790 (6th Cir. 2003).            It is rare that a\n\nkey witness survives a murder trial unscathed, and the jurors in\n\nthis case were free to credit Hobson's version of the events or\n\nnot, as they saw fit.\n\n          The absence of an in-court identification does not tip\n\nthe sufficiency scales.     Extrajudicial witness identifications are\n\nroutinely used as substantive evidence of guilt.                See, e.g.,\n\nSamuels v. Mann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660167\"><a href=\"/opinion/660167/robert-samuels-v-louis-f-mann-superintendent-shawangunk-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (2d Cir. 1993); see also Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 801(d)(1)(C) (excluding prior out-of-court identifications\n\nfrom the definition of hearsay).        There is no requirement, either\n\nin the Constitution or in the usual rules that apply to the\n\nadmission of evidence, that a witness who makes an extrajudicial\n\n\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fidentification must repeat the identification in the courtroom.2\n\nConsequently, the fact that Hobson never identified the petitioner\n\nat trial does not alter the constitutional calculus.\n\n                 The petitioner offers a closely related argument.              He\n\nmaintains that Hobson's out-of-court identification was itself so\n\nunreliable that a rational jury could not rely on it.                    In this\n\nregard, he stresses that the district court characterized the photo\n\narray as suggestive.         See Foxworth III, slip op. at 16.\n\n                 The bottom line, however, is that the district court\n\nconcluded that it was not objectively unreasonable for the state\n\ncourt       to    find   enough   indicia     of   reliability    to   allow   the\n\nintroduction of the identification testimony into evidence without\n\noffending any constitutional safeguard.               See id. at 16-17.        The\n\npetitioner has not challenged that conclusion on appeal.\n\n                 Moreover, the alleged flaws in the photo array were fully\n\nvetted at the trial; the cross-examiner dwelt on them and argued\n\nthe   point       vociferously    to   the   jury.    He   also   exploited    the\n\ntestimony about viewing angles (i.e., that the view Hobson had of\n\nthe petitioner was in profile).              Despite the force of this multi-\n\npronged attack, the jury credited Hobson's identification.                      On\n\n\n\n        2\n       This paradigm makes good sense: it is designed to facilitate\nthe introduction of eyewitness identifications made \"when memory\nwas fresher and there had been less opportunity for influence to be\nexerted upon [the witness].\"     United States v.

Ramonez, 490\n\nF.3d at 490.\n\n             Finally, the district court gave significant weight to\n\nthe fact that Hobson admitted that he was only \"eighty percent\n\nsure\" of his identification.         The court reasoned that even if the\n\ntestimony was fully credited by the jury, it carried with it a\n\nsignificant     measure     of   doubt    and,    therefore,    \"it    would    be\n\nirrational to find that fact beyond a reasonable doubt [when] the\n\neyewitness himself was not sure of the fact . . . .\"                Foxworth III,\n\nslip op. at 24-25. On appeal, the respondent savages this analysis\n\nwhile the petitioner embraces it.\n\n             Although the district court's reasoning has a patina of\n\nplausibility, it does not withstand close scrutiny.                        A prior\n\nidentification is not stripped of probative force merely because\n\nthe witness confesses that he harbors some doubt about it.                     Cf.\n\nSamuels, 13 F.3d at 527 (holding that a jury could credit a\n\nwitness's     earlier     identification     of    the   defendant     over    the\n\nwitness's in-court identification of a different person).                      The\n\nwitness's certainty vel non is properly viewed as a factor that\n\nmust be evaluated by the jury as the trier of the facts — but a\n\njury is no more bound to find reasonable doubt based on an\n\neyewitness's profession that he is \"eighty percent certain\" than it\n\nwould   be   bound   to    accept   the   identification       if    the   witness\n\nprofessed to being \"one hundred percent certain.\"\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f               This conclusion is rooted in human experience and common\n\nsense.     Self-esteem is a wild card.          Some witnesses may be over-\n\nconfident about their powers of perception or recall; others may be\n\ndiffident or overly cautious.          Moreover, \"some witnesses verbalize\n\ntheir assurances of being correct with more positiveness than\n\nothers.\"       United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349663\"><a href=\"/opinion/349663/united-states-v-henry-albert-smith-united-states-of-america-v-roderick/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1363 (9th Cir.\n\n1977).    And, finally, there is no necessary correlation between a\n\nwitness's        self-confidence       and     the   correctness     of    his\n\nidentification.       In the last analysis, it is up to the jury to\n\ngauge    the     accuracy   of   an    identification,   factoring    in   any\n\nprotestations of assurance or self-doubt.3\n\n               In this case, there is no principled way to label the\n\njury's choice as irrational.             Hobson selected the petitioner's\n\npicture from each of two separate (constitutionally adequate) photo\n\narrays.     The first time, he signed the back of the photograph to\n\nconfirm the identification.           Detective Flynn testified that Hobson\n\nacted \"without hesitation.\"           He later made a second identification\n\nfrom another photo array. These identifications were made in close\n\nproximity to the time of the murder.            In addition, the petitioner\n\nresembled the general description given by Hobson at that time.\n\nHobson's subsequent expression of less than complete certitude\n\nabout the identifications came nearly a year later (after his\n\n\n     3\n      The trial justice instructed the jurors that the identity of\nthe shooter was of paramount importance in this case and that it\nwas up to them to decide the accuracy of Hobson's identification.\n\n                                        -23-\n\fmemory   arguably   had    dulled).      Given   the    totality   of     the\n\ncircumstances, we conclude that Hobson's eyewitness testimony could\n\nreasonably be thought to comprise part of a constitutionally\n\nadequate foundation for the ensuing conviction.\n\n           Of course, the fact that each weakness in Hobson's\n\ntestimony can be overcome does not mean that, in the aggregate,\n\nthey can be overcome.      Cf. Bourjaily v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179-80 (1987) (explaining that \"individual pieces of evidence,\n\ninsufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation\n\nprove it\"). The district court made this point quite forcefully.\n\nSee Foxworth III, slip op. at 25-26.      Under the AEDPA, however, the\n\nquestion is not whether the outcome reached by the state court is\n\ncorrect in an absolute sense but, rather, the reasonableness of\n\nthat court's application of clearly established Federal law in\n\nreaching that outcome.     See Hurtado, 245 F.3d at 20.\n\n           We mention one last point.            We have said that the\n\nunderlying constitutional question is close.

That   is\n\nespecially so when the state court is tasked with applying a\n\ngeneral standard, such as that contemplated by Jackson.                   See\n\nYarborough, 541 U.S. at 664; see also Wright v. West, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112771\"><a href=\"/opinion/112771/wright-v-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\f308 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (identifying Jackson as enunciating\n\na   general    standard).    The   generalized        nature   of   the   Jackson\n\nstandard reinforces our conclusion that it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe Appeals Court to hold that Hobson's testimony, together with\n\nthe other evidence of record, was sufficient to undergird the\n\nconviction.\n\n              The petitioner, ably represented, tries yet another tack.\n\nArguing for a finding of unreasonableness, he emphasizes the\n\npaucity of reasoning in the Appeals Court's decision. In his view,\n\nthis perceived flaw is aggravated by that court's ostensible\n\noverstatement of the corrobative effect of McAfee's testimony.\n\nThese arguments have some bite but, on habeas review, the ultimate\n\ninquiry is not the degree to which the state court's decision is or\n\nis not smoothly reasoned; the ultimate inquiry is whether the\n\noutcome is reasonable.       See Hurtado, 245 F.3d at 20.            A sparsely\n\nreasoned state-court decision may set off warning bells, but such\n\na decision does not necessarily mean that the outcome represents an\n\nunreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.                 Id.\n\n              So it is here. Although the Appeals Court's reasoning on\n\nthis   issue    seems   perfunctory    (a    single    paragraph    with   scant\n\nanalysis), the outcome reached by the court appears to be both\n\nplausible and adequately supported.           Phrased in the idiom of the\n\nAEDPA, we cannot say on this record that the outcome was an\n\nunreasonable application of the Jackson standard.              Accordingly, we\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\freverse the district court's decision insofar as it purposes to\n\ngrant the petitioner relief on this claim.\n\n                C.    Sixth Amendment: Confrontation.\n\n          The petitioner argued below that the trial justice's\n\naffirmed ruling allowing Logan's redacted statement into evidence\n\nviolated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.        The district\n\ncourt concurred with the petitioner's appraisal.    Foxworth I, slip\n\nop. at 19.   The respondent takes exception.\n\n          To begin, the panel has identified a pivotal issue\n\nconcerning the date upon which the petitioner's conviction became\n\nfinal; that is, the date when the process of direct review of the\n\nconviction in the state courts was exhausted.    The district court,\n\nbelieving that the respondent had conceded the point, assumed that\n\nthe conviction became final in 2002 (when the SJC denied the\n\namended ALOFAR).     See Foxworth I, slip op. at 4 n.3.    The parties\n\nhave not explicitly addressed the date of finality in their briefs\n\nin this court (although the respondent consistently has argued that\n\nGray should not be applied retroactively to this case).        For our\n\npart, we have been unable either to locate an outright concession\n\nor to agree upon an answer to the finality question of when direct\n\nreview ended.   As we explain below, the issue turns out to be a\n\ndispositive one.4\n\n\n     4\n       There is some room for doubt as to whether the respondent\nhas waived or forfeited the date-of-finality issue by failing to\ncontest the district court's unfounded statement, by failing to\n\n                                 -26-\n\f           1.    The Finality Question.    We set the stage.     In federal\n\nhabeas cases, there is a requirement, spelled out in 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d), that a state-court decision be measured against \"clearly\n\nestablished Federal law, as determined by Supreme Court of the\n\nUnited States.\"     In most cases (and, specifically, in this case),\n\nthe date of finality of the state court conviction determines the\n\ntime line to be used for determining what Supreme Court decisions\n\ncomprise the corpus of this \"clearly established Federal law.\"\n\n           Here, the jury convicted the petitioner on March 31,\n\n1992; the petitioner's first new trial motion was denied on August\n\n8, 1994; and both the conviction and the denial of the first new\n\ntrial motion were affirmed by the Appeals Court on October 21,\n\n1996.   The normal time for seeking direct review of that decision\n\nexpired twenty days later.       See Mass. R. App. P. 27.1(a).            The\n\npetitioner took no action; and his conviction became final.               At\n\nthat time, the Supreme Court's Confrontation Clause jurisprudence\n\nincluded Bruton and Richardson v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).\n\n           The    petitioner   applied    for   leave   to   obtain   further\n\nappellate review four years later (on October 25, 2000).              In that\n\n\n\nraise the issue squarely in his appellate briefs, and/or by his\ncounsel's statements at oral argument in this court. The panel is\ndivided on this point: Chief Judge Lynch and Judge Siler find\nneither waiver nor forfeiture; Judge Selya would hold the point\nwaived or, at least, forfeited.    Since a majority of the panel\nbelieves that the question of finality is properly before us, no\nuseful purpose would be served by rehearsing the arguments for and\nagainst waiver.\n\n                                   -27-\n\ftemporal gap, the Supreme Court decided Gray v.

The amended ALOFAR was accompanied by a \"motion to\n\nfile an amended FAR application late,\" which the SJC allowed.                   The\n\nSJC denied further appellate review without comment on September 6,\n\n2002.\n\n              Given this chronology, there are two possible dates of\n\nfinality: November 18, 1996 or September 6, 2002.5                   We know that\n\nthe SJC has the power to overlook the untimeliness of an ALOFAR and\n\nsometimes considers a late application on the merits.                   See, e.g.,\n\nCommonwealth v. O'Neil, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 n.1 (Mass. 2002).                   But\n\nthe   question     is     whether    the   SJC's    actions   here   reopened   the\n\nfinality of the criminal conviction in 2002.               See 2 R. Hertz & J.S.\n\nLiebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice & Procedure § 25.6 (5th ed.\n\n2001) (suggesting that a state court may choose to delay the point\n\n\n\n        5\n      In fact, the latter date may well be extended by ninety days\nto encompass the period in which a petition for certiorari to the\nSupreme Court of the United States could be filed.      See, e.g.,\nGriffith, 479 U.S. at 321 n.6. Because this ninety-day shift makes\nno difference here, we use September 6, 2002 as a convenient\nshorthand.\n\n                                           -28-\n\fof finality of a criminal judgment and that, since the non-\n\nretroactivity doctrine serves the interests of the states, a\n\nfederal court may be required to respect this decision on habeas\n\nreview).\n\n            The answer to these questions will be conclusive here.\n\nAfter all, if the petitioner's conviction became final in 2002,\n\nthen Gray applies because it was decided beforehand.             Otherwise,\n\nRichardson controls.        As we explain below, the result of our\n\nanalysis of the confrontation issue hinges on which of these\n\nprecedents governs.\n\n            2.    The Effect if 2002 is the Date of Finality.          We turn\n\nnext to the effect of a 2002 date of finality on the constitutional\n\npropriety    of    the   trial   justice's   evidentiary     ruling.      The\n\nrespondent consistently has argued that the date for determining\n\nclearly established law was in 1996.          But the respondent gave a\n\nparticular reason, and that reason is wrong: the respondent posits\n\nthat because the SJC summarily denied further appellate review, the\n\ncontours of \"clearly established Federal law\" should be defined\n\nwith reference to the date of the Appeals Court decision (which\n\nantedated    Gray).        The   district    court   found    this     theory\n\nunconvincing, see Foxworth I, slip op. at 5, and so do we.\n\n            The respondent's theory is based on an incorrect premise.\n\nTo support it, the respondent cites Justice O'Connor's locution\n\nthat, under the AEDPA, the term \"clearly established Federal law\"\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fmeans \"the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's\n\ndecisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\"\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 412.           The respondent reads the phrase\n\n\"relevant state-court decision\" as referring for all purposes to\n\nthe last reasoned state-court decision.\n\n           This   reading   is    untenable.      Close   perscrutation    of\n\nWilliams discloses nothing in the Court's constituent opinions that\n\nindicates any intention on Justice O'Connor's part either to modify\n\nor to undercut the bright-line rule of Teague v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 310 (1989) (effectively limiting the consideration of new\n\nconstitutional rules of criminal procedure in cases on collateral\n\nreview to those rules announced before the petitioner's conviction\n\nbecame final).    The opposite is true.         Justice O'Connor's opinion\n\nstated that \"whatever would qualify as an old rule under our Teague\n\njurisprudence will constitute 'clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined   by   the   Supreme   Court    of   the   United   States'   under\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).\"    529 U.S. at 412.     That is a frank recognition that\n\nthe AEDPA has neither altered nor eroded the marker laid down by\n\nTeague.   This recognition is fully consistent with Part III of\n\nJustice Stevens's lead opinion, joined by Justice O'Connor; there,\n\nJustice Stevens stated that \"[t]he threshold question under AEDPA\n\nis whether [the petitioner] seeks to apply a rule of law that was\n\nclearly established at the time his state-court conviction became\n\nfinal.\"   Williams, 529 U.S. at 390 (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\f           Griffith removes any vestige of doubt. We have read that\n\ndecision as establishing that \"[i]f [a] conviction is not yet final\n\nwhen the Supreme Court announces [a] rule, then inferior courts\n\nmust apply that rule to the defendant's case.\"     Derman v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Griffith, 479 U.S.\n\nat 322).   By contrast, if the conviction is already final, then the\n\ndefendant ordinarily — there are special circumstances, but none\n\nthat are relevant here — may not avail himself of the newly\n\nannounced rule.     See Teague, 439 U.S. at 310.   It is, therefore,\n\nevident that finality, not the date of the last reasoned decision,\n\nis the principal determinant of whether a \"new\" rule can be applied\n\nto an \"old\" case.\n\n           Finality means that \"a judgment of conviction has been\n\nrendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a\n\npetition for certiorari [has] elapsed or a petition for certiorari\n\n[filed and] finally denied.\"   Griffith, 479 U.S. at 321 n.6.   Under\n\nthis definition, if the petitioner's conviction was final no\n\nearlier than September 6, 2002, Gray would control.    See Currie v.\n\nMatesanz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199834\"><a href=\"/opinion/199834/currie-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           To recapitulate, both Teague and Griffith remain good\n\nlaw.   Those cases mean what they say.   Together, they lead to the\n\ninexorable conclusion that if the petitioner's conviction was not\n\n\"final\" until after Gray was decided by the Supreme Court, the\n\npetitioner is entitled to the benefit of Gray.\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\f            We    add    a   coda.     While   this   result     is    dictated    by\n\nprecedent, it also makes good sense from a policy standpoint.                      The\n\nconstruct advocated by the respondent would allow a state court to\n\nsubvert Griffith and deny criminal defendants the benefit of new\n\nSupreme Court precedent by the simple expedient of summarily\n\naffirming a lower court's decision.             That would give state courts\n\na perverse incentive to avoid addressing constitutional claims in\n\ncontemporaneous         terms   while     insulating     their        actions    from\n\nsubsequent federal habeas review.              That would be an unattractive\n\nprospect.\n\n            The respondent has yet another string to his bow.                      He\n\nargues that even if Gray applies, the trial justice's ruling should\n\nbe upheld.       Initially, that argument requires us to consider the\n\nstandard of review applicable to the state court's rejection of the\n\nSixth Amendment claim.\n\n            On this point, the respondent urges us to use AEDPA's\n\ncustomary    \"unreasonable           application\"     standard.          28     U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1). The petitioner resists. He notes that this standard\n\napplies only to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits in\n\nState court proceedings.\" Id. § 2254(d).               Because Gray was never\n\naddressed by the state courts, he proposes de novo review.                        See\n\nFortini v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199512\"><a href=\"/opinion/199512/fortini-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir. 2001) (stating that a\n\nfederal court \"can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that\n\nthe state court did not address\"); cf. Brown v. Maloney, 267 F.3d\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f36, 40 (1st Cir. 2001) (declaring that absent \"reasoning on a\n\nholding from the state court on [an] issue,\" it cannot be said that\n\nthe claim was adjudicated on the merits).\n\n           The precise question raised by the dueling arguments is\n\nwhether    a    state-court     decision    disposing     of    a   federal\n\nconstitutional claim on the merits without a reasoned application\n\nof the most pertinent Supreme Court authority is an adjudication\n\nthat   comes   within   the   AEDPA's   purview.   This    is   a   question\n\ndifferent from that which we confronted in Fortini.             The Appeals\n\nCourt, citing Bruton, squarely decided the Sixth Amendment claim\n\nand elaborated its reasoning.           But that decision did not take\n\naccount of Gray; indeed, it could not have done so; the Supreme\n\nCourt decided Gray after the Appeals Court issued its decision. In\n\nthese uncharted waters, ascertainment of the appropriate level of\n\nreview presents a vexing question.\n\n           Deferring the answers to difficult procedural questions\n\nuntil the law develops is often the path of prudence.           We have the\n\nluxury of taking that path here because nothing turns on the\n\nstandard of review.       Even were we to accept the respondent's\n\nargument and evaluate the state court's resolution of the Sixth\n\nAmendment claim through the AEDPA's more deferential prism, we\n\nwould conclude that the petitioner is entitled to relief. Thus, we\n\nassume for ease in administration — but do not decide — that the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fAEDPA's \"unreasonable application\" standard pertains to the state\n\ncourts' resolution of the Sixth Amendment claim.\n\n              This    brings   us    to    the    merits     of    the   respondent's\n\ncontention that even if the petitioner's conviction did not become\n\nfinal until 2002 and Gray therefore applies, the trial justice's\n\nruling was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of\n\nGray. This argument requires us to exercise the trilogy of Supreme\n\nCourt cases that collectively constitute the controlling precedents\n\nfor the petitioner's Confrontation Clause claim.                         This trilogy\n\nincludes Bruton, Richardson, and Gray.                      We start with a brief\n\nsynopsis of each decision.\n\n              In Bruton, the Supreme Court proscribed the introduction\n\nof a nontestifying defendant's extrajudicial statements that are\n\n\"powerfully incriminating\" as to a jointly-tried codefendant.                      391\n\nU.S. at 135.         The Court made pellucid that the vice inherent in\n\nsuch a tactic cannot reliably be abated through the use of limiting\n\ninstructions.        Id. (explaining that \"the risk that the jury will\n\nnot, or cannot, follow [such] instructions is so great, and the\n\nconsequences     of    failure      so    vital   to   the    defendant,    that   the\n\npractical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be\n\nignored\").\n\n              In Richardson, the Court refined the Bruton rule.                    It\n\nheld   that    \"the    Confrontation        Clause     is    not   violated   by   the\n\nadmission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession with a proper\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\flimiting instruction when . . . the confession is redacted to\n\neliminate not only the [objecting] defendant's name, but any\n\nreference to his or her existence.\"                    481 U.S. 211.        Under this\n\nrefinement, \"[s]tatements that are incriminating only when linked\n\nto other evidence in the case do not trigger application of\n\nBruton's preclusionary rule.\"               United States v. Vega Molina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Richardson left open the question of whether Bruton's\n\nprophylaxis      extended     to    a     statement      in   which   the    objecting\n\ndefendant's   name      has   been      replaced       with   a   symbol    or   neutral\n\npronoun.   Gray answered that question, holding that \"redactions\n\nthat   replace    a    proper      name    with   an    obvious    blank,     the   word\n\n'delete,' a symbol, or similarly notify the jury that a name has\n\nbeen deleted are similar enough to Bruton's unredacted confessions\n\nas to warrant the same legal results.\"                   523 U.S. at 195.           Under\n\nthis   regime,    an    inquiring         court   must    judge    the     efficacy   of\n\nredaction on a case-by-case basis, paying careful attention to both\n\na statement's text and the context in which it is offered.                          Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d at 520.\n\n           In this corner of the law, one size does not fit all.\n\nOne case may involve numerous actors and events, such that no\n\ncompelling inference can be drawn that a symbol or neutral pronoun\n\nrefers to a specific defendant.              A different case may involve few\n\nactors and events, such that a symbol or neutral pronoun becomes\n\n\n                                           -35-\n\ftransparent and leaves little doubt in the listener's mind about\n\nthe identity of the person whose name has been removed.\n\n           This brings us to the instant case.                  In affirming the\n\ntrial justice's admission of Logan's statement, the Appeals Court\n\nwrote:\n\n           Foxworth's reliance [on Bruton] is misplaced,\n           however, because (a) the challenged statement\n           as redacted did not name or necessarily\n           implicate    Foxworth;   (b)   it    was   not\n           \"powerfully\"    inculpatory,    since    Logan\n           concededly had left the premises before and\n           did not personally observe the shooting; (c)\n           the Commonwealth's case rested primarily on\n           the eyewitness identification of Foxworth as\n           the shooter; (d) the prosecutor did not use\n           the statement as substantive evidence against\n           Foxworth but rather against Logan and in\n           support of a joint venture theory; and (e) the\n           judge provided an appropriate instruction to\n           obviate the Bruton concerns.\n\nEvaluating   the     Appeals    Court's     ruling       against       Bruton     and\n\nRichardson, we hold that it was not an unreasonable application of\n\nclearly established Federal law.          See infra Part II(C)(3).              Thus,\n\nthe   petitioner's   claim     depends    wholly    on    the    refinement       and\n\nextension of the doctrine that Gray heralded.\n\n           Here    (as   in    the   district      court),       the    petitioner\n\nchallenges   the   Appeals     Court's    recitation      on    several    levels,\n\nprimarily arguing that the redacted statement left no doubt as to\n\nhis identity and, in the bargain, powerfully incriminated him.                     He\n\nsucceeded in convincing the district court that the Appeals Court's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\frejection of this challenge constituted an unreasonable application\n\nof Gray.    See Foxworth I, slip op. at 19.\n\n            The respondent assigns error, maintaining that Gray and\n\nthis case are horses of a different hue.       In a sense, that is so.\n\nIn Gray, the redaction — a blank space — was clear on the face of\n\nthe statement.    Here, a clumsy attempt was made to redact Logan's\n\nstatement in a way that might serve to conceal from the jury the\n\nfact that a redaction had been made.\n\n            Still, this difference seems to be of little moment.          As\n\nsaid, this is an \"unreasonable application\" case; thus, the mere\n\nexistence of a slight factual distinction does not signify that the\n\nstatement    in   question    necessarily   spins    outside      of   Gray's\n\nprecedential orbit.     What matters is that the situation at hand\n\nfits   comfortably   within    the    parameters    of   Gray's    doctrinal\n\nteachings.\n\n            We have carefully examined both the text of the redacted\n\nstatement and the context in which it was admitted.            We conclude\n\nthat its admission was an unreasonable application of Gray.              Our\n\nreasons follow.\n\n            First, the redaction is obvious.        In and of itself, the\n\nuse of the designation \"Mr. X\" would have caused any rational juror\n\nto raise an eyebrow.    See United States v.

Detective Flynn drove this point home,\n\ntestifying that \"Mr. X\" was a substitute for the name of the person\n\nactually identified by Logan. Furthermore, the prosecutor referred\n\nto   Logan's    statement   as    \"the    redacted     statement.\"      To   cinch\n\nmatters, the copy given to the jury had the phrase \"Mr. X\" in a\n\ndifferent font (which did not exactly fit the spaces left by the\n\nexcision of the petitioner's name).               It follows inexorably from\n\nthese facts that the use of the pseudonym \"Mr. X\" represented an\n\n\"obvious deletion\" that \"encourag[ed] the jury to speculate about\n\nthe reference.\"     Gray, 523 U.S. at 193.\n\n           With knowledge of the redaction, it was child's play for\n\nthe jury to identify the petitioner as \"Mr. X.\"                 There were only\n\nthree defendants — Logan, Christian, and the petitioner — and no\n\nother suspects. Logan, as the author of the statement, could not\n\nhave been \"Mr. X.\" Flynn's testimony unambiguously eliminated\n\nChristian from consideration.            That left the petitioner.\n\n           Of    course,    the    fact    that   it    was   obvious   that   the\n\npetitioner was \"Mr. X\" does not necessarily render Logan's redacted\n\nstatement powerfully incriminating. In this regard, the respondent\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\fpoints out that the statement did not designate \"Mr. X\" as the\n\nshooter.    That disclaimer is true as far as it goes, but it does not\n\ntake the respondent very far.\n\n            To recapitulate, the redacted statement revealed that \"Mr.\n\nX\" had gone to McLean's apartment because McLean had sold him some\n\nbad cocaine; once there, \"Mr. X\" argued with McLean; then, after\n\n\"Mr. X\" had departed, Logan saw him reentering the building with a\n\ngun   tucked   into     his   waistband;    and   shots    were    heard   shortly\n\nthereafter.       Given the chain of events chronicled in Logan's\n\nredacted statement, the inference that the petitioner shot McLean\n\nwas virtually inescapable.         As a practical matter, the statement\n\ndirectly implicated the petitioner and powerfully incriminated him.6\n\nUnder Gray, the redacted statement should have been excluded.\n\n            That conclusion does not end our odyssey. Even though the\n\nadmission    of   the   redacted   statement      violated    Gray,    the   AEDPA\n\nstandard    requires     more   than    a   showing   of   trial    error.

At a bare minimum, the error must be\n\nsufficiently egregious to comprise an unreasonable application of\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        The Appeals Court made much of the trial justice's\ninstructions limiting the jury's use of the statement to the case\nagainst Logan. Where a nontestifying codefendant's statement is\npowerfully incriminating, however, a limiting instruction is cold\ncomfort. See Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135. That is especially so in\nthis case since Logan was charged with murder under a joint-venture\ntheory, and the petitioner was a likely candidate for membership in\nany such joint venture.\n\n                                        -39-\n\fclearly established federal constitutional principles.         28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).     That standard is satisfied here.\n\n             We need not tarry.   The range of reasonable outcomes here\n\nis small because the applicable constitutional rule — explained in\n\nGray — is narrow, see United States v. Thayer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767835\"><a href=\"/opinion/767835/united-states-v-alta-thayer-aka-adie-aka-helen-aka-vickie/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1355\n\n(11th Cir. 2000) (describing Bruton rule as \"narrow\").       The outcome\n\nreached by the Appeals Court (albeit understandable because Gray had\n\nnot yet been decided) is patently offensive to that rule.       There is\n\nsimply no way to defend it: the inferences necessary to conclude\n\nthat the petitioner was \"Mr. X\" and that \"Mr. X\" was the shooter are\n\nnose-on-the-face plain, and the inculpatory thrust of the statement\n\nis potent. We hold, therefore, that if the state conviction was not\n\nfinal until 2002, Gray applies; and, applying Gray to this case, it\n\nwould run afoul of clearly established Federal law to find no\n\nviolation of Gray on these facts.\n\n             As a rear-guard action, the respondent suggests that any\n\nSixth Amendment violation was harmless.           This suggestion lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n             Once again, we pause to clarify the applicable standard\n\nof review.    Although the Appeals Court did not find a Bruton error,\n\nit nevertheless hedged its bets.          It added that \"[e]ven if there\n\nwere error, [in connection with the admission of Logan's statement],\n\nit was harmless, because the evidence related to a noncrucial issue\n\n. . . and was at most merely cumulative of evidence properly before\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fthe jury.\"    The court cited Commonwealth v. Sinnott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Mass. 1987), which holds that a Bruton error does not require\n\nreversal if it was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"               Id. at\n\n705.   In other words, it applied the federal standard for harmless\n\nconstitutional error applicable on direct review.              See Chapman v.\n\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1967).\n\n             That determination of harmlessness does not engender AEDPA\n\ndeference.     The Supreme Court recently instructed federal habeas\n\ncourts to perform a straightforward harmless error analysis under\n\nBrecht, 507 U.S. at 638,           rather than review a state court's\n\nharmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt                     determination        for\n\nunreasonableness.

This is so because the more forgiving\n\nBrecht test subsumes the hybrid Chapman/AEDPA test.              Fry, 127 St.\n\nCt. at 2327.      We proceed accordingly.\n\n             On collateral review of trial error, the test for harmless\n\nerror is whether the error had a \"substantial and injurious effect\n\nor influence in determining the jury's verdict.\"             Sinnott v. Duval,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197851\"><a href=\"/opinion/197851/sinnott-v-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637).\n\nThe burden of establishing harmlessness rests with the state qua\n\nrespondent.      O'Neal v. McAninch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (1995).         If the\n\nhabeas   court    entertains     \"grave   doubt   as   to   harmlessness,   the\n\npetitioner must win.\"      Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\f             The identification of the shooter was the pivotal issue\n\nin    this   case.       The   prosecution's        case    in    chief,    though\n\nconstitutionally sufficient, was painfully thin.                  See supra Part\n\nII(B).    Other than Logan's statement, the only evidence bearing on\n\nidentification was Hobson's testimony.            That testimony was scarcely\n\nunassailable.        Logan's statement bolstered Hobson's account by\n\nplacing the petitioner at the murder scene, armed and with a motive,\n\nimmediately before the shooting. It also supported Hobson's version\n\nof the events leading up to the slaying as it suggested that McLean\n\nwas chased by one man rather than two.\n\n             At the trial-court level, this case was close.                In close\n\ncases, there is often a tipping point. We think that it is probable\n\nthat Logan's statement tipped the balance.                  The statement lent\n\nsignificant weight to the word of the lone witness who identified\n\nthe petitioner as the shooter and, as the Bruton Court recognized,\n\n391 U.S. at 135, the trial justice's limiting instructions were not\n\nan    effective    safeguard   against      the    jury's    exposure      to    such\n\npowerfully incriminating evidence.                Indeed, the impact of the\n\nstatement is adequately evinced by the fact that the jury convicted\n\nthe petitioner while acquitting Logan.\n\n             In sum, we agree with the district court, Foxworth I, slip\n\nop. at 23, that the admission of the redacted statement likely had\n\na    substantial   and   injurious   influence       on    the   outcome    of    the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -42-\n\fproceedings. At the very least, there is grave doubt. Accordingly,\n\nthe petitioner is entitled to a new trial if Gray applies.\n\n             3.    The Effect if 1996 is the Date of Finality.               If the\n\npetitioner's conviction became final in 1996 rather than final in\n\n2002, the case plays out differently. Because the Supreme Court had\n\nnot yet decided Gray,7 the relevant \"clearly established Federal\n\nlaw\" would be capped by Richardson.               Under that precedent — and\n\nwithout the benefit of Gray — the Appeals Court's decision cannot\n\nbe said to be either contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n\nclearly     established    Supreme      Court   precedent.      After   all,      the\n\nRichardson Court specifically left open the question, implicated in\n\nthis case, of whether a Confrontation Clause problem exists when\n\n\"the defendant's name has been replaced by a symbol or neutral\n\npronoun.\"     481 U.S. at 211 n.5.       The Court's acknowledgment that an\n\nissue remains fairly debatable precludes any credible argument that\n\na   state   court's    decision    on    the    issue   is   contrary   to   or    an\n\nunreasonable       application    of    clearly   established     Supreme     Court\n\nprecedent.8       See L'Abbe v. DiPaolo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200210\"><a href=\"/opinion/200210/labbe-v-dipaolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       We note that the Court has not directed that Gray should be\napplied retroactively.    See Teague, 489 U.S. at 310; see also\nGarcia v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75731\"><a href=\"/opinion/75731/hector-garcia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1216 (11th Cir. 2002)\n(refusing to apply Gray retroactively).\n      8\n       The closeness of the question left open in Richardson is\nemphasized by the fact that in the subsequent decision in Gray four\njustices dissented.     See Gray, 523 U.S. at 200 (Scalia, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n                                        -43-\n\f           4.   The Decision to Certify.        It thus appears that the\n\ndate of finality, which will determine whether Gray or Richardson\n\nis the controlling precedent, will be dispositive of this aspect of\n\nthe respondent's appeal.        The SJC has offered no real guidance on\n\nthat issue, and the correct answer remains shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, the case is obviously important: a murder conviction hangs\n\nin the balance. Consequently, we deem it appropriate to certify the\n\nquestion concerning the date of finality to the SJC.            See, e.g., In\n\nre Engage, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 n.10 (1st Cir. 2008) (approving sua\n\nsponte certification in appropriate cases); Brown v. Crown Equip.\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202921\"><a href=\"/opinion/202921/brown-v-crown-equipment-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (1st Cir. 2007) (similar).\n\n           This case fits the model for certification.                We may\n\ncertify doubtful questions to a state supreme court in cases, such\n\nas this, where we find no controlling precedent, where the answer\n\nis unclear, and where the answer will be determinative of an issue\n\nin the litigation.      See Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 2008); Nieves v. Univ. of P.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194980\"><a href=\"/opinion/194980/marta-v-u-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274\n\n(1st   Cir.   1993).     And,    moreover,    the   SJC   has   indicated   a\n\nwillingness,    under    such    circumstances,     to    answer   certified\n\nquestions.    See Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.     For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reverse the district court's ukase holding the evidence of the\n\npetitioner's guilt insufficient.           At the same time, however, we\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\fwithhold decision on the district court's ruling that the petitioner\n\nis entitled to relief on the basis of a Sixth Amendment violation.\n\nThe outcome of that question turns on whether the petitioner's\n\nconviction became final in 1996 or 2002.   We certify that question\n\nto the SJC as per the order filed in conjunction herewith.   Pending\n\nthat court's response, we retain appellate jurisdiction.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\f</pre>",
