Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 8, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f            BOWMAN, Senior Circuit Judge.             Dr. Steven P. Amato\n\nappeals the denial of his motion to quash two administrative\n\nsubpoenas duces tecum served on him as custodian of records for two\n\ncorporations in which he was the sole shareholder, director,\n\nofficer and employee.       We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Amato is a chiropractor in Damariscotta, Maine.            He has\n\nconducted his chiropractor business as a sole proprietorship and as\n\na corporation. In October 1997, Amato incorporated the business as\n\nDr. Steven Amato, D.C., P.C. (\"Amato P.C.\") in New York and is\n\nAmato P.C.'s sole shareholder, director, officer and employee.                In\n\nSeptember        2002,   Amato      incorporated     Mainecures.com,        Inc.\n\n(\"Mainecures\") in Maine.         A year later, Maine dissolved Mainecures\n\nfor failing to file an annual report.           Amato was Mainecures's sole\n\nshareholder, director, officer and employee.\n\n            In    January   2005,    law    enforcement,   acting   under   the\n\nauthority of a search warrant, searched Amato's office for evidence\n\nof federal health-care crimes.         During the search, law enforcement\n\nserved two administrative subpoenas duces tecum on Amato as the\n\nrecords custodian of Amato P.C. and Mainecures.               See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3486 (2000).       The subpoenas required the records custodian to\n\nappear with the records at the United States Attorney's Office or,\n\nin lieu of an appearance, to deliver the records with certificates\n\nof authenticity to the United States Attorney's Office.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f               Amato moved to quash the subpoenas.            Amato argued that\n\nthe act-of-production doctrine protects production of the records\n\nbecause the testimonial aspects of the production would incriminate\n\nhim.1          Recognizing     the     collective-entity      doctrine,2         Amato\n\nnevertheless asserted that the act-of-production doctrine controls\n\nin his case.       For support, Amato invoked a footnote in Braswell v.\n\nUnited      States    that   left    open   the    question      of    whether    the\n\ncollective-entity        doctrine      would   apply    if   the      custodian    of\n\ncorporate records is \"able to establish, by showing for example\n\nthat he is the sole employee and officer of the corporation, that\n\nthe jury would inevitably conclude that he produced the records.\"\n\n487     U.S.    99,   118–19    n.11     (1988).       Because     Amato   is     his\n\ncorporations' sole shareholder, director, officer and employee, he\n\n\n\n        1\n      Under the act-of-production doctrine, persons compelled by\nsubpoena to produce incriminating records may invoke the Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination \"only where the act\nof producing the evidence would contain 'testimonial' features.\"\nUnited States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 49 (2000) (Thomas, J.,\nconcurring); Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 408 (1976)\n(stating that while \"the Fifth Amendment does not independently\nproscribe the compelled production of every sort of incriminating\nevidence,\" it does apply \"when the accused is compelled to make a\ntestimonial communication that is incriminating\").\n        2\n      The collective-entity doctrine recognizes that the Fifth\nAmendment treats corporations and collective entities differently\nfrom individuals.   Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 104\n(1988). Because corporations and collective entities have no Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination and because a\n\"custodian of corporate or entity records holds those documents in\na representative rather than a personal capacity,\" the custodian\ncannot claim a personal Fifth Amendment privilege against the\nproduction of corporate records. Id. at 109–11.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fasserted his personal Fifth Amendment privilege against producing\n\nthe corporate records. Amato also argued that Mainecures's records\n\nare privileged because Mainecures was a dissolved corporation.\n\n          In considering the motion to quash, the magistrate judge\n\nrecognized that the collective-entity doctrine has not provided\n\nFifth Amendment protection to custodians of corporate records\n\nbecause custodians act in their representative, rather than their\n\npersonal, capacities when complying with a subpoena directed at the\n\ncorporation.    The   magistrate   judge   declined   to   recognize   an\n\nexception to the collective-entity doctrine that would fit Amato's\n\nsituation:   he is the target of an investigation, the custodian of\n\nrecords, and the corporation's sole shareholder, director, officer\n\nand employee.    The judge reasoned that the First Circuit has\n\nrejected such an exception, see United States v. Lawn Builders of\n\nNew Eng., Inc., 856 F.2d 388 (1st Cir. 1988); In re Grand Jury\n\nProceedings (The John Doe Co.), 838 F.2d 624 (1st Cir. 1988), and\n\nconcluded that Braswell's footnote does not contradict the First\n\nCircuit's holdings.     The magistrate judge also rebuffed Amato's\n\nargument that Mainecures's records are privileged because the\n\nrecords now belong to Amato's sole proprietorship, Mainecures\n\nhaving been dissolved before the subpoena issued.             The judge\n\nconcluded that Maine law dictates that a dissolved corporation\n\nexists for up to three years after dissolution to wind up its\n\nbusiness affairs.     Thus, the judge held that no Fifth Amendment\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fprivilege guards against the subpoena directed at Mainecures's\n\ncustodian of records.\n\n          Adopting the magistrate judge's view of the matter, the\n\ndistrict court denied Amato's motion to quash.       After the district\n\ncourt further denied a motion to stay enforcement of the subpoenas\n\npending appeal, Amato's attorney produced the records and the\n\ncertificates of authenticity, but stated that Amato did not waive\n\nhis constitutional rights by complying with the subpoenas.\n\n          Amato   appeals,   contending   that   \"the   Fifth   Amendment\n\nprotects a (sole shareholder/sole employee) one-person corporate\n\nentity from compulsory self-incrimination arising from the act of\n\nproducing materials pursuant to an administrative subpoena.\" Amato\n\nalso contends that Mainecures's records should be treated as\n\nrecords of Amato's sole proprietorship and that as such, they enjoy\n\nFifth Amendment protection from production.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Denials of motions to quash are reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 138 F.3d 442, 444 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (1998).        Because Amato contends\n\nthat the district court operated under an erroneous view of the\n\nlaw, we review de novo the district court's legal analysis.         Id.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          The Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person \"shall be\n\ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fU.S. Const. amend V.         \"The word 'witness' in the constitutional\n\ntext   limits    the   relevant   category    of     compelled    incriminating\n\ncommunications to those that are 'testimonial' in character.\"\n\nUnited States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34 (2000).                 A corporation\n\ndoes not enjoy the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed\n\nby the Fifth Amendment, as the privilege is a personal privilege\n\nenjoyed by natural individuals.            See Braswell, 487 U.S. at 102\n\n(acknowledging the \"well-established [rule] that such artificial\n\nentities   [as    corporations]     are    not     protected      by    the   Fifth\n\nAmendment\"); United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 698 (1944)\n\n(explaining     that   the   \"constitutional         privilege    against     self-\n\nincrimination is essentially a personal one, applying only to\n\nnatural individuals\").         Furthermore, the contents of corporate\n\nrecords generally do not enjoy Fifth Amendment protection.                      See\n\nBraswell, 487 U.S. at 102; United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 612\n\n(1984).    The rationale underpinning these principles is that the\n\nFifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination \"is designed\n\nto prevent the use of legal process to force from the lips of the\n\naccused individual the evidence necessary to convict him or to\n\nforce him to produce and authenticate any personal documents or\n\neffects that might incriminate him.\"          White, 322 U.S. at 698.\n\n           In addition, the Supreme Court has long held that the\n\ncollective-entity      doctrine   precludes      a    custodian    of    corporate\n\nrecords from relying on the Fifth Amendment to block the production\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fof those records.       See Bellis v. United States, 417 U.S. 85, 88\n\n(1974) (explaining that a \"long line of cases has established that\n\nan individual cannot rely upon the [Fifth Amendment] privilege to\n\navoid producing the records of a collective entity which are in his\n\npossession in a representative capacity, even if these records\n\nmight incriminate him personally\").        The Court in Braswell stated\n\nthat its cases applying the collective-entity doctrine hold \"that\n\nwithout   regard   to   whether   the   subpoena   is   addressed   to   the\n\ncorporation, [or] to the individual in his capacity as a custodian,\n\n. . . a corporate custodian . . . may not resist a subpoena for\n\ncorporate records on Fifth Amendment grounds.\"          487 U.S. at 108–09\n\n(citations omitted).      Finally, the Supreme Court has stated that\n\nwell-settled law applying the collective-entity doctrine holds that\n\ncustodians of corporate records have no Fifth Amendment privilege,\n\n\"regardless of how small the corporation may be.\" Bellis, 417 U.S.\n\nat 100.\n\n            Despite the collective-entity doctrine's far reach, cases\n\nsuch as the instant case must confront the act-of-production\n\ndoctrine.   The act-of-production doctrine recognizes that although\n\n\"the Fifth Amendment does not independently proscribe the compelled\n\nproduction of every sort of incriminating evidence,\" it does apply\n\n\"when the accused is compelled to make a testimonial communication\n\nthat is incriminating.\" Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 408\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f(1976).   The Supreme Court has expressed its concerns over the\n\ntestimonial nature of acts of production:\n\n          The act of producing evidence in response to a\n          subpoena . . . has communicative aspects of\n          its own, wholly aside from the contents of the\n          papers produced. Compliance with the subpoena\n          tacitly concedes the existence of the papers\n          demanded and their possession or control by\n          the [individual producing the records].      It\n          also would indicate the [individual]'s belief\n          that the papers are those described in the\n          subpoena.    The elements of compulsion are\n          clearly present, but the more difficult issues\n          are whether the tacit averments of the\n          [individual]   are   both   \"testimonial\"   and\n          \"incriminating\" for purposes of applying the\n          Fifth Amendment. These questions perhaps do\n          not lend themselves to categorical answers;\n          their resolution may instead depend on the\n          facts   and    circumstances    of   particular\n          cases. . . .\n\nId. at 410 (citation omitted); Doe, 465 U.S. at 612, 613–14\n\n(stating that \"[a]lthough the contents of a document may not be\n\nprivileged, the act of producing the document may be\" because the\n\nholder of the document is compelled \"to perform an act that may\n\nhave testimonial aspects and an incriminating effect\"; concluding\n\nthat the district court did not err in finding that a sole\n\nproprietor's \"act of producing [subpoenaed business] documents\n\nwould involve testimonial self-incrimination\"); see also Hubbell,\n\n530 U.S. at 36–37 (discussing the act-of-production doctrine).\n\n          It is fair to say that while the collective-entity\n\ndoctrine focuses on the contents of corporate records or at least\n\nthe status of the records, i.e., corporate or individual, the act-\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fof-production doctrine focuses on whether an individual's compelled\n\nacts in producing records involve testimonial self-incrimination.\n\nThis   case    tests    Fifth     Amendment    boundaries   when   the   act-of-\n\nproduction doctrine intersects with the collective-entity doctrine.\n\nIn the present case, the issue is whether the Fifth Amendment\n\nprotects Amato's act of producing the subpoenaed records in his\n\ncapacity as custodian of the corporate records because the act\n\nitself would incriminate Amato personally.             In other words, we ask\n\nwhether   the       Fifth   Amendment    recognizes    an   exception    to   the\n\ncollective-entity doctrine such that an act-of-production privilege\n\nprotects a custodian of corporate records from producing those\n\nrecords when the custodian is the corporation's sole shareholder,\n\ndirector, officer and employee.\n\n              Our    resolution    of   this   issue   is   controlled   by   our\n\ndecision in John Doe Co., in which we decided that the act-of-\n\nproduction doctrine is not an exception to the collective-entity\n\ndoctrine even when the corporate custodian is the corporation's\n\nsole shareholder, officer and employee.                838 F.2d at 627.        In\n\nasserting a Fifth Amendment privilege, Amato ignores the holding of\n\nJohn Doe Co.        Instead, he seeks refuge in the language later used\n\nby the Supreme Court in footnote eleven in Braswell:\n\n              We leave open the question whether the agency\n              rationale   [behind   the   collective-entity\n              doctrine] supports compelling a custodian to\n              produce corporate records when the custodian\n              [can] establish, by showing for example that\n              he is the sole employee and officer of the\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           corporation, that the jury would inevitably\n           conclude that he produced the records.\n\n487 U.S. at 118–19 n.11.           Our reading of Braswell and of our\n\ncaselaw,   however,   leads   us    to   conclude   that   such   refuge    is\n\nunavailable in this circuit.\n\n           Although Braswell does not directly contradict Amato's\n\nargument, the decision contains nothing that would justify our\n\nreconsideration of our holding in John Doe Co..            In Braswell, the\n\nSupreme Court held that \"the custodian of corporate records may\n\n[not] resist a subpoena for such records on the ground that the act\n\nof production would incriminate him in violation of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.\" 487 U.S. at 100. Randy Braswell operated his business\n\nthrough two corporations, with himself as the sole shareholder of\n\nboth. State law required the corporations to have three directors,\n\nso Braswell's wife and mother were directors along with Braswell.\n\nAll three were also corporate officers.             A federal grand jury\n\nissued a subpoena to Braswell in his capacity as president of the\n\ncorporations to produce the corporations' records. Moving to quash\n\nthe subpoena, Braswell argued that the Fifth Amendment's act-of-\n\nproduction doctrine prohibited the compulsion of the records.\n\n           Given Braswell's argument, the Supreme Court discussed\n\nthe act-of-production and the collective-entity doctrines.                 The\n\nCourt recognized that the act-of-production doctrine \"embarked upon\n\na new course of Fifth Amendment analysis,\" but did not \"render[]the\n\ncollective entity rule obsolete.\" Id. at 109. The Court recounted\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthe   collective-entity    doctrine's     \"lengthy     and   distinguished\n\npedigree,\"   recognizing    that    since    1906    it   has    held   that\n\nrepresentatives   of   collective     entities,      including    corporate\n\nofficers, possess no Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to produce\n\nrecords that belong to collective entities, including corporate\n\nrecords. Braswell, 487 U.S. at 104–13 (discussing Bellis, 417 U.S.\n\n85; White, 322 U.S. 694; Dreier v. United States, 221 U.S. 394\n\n(1911); Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361 (1911); and Hale v.\n\nHenkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1906)).       The Court explained:\n\n          [T]he Court has consistently recognized that\n          the custodian of corporate or entity records\n          holds those documents in a representative\n          rather than a personal capacity. Artificial\n          entities such as corporations may act only\n          through their agents, and a custodian's\n          assumption of his representative capacity\n          leads to certain obligations, including the\n          duty to produce corporate records on proper\n          demand by the Government.        Under those\n          circumstances,   the   custodian's   act  of\n          production is not deemed a personal act, but\n          rather an act of the corporation. Any claim\n          of Fifth Amendment privilege asserted by the\n          agent would be tantamount to a claim of\n          privilege by the corporation—which of course\n          possesses no such privilege.\n\nId. at 109–10 (citation omitted).           Braswell did not alter the\n\napplication of the collective-entity doctrine in this circuit. See\n\nalso United States v. Milligan, 371 F. Supp. 2d 1127, 1129 (D.\n\nAriz. 2005) (stating that no court has treated the language in\n\nBraswell's footnote eleven as an exception to the collective-entity\n\ndoctrine).\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f           Our caselaw rejects Amato's argument suggesting that we\n\nshould recognize an exception to the collective-entity doctrine\n\nwhere   the   custodian         of   records      is    the   corporation's         sole\n\nshareholder, director, officer and employee.                     Four months before\n\nthe Supreme Court decided Braswell, this court held \"that the sole\n\nshareholder of a one-man corporation has no 'act of production\n\nprivilege'    under      the     fifth    amendment      to   resist    turnover     of\n\ncorporate documents.\"          John Doe Co., 838 F.2d at 627 n.3.              In John\n\nDoe Co., which is very similar to Amato's case, a grand jury\n\ninvestigated an individual (referred to by the court as \"Owner\")\n\nwho was a corporation's sole shareholder, officer and employee.\n\nWhen the grand jury issued a subpoena to the corporation's \"Keeper\n\nof the Records,\" the Owner's attorney provided the government some\n\nof the records, but \"the corporation refused to authenticate the\n\ndocuments before the grand jury or to provide testimony (through\n\nOwner or by designating some other agent) that they were all the\n\nrecords of the corporation.\"             Id. at 624.      The Owner also \"refused\n\nto   stipulate    to    these     facts    or    to    appoint    an   agent   of   the\n\ncorporation      to    provide    the     requested     testimony.\"       Id.       The\n\ngovernment moved to compel the production of the corporate records,\n\nwhile the corporation moved to quash the subpoena.

This court also concluded that a so-called \"one-man\n\ncorporation\" fares no better under the collective-entity doctrine:\n\n              “It is well settled that no privilege can be\n              claimed by the custodian of corporate records,\n              regardless of how small the corporation may\n              be.” Bellis, 417 U.S. at 100. It was Owner's\n              choice to incorporate. With that choice came\n              all    the     attendant      benefits     and\n              responsibilities of being a corporation. One\n              of those responsibilities is to produce and\n              authenticate records of the corporation when\n              they are subpoenaed by a grand jury. How the\n              corporation chooses to fulfill this duty is\n              not the court's concern.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fJohn Doe Co., 838 F.2d at 627.3\n\n          In a case argued eight days after Braswell was decided,\n\nthis court, citing Braswell, reaffirmed its application of the\n\ncollective-entity   doctrine   to   a   corporation    where   the   sole\n\nshareholder was also the sole officer and employee: \"even assuming\n\n[the corporation] to be a one-man corporation and [the corporate\n\ncustodian] to be that one man, the corporate records are not\n\nshielded from production, nor may [the corporate custodian] resist\n\na subpoena for those records on the         ground that the act of\n\nproduction would impermissibly infringe on his Fifth Amendment\n\nright against self-incrimination.\" Lawn Builders, 856 F.2d at 394.\n\n          Amato also invokes this court's decision in In re Grand\n\nJury Subpoena, 973 F.2d 45 (1st Cir. 1992), to cast doubt on the\n\nprecedential value of John Doe Co. and Lawn Builders.      But there is\n\nnothing in that case that causes us to rethink our previous\n\ndecisions that foreclose Amato's argument.            In re Grand Jury\n\nSubpoena held that the collective-entity doctrine precluded the\n\npossibility that the records of a nominee trust were privileged\n\nunder the Fifth Amendment.     973 F.2d at 46.        In reaching that\n\n\n\n     3\n      The court opined that the Supreme Court was likely to decide\n\"the pivotal question presented in this appeal\" in the Braswell\nappeal. John Doe Co., 838 F.2d at 627 n.3. As already explained,\nthe Supreme Court did not decide the pivotal question of whether\nthe collective-entity doctrine is applicable where the corporate\ncustodian is also the sole shareholder, officer and employee, nor\ndid the Supreme Court call into question this circuit's decision in\nJohn Doe Co..\n\n                                -14-\n\fdecision, the court iterated, \"Whether an organization is properly\n\ndeemed a collective entity has little to do with its size.           'It is\n\nwell settled that no privilege can be claimed by the custodian of\n\ncorporate records, regardless of how small the corporation may\n\nbe.'\"    Id. at 47 (quoting Bellis, 417 U.S. at 100).       The court also\n\nnoted that \"Braswell held the [collective-entity] rule applicable\n\nto   a   one-person   corporation.\"      Id.   In   a    footnote   to   this\n\nstatement, the court recognized Braswell's footnote eleven.               Id.\n\nn.3 (quoting Braswell, 487 U.S. at 118 n. 11).          Amato relies on the\n\nfootnote in In re Grand Jury Subpoena to argue that we reopened the\n\nissue of whether an exception to the collective-entity doctrine\n\nexists where the records custodian is the corporation's sole\n\nshareholder, officer and employee.        We see nothing that supports\n\nthis contention.\n\n            Although we acknowledged in In re Grand Jury Subpoena\n\nthat the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the\n\ncollective-entity doctrine applies where the custodian is the sole\n\nofficer and employee of the corporation, we did not call into\n\nquestion our own precedent holding that it does.           Accordingly, we\n\nfollow our precedent and affirm the district court's order denying\n\nAmato's motion to quash the administrative subpoena directed at him\n\nas the corporations' custodian of records.          See generally Wallace\n\nv. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"When a panel of this\n\ncircuit has decided an issue, another panel will ordinarily not\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\frevisit that issue; but, of course, this limitation does not apply\n\nwhere an intervening decision of the Supreme Court overturns or\n\nundermines our earlier decision.\"); Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d 980,\n\n985 (1st Cir. 1986) (\"Uniformity of decisions within a multi-panel\n\ncircuit can only be achieved by strict adherence to prior circuit\n\nprecedent, with the error-correcting function reserved to the court\n\nsitting en banc.\"), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 888 (1986).\n\n                                    B.\n\n           Finally, we conclude that the district court committed no\n\nerror in concluding that Mainecures's records remained corporate\n\nrecords after the corporation's dissolution.          See Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 13-C, § 1406(1) (\"A dissolved corporation continues\n\ncorporate existence for a period not exceeding 3 years from the\n\neffective date of the articles of dissolution . . . to wind up and\n\nliquidate its business and affairs. . . .\"); 1406(2) (\"Dissolution\n\nof a corporation does not:    A.

Terminate the authority of the clerk of the corporation.\").\n\nMainecures was dissolved in late 2003, less than three years before\n\nthe service of the subpoena in January 2005.          And nothing in the\n\nrecord suggests that Mainecures's dissolution effected a transfer\n\nof its corporate records to Amato personally.             Moreover, the\n\nSupreme Court has stated that corporate records receive no Fifth\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fAmendment protection even after dissolution.               Bellis, 417 U.S. at\n\n96 n.3 (recognizing that Supreme Court decisions make \"clear that\n\nthe dissolution of a corporation does not give the custodian of the\n\ncorporate     records     any   greater   claim     to   the   Fifth   Amendment\n\nprivilege\"); Grant v. United States, 227 U.S. 74, 80 (1913);\n\nWheeler v.

We also conclude that Mainecures's dissolution did not\n\nprotect its records from the reach of the subpoena in this case.\n\nTherefore, we affirm the district court's order denying Amato's\n\nmotion to quash.4\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Although the Supreme Court in Braswell held that \"a corporate\ncustodian is not entitled to resist a subpoena on the ground that\nhis act of production will be personally incriminating,\" the Court\nrecognized that \"certain consequences flow from the fact that the\ncustodian's act of production is one in his representative rather\nthan personal capacity.\" 487 U.S. at 117–18. The Court explained\nthat the government could not use an individual's act of production\nagainst him, but could use the corporation's act of production\nagainst the individual.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amato is a chiropractor in Damariscotta, Maine. He has conducted his chiropractor business as a sole proprietorship and as a corporation. In October 1997, Amato incorporated the business as Dr. Steven Amato, D.C., P.C. (\"Amato P.C.\") in New York and is Amato P.C.'s sole shareholder, director, officer and employee. In September 2002, Amato incorporated Mainecures.com, Inc. (\"Mainecures\") in Maine. A year later, Maine dissolved Mainecures for failing to file an annual report. Amato was Mainecures's sole shareholder, director, officer and employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2005, law enforcement, acting under the authority of a search warrant, searched Amato's office for evidence of federal health-care crimes. During the search, law enforcement served two administrative subpoenas duces tecum on Amato as the records custodian of Amato P.C. and Mainecures. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3486 (2000). The subpoenas required the records custodian to appear with the records at the United States Attorney's Office or, in lieu of an appearance, to deliver the records with certificates of authenticity to the United States Attorney's Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amato moved to quash the subpoenas. Amato argued that the act-of-production doctrine protects production of the records because the testimonial aspects of the production would incriminate him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Recognizing the collective-entity doctrine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Amato nevertheless asserted that the act-of-production doctrine controls in his case. For support, Amato invoked a footnote in <i>Braswell v. United States</i> that left open the question of whether the collective-entity doctrine would apply if the custodian of corporate records is \"able to establish, by showing for example that he is the sole employee and officer of the corporation, that the jury would inevitably conclude that he produced the records.\" 487 U.S. 99, 118-19 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2284, 101 L.Ed.2d 98 (1988). Because Amato is his corporations' sole shareholder, director, officer and employee, he asserted his personal Fifth Amendment privilege against producing the corporate records. Amato also argued that Mainecures's records are privileged because Mainecures was a dissolved corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the motion to quash, the magistrate judge recognized that the collective-entity doctrine has not provided Fifth Amendment protection to custodians of corporate records because custodians act in their representative, rather than their personal, capacities when complying with a subpoena directed at the corporation. The magistrate judge declined to recognize an exception to the collective-entity doctrine that would fit Amato's situation: he is the target of an investigation, the custodian of records, and the corporation's sole shareholder, director, officer and employee. The judge reasoned that the First Circuit has rejected such an exception, <i>see United States v. Lawn Builders of New Eng., Inc.,</i> 856 F.2d 388 (1st Cir.1988); <i>In re Grand Jury Proceedings (The John Doe Co.),</i> 838 F.2d 624 (1st Cir.1988), and concluded that <i>Braswell's</i> footnote does not contradict the First Circuit's holdings. The magistrate judge also rebuffed Amato's argument that Mainecures's records are privileged because the records now belong to Amato's sole proprietorship, Mainecures having been dissolved before the subpoena issued. The judge concluded that Maine law dictates that a dissolved corporation exists for up to three years after dissolution to wind up its business affairs. Thus, the judge held that no Fifth Amendment privilege guards against the subpoena directed at Mainecures's custodian of records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adopting the magistrate judge's view of the matter, the district court denied Amato's motion to quash. After the district court further denied a motion to stay enforcement of the subpoenas pending appeal, Amato's attorney produced the records and the certificates of authenticity, but stated that Amato did not waive his constitutional rights by complying with the subpoenas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amato appeals, contending that \"the Fifth Amendment protects a (sole shareholder/sole employee) one-person corporate entity from compulsory self-incrimination arising from the act of producing materials pursuant to an administrative subpoena.\" Amato also contends that Mainecures's records should be treated as records of Amato's sole proprietorship and that as such, they enjoy Fifth Amendment protection from production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denials of motions to quash are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 138 F.3d 442, 444 (1st Cir.1998), <i>cert. denied,</i> 524 U.S. 939, 118 S.Ct. 2345, 141 L.Ed.2d 716 (1998). Because Amato contends that the district court operated under an erroneous view of the law, we review de novo the district court's legal analysis. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" U.S. Const. amend V. \"The word `witness' in the constitutional text limits the relevant category of compelled incriminating communications to those that are `testimonial' in character.\" <i>United States v. Hubbell,</i> 530 U.S. 27, 34, 120 S.Ct. 2037, 147 L.Ed.2d 24 (2000). A corporation does not enjoy the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, as the privilege is a personal privilege enjoyed by natural individuals. <i>See Braswell,</i> 487 U.S. at 102, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (acknowledging the \"well-established [rule] that such artificial entities [as corporations] are not protected by the Fifth Amendment\"); <i>United States v. White,</i> 322 U.S. 694, 698, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 88 L.Ed. 1542 (1944) (explaining that the \"constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is essentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals\"). Furthermore, the contents of corporate records generally do not enjoy Fifth Amendment protection. <i>See Braswell,</i> 487 U.S. at 102, 108 S.Ct. 2284; <i>United States v. Doe,</i> 465 U.S. 605, 612, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984). The rationale underpinning these principles is that the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination \"is designed to prevent the use of legal process to force from the lips of the accused individual the evidence necessary to convict him or to force him to produce and authenticate any personal documents or effects that might incriminate him.\" <i>White,</i> 322 U.S. at 698, 64 S.Ct. 1248.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Supreme Court has long held that the collective-entity doctrine precludes a custodian of corporate records from relying on the Fifth Amendment to block the production of those records. <i>See Bellis v. United States,</i> 417 U.S. 85, 88, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 40 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974) (explaining that a \"long line of cases has established that an individual cannot rely upon the [Fifth Amendment] privilege to avoid producing the records of a collective entity which are in his possession in a representative capacity, even if these records might incriminate him personally\"). The Court in <i>Braswell</i> stated that its cases applying the collective-entity doctrine hold \"that without regard to whether the subpoena is addressed to the corporation, [or] to the individual in his capacity as a custodian,... a corporate custodian ... may not resist a subpoena for corporate records on Fifth Amendment grounds.\" 487 U.S. at 108-09, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (citations omitted). Finally, the Supreme Court has stated that well-settled law applying the collective-entity doctrine holds that custodians of corporate records have no Fifth Amendment privilege, \"regardless of how small the corporation may be.\" <i>Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. at 100, 94 S.Ct. 2179.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the collective-entity doctrine's far reach, cases such as the instant case must confront the act-of-production doctrine. The act-of-production doctrine recognizes that although \"the Fifth Amendment does not independently proscribe the compelled production of every sort of incriminating evidence,\" it does apply \"when the accused is compelled to make a <i>testimonial</i> communication that is incriminating.\" <i>Fisher v. United States,</i> 425 U.S. 391, 408, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976). The Supreme Court has expressed its concerns over the testimonial nature of acts of production:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act of producing evidence in response to a subpoena ... has communicative aspects of its own, wholly aside from the contents of the papers produced. Compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the [individual producing the records]. It also would indicate the [individual]'s belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena. The elements of compulsion are clearly present, but the more difficult issues are whether the tacit averments of the [individual] are both \"testimonial\" and \"incriminating\" for purposes of applying the Fifth Amendment. These questions perhaps do not lend themselves to categorical answers; their resolution may instead depend on the facts and circumstances of particular cases....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 410, 96 S.Ct. 1569 (citation omitted); <i>Doe,</i> 465 U.S. at 612, 613-14, 104 S.Ct. 1237 (stating that \"[a]lthough the contents of a document may not be privileged, the act of producing the document may be\" because the holder of the document is compelled \"to perform an act that may have testimonial aspects and an incriminating effect\"; concluding that the district court did not err in finding that a sole proprietor's \"act of producing [subpoenaed business] documents would involve testimonial self-incrimination\"); <i>see also Hubbell,</i> 530 U.S. at 36-37, 120 S.Ct. 2037 (discussing the act-of-production doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is fair to say that while the collective-entity doctrine focuses on the contents of corporate records or at least the status of the records, i.e., corporate or individual, the act-of-production doctrine focuses on whether an individual's compelled acts in producing records involve testimonial self-incrimination. This case tests Fifth Amendment boundaries when the act-of-production doctrine intersects with the collective-entity doctrine. In the present case, the issue is whether the Fifth Amendment protects Amato's act of producing the subpoenaed records in his capacity as custodian of the corporate records because the act itself would incriminate Amato personally. In other words, we ask whether the Fifth Amendment recognizes an exception to the collective-entity doctrine such that an act-of-production privilege protects a custodian of corporate records from producing those records when the custodian is the corporation's sole shareholder, director, officer and employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of this issue is controlled by our decision in <i>John Doe Co.,</i> in which we decided that the act-of-production doctrine is not an exception to the collective-entity doctrine even when the corporate custodian is the corporation's sole shareholder, officer and employee. 838 F.2d at 627. In asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege, Amato ignores the holding of <i>John Doe Co.</i> Instead, he seeks refuge in the language later used by the Supreme Court in footnote eleven in <i>Braswell:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We leave open the question whether the agency rationale [behind the collective-entity doctrine] supports compelling a custodian to produce corporate records when the custodian [can] establish, by showing for example that he is the sole employee and officer of the corporation, that the jury would inevitably conclude that he produced the records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">487 U.S. at 118-19 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2284.

Randy Braswell operated his business through two corporations, with himself as the sole shareholder of both. State law required the corporations to have three directors, so Braswell's wife and mother were directors along with Braswell. All three were also corporate officers. A federal grand jury issued a subpoena to Braswell in his capacity as president of the corporations to produce the corporations' records. Moving to quash the subpoena, Braswell argued that the Fifth Amendment's act-of-production doctrine prohibited the compulsion of the records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given Braswell's argument, the Supreme Court discussed the act-of-production and the collective-entity doctrines. The Court recognized that the act-of-production doctrine \"embarked upon a new course of Fifth Amendment analysis,\" but did not \"render[]the collective entity rule obsolete.\" <i>Id.</i> at 109, 108 S.Ct. 2284. The Court recounted the collective-entity doctrine's \"lengthy and distinguished pedigree,\" recognizing that since 1906 it has held that representatives of collective entities, including corporate officers, possess no Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to produce records that belong to collective entities, including corporate records. <i>Braswell,</i> 487 U.S. at 104-13, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (discussing <i>Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. 85, 94 S.Ct. 2179, 40 L.Ed.2d 678; <i>White,</i> 322 U.S. 694, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 88 L.Ed. 1542; <i>Dreier v.

Henkel,</i> 201 U.S. 43, 26 S.Ct. 370, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906)). The Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Court has consistently recognized that the custodian of corporate or entity records holds those documents in a representative rather than a personal capacity. Artificial entities such as corporations may act only through their agents, and a custodian's assumption of his representative capacity leads to certain obligations, including the duty to produce corporate records on proper demand by the Government. Under those circumstances, the custodian's act of production is not deemed a personal act, but rather an act of the corporation. Any claim of Fifth Amendment privilege asserted by the agent would be tantamount to a claim of privilege by the corporation &#8212; which of course possesses no such privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 109-10, 108 S.Ct. 2284 (citation omitted). <i>Braswell</i> did not alter the application of the collective-entity doctrine in this circuit. <i>See also United States v. Milligan,</i> 371 F.Supp.2d 1127, 1129 (D.Ariz. 2005) (stating that no court has treated the language in <i>Braswell's</i> footnote eleven as an exception to the collective-entity doctrine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our caselaw rejects Amato's argument suggesting that we should recognize an exception to the collective-entity doctrine where the custodian of records is the corporation's sole shareholder, director, officer and employee. Four months before the Supreme Court decided <i>Braswell,</i> this court held \"that the sole shareholder of a one-man corporation has no `act of production privilege' under the fifth amendment to resist turnover of corporate documents.\" <i>John Doe Co.,</i> 838 F.2d at 627 n. 3. In <i>John Doe Co.,</i> which is very similar to Amato's case, a grand jury investigated an individual (referred to by the court as \"Owner\") who was a corporation's sole shareholder, officer and employee. When the grand jury issued a subpoena to the corporation's \"Keeper of the Records,\" the Owner's attorney provided the government some of the records, but \"the corporation refused to authenticate the documents before the grand jury or to provide testimony (through Owner or by designating some other agent) that they were <i>all</i> the records of the corporation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624. The Owner also \"refused to stipulate to these facts or to appoint an agent of the corporation to provide the requested testimony.\" <i>Id.</i> The government moved to compel the production of the corporate records, while the corporation moved to quash the subpoena. The district court denied the motion to compel and granted the motion to quash \"on the basis that the compelled testimony would likely force Owner to incriminate himself in violation of his fifth amendment right not to be a witness against himself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624-25. This circuit reversed \"on the basis that the subpoena is directed at the corporation which receives no constitutional protection from self-incrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acknowledging that \"the very act of producing the documents may, in some circumstances, be a testimonial act of authentication,\" we nevertheless concluded that \"production, including implied authentication, can be required of a corporation through a corporate officer regardless of the potential for self-incrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 626; <i>see also Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. at 90, 94 S.Ct. 2179 (\"Since no artificial organization may utilize the personal privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, ... it follows that an individual acting in his official capacity on behalf of the organization may likewise not take advantage of his personal privilege.\"). This court also concluded that a so-called \"one-man corporation\" fares no better under the collective-entity doctrine:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is well settled that no privilege can be claimed by the custodian of corporate records, regardless of how small the corporation may be.\" <i>Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. at 100, 94 S.Ct. 2179. It was Owner's choice to incorporate. With that choice came all the attendant benefits <i>and responsibilities</i> of being a corporation. One of those responsibilities is to produce and authenticate records of the corporation when they are subpoenaed by a grand jury. How the corporation chooses to fulfill this duty is not the court's concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>John Doe Co.,</i> 838 F.2d at 627.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case argued eight days after <i>Braswell</i> was decided, this court, citing <i>Braswell,</i> reaffirmed its application of the collective-entity doctrine to a corporation where the sole shareholder was also the sole officer and employee: \"even assuming [the corporation] to be a one-man corporation and [the corporate custodian] to be that one man, the corporate records are not shielded from production, nor may [the corporate custodian] resist a subpoena for those records on the ground that the act of production would impermissibly infringe on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\" <i>Lawn Builders,</i> 856 F.2d at 394.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amato also invokes this court's decision in <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 973 F.2d 45 (1st Cir.1992), to cast doubt on the precedential value of <i>John Doe Co.</i> and <i>Lawn Builders.</i> But there is nothing in that case that causes us to rethink our previous decisions that foreclose Amato's argument. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena</i> held that the collective-entity doctrine precluded the possibility that the records of a nominee trust were privileged under the Fifth Amendment. 973 F.2d at 46. In reaching that decision, the court iterated, \"Whether an organization is properly deemed a collective entity has little to do with its size. `It is well settled that no privilege can be claimed by the custodian of corporate records, regardless of how small the corporation may be.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 47 (quoting <i>Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. at 100, 94 S.Ct. 2179). The court also noted that \"<i>Braswell</i> held the [collective-entity] rule applicable to a one-person corporation.\" <i>Id.</i> In a footnote to this statement, the court recognized <i>Braswell's</i> footnote eleven. <i>Id.</i> n. 3 (quoting <i>Braswell,</i> 487 U.S. at 118 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2284). Amato relies on the footnote in <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena</i> to argue that we reopened the issue of whether an exception to the collective-entity doctrine exists where the records custodian is the corporation's sole shareholder, officer and employee. We see nothing that supports this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we acknowledged in <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena</i> that the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the collective-entity doctrine applies where the custodian is the sole officer and employee of the corporation, we did not call into question our own precedent holding that it does. Accordingly, we follow our precedent and affirm the district court's order denying Amato's motion to quash the administrative subpoena directed at him as the corporations' custodian of records. <i>See generally Wallace v. Reno,</i> 194 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1999) (\"When a panel of this circuit has decided an issue, another panel will ordinarily not revisit that issue; but, of course, this limitation does not apply where an intervening decision of the Supreme Court overturns or undermines our earlier decision.\"); <i>Lacy v. Gardino,</i> 791 F.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir.1986) (\"Uniformity of decisions within a multi-panel circuit can only be achieved by strict adherence to prior circuit precedent, with the error-correcting function reserved to the court sitting en banc.\"), <i>cert. denied,</i> 479 U.S. 888, 107 S.Ct. 284, 93 L.Ed.2d 259 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we conclude that the district court committed no error in concluding that Mainecures's records remained corporate records after the corporation's dissolution. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 13-C, &#167; 1406(1) (\"A dissolved corporation continues corporate existence for a period not exceeding 3 years from the effective date of the articles of dissolution ... to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs....\"); 1406(2) (\"Dissolution of a corporation does not: A. Transfer title to the corporation's property; ... E. Prevent commencement of a proceeding by or against the corporation in its corporate name; ... or G. Terminate the authority of the clerk of the corporation.\"). Mainecures was dissolved in late 2003, less than three years before the service of the subpoena in January 2005. And nothing in the record suggests that Mainecures's dissolution effected a transfer of its corporate records to Amato personally. Moreover, the Supreme Court has stated that corporate records receive no Fifth Amendment protection even after dissolution. <i>Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. at 96 n. 3, 94 S.Ct. 2179 (recognizing that Supreme Court decisions make \"clear that the dissolution of a corporation does not give the custodian of the corporate records any greater claim to the Fifth Amendment privilege\"); <i>Grant v. United States,</i> 227 U.S. 74, 80, 33 S.Ct. 190, 57 L.Ed. 423 (1913); <i>Wheeler v.

We also conclude that Mainecures's dissolution did not protect its records from the reach of the subpoena in this case. Therefore, we affirm the district court's order denying Amato's motion to quash.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the act-of-production doctrine, persons compelled by subpoena to produce incriminating records may invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination \"only where the act of producing the evidence would contain `testimonial' features.\"<i>United States v.

He has conducted his chiropractor business as a sole proprietorship and as a corporation. In October 1997, Amato incorporated the business as Dr. Steven Amato, D.C., P.C. (\"Amato P.C.\") in New York and is Amato P.C.'s sole shareholder, director, officer and employee. In September 2002, Amato incorporated Mainecures.com, Inc. (\"Mainecures\") in Maine. A year later, Maine dissolved Mainecures for failing to file an annual report.

During the search, law enforcement served two administrative subpoenas duces tecum on Amato as the records custodian of Amato P.C. and Mainecures. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3486 (2000). The subpoenas required the records custodian to appear with the records at the United States Attorney's Office or, in lieu of an appearance, to deliver the records with certificates of authenticity to the United States Attorney's Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amato moved to quash the subpoenas.

For support, Amato invoked a footnote in <i>Braswell v.

Because Amato is his corporations' sole shareholder, director, officer and employee, he asserted his personal Fifth Amendment privilege against producing the corporate records.

The magistrate judge declined to recognize an exception to the collective-entity doctrine that would fit Amato's situation: he is the target of an investigation, the custodian of records, and the corporation's sole shareholder, director, officer and employee. The judge reasoned that the First Circuit has rejected such an exception, <i>see United States v. Lawn Builders of New Eng., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511562\"><a href=\"/opinion/511562/united-states-of-america-v-lawn-builders-of-new-england-inc-and-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988); <i>In re Grand Jury Proceedings (The John Doe Co.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501185\"><a href=\"/opinion/501185/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-the-john-doe-company-inc-appeal-of-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988), and concluded that <i>Braswell's</i> footnote does not contradict the First Circuit's holdings. The magistrate judge also rebuffed Amato's argument that Mainecures's records are privileged because the records now belong to Amato's sole proprietorship, Mainecures having been dissolved before the subpoena issued. The judge concluded that Maine law dictates that a dissolved corporation exists for up to three years after dissolution to wind up its business affairs.

This case tests Fifth Amendment boundaries when the act-of-production doctrine intersects with the collective-entity doctrine. In the present case, the issue is whether the Fifth Amendment protects Amato's act of producing the subpoenaed records in his capacity as custodian of the corporate records because the act itself would incriminate Amato personally. In other words, we ask whether the Fifth Amendment recognizes an exception to the collective-entity doctrine such that an act-of-production privilege protects a custodian of corporate records from producing those records when the custodian is the corporation's sole shareholder, director, officer and employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of this issue is controlled by our decision in <i>John Doe Co.,</i> in which we decided that the act-of-production doctrine is not an exception to the collective-entity doctrine even when the corporate custodian is the corporation's sole shareholder, officer and employee. 838 F.2d at 627.

In <i>John Doe Co.,</i> which is very similar to Amato's case, a grand jury investigated an individual (referred to by the court as \"Owner\") who was a corporation's sole shareholder, officer and employee. When the grand jury issued a subpoena to the corporation's \"Keeper of the Records,\" the Owner's attorney provided the government some of the records, but \"the corporation refused to authenticate the documents before the grand jury or to provide testimony (through Owner or by designating some other agent) that they were <i>all</i> the records of the corporation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624. The Owner also \"refused to stipulate to these facts or to appoint an agent of the corporation to provide the requested testimony.\" <i>Id.</i> The government moved to compel the production of the corporate records, while the corporation moved to quash the subpoena. The district court denied the motion to compel and granted the motion to quash \"on the basis that the compelled testimony would likely force Owner to incriminate himself in violation of his fifth amendment right not to be a witness against himself.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624-25.

Transfer title to the corporation's property; ... E. Prevent commencement of a proceeding by or against the corporation in its corporate name; ... or G. Terminate the authority of the clerk of the corporation.\"). Mainecures was dissolved in late 2003, less than three years before the service of the subpoena in January 2005. And nothing in the record suggests that Mainecures's dissolution effected a transfer of its corporate records to Amato personally. Moreover, the Supreme Court has stated that corporate records receive no Fifth Amendment protection even after dissolution. <i>Bellis,</i> 417 U.S. at 96 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109046\"><a href=\"/opinion/109046/bellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We also conclude that Mainecures's dissolution did not protect its records from the reach of the subpoena in this case. Therefore, we affirm the district court's order denying Amato's motion to quash.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the act-of-production doctrine, persons compelled by subpoena to produce incriminating records may invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination \"only where the act of producing the evidence would contain `testimonial' features.\"<i>United States v.
