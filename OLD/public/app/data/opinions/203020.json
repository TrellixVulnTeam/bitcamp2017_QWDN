Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rosemary Curran Scapicchio for petitioner.\n     Eva M. Badway, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Martha\nCoakley, Attorney General, was on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          November 8, 2007\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         In this opinion we address some\n\nissues new to this circuit about practice under the federal habeas\n\ncorpus statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2254.           Joseph Teti appeals from the\n\ndenial of his federal petition for habeas corpus relief.1                The\n\nprimary question in this appeal is whether the federal district\n\ncourt erred in applying the presumption of correctness under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) to the state appellate court's findings of\n\nfacts and in denying discovery and an evidentiary hearing.\n\n            Substantively, Teti argues that the state court erred in\n\ndenying his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights\n\nbecause, inter alia, his original defense attorney Bradford Keene\n\nhad an actual conflict of interest.\n\n            We affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We describe the facts as they appear from the state court\n\nrecord.    Teti was convicted in Massachusetts Superior Court in\n\nApril    1999   on   charges   stemming    from   two   cocaine   trafficking\n\nincidents in 1996.      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C § 32E(b)(4).        As he\n\nhad provided cocaine to an undercover agent, Teti's primary defense\n\n\n\n     1\n          Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Commissioner\nJames Bender has been substituted for former Commissioner Kathleen\nDennehy.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fwas entrapment.         Commonwealth v. Teti, 801 N.E.2d 279, 282 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 2004).         He testified that he was an addict and had been\n\npressured by the agent to make the sale.              Id.\n\n               On the third day of Teti's four-day trial the prosecutor\n\nraised    an    issue    of   possible    conflict:   that    defense    attorney\n\nBradford Keene had also represented a witness hostile to Teti. Id.\n\nat 283.        Teti originally hired attorney Keene in May 1998 but\n\nreplaced him with attorney John McBride in January 1999.                      Id. at\n\n282.     After forwarding his file on Teti to McBride, Keene was no\n\nlonger involved in the case, although he never formally withdrew\n\nhis appearance and he sat at the defense counsel table during\n\nTeti's trial.      Id. at 282-83 & n.6.         Sometime around April 1998, a\n\nyear before Teti's trial, Keene had represented a man named Leo\n\nLobello in some limited matters.                Lobello, a convicted federal\n\nfelon, was the informant who had introduced Teti to the undercover\n\nagent who bought the cocaine from Teti.                     Id. at 282.        Keene\n\ninsisted, however, that he did not know Lobello was the informant\n\nin Teti's case until a week before Teti's trial.                Id. at 285.\n\n               McBride, who did know as early as February 1999 that\n\nLobello was the informant, had called Lobello as a hostile witness\n\nin the vain hopes that Lobello would bolster the entrapment defense\n\nby demonstrating that Teti was not predisposed to sell cocaine and\n\nby     appearing    himself     to   be     \"the   instigator     of    the     drug\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\ftransactions, as well as a reprobate and liar, testifying to curry\n\nfavor with the Federal authorities,\" id. at 282.\n\n           Upon hearing the prosecutor's concern about a potential\n\nconflict, the court immediately questioned both Keene and McBride.\n\nThat questioning, which has been the only hearing on this issue,\n\nunderlies the description of the facts by the Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt (\"MAC\") discussed below.          Initially, the state trial judge\n\nstated her impression that Keene had a conflict of interest; she\n\nrequired him to withdraw, but allowed the trial to continue.             The\n\njury   convicted   Teti,   and   he   was   sentenced   to   fifteen   years'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n           Two and a half years later, Teti moved for a new trial\n\nand, on denial of the new trial motion, moved for reconsideration.\n\nThat motion was also denied.          The same state judge who tried the\n\ncase, in denying the motion for a new trial, concluded that\n\ncontrary to her initial impression, there was no actual conflict of\n\ninterest and no showing that any prejudice had resulted, even if\n\nthere had been a conflict.            Because Massachusetts law largely\n\nleaves the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing on a new trial\n\nmotion to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and because Teti\n\nhad not presented any substantial question of fact warranting an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the state judge declined to grant one.              See\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 30(c)(3); Commonwealth v. Stewart, 418 N.E.2d\n\n1219, 1222-23 (Mass. 1981).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           The MAC in 2004 affirmed the conviction as well as the\n\ndenial of Teti's motion for a new trial.        The MAC rejected Teti's\n\nclaims that Keene had an actual conflict of interest in violation\n\nof Teti's federal and state constitutional rights, Teti, 801 N.E.2d\n\nat 284; that Keene's actions had caused Teti any prejudice, making\n\nit irrelevant whether Keene had a potential conflict of interest,\n\nid. at 286; and that Teti had been denied his right to effective\n\nassistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions for\n\nother reasons, id. at 286-89\n\n           The MAC made certain key findings of fact, which the\n\nfederal   habeas   court   later   presumed   were   correct:   (1)   that,\n\ncontrary to what the prosecutor had initially believed, Keene had\n\nnot represented Lobello in seeking a Rule 35(b) motion in federal\n\ncourt to reduce Lobello's federal sentence, id. at 283, 285 n.10;2\n\n(2) that Keene's representation of Lobello was fully in the past\n\nand was limited to a few, unanswered phone calls to a South\n\nCarolina prison facility approximately one year before Teti's trial\n\nin an effort to have Lobello transferred to another facility, and\n\nthat Keene had never spoken to or met Lobello, id. at 284-85; (3)\n\nthat Keene was not aware that Lobello was the informant in Teti's\n\ncase until one week before trial -- \"a point by which [Keene's]\n\n\n\n     2\n          Rule 35(b) allows the prosecutor to move for a reduced\nsentence based on the defendant's \"substantial assistance in\ninvestigating or prosecuting another person\" after the defendant\nwas sentenced. Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                    -5-\n\factivities on Lobello's behalf had long since ended,\" id. at 285;\n\n(4) that Keene did not participate in the preparation of Teti's\n\ncase and that his \"involvement with the trial was essentially\n\nnonexistent,\" id. at 286; and (5) that McBride learned of Keene's\n\nrepresentation of Lobello only on the third day of Teti's trial,\n\nid. at 287.      Based on these factual determinations, the MAC\n\nconcluded that Teti failed to establish the existence of an actual\n\nconflict of interest.   Id. at 285.\n\n          The MAC then considered whether apart from an actual\n\nconflict, Teti's counsel had a potential or, as state law phrases\n\nit, a \"tenuous\" conflict. It determined that, whether or not there\n\nhad been a conflict, there was no prejudice in any event.           Id. at\n\n286.   As the MAC sensibly reasoned, Keene's participation in the\n\ntrial preparation and the trial itself was de minimis.             Further,\n\nany privileged information that Keene did have would not have\n\nharmed Teti, as \"[i]t would have been to the defendant's benefit\n\nfor McBride to know more about Lobello, a hostile witness.\"           Id.\n\n          Teti had also presented to the MAC a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance by McBride, based on several alleged deficiencies. Teti\n\nargued that McBride was ineffective in failing to investigate\n\nKeene's potential conflicts and to tell Teti about Keene's prior\n\nrepresentation   of   Lobello,   but    the   MAC   held   there   was   no\n\nineffectiveness and no prejudice.       Id. at 287.   The MAC also noted\n\nthat when the trial judge had questioned Teti about Keene's alleged\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fconflict,    Teti    said    he    was    \"quite    satisfied\"    with    McBride's\n\nrepresentation.        Id.        The    MAC,   accordingly,     rejected    Teti's\n\nassertion that had he been informed more fully of the conflict, he\n\nwould have insisted on new counsel.                Id.\n\n            Teti also argued that McBride was ineffective for failing\n\nto move to sever the indictments against him; for introducing\n\nevidence    of    additional,      uncharged       drug   transactions;     and   for\n\npromising in his opening statement but then not providing testimony\n\nabout the effects of Teti's psychological and drug dependency\n\nproblems on his state of mind.               The MAC concluded that none of\n\nthese actions constituted ineffective assistance.                 See id. at 286-\n\n89.\n\n            The    Supreme    Judicial      Court    denied   further     appellate\n\nreview.    Commonwealth v. Teti, 805 N.E.2d 44 (Mass. 2004).\n\n                                          II.\n\n            In February 2005, Teti filed a petition for habeas corpus\n\nin federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, raising the same arguments\n\nhe had made to the MAC.\n\n            In an able opinion, the district court denied Teti's\n\nrequests for discovery and an evidentiary hearing and denied habeas\n\nrelief. The court applied the statutory presumption of correctness\n\nto the state court's factual determinations and viewed the claims\n\nactually ruled upon by the MAC through the deferential lens of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fNo. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996).      See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d),\n\n(e)(1).\n\n           The district court held that the state court holdings --\n\nthat there was neither an actual conflict nor any prejudice -- were\n\nnot an unreasonable application of federal law under AEDPA. See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).   Under federal law, an ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claim requires demonstrating \"a reasonable probability\n\nthat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.\"   Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984).   If, however, a defendant can show that\n\nhis attorney \"actively represented conflicting interests\" in breach\n\nof the attorney's duty of loyalty, and if the defendant can show\n\nthat this \"actual\" conflict of interest \"adversely affected [the]\n\nlawyer's performance,\" then the stricter prejudice showing required\n\nby Strickland does not apply.       Id. at 692 (quoting Cuyler v.\n\nSullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348, 350 (1980)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Allison v. Ficco, 388 F.3d 367, 370 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    In Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162 (2002), the Supreme\n\nCourt emphasized that an actual conflict of interest does not\n\nresult in an automatic reversal; in almost all cases, some showing\n\nof an adverse effect is still required.       Id. at 171, 173-74.\n\nLesser (\"potential\") conflicts of interest can also be the basis of\n\nan ineffective assistance claim, but the more stringent prejudice\n\nprong of Strickland then applies.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f            Although the MAC had relied on state law in concluding\n\nthere was no actual conflict, the district court noted that state\n\nlaw is more favorable than federal law to the defendant on this\n\nissue because under state law, if there were an actual conflict of\n\ninterest,     that    conflict    would      result    in   automatic       reversal\n\nregardless     of    whether     any   prejudice       could    be    shown.       See\n\nCommonwealth v. Croken, 733 N.E.2d 1005, 1010 (Mass. 2000).                        For\n\nhabeas purposes, where state law is explicitly more favorable to\n\ndefendants than the federal standard, \"we will presume the federal\n\nlaw adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication.\"\n\nMcCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24, 35 (1st Cir. 2002); see also\n\nCommonwealth v. Shraiar, 489 N.E.2d 689, 692 n.3 (Mass. 1986)\n\n(noting that the state constitutional standard on this issue is\n\nmore   protective      of   defendant's       interests        than   the      federal\n\nconstitutional standard).\n\n            As for Teti's claim that McBride shared Keene's conflict\n\nof interest, the district court determined that the MAC had not\n\nadjudicated    that    claim     on    the   merits,    even    though      Teti   had\n\npresented it to the court; it thus reviewed the claim de novo\n\ninstead of applying § 2254(d)(1)'s highly deferential standard.\n\nSee DiBenedetto v. Hall, 272 F.3d 1, 6-7 & n.1 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001).                             Again\n\nutilizing the presumption that the state court's factual findings\n\nwere correct, the district court concluded that attorney McBride\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fhad no conflict and that Teti could not establish any prejudice\n\nthat would have resulted even if a conflict had existed.              Finally,\n\nthe court found no basis for habeas relief in the state court's\n\nrejection of the remaining ineffective assistance claims.\n\n             The federal habeas court denied a later motion to amend\n\nor   to    alter   its   findings.      It   granted    a    certificate   of\n\nappealability      sua   sponte   regarding    issues       related   to   the\n\neffectiveness of Teti's counsel.\n\n             In addressing these issues, we recite only so much of the\n\ncase and underlying facts as needed for analysis of the denial of\n\nfederal habeas relief.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo;\n\nfurther, \"[w]hen the district court undertakes no independent\n\nfactfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same\n\nposition as the district court vis-à-vis the state court record,\"\n\nso we review the district court's factual conclusions de novo as\n\nwell.     Pike v. Guarino, 492 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir. 2007), petition\n\nfor cert. filed, __ U.S.L.W. ____ (U.S. Sept. 28, 2007) (No. 07-\n\n6854).\n\nA.           Deference Under § 2254(d)\n\n             Under AEDPA, our review of state court legal and factual\n\ndeterminations is highly deferential.         When a petitioner presses a\n\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fhabeas courts must defer to the state court determination unless\n\nit:\n\n             (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n             involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n             established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n             Court of the United States; or\n             (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an\n             unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n             evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n             Section   2254(d)   applies     to   Teti's   claim   that    Keene\n\nprovided ineffective assistance of counsel due to an actual or\n\npotential conflict of interest because the MAC adjudicated that\n\nclaim on the merits.       A matter is \"adjudicated on the merits\" if\n\nthere is a \"decision finally resolving the parties' claims, with\n\nres judicata effect, that is based on the substance of the claim\n\nadvanced, rather than on a procedural, or other, ground.\"                 Sellan\n\nv. Kuhlman, 261 F.3d 303, 311 (2d Cir. 2001).              Contrary to Teti's\n\nargument, § 2254(d) applies regardless of the procedures employed\n\nor    the   decision   reached   by   the    state   court,   as   long    as   a\n\nsubstantive decision was reached; the adequacy of the procedures\n\nand of the decision are addressed through the lens of § 2254(d),\n\nnot as a threshold matter.        See, e.g., Lambert v. Blodgett, 393\n\nF.3d 943, 966-69 (9th Cir. 2004) (no procedural requisites before\n\n§ 2254(d) applies); Wright v. Sec'y for Dep't of Corr., 278 F.3d\n\n1245, 1254 (11th Cir. 2002) (§ 2254(d) applies equally to summary\n\ndispositions); Valdez v. Cockrell, 274 F.3d 941, 950 (5th Cir.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f2001); Bell v. Jarvis, 236 F.3d 149, 158-60 (4th Cir. 2000) (en\n\nbanc); Harris v. Stovall, 212 F.3d 940, 943 (6th Cir. 2000); Aycox\n\nv. Lytle, 196 F.3d 1174, 1177-78 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n            Since an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a\n\nmixed question of law and fact, Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698; Scarpa\n\nv. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1994), Teti cannot be granted\n\nrelief unless the MAC's decision was an \"unreasonable application\n\nof[] clearly established Federal law,\" Terry Williams v. Taylor,\n\n529 U.S. 362, 409 (2000) (mixed questions are reviewed under\n\n§ 2254(d)(1)'s \"unreasonable application\" clause).           A decision can\n\nstill be reasonable even if the reviewing court thinks it is wrong;\n\n\"unreasonable\"     here   means   something    more   than     incorrect   or\n\nerroneous.   Id. at 411.\n\n            Based on the facts as described by the MAC, it was not\n\nunreasonable for the MAC to conclude that Keene's representation\n\nwas not constitutionally deficient.           Even assuming that Keene's\n\nrepresentation of Lobello and Teti overlapped for some period of\n\ntime and even assuming that Keene was actively engaged in Teti's\n\ntrial, Keene had stopped representing Lobello a year before the\n\ntrial and long before he knew that Lobello was the informant in\n\nTeti's case. Further, the MAC found that Keene's representation of\n\nLobello was very limited and would not have related in any way to\n\nTeti's case.       Based on these facts, there were no competing\n\nloyalties    and    no    possible    detrimental     effect     on   Teti's\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\frepresentation. To press this claim, then, Teti must challenge the\n\nfactfinding on which the MAC's conclusion rested.                    We turn to\n\n§ 2254(e).\n\n             Our mode of analysis does not suggest, however, that\n\nhabeas courts should always consider the reasonableness of the\n\nstate court's determination under § 2254(d) before considering the\n\nvalidity of the state court factfinding under § 2254(e).                      To\n\nsuggest a set order of analysis would unnecessarily constrain\n\nhabeas courts. Accord Lambert v. Blackwell, 387 F.3d 210, 236 n.19\n\n(3d   Cir.    2004)    (acknowledging     that   different      circuits    have\n\nsuggested different orders of analysis and declining to adopt a\n\nrigid approach).       Others disagree.     See 1 Hertz & Liebman, Federal\n\nHabeas    Corpus    Practice   and   Procedure   §    20.2c   (5th    ed.   2005)\n\n(concluding that courts should apply § 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness\n\nreview before applying § 2254(e)(1)).\n\nB.           Deference Under § 2254(e)\n\n             Under § 2254(e)(1), \"a determination of a factual issue\n\nmade by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\"                      The\n\npetitioner bears the burden of overcoming that presumption by\n\nproviding \"clear and convincing evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n\n             The relationship between § 2254(d)(2) and § 2254(e)(1),\n\nboth of which apply to state court fact determinations, has caused\n\nsome confusion.       The Supreme Court has suggested that § 2254(e)(1)\n\napplies      to   \"determinations    of     factual   issues,    rather      than\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fdecisions,\" while § 2254(d)(2) \"applies to the granting of habeas\n\nrelief\" itself.      Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 341-42\n\n(2003).       That   is,   under   this     approach,    §   2254(d)(2)'s\n\nreasonableness standard would apply to the final decision reached\n\nby the state court on a determinative factual question, while\n\n§ 2254(e)(1)'s presumption of correctness would apply to the\n\nindividual factfindings, which might underlie the state court's\n\nfinal decision or which might be determinative of new legal issues\n\nconsidered by the habeas court.       See, e.g., Blackwell, 387 F.3d at\n\n235 (\"[Section] 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness determination turns on\n\na consideration of the totality of the 'evidence presented in the\n\nstate-court    proceeding,'   while     §   2254(e)(1)   contemplates   a\n\nchallenge to the state court's individual factual determinations .\n\n. . .\") (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2)); Valdez, 274 F.3d at 951\n\nn.17; cf. Coombs v. State of Maine, 202 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(suggesting but not explicating this distinction).\n\n          This question has not yet been definitively resolved, nor\n\ndo we attempt our own resolution here.3           Since Miller-El, the\n\n\n     3\n          The Ninth Circuit, for example, draws a slightly\ndifferent distinction than the one described above. Under that\ncourt's approach, § 2254(d)(2) applies when the petitioner argues\nthat the state court drew unreasonable conclusions based on the\nevidence already in the record; § 2254(e)(1) applies, on the other\nhand, when the petitioner wishes to bring in new evidence to\nchallenge the facts found by the state court. See, e.g., Blodgett,\n393 F.3d at 972, 978; Taylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992, 999-1000 (9th\nCir. 2004).\n          Professors Hertz and Liebman would apply the provisions\nsequentially: under their approach, courts should consider first\n\n                                   -14-\n\fSupreme Court has not further clarified this issue.                      See Rice v.\n\nCollins, 546 U.S. 333, 338-39 (2006).                As the Third Circuit noted\n\nin Blackwell, \"[d]espite the Supreme Court's pronouncements in\n\nMiller-El         and    Wiggins    [v.   Smith,    539    U.S.    510    (2003)],    a\n\ncomprehensive interpretation of AEDPA's factual review scheme has\n\nyet    to   emerge       from   the    federal     courts.        Specifically,      the\n\nrelationship between the standards enunciated in § 2254(d)(2) and\n\n§ 2254(e)(1) remains unclear.\" 387 F.3d at 235; see also Blodgett,\n\n393 F.3d at 971 & n.19; R. Fallon et al., Hart & Wechsler's The\n\nFederal Courts and the Federal System 1355 (5th ed. 2003); 17B\n\nWright      et    al.,    Federal     Practice     and    Procedure:     Jurisdiction\n\n§ 4265.2 (3d ed. 2007).\n\n                 For now we follow the Supreme Court's lead in Miller-El\n\nand apply § 2254(e)(1) to the MAC's individual factfindings.                       The\n\ndecision to do so is not determinative, however, for not only do\n\nboth    provisions        \"express     the   same    fundamental       principle     of\n\ndeference to state court findings,\"                 Blackwell, 387 F.3d at 235,\n\nbut were we to apply § 2254(d)(2), we would also find the MAC's\n\nfactual conclusions to be not unreasonable in light of the record\n\nbefore it.\n\n\n\n\nwhether a state court's factfindings are reasonable under\n§ 2254(d)(2), and if they are, only then should the courts apply\n§ 2254(e)(1)'s presumption of correctness.    1 Hertz & Liebman\n§ 20.2c.\n\n                                          -15-\n\f           1.        Presumption of Correctness Under § 2254(e)(1)\n\n           The \"presumption of correctness is equally applicable\n\nwhen a state appellate court, as opposed to a state trial court,\n\nmakes the finding of fact.\"           Norton v. Spencer, 351 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (quoting Sumner v. Mata, 455 U.S. 591, 592-93 (1982))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).            Contrary to Teti's arguments,\n\nit is for the habeas petitioner to provide the clear and convincing\n\nevidence that can overcome that presumption of correctness.\n\n           There is some disagreement about whether the presumption\n\nof correctness always applies or if there are instead certain\n\nprocedural prerequisites.         See, e.g., Mayes v. Gibson, 210 F.3d\n\n1284, 1289 (10th Cir. 2000) (if there was no \"full, fair, and\n\nadequate   hearing     in   the       state    court,\"    the     presumption   of\n\ncorrectness does not apply); cf. Taylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992,\n\n1001 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"If . . . a state court makes evidentiary\n\nfindings   without    holding     a    hearing    and    giving    petitioner   an\n\nopportunity to present evidence, such findings clearly result in an\n\n'unreasonable determination' of the facts [under § 2254(d)(2)].\");\n\n1 Hertz & Liebman § 20.2c (§ 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness standard\n\napplies to both the process and the substance of state court\n\nfactfindings).\n\n           While the policy arguments underlying these conclusions\n\nare reasonable, we must look first to the language of the statute.\n\nWhen Congress revised § 2254 under AEDPA, it removed language that\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fhad limited the presumption to determinations made \"after a hearing\n\non the merits of a factual issue,\" as well as the statute's list of\n\nprocedural defects that previously deprived state court factfinding\n\nof the presumption.           As Professors Fallon, Meltzer, and Shapiro\n\nhave    noted,      these    changes   suggest     that       \"the    presumption    of\n\ncorrectness now applies across the board.\"                     R. Fallon et al. at\n\n1355; see also Valdez, 274 F.3d at 949-51; Mendiola v. Schomig, 224\n\nF.3d 589, 592-93 (7th Cir. 2000); 17B Wright et al. § 4265.2\n\n(noting    change       of   statutory   language,       raising       concerns,    and\n\npredicting       that    courts     might   read       some    of     the   procedural\n\nrequirements back into the statute).\n\n               The Third Circuit has taken the position that \"the extent\n\nto which a state court provides a 'full and fair hearing' is no\n\nlonger a threshold requirement before deference applies; but it\n\nmight     be    a    consideration       while     applying          deference   under\n\n§ 2254(d)(2) and § 2254(e)(1).\"             Blackwell, 387 F.3d at 239.              We\n\nagree with this approach.              While it might seem questionable to\n\npresume the correctness of material facts not derived from a full\n\nand fair hearing in state court, the veracity of those facts can be\n\ntested through an evidentiary hearing before the district court\n\nwhere   appropriate.          Cf.   Valdez,      274    F.3d    at    951   n.17,   952\n\n(evidentiary hearing can aid in federal court's assessment of\n\nreasonableness under § 2254(d) when state did not hold a full and\n\nfair hearing).\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f           Teti does not attempt to argue that he has clear and\n\nconvincing evidence to overcome the presumption here.                        Instead he\n\ntries to refute the MAC's factual determinations by employing the\n\nsame documents already considered by the state courts.                             That\n\napproach fails.     Describing how different parties stated different\n\nversions of events does not constitute the needed showing of clear\n\nand convincing evidence; rather, the state trial judge's implicit\n\ncredibility determinations, adopted by the MAC, are exactly the\n\ntype of factual determinations to which we defer, at least short of\n\nany   indication    of   serious     error.         Rice,     546   U.S.     at   341-42\n\n(\"Reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the\n\nprosecutor's credibility, but on habeas review that does not\n\nsuffice      to     supersede        the         trial      court's        credibility\n\ndetermination.\").\n\n           Teti also argues that the trial judge's conclusion post-\n\ntrial that there was no relevant conflict of interest contradicts\n\nher in-court statements.             That argument does not work either.\n\nFirst,    the     judge's    in-court            statements      were      not     final\n\ndeterminations and thus not inconsistent with her later ruling.\n\nTeti, 801 N.E.2d at 285 n.11 (\"That the judge, on first impression,\n\nbelieved there was a conflict did not prevent her from considering\n\nthe issue further, and then specifically finding, in a reasoned and\n\nreflective      memorandum   .   .    .    ,   that      there   was,   in    fact,   no\n\nconflict.\"). Second, such a determination by the state trial judge\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fwould be a legal -- not factual -- conclusion and thus not relevant\n\nto the § 2254(e)(1) inquiry.\n\n           Because the presumption of correctness applies to all the\n\nstate court's factfindings, and because Teti does not point us to\n\nany clear and convincing evidence that refutes those factfindings,\n\nwe turn next to whether he should have been allowed discovery or an\n\nevidentiary hearing.\n\n           2.     Discovery Under Rule 6\n\n           Habeas corpus proceedings under § 2254 are civil in\n\nnature, but they are governed by a discrete set of procedural\n\nrules.   Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 654 & 655 n.4 (2005).   Thus\n\nunlike in normal civil cases, there is no entitlement to discovery\n\nin habeas proceedings; the availability of discovery is instead\n\ncircumscribed by Rule 6 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases.   Bracy\n\nv. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904 (1997); Bader v. Warden, 488 F.3d\n\n483, 488 (1st Cir. 2007).   Under Rule 6, the federal habeas judge\n\nhas discretion to grant discovery for \"good cause.\"      Rule 6(a).\n\nThe party requesting discovery must not only provide reasons for\n\nthe discovery, but also must specify \"any proposed interrogatories\n\nand requests for admission\" and \"any requested documents.\"      Rule\n\n6(b). We review the district court's denial of discovery for abuse\n\nof discretion.   See Bader, 488 F.3d at 488.\n\n           Teti did not comply with the specific requirements of\n\nRule (6)(b); his request for discovery is generalized and does not\n\n\n                                -19-\n\findicate exactly what information he seeks to obtain.                   A habeas\n\nproceeding is not a fishing expedition.            E.g., Stanford v. Parker,\n\n266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir. 2001); Rich v. Calderon, 187 F.3d 1064,\n\n1067 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n            In addition, as the district court noted, Teti did not\n\nmeet the Rule's requirement of \"good cause.\" The Supreme Court has\n\ndefined \"good cause\" in this context as specific allegations that\n\ngive a court \"reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the\n\nfacts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is . . .\n\nentitled to relief.\"       Bracy, 520 U.S. at 908-09 (quoting Harris v.\n\nNelson,   394    U.S.    286,    300   (1969))    (internal   quotation     marks\n\nomitted).    The district court carefully reviewed the documents\n\nsubmitted to it and concluded they did not suggest that discovery\n\nwould help establish any claim for relief.              The district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying discovery.\n\n            3.       Evidentiary Hearings\n\n            We   also     review    the   decision      whether   to    grant   an\n\nevidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. Pike, 492 F.3d at 70;\n\nsee also Schriro v. Landrigan, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 1940 (2007).\n\n            Before      AEDPA,   judge-made      law   governed   the    decision\n\nwhether to grant an evidentiary hearing.               Under Townsend v. Sain,\n\n372 U.S. 293 (1963), district courts generally had discretion to\n\ngrant such hearings when they deemed it appropriate.                   Id. at 318\n\n(\"In every case [the district judge] has the power, constrained\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fonly by his sound discretion, to receive evidence bearing upon the\n\napplicant's   constitutional   claim.\").   In   some   situations,   an\n\nevidentiary hearing before the district court was mandatory: \"Where\n\nthe facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must\n\nhold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive\n\na full and fair evidentiary hearing in state court, either at the\n\ntime of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.\"         Id. at 312.\n\nTownsend specified six situations which would necessitate a hearing\n\nunder this standard, including a catch-all category for \"any\n\nreason\" the petitioner might not have received a full and fair\n\nhearing on the issue before a state court.      Id. at 313.\n\n          But Townsend was \"significantly qualified by later case\n\nlaw and congressional action[,] leaving the circuit courts in some\n\nuncertainty\" about when new federal factfinding for state prisoners\n\nis appropriate.4   Bader, 488 F.3d at 487.      There is debate post-\n\nAEDPA over whether evidentiary hearings are still mandatory in some\n\ncircumstances, or whether they are simply within the district court\n\njudge's discretion when not prohibited. Some courts have concluded\n\nthat Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1 (1992), and AEDPA only\n\nmodified Townsend's six categories of mandatory hearings, leaving\n\n\n     4\n          AEDPA did not change the standard for granting\nevidentiary hearings under § 2255, which applies to federal\npetitioners. This suggests that Congress intended \"to create a\ndiscrepancy between the (respectively, somewhat narrower and\nbroader) rights to a hearing in section 2254 and section 2255.\" 2\nHertz & Liebman § 41.6d.       This discrepancy underscores the\nprinciples of comity and federalism embodied in § 2254.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fthe rest of Townsend intact.     E.g., Conaway v. Polk, 453 F.3d 567,\n\n582, 590 (4th Cir. 2006); Insyxiengmay v. Morgan, 403 F.3d 657, 670\n\n(9th Cir. 2005); Smith v. Bowersox, 311 F.3d 915, 921 (8th Cir.\n\n2002); Matheney v. Anderson, 253 F.3d 1025, 1039 (7th Cir. 2001);\n\nMiller v. Champion, 161 F.3d 1249, 1253 (10th Cir. 1998).           And some\n\ncommentators agree.     See 1 Hertz & Liebman § 20.1b (\"Even after\n\nAEDPA . . . Townsend's mandatory-hearing standards . . . continue[]\n\nto govern all situations save those in which the petitioner's\n\nprocedural default accounts for the state courts' failure to\n\ndevelop the material facts.\"); W. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure\n\n§ 28.7(c) (2d ed. 2004).     Indeed, the Advisory Committee Notes for\n\nRule 8 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, regarding evidentiary\n\nhearings, suggest that Townsend still applies except to the extent\n\nit is specifically superceded by § 2254(e)(2).           The Third Circuit,\n\non the other hand, has read AEDPA as rendering all evidentiary\n\nhearings purely discretionary.        E.g., Campbell v. Vaughn, 209 F.3d\n\n280, 287 (3d Cir. 2000) (\"AEDPA, unlike Townsend and Keeney, does\n\nnot require that such a hearing be held.           Instead, federal courts\n\nhave discretion to grant [an evidentiary] hearing or not.\").\n\n            At the least, where not explicitly prohibited by § 2254,\n\nfederal   habeas   judges   retain    discretion    to   grant   evidentiary\n\nhearings.    See Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, Rule 8(a); Schriro,\n\n127 S. Ct. at 1939 (AEDPA did not change the \"basic rule\" that \"the\n\ndecision to grant an evidentiary hearing [is] generally left to the\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fsound discretion of district courts\"); Guidry v. Dretke, 397 F.3d\n\n306, 323 (5th Cir. 2005).    But that discretion should be exercised\n\nin a restrained manner.      As the Supreme Court noted in Schriro,\n\nCongress through AEDPA meant to curb delays and prevent retrials\n\nbefore habeas courts.     127 S. Ct. at 1940; see also Pike, 492 F.3d\n\nat 70. As a result, federal evidentiary hearings seeking to rehear\n\nissues addressed by the state courts \"ought to be the exception,\n\nnot the rule.\"   Pike, 492 F.3d at 70.\n\n          We need not resolve today the question of whether federal\n\nhabeas evidentiary hearings are ever mandated.       First, AEDPA is\n\nclear on one point: an evidentiary hearing is prohibited if \"the\n\napplicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in\n\nState court proceedings\" unless certain stringent exceptions apply.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2).    It may seem odd to prohibit an evidentiary\n\nhearing where the defendant did not present the facts to a state\n\ncourt but not to prohibit one where he did.    But the prohibition is\n\nanalogous to a procedural default rule, furthering the principles\n\nof comity, finality, and federalism by requiring the prisoner to\n\npresent his claims fully before the state courts. Michael Williams\n\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436-37 (2000).\n\n          Section 2254(e)(2)'s bar applies where there has been a\n\n\"lack of diligence\" on the part of the petitioner or his counsel\n\nbefore the state courts.      Id. at 432.   Teti demonstrated such a\n\nlack of diligence.   \"Diligence will require in the usual case that\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fthe prisoner, at a minimum, seek an evidentiary hearing in state\n\ncourt in the manner proscribed by state law.\"             Id. at 437.     Teti's\n\nbroad claims in his state court motion for a new trial did not\n\nraise any specific question sufficient to require the state trial\n\njudge to hold an evidentiary hearing.               Cf. Bowersox, 311 F.3d at\n\n921-22 (petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing barred\n\nunder § 2254(e)(2) where petitioner had submitted only broad\n\nallegations      to   the   state    court,    in     conflict   with    state's\n\nrequirement of factual allegations sufficient to warrant relief if\n\ntrue).    Further,      Teti   did   not     develop   his    argument   for   an\n\nevidentiary hearing in his appeal to the MAC.             Teti, 801 N.E.2d at\n\n289.   Section 2254(e)(2) does include narrow exceptions that would\n\nexcuse a petitioner's lack of diligence, but they clearly do not\n\napply to Teti's situation: there is no new rule of constitutional\n\nlaw, nor any new evidence, much less any evidence that \"could not\n\nhave   been    previously   discovered       through    the   exercise   of    due\n\ndiligence.\"      28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)(A).\n\n              Second, even if Teti's request for an evidentiary hearing\n\nwere not barred by § 2254(e)(2) for lack of diligence, he fails on\n\nanother threshold matter, just as he did before the state trial\n\ncourt.   Akin to Rule 6's \"good cause\" requirement, a habeas judge,\n\nbefore granting an evidentiary hearing, \"must [first] consider\n\nwhether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the\n\npetition's factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\fapplicant to federal habeas relief.\"        Schriro, 127 S. Ct. at 1940;\n\nsee also Townsend, 372 U.S. at 312.\n\n            The requirement is not so stringent that Teti must point\n\nto specific facts he will establish that will entitle him to\n\nrelief, but rather that his allegations would entitle him to relief\n\nand the hearing is likely to elicit the factual support for those\n\nallegations.    See, e.g., Insyxiengmay, 403 F.3d at 670.            As the\n\nFourth Circuit noted in the context of a state collateral review\n\npetition, \"it would create a 'classic catch-22' if [a habeas]\n\ndefendant    were   obliged   to   submit   admissible    evidence   to   the\n\n[habeas] court in order to be accorded an evidentiary hearing, when\n\nthe defendant is seeking the hearing because he cannot, without\n\nsubpoena power or mechanisms of discovery, otherwise secure such\n\nevidence.\"    Conaway, 453 F.3d at 584.       But see Campbell, 209 F.3d\n\nat 290 (petitioner needs clear evidence before a habeas court can\n\njustify a new evidentiary hearing, at least where the state court\n\nalso held an evidentiary hearing and there is a sufficient basis in\n\nthe record for the state court's conclusions).           On the other hand,\n\nTeti must allege more than that he received inadequate assistance;\n\nhe must allege facts sufficient to overcome AEDPA deference to the\n\nstate court's factfindings and legal conclusion to the contrary.\n\nSee Schriro, 127 S. Ct. at 1940; Bader, 488 F.3d at 488.\n\n            The district court correctly considered this threshold\n\nquestion, concluding that Teti had not given any \"indication that\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fan evidentiary hearing would give rise to 'clear and convincing\n\nevidence' that petitioner's trial counsel suffered from a conflict\n\nof interest.\"     We turn, however, directly to the question of\n\nprejudice.    See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697 (\"[A] court need not\n\ndetermine    whether   counsel's   performance    was   deficient   before\n\nexamining the prejudice suffered by the defendant . . . . If it is\n\neasier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack\n\nof sufficient prejudice, . . . that course should be followed.\").\n\n            Teti argues that he suffered prejudice because he was\n\nunable to obtain a plea agreement.        He does not, however, make the\n\nargument that his attorneys failed to obtain a plea agreement\n\nbecause of their conflicted loyalties.        Nor would such an argument\n\nbe plausible, given that Keene ceased representing Lobello shortly\n\nafter, if not before, he began representing Teti.           Teti instead\n\nargues that McBride was unable to secure a plea agreement for him\n\nbecause the Commonwealth was worried, once the conflict of interest\n\nconcern was aired, that such an agreement might be vulnerable on\n\nappeal.     The argument is hard to credit, as one would think a\n\nconviction would have been more vulnerable on appeal.        Regardless,\n\nit is insufficient.\n\n            Teti might be arguing that he was harmed because of\n\nprocedural irregularities in the hearing before the state trial\n\njudge.    The relevant harm, however, is the one emanating from\n\nKeene's alleged conflict of interest.          If a federal evidentiary\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fhearing could cure any procedural irregularities, Teti still has\n\nnot explained what harm he would hope to demonstrate beyond the\n\nalleged plea agreement harm already discussed.\n\n           Teti has not argued sufficient harm to satisfy Mickens,\n\nmuch less the prejudice needed to meet the more stringent standard\n\nfor   establishing   ineffective    assistance   where   counsel    has   a\n\npotential, rather than actual, conflict of interest.          In short,\n\nTeti \"continues to assert he needs [an] evidentiary hearing to\n\nfactually develop his constitutional claims, but he has failed at\n\nevery level to make a factual showing (as opposed to conclusory\n\nstatements) as to why those claims merit development through the\n\ncrucible of an official hearing.\"         Reynolds v. Bagley, 498 F.3d\n\n549, 555 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\n           Because Teti provides no clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the MAC's factual determinations were erroneous, and because\n\nhe has not adequately specified what facts he seeks to establish\n\nthrough discovery or an evidentiary hearing, the MAC's factual\n\ndeterminations   stand,   as   does   its   ultimate   conclusion   under\n\n§ 2254(d)(1) that Keene did not provide ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel due to any conflict of interest.       See Allison, 388 F.3d at\n\n370-71.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fC.        Remaining Claims\n\n          Teti also claims that McBride shared Keene's conflict of\n\ninterest and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel for\n\nseveral additional reasons.\n\n          The district court reviewed de novo the claim that\n\nMcBride had a conflict.      It did so on the basis that the MAC did\n\nnot expressly rule on this issue, although the issue had been\n\npresented to it.   See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.        We need not address\n\nwhether this was the correct approach, for whether reviewed de novo\n\nor deferentially, Teti's claim fails.          If Keene did not have a\n\nconflict, there was no derivative conflict in McBride, and like the\n\nstate court, we see no possible prejudice to Teti.\n\n          We    rely   on   the   district   court's    reasoning   on   the\n\nremaining ineffective assistance claims against McBride.                 The\n\ndistrict court correctly applied § 2254(d)(1) to these claims, as\n\nthey were addressed by the state court.                The district court\n\nreasoned as follows: Because Teti's main defense was entrapment,\n\nMcBride's failure to move to sever the two indictments and his\n\nallowance of the introduction of evidence on similar but uncharged\n\ndrug transactions could have been part of a reasonable defense\n\nstrategy to highlight that the same federal agent initiated all the\n\ntransactions.    Further, a motion to sever would have failed, as\n\njoinder was appropriate under state law.          Finally, the relevant\n\ninformation about Teti's state of mind was provided when Teti\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fhimself testified as to his drug dependency and depression; McBride\n\nhad promised nothing further in his opening statement.   The MAC's\n\nconclusion that none of these arguments established ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel was therefore not an unreasonable application\n\nof federal law under § 2254(d)(1).    We agree.\n\n          Teti has been well and inventively represented on appeal.\n\nThe denial of the petition for habeas relief is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -29-\n\f",

Joseph Teti appeals from the denial of his federal petition for habeas corpus relief.<sup>[1]</sup> The primary question in this appeal is whether the federal district court erred in applying the presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) to the state appellate court's findings of facts and in denying discovery and an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>Substantively, Teti argues that the state court erred in denying his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights because, inter alia, his original defense attorney Bradford Keene had an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>We affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We describe the facts as they appear from the state court record. Teti was convicted in Massachusetts Superior Court in April 1999 on charges stemming from two cocaine trafficking incidents in 1996. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32E(b)(4). As he had provided cocaine to an undercover agent, Teti's primary defense was entrapment. <i>Commonwealth v. Teti,</i> 60 Mass.App.Ct. 279, 801 N.E.2d 279, 282 (2004). He testified that he was an addict and had been pressured by the agent to make the sale. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On the third day of Teti's four-day trial the prosecutor raised an issue of possible conflict: that defense attorney Bradford Keene had also represented a witness hostile to Teti. <i>Id.</i> at 283, 801 N.E.2d 279. Teti originally hired attorney Keene in May 1998 but replaced him with attorney John McBride in January 1999. <i>Id.</i> at 282, 801 N.E.2d 279. After forwarding his file on Teti to McBride, Keene was no longer involved in the case, although he never formally withdrew his appearance and he sat at the defense counsel table during Teti's trial. <i>Id.</i> at 282-83 &amp; n. 6, 801 N.E.2d 279. Sometime around April 1998, a year before Teti's trial, Keene had represented a man named Leo Lobello in some limited matters. Lobello, a convicted federal felon, was the informant who had introduced Teti to the undercover agent who bought the cocaine from Teti. <i>Id.</i> at 282, 801 N.E.2d 279. Keene insisted, however, that he did not know Lobello was the informant in Teti's case until a week before Teti's trial. <i>Id.</i> at 285, 801 N.E.2d 279.</p>\n<p>McBride, who did know as early as February 1999 that Lobello was the informant, had called Lobello as a hostile witness in the vain hopes that Lobello would bolster the entrapment defense by demonstrating that Teti was not predisposed to sell cocaine and by appearing himself to be \"the instigator of the drug transactions, as well as a reprobate and liar, testifying to curry favor with the Federal authorities,\" <i>id.</i> at 282, 801 N.E.2d 279.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing the prosecutor's concern about a potential conflict, the court immediately questioned both Keene and McBride. That questioning, which has been the only hearing on this issue, underlies the description of the facts by the Massachusetts Appeals Court (\"MAC\") discussed below. Initially, the state trial judge stated her impression that Keene had a conflict of interest; she required him to withdraw, but allowed the trial to continue. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> The jury convicted Teti, and he was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Two and a half years later, Teti moved for a new trial and, on denial of the new trial motion, moved for reconsideration. That motion was also denied. The same state judge who tried the case, in denying the motion for a new trial, concluded that contrary to her initial impression, there was no actual conflict of interest and no showing that any prejudice had resulted, even if there had been a conflict. Because Massachusetts law largely leaves the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing on a new trial motion to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and because Teti had not presented any substantial question of fact warranting an evidentiary hearing, the state judge declined to grant one. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(3); <i>Commonwealth v. Stewart,</i> 383 Mass. 253, 418 N.E.2d 1219, 1222-23 (1981).</p>\n<p>The MAC in 2004 affirmed the conviction as well as the denial of Teti's motion for a new trial. The MAC rejected Teti's claims that Keene had an actual conflict of interest in violation of Teti's federal and state constitutional rights, <i>Teti,</i> 801 N.E.2d at 284; that Keene's actions had caused Teti any prejudice, making it irrelevant whether Keene had a potential conflict of interest, <i>id.</i> at 286, 801 N.E.2d 279; and that Teti had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions for other reasons, <i>id.</i> at 286-89, 801 N.E.2d 279.</p>\n<p>The MAC made certain key findings of fact, which the federal habeas court later presumed were correct: (1) that, contrary to what the prosecutor had initially believed, Keene had not represented Lobello in seeking a Rule 35(b) motion in federal court to reduce Lobello's federal sentence, <i>id.</i> at 283, 285 n. 10, 801 N.E.2d 279;<sup>[2]</sup> (2) that Keene's representation of Lobello was fully in the past and was limited to a few, unanswered phone calls to a South Carolina prison facility approximately one year before Teti's trial in an effort to have Lobello transferred to another facility, and that Keene had never spoken to or met Lobello, <i>id.</i> at 284-85, 801 N.E.2d 279; (3) that Keene was not aware that Lobello was the informant in Teti's case until one week before trial  \"a point by which [Keene's] activities on Lobello's behalf had long since ended,\" <i>id.</i> at 285, 801 N.E.2d 279; (4) that Keene did not participate in the preparation of Teti's case and that his \"involvement with the trial was essentially nonexistent,\" <i>id.</i> at 286, 801 N.E.2d 279; and (5) that McBride learned of Keene's representation of Lobello only on the third day of Teti's trial, <i>id.</i> at 287, 801 N.E.2d 279. Based on these factual determinations, the MAC concluded that Teti failed to establish the existence of an actual conflict of interest. <i>Id.</i> at 285, 801 N.E.2d 279.</p>\n<p>The MAC then considered whether apart from an actual conflict, Teti's counsel had a potential or, as state law phrases it, a \"tenuous\" conflict. It determined that, whether or not there had been a conflict, there was no prejudice in any event. <i>Id.</i> at 286, 801 N.E.2d 279. As the MAC sensibly reasoned, Keene's participation in the trial preparation and the trial itself was de minimis. Further, any privileged information that Keene did have would not have harmed Teti, as \"[i]t would have been to the defendant's benefit for McBride to know more about Lobello, a hostile witness.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Teti had also presented to the MAC a claim of ineffective assistance by McBride, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> based on several alleged deficiencies. Teti argued that McBride was ineffective in failing to investigate Keene's potential conflicts and to tell Teti about Keene's prior representation of Lobello, but the MAC held there was no ineffectiveness and no prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 287, 801 N.E.2d 279. The MAC also noted that when the trial judge had questioned Teti about Keene's alleged conflict, Teti said he was \"quite satisfied\" with McBride's representation. <i>Id.</i> The MAC, accordingly, rejected Teti's assertion that had he been informed more fully of the conflict, he would have insisted on new counsel. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Teti also argued that McBride was ineffective for failing to move to sever the indictments against him; for introducing evidence of additional, uncharged drug transactions; and for promising in his opening statement but then not providing testimony about the effects of Teti's psychological and drug dependency problems on his state of mind. The MAC concluded that none of these actions constituted ineffective assistance. <i>See id.</i> at 286-89, 801 N.E.2d 279.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court denied further appellate review. <i>Commonwealth v. Teti,</i> 441 Mass. 1104, 805 N.E.2d 44 (2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>In February 2005, Teti filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, raising the same arguments he had made to the MAC.</p>\n<p>In an able opinion, the district court denied Teti's requests for discovery and an evidentiary hearing and denied habeas relief. The court applied the statutory presumption of correctness to the state court's factual determinations and viewed the claims actually ruled upon by the MAC through the deferential lens of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), (e)(1).</p>\n<p>The district court held that the state court holdings  that there was neither an actual conflict nor any prejudice  were not an unreasonable application of federal law under AEDPA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). Under federal law, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires demonstrating \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If, however, a defendant can show that his attorney \"actively represented conflicting interests\" in breach of the attorney's duty of loyalty, and if the defendant can show that this \"actual\" conflict of interest \"adversely affected [the] lawyer's performance,\" then the stricter prejudice showing required by <i>Strickland</i> does not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (quoting <i>Cuyler v. Sullivan,</i> 446 U.S. 335, 348, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Allison v. Ficco,</i> 388 F.3d 367, 370 (1st Cir.2004). In <i>Mickens v. Taylor,</i> 535 U.S. 162, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002), the Supreme Court emphasized that an actual conflict of interest does not result in an automatic reversal; in almost all cases, some showing of an adverse effect is still required. <i>Id.</i> at 171, 173-74, 122 S.Ct. 1237. Lesser (\"potential\") conflicts of interest can also be the basis of an ineffective assistance claim, but the more stringent prejudice prong of <i>Strickland</i> then applies.</p>\n<p>Although the MAC had relied on state law in concluding there was no actual conflict, the district court noted that state law is more favorable than federal law to the defendant on this issue because under state law, if there were an actual conflict of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> interest, that conflict would result in automatic reversal regardless of whether any prejudice could be shown. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Croken,</i> 432 Mass. 266, 733 N.E.2d 1005, 1010 (2000). For habeas purposes, where state law is explicitly more favorable to defendants than the federal standard, \"we will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication.\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 35 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see also </i><i>Commonwealth v. Shraiar,</i> 397 Mass. 16, 489 N.E.2d 689, 692 n. 3 (1986) (noting that the state constitutional standard on this issue is more protective of defendant's interests than the federal constitutional standard).</p>\n<p>As for Teti's claim that McBride shared Keene's conflict of interest, the district court determined that the MAC had not adjudicated that claim on the merits, even though Teti had presented it to the court; it thus reviewed the claim de novo instead of applying § 2254(d)(1)'s highly deferential standard. <i>See </i><i>DiBenedetto v. Hall,</i> 272 F.3d 1, 6-7 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2001). Again utilizing the presumption that the state court's factual findings were correct, the district court concluded that attorney McBride had no conflict and that Teti could not establish any prejudice that would have resulted even if a conflict had existed. Finally, the court found no basis for habeas relief in the state court's rejection of the remaining ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<p>The federal habeas court denied a later motion to amend or to alter its findings. It granted a certificate of appealability sua sponte regarding issues related to the effectiveness of Teti's counsel.</p>\n<p>In addressing these issues, we recite only so much of the case and underlying facts as needed for analysis of the denial of federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo; further, \"[w]hen the district court undertakes no independent factfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same position as the district court vis-à-vis the state court record,\" so we review the district court's factual conclusions de novo as well. <i>Pike v. Guarino,</i> 492 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S.L.W. ___, ___ U.S. ___, ___ S.Ct. ___, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, 2007 WL 2888011 (U.S. Sept. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6854).</p>\n<p>A. <i>Deference Under § 2254(d)</i></p>\n<p>Under AEDPA, our review of state court legal and factual determinations is highly deferential. When a petitioner presses a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal habeas courts must defer to the state court determination unless it:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).</p>\n<p>Section 2254(d) applies to Teti's claim that Keene provided ineffective assistance of counsel due to an actual or potential conflict of interest because the MAC adjudicated that claim on the merits. A matter is \"adjudicated on the merits\" if there is a \"decision finally resolving the parties' claims, with res judicata effect, that is based on the substance of the claim advanced, rather than on a procedural, or other, ground.\" <i>Sellan v. Kuhlman,</i> 261 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> F.3d 303, 311 (2d Cir.2001). Contrary to Teti's argument, § 2254(d) applies regardless of the procedures employed or the decision reached by the state court, as long as a substantive decision <i>was</i> reached; the adequacy of the procedures and of the decision are addressed through the lens of § 2254(d), not as a threshold matter. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lambert v. Blodgett,</i> 393 F.3d 943, 966-69 (9th Cir.2004) (no procedural requisites before § 2254(d) applies); <i>Wright v. Sec'y for Dep't of Corr.,</i> 278 F.3d 1245, 1254 (11th Cir.2002) (§ 2254(d) applies equally to summary dispositions); <i>Valdez v. Cockrell,</i> 274 F.3d 941, 950 (5th Cir. 2001); <i>Bell v. Jarvis,</i> 236 F.3d 149, 158-60 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc); <i>Harris v. Stovall,</i> 212 F.3d 940, 943 (6th Cir.2000); <i>Aycox v. Lytle,</i> 196 F.3d 1174, 1177-78 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p>Since an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact, <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <i>Scarpa v. DuBois,</i> 38 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1994), Teti cannot be granted relief unless the MAC's decision was an \"unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal law,\" <i>Terry Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (mixed questions are reviewed under § 2254(d)(1)'s \"unreasonable application\" clause). A decision can still be reasonable even if the reviewing court thinks it is wrong; \"unreasonable\" here means something more than incorrect or erroneous. <i>Terry Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>Based on the facts as described by the MAC, it was not unreasonable for the MAC to conclude that Keene's representation was not constitutionally deficient. Even assuming that Keene's representation of Lobello and Teti overlapped for some period of time and even assuming that Keene was actively engaged in Teti's trial, Keene had stopped representing Lobello a year before the trial and long before he knew that Lobello was the informant in Teti's case. Further, the MAC found that Keene's representation of Lobello was very limited and would not have related in any way to Teti's case. Based on these facts, there were no competing loyalties and no possible detrimental effect on Teti's representation. To press this claim, then, Teti must challenge the factfinding on which the MAC's conclusion rested. We turn to § 2254(e).</p>\n<p>Our mode of analysis does not suggest, however, that habeas courts should always consider the reasonableness of the state court's determination under § 2254(d) before considering the validity of the state court factfinding under § 2254(e). To suggest a set order of analysis would unnecessarily constrain habeas courts. <i>Accord </i><i>Lambert v. Blackwell,</i> 387 F.3d 210, 236 n. 19 (3d Cir.2004) (acknowledging that different circuits have suggested different orders of analysis and declining to adopt a rigid approach). Others disagree. <i>See</i> 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman, <i>Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure</i> § 20.2c (5th ed.2005) (concluding that courts should apply § 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness review before applying § 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p>B. <i>Deference Under § 2254(e)</i></p>\n<p>Under § 2254(e)(1), \"a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\" The petitioner bears the burden of overcoming that presumption by providing \"clear and convincing evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p>The relationship between § 2254(d)(2) and § 2254(e)(1), both of which apply to state court fact determinations, has caused some confusion. The Supreme Court has suggested that § 2254(e)(1) applies to \"determinations of factual issues, rather than decisions,\" while § 2254(d)(2) \"applies to the granting of habeas relief\" itself. <i>Miller-El</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> <i>v. Cockrell,</i> 537 U.S. 322, 341-42, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). That is, under this approach, § 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness standard would apply to the final decision reached by the state court on a determinative factual question, while § 2254(e)(1)'s presumption of correctness would apply to the individual factfindings, which might underlie the state court's final decision or which might be determinative of new legal issues considered by the habeas court. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blackwell,</i> 387 F.3d at 235 (\"[Section] 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness determination turns on a consideration of the totality of the `evidence presented in the state-court proceeding,' while § 2254(e)(1) contemplates a challenge to the state court's individual factual determinations. . . .\" (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2))); <i>Valdez,</i> 274 F.3d at 951 n. 17; <i>cf. </i><i>Coombs v. State of Maine,</i> 202 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.2000) (suggesting but not explicating this distinction).</p>\n<p>This question has not yet been definitively resolved, nor do we attempt our own resolution here.<sup>[3]</sup> Since <i>Miller-El,</i> the Supreme Court has not further clarified this issue. <i>See </i><i>Rice v. Collins,</i> 546 U.S. 333, 338-39, 126 S.Ct. 969, 163 L.Ed.2d 824 (2006). As the Third Circuit noted in <i>Blackwell,</i> \"[d]espite the Supreme Court's pronouncements in <i>Miller-El</i> and <i>Wiggins</i> [v. <i>Smith,</i> 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003)], a comprehensive interpretation of AEDPA's factual review scheme has yet to emerge from the federal courts. Specifically, the relationship between the standards enunciated in § 2254(d)(2) and § 2254(e)(1) remains unclear.\" 387 F.3d at 235; <i>see also </i><i>Blodgett,</i> 393 F.3d at 971 &amp; n. 19; R. Fallon et al., <i>Hart &amp; Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System</i> 1355 (5th ed.2003); 17B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction</i> § 4265.2 (3d ed.2007).</p>\n<p>For now we follow the Supreme Court's lead in <i>Miller-El</i> and apply § 2254(e)(1) to the MAC's individual factfindings. The decision to do so is not determinative, however, for not only do both provisions \"express the same fundamental principle of deference to state court findings,\" <i>Blackwell,</i> 387 F.3d at 235, but were we to apply § 2254(d)(2), we would also find the MAC's factual conclusions to be not unreasonable in light of the record before it.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Presumption of Correctness Under § 2254(e)(1)</i></p>\n<p>The \"presumption of correctness is equally applicable when a state appellate court, as opposed to a state trial court, makes the finding of fact.\" <i>Norton v. Spencer,</i> 351 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Sumner v. Mata,</i> 455 U.S. 591, 592-93, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Contrary to Teti's arguments, it is for the habeas petitioner to provide the clear and convincing evidence that can overcome that presumption of correctness.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> There is some disagreement about whether the presumption of correctness always applies or if there are instead certain procedural prerequisites. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mayes v. Gibson,</i> 210 F.3d 1284, 1289 (10th Cir.2000) (if there was no \"full, fair, and adequate hearing in the state court,\" the presumption of correctness does not apply); <i>cf. </i><i>Taylor v. Maddox,</i> 366 F.3d 992, 1001 (9th Cir.2004) (\"If . . . a state court makes evidentiary findings without holding a hearing and giving petitioner an opportunity to present evidence, such findings clearly result in an `unreasonable determination' of the facts [under § 2254(d)(2)].\"); 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman § 20.2c (§ 2254(d)(2)'s reasonableness standard applies to both the process and the substance of state court factfindings).</p>\n<p>While the policy arguments underlying these conclusions are reasonable, we must look first to the language of the statute. When Congress revised § 2254 under AEDPA, it removed language that had limited the presumption to determinations made \"after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue,\" as well as the statute's list of procedural defects that previously deprived state court factfinding of the presumption. As Professors Fallon, Meltzer, and Shapiro have noted, these changes suggest that \"the presumption of correctness now applies across the board.\" R. Fallon et al. at 1355; <i>see also </i><i>Valdez,</i> 274 F.3d at 949-51; <i>Mendiola v. Schomig,</i> 224 F.3d 589, 592-93 (7th Cir.2000); 17B Wright et al. § 4265.2 (noting change of statutory language, raising concerns, and predicting that courts might read some of the procedural requirements back into the statute).</p>\n<p>The Third Circuit has taken the position that \"the extent to which a state court provides a `full and fair hearing' is no longer a threshold requirement before deference applies; but it might be a consideration while applying deference under § 2254(d)(2) and § 2254(e)(1).\" <i>Blackwell,</i> 387 F.3d at 239. We agree with this approach. While it might seem questionable to presume the correctness of material facts not derived from a full and fair hearing in state court, the veracity of those facts can be tested through an evidentiary hearing before the district court where appropriate. <i>Cf. </i><i>Valdez,</i> 274 F.3d at 951 n. 17, 952 (evidentiary hearing can aid in federal court's assessment of reasonableness under § 2254(d) when state did not hold a full and fair hearing).</p>\n<p>Teti does not attempt to argue that he has clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption here. Instead he tries to refute the MAC's factual determinations by employing the same documents already considered by the state courts. That approach fails. Describing how different parties stated different versions of events does not constitute the needed showing of clear and convincing evidence; rather, the state trial judge's implicit credibility determinations, adopted by the MAC, are exactly the type of factual determinations to which we defer, at least short of any indication of serious error. <i>Rice,</i> 546 U.S. at 341-42, 126 S.Ct. 969 (\"Reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor's credibility, but on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court's credibility determination.\").</p>\n<p>Teti also argues that the trial judge's conclusion post-trial that there was no relevant conflict of interest contradicts her in-court statements. That argument does not work either. First, the judge's in-court statements were not final determinations and thus not inconsistent with her later ruling. <i>Teti,</i> 801 N.E.2d at 285 n. 11 (\"That the judge, on first impression, believed there was a conflict did not prevent her from considering the issue further, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> then specifically finding, in a reasoned and reflective memorandum . . ., that there was, in fact, no conflict.\"). Second, such a determination by the state trial judge would be a legal  not factual  conclusion and thus not relevant to the § 2254(e)(1) inquiry.</p>\n<p>Because the presumption of correctness applies to all the state court's factfindings, and because Teti does not point us to any clear and convincing evidence that refutes those factfindings, we turn next to whether he should have been allowed discovery or an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Discovery Under Rule 6</i></p>\n<p>Habeas corpus proceedings under § 2254 are civil in nature, but they are governed by a discrete set of procedural rules. <i>Mayle v. Felix,</i> 545 U.S. 644, 654 &amp; 655 n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 2562, 162 L.Ed.2d 582 (2005). Thus unlike in normal civil cases, there is no entitlement to discovery in habeas proceedings; the availability of discovery is instead circumscribed by Rule 6 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases. <i>Bracy v. Gramley,</i> 520 U.S. 899, 904, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997); <i>Bader v. Warden,</i> 488 F.3d 483, 488 (1st Cir. 2007). Under Rule 6, the federal habeas judge has discretion to grant discovery for \"good cause.\" Rule 6(a). The party requesting discovery must not only provide reasons for the discovery, but also must specify \"any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission\" and \"any requested documents.\" Rule 6(b). We review the district court's denial of discovery for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>Bader,</i> 488 F.3d at 488.</p>\n<p>Teti did not comply with the specific requirements of Rule (6)(b); his request for discovery is generalized and does not indicate exactly what information he seeks to obtain. A habeas proceeding is not a fishing expedition. <i>E.g., </i><i>Stanford v. Parker,</i> 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001); <i>Rich v. Calderon,</i> 187 F.3d 1064, 1067 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>In addition, as the district court noted, Teti did not meet the Rule's requirement of \"good cause.\" The Supreme Court has defined \"good cause\" in this context as specific allegations that give a court \"reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is . . . entitled to relief.\" <i>Bracy,</i> 520 U.S. at 908-09, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (quoting <i>Harris v. Nelson,</i> 394 U.S. 286, 300, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court carefully reviewed the documents submitted to it and concluded they did not suggest that discovery would help establish any claim for relief. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying discovery.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Evidentiary Hearings</i></p>\n<p>We also review the decision whether to grant an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <i>Pike,</i> 492 F.3d at 70; <i>see also </i><i>Schriro v. Landrigan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007).</p>\n<p>Before AEDPA, judge-made law governed the decision whether to grant an evidentiary hearing. Under <i>Townsend v. Sain,</i> 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), district courts generally had discretion to grant such hearings when they deemed it appropriate. <i>Id.</i> at 318, 83 S.Ct. 745 (\"In every case [the district judge] has the power, constrained only by his sound discretion, to receive evidence bearing upon the applicant's constitutional claim.\"). In some situations, an evidentiary hearing before the district court was mandatory: \"Where the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> and fair evidentiary hearing in state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 312. <i>Townsend</i> specified six situations which would necessitate a hearing under this standard, including a catch-all category for \"any reason\" the petitioner might not have received a full and fair hearing on the issue before a state court. <i>Id.</i> at 313, 83 S.Ct. 745.</p>\n<p>But <i>Townsend</i> was \"significantly qualified by later case law and congressional action[,] leaving the circuit courts in some uncertainty\" about when new federal factfinding for state prisoners is appropriate.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Bader,</i> 488 F.3d at 487. There is debate post-AEDPA over whether evidentiary hearings are still mandatory in some circumstances, or whether they are simply within the district court judge's discretion when not prohibited. Some courts have concluded that <i>Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,</i> 504 U.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 1715, 118 L.Ed.2d 318 (1992), and AEDPA only modified <i>Townsend</i>'s six categories of mandatory hearings, leaving the rest of <i>Townsend</i> intact. <i>E.g., </i><i>Conaway v. Polk,</i> 453 F.3d 567, 582, 590 (4th Cir.2006); <i>Insyxiengmay v. Morgan,</i> 403 F.3d 657, 670 (9th Cir.2005); <i>Smith v. Bowersox,</i> 311 F.3d 915, 921 (8th Cir.2002); <i>Matheney v. Anderson,</i> 253 F.3d 1025, 1039 (7th Cir.2001); <i>Miller v. Champion,</i> 161 F.3d 1249, 1253 (10th Cir. 1998). And some commentators agree. <i>See</i> 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman § 20.1b (\"Even after AEDPA . . . <i>Townsend</i>'s mandatory-hearing standards . . . continue[] to govern all situations save those in which the petitioner's procedural default accounts for the state courts' failure to develop the material facts.\"); W. LaFave et al., <i>Criminal Procedure</i> § 28.7(c) (2d ed.2004). Indeed, the Advisory Committee Notes for Rule 8 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, regarding evidentiary hearings, suggest that <i>Townsend</i> still applies except to the extent it is specifically superceded by § 2254(e)(2). The Third Circuit, on the other hand, has read AEDPA as rendering all evidentiary hearings purely discretionary. <i>E.g., </i><i>Campbell v. Vaughn,</i> 209 F.3d 280, 287 (3d Cir.2000) (\"AEDPA, unlike <i>Townsend</i> and <i>Keeney,</i> does not require that such a hearing be held. Instead, federal courts have discretion to grant [an evidentiary] hearing or not.\").</p>\n<p>At the least, where not explicitly prohibited by § 2254, federal habeas judges retain discretion to grant evidentiary hearings. <i>See</i> Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, Rule 8(a); <i>Schriro,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1939 (AEDPA did not change the \"basic rule\" that \"the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing [is] generally left to the sound discretion of district courts\"); <i>Guidry v. Dretke,</i> 397 F.3d 306, 323 (5th Cir.2005). But that discretion should be exercised in a restrained manner. As the Supreme Court noted in <i>Schriro,</i> Congress through AEDPA meant to curb delays and prevent retrials before habeas courts. 127 S.Ct. at 1940; <i>see also </i><i>Pike,</i> 492 F.3d at 70. As a result, federal evidentiary hearings seeking to rehear issues addressed by the state courts \"ought to be the exception, not the rule.\" <i>Pike,</i> 492 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p>We need not resolve today the question of whether federal habeas evidentiary hearings are ever mandated. First, AEDPA is clear on one point: an evidentiary hearing is prohibited if \"the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings\" unless <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> certain stringent exceptions apply. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2). It may seem odd to prohibit an evidentiary hearing where the defendant did not present the facts to a state court but not to prohibit one where he did. But the prohibition is analogous to a procedural default rule, furthering the principles of comity, finality, and federalism by requiring the prisoner to present his claims fully before the state courts. <i>Michael Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 420, 436-37, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p>Section 2254(e)(2)'s bar applies where there has been a \"lack of diligence\" on the part of the petitioner or his counsel before the state courts. <i>Id.</i> at 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479. Teti demonstrated such a lack of diligence. \"Diligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner, at a minimum, seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479. Teti's broad claims in his state court motion for a new trial did not raise any specific question sufficient to require the state trial judge to hold an evidentiary hearing. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bowersox,</i> 311 F.3d at 921-22 (petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing barred under § 2254(e)(2) where petitioner had submitted only broad allegations to the state court, in conflict with state's requirement of factual allegations sufficient to warrant relief if true). Further, Teti did not develop his argument for an evidentiary hearing in his appeal to the MAC. <i>Teti,</i> 801 N.E.2d at 289. Section 2254(e)(2) does include narrow exceptions that would excuse a petitioner's lack of diligence, but they clearly do not apply to Teti's situation: there is no new rule of constitutional law, nor any new evidence, much less any evidence that \"could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>Second, even if Teti's request for an evidentiary hearing were not barred by § 2254(e)(2) for lack of diligence, he fails on another threshold matter, just as he did before the state trial court. Akin to Rule 6's \"good cause\" requirement, a habeas judge, before granting an evidentiary hearing, \"must [first] consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition's factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief.\" <i>Schriro,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1940; <i>see also </i><i>Townsend,</i> 372 U.S. at 312, 83 S.Ct. 745.</p>\n<p>The requirement is not so stringent that Teti must point to specific facts he <i>will</i> establish that will entitle him to relief, but rather that his allegations would entitle him to relief and the hearing is likely to elicit the factual support for those allegations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Insyxiengmay,</i> 403 F.3d at 670. As the Fourth Circuit noted in the context of a state collateral review petition, \"it would create a `classic catch-22' if [a habeas] defendant were obliged to submit admissible evidence to the [habeas] court in order to be accorded an evidentiary hearing, when the defendant is seeking the hearing because he cannot, without subpoena power or mechanisms of discovery, otherwise secure such evidence.\" <i>Conaway,</i> 453 F.3d at 584. <i>But see </i><i>Campbell,</i> 209 F.3d at 290 (petitioner needs clear evidence <i>before</i> a habeas court can justify a new evidentiary hearing, at least where the state court also held an evidentiary hearing and there is a sufficient basis in the record for the state court's conclusions). On the other hand, Teti must allege more than that he received inadequate assistance; he must allege facts sufficient to overcome AEDPA deference to the state court's factfindings and legal conclusion to the contrary. <i>See </i><i>Schriro,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1940; <i>Bader,</i> 488 F.3d at 488.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> The district court correctly considered this threshold question, concluding that Teti had not given any \"indication that an evidentiary hearing would give rise to `clear and convincing evidence' that petitioner's trial counsel suffered from a conflict of interest.\" We turn, however, directly to the question of prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\"[A] court need not determine whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant. . . . If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, . . . that course should be followed.\").</p>\n<p>Teti argues that he suffered prejudice because he was unable to obtain a plea agreement. He does not, however, make the argument that his attorneys failed to obtain a plea agreement because of their conflicted loyalties. Nor would such an argument be plausible, given that Keene ceased representing Lobello shortly after, if not before, he began representing Teti. Teti instead argues that McBride was unable to secure a plea agreement for him because the Commonwealth was worried, once the conflict of interest concern was aired, that such an agreement might be vulnerable on appeal. The argument is hard to credit, as one would think a conviction would have been more vulnerable on appeal. Regardless, it is insufficient.</p>\n<p>Teti might be arguing that he was harmed because of procedural irregularities in the hearing before the state trial judge. The relevant harm, however, is the one emanating from Keene's alleged conflict of interest. If a federal evidentiary hearing could cure any procedural irregularities, Teti still has not explained what harm he would hope to demonstrate beyond the alleged plea agreement harm already discussed.</p>\n<p>Teti has not argued sufficient harm to satisfy <i>Mickens,</i> much less the prejudice needed to meet the more stringent standard for establishing ineffective assistance where counsel has a potential, rather than actual, conflict of interest. In short, Teti \"continues to assert he needs [an] evidentiary hearing to factually <i>develop</i> his constitutional claims, but he has failed at every level to make a factual <i>showing</i> (as opposed to conclusory statements) as to why those claims merit development through the crucible of an official hearing.\" <i>Reynolds v. Bagley,</i> 498 F.3d 549, 555 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Because Teti provides no clear and convincing evidence that the MAC's factual determinations were erroneous, and because he has not adequately specified what facts he seeks to establish through discovery or an evidentiary hearing, the MAC's factual determinations stand, as does its ultimate conclusion under § 2254(d)(1) that Keene did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel due to any conflict of interest. <i>See </i><i>Allison,</i> 388 F.3d at 370-71.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Remaining Claims</i></p>\n<p>Teti also claims that McBride shared Keene's conflict of interest and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel for several additional reasons.</p>\n<p>The district court reviewed de novo the claim that McBride had a conflict. It did so on the basis that the MAC did not expressly rule on this issue, although the issue had been presented to it. <i>See </i><i>Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47. We need not address whether this was the correct approach, for whether reviewed de novo or deferentially, Teti's claim fails. If Keene did not have a conflict, there was no derivative conflict in McBride, and like the state court, we see no possible prejudice to Teti.</p>\n<p>We rely on the district court's reasoning on the remaining ineffective assistance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> claims against McBride. The district court correctly applied § 2254(d)(1) to these claims, as they were addressed by the state court. The district court reasoned as follows: Because Teti's main defense was entrapment, McBride's failure to move to sever the two indictments and his allowance of the introduction of evidence on similar but uncharged drug transactions could have been part of a reasonable defense strategy to highlight that the same federal agent initiated all the transactions. Further, a motion to sever would have failed, as joinder was appropriate under state law. Finally, the relevant information about Teti's state of mind was provided when Teti himself testified as to his drug dependency and depression; McBride had promised nothing further in his opening statement. The MAC's conclusion that none of these arguments established ineffective assistance of counsel was therefore not an unreasonable application of federal law under § 2254(d)(1). We agree.</p>\n<p>Teti has been well and inventively represented on appeal. The denial of the petition for habeas relief is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Commissioner James Bender has been substituted for former Commissioner Kathleen Dennehy.</p>\n<p>[2]  Rule 35(b) allows the prosecutor to move for a reduced sentence based on the defendant's \"substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person\" after the defendant was sentenced. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[3]  The Ninth Circuit, for example, draws a slightly different distinction than the one described above. Under that court's approach, § 2254(d)(2) applies when the petitioner argues that the state court drew unreasonable conclusions based on the evidence already in the record; § 2254(e)(1) applies, on the other hand, when the petitioner wishes to bring in new evidence to challenge the facts found by the state court. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blodgett,</i> 393 F.3d at 972, 978; <i>Taylor v. Maddox,</i> 366 F.3d 992, 999-1000 (9th Cir.2004).\n</p>\n<p>Professors Hertz and Liebman would apply the provisions sequentially: under their approach, courts should consider first whether a state court's factfindings are reasonable under § 2254(d)(2), and if they are, only then should the courts apply § 2254(e)(1)'s presumption of correctness. 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman § 20.2c.</p>\n<p>[4]  AEDPA did not change the standard for granting evidentiary hearings under § 2255, which applies to federal petitioners. This suggests that Congress intended \"to create a discrepancy between the (respectively, somewhat narrower and broader) rights to a hearing in section 2254 and section 2255.\" 2 Hertz &amp; Liebman § 41.6d. This discrepancy underscores the principles of comity and federalism embodied in § 2254.</p>\n\n</div>",

Joseph Teti appeals from the denial of his federal petition for habeas corpus relief.<sup>[1]</sup> The primary question in this appeal is whether the federal district court erred in applying the presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) to the state appellate court's findings of facts and in denying discovery and an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>Substantively, Teti argues that the state court erred in denying his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights because, inter alia, his original defense attorney Bradford Keene had an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>We affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief by the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We describe the facts as they appear from the state court record. Teti was convicted in Massachusetts Superior Court in April 1999 on charges stemming from two cocaine trafficking incidents in 1996. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32E(b)(4). As he had provided cocaine to an undercover agent, Teti's primary defense was entrapment. <i>Commonwealth v. Teti,</i> 60 Mass.App.Ct. 279, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>, 282 (2004). He testified that he was an addict and had been pressured by the agent to make the sale. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On the third day of Teti's four-day trial the prosecutor raised an issue of possible conflict: that defense attorney Bradford Keene had also represented a witness hostile to Teti. <i>Id.</i> at 283, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. Teti originally hired attorney Keene in May 1998 but replaced him with attorney John McBride in January 1999. <i>Id.</i> at 282, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. After forwarding his file on Teti to McBride, Keene was no longer involved in the case, although he never formally withdrew his appearance and he sat at the defense counsel table during Teti's trial. <i>Id.</i> at 282-83 &amp; n. 6, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. Sometime around April 1998, a year before Teti's trial, Keene had represented a man named Leo Lobello in some limited matters. Lobello, a convicted federal felon, was the informant who had introduced Teti to the undercover agent who bought the cocaine from Teti. <i>Id.</i> at 282, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. Keene insisted, however, that he did not know Lobello was the informant in Teti's case until a week before Teti's trial. <i>Id.</i> at 285, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>.</p>\n<p>McBride, who did know as early as February 1999 that Lobello was the informant, had called Lobello as a hostile witness in the vain hopes that Lobello would bolster the entrapment defense by demonstrating that Teti was not predisposed to sell cocaine and by appearing himself to be \"the instigator of the drug transactions, as well as a reprobate and liar, testifying to curry favor with the Federal authorities,\" <i>id.</i> at 282, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing the prosecutor's concern about a potential conflict, the court immediately questioned both Keene and McBride. That questioning, which has been the only hearing on this issue, underlies the description of the facts by the Massachusetts Appeals Court (\"MAC\") discussed below. Initially, the state trial judge stated her impression that Keene had a conflict of interest; she required him to withdraw, but allowed the trial to continue. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> The jury convicted Teti, and he was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Two and a half years later, Teti moved for a new trial and, on denial of the new trial motion, moved for reconsideration. That motion was also denied. The same state judge who tried the case, in denying the motion for a new trial, concluded that contrary to her initial impression, there was no actual conflict of interest and no showing that any prejudice had resulted, even if there had been a conflict. Because Massachusetts law largely leaves the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing on a new trial motion to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and because Teti had not presented any substantial question of fact warranting an evidentiary hearing, the state judge declined to grant one. <i>See</i> Mass. R.Crim. P. 30(c)(3); <i>Commonwealth v. Stewart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175642/commonwealth-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175642/commonwealth-v-stewart/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>, 1222-23 (1981).</p>\n<p>The MAC in 2004 affirmed the conviction as well as the denial of Teti's motion for a new trial. The MAC rejected Teti's claims that Keene had an actual conflict of interest in violation of Teti's federal and state constitutional rights, <i>Teti,</i> 801 N.E.2d at 284; that Keene's actions had caused Teti any prejudice, making it irrelevant whether Keene had a potential conflict of interest, <i>id.</i> at 286, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>; and that Teti had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions for other reasons, <i>id.</i> at 286-89, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>.</p>\n<p>The MAC made certain key findings of fact, which the federal habeas court later presumed were correct: (1) that, contrary to what the prosecutor had initially believed, Keene had not represented Lobello in seeking a Rule 35(b) motion in federal court to reduce Lobello's federal sentence, <i>id.</i> at 283, 285 n. 10, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>;<sup>[2]</sup> (2) that Keene's representation of Lobello was fully in the past and was limited to a few, unanswered phone calls to a South Carolina prison facility approximately one year before Teti's trial in an effort to have Lobello transferred to another facility, and that Keene had never spoken to or met Lobello, <i>id.</i> at 284-85, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>; (3) that Keene was not aware that Lobello was the informant in Teti's case until one week before trial  \"a point by which [Keene's] activities on Lobello's behalf had long since ended,\" <i>id.</i> at 285, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>; (4) that Keene did not participate in the preparation of Teti's case and that his \"involvement with the trial was essentially nonexistent,\" <i>id.</i> at 286, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>; and (5) that McBride learned of Keene's representation of Lobello only on the third day of Teti's trial, <i>id.</i> at 287, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. Based on these factual determinations, the MAC concluded that Teti failed to establish the existence of an actual conflict of interest. <i>Id.</i> at 285, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>.</p>\n<p>The MAC then considered whether apart from an actual conflict, Teti's counsel had a potential or, as state law phrases it, a \"tenuous\" conflict. It determined that, whether or not there had been a conflict, there was no prejudice in any event. <i>Id.</i> at 286, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. As the MAC sensibly reasoned, Keene's participation in the trial preparation and the trial itself was de minimis. Further, any privileged information that Keene did have would not have harmed Teti, as \"[i]t would have been to the defendant's benefit for McBride to know more about Lobello, a hostile witness.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Teti had also presented to the MAC a claim of ineffective assistance by McBride, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> based on several alleged deficiencies. Teti argued that McBride was ineffective in failing to investigate Keene's potential conflicts and to tell Teti about Keene's prior representation of Lobello, but the MAC held there was no ineffectiveness and no prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 287, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>. The MAC also noted that when the trial judge had questioned Teti about Keene's alleged conflict, Teti said he was \"quite satisfied\" with McBride's representation. <i>Id.</i> The MAC, accordingly, rejected Teti's assertion that had he been informed more fully of the conflict, he would have insisted on new counsel. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Teti also argued that McBride was ineffective for failing to move to sever the indictments against him; for introducing evidence of additional, uncharged drug transactions; and for promising in his opening statement but then not providing testimony about the effects of Teti's psychological and drug dependency problems on his state of mind. The MAC concluded that none of these actions constituted ineffective assistance. <i>See id.</i> at 286-89, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></span>.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court denied further appellate review. <i>Commonwealth v.

The court applied the statutory presumption of correctness to the state court's factual determinations and viewed the claims actually ruled upon by the MAC through the deferential lens of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), (e)(1).</p>\n<p>The district court held that the state court holdings  that there was neither an actual conflict nor any prejudice  were not an unreasonable application of federal law under AEDPA. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). Under federal law, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires demonstrating \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Strickland v.

If, however, a defendant can show that his attorney \"actively represented conflicting interests\" in breach of the attorney's duty of loyalty, and if the defendant can show that this \"actual\" conflict of interest \"adversely affected [the] lawyer's performance,\" then the stricter prejudice showing required by <i>Strickland</i> does not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 692, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Lesser (\"potential\") conflicts of interest can also be the basis of an ineffective assistance claim, but the more stringent prejudice prong of <i>Strickland</i> then applies.</p>\n<p>Although the MAC had relied on state law in concluding there was no actual conflict, the district court noted that state law is more favorable than federal law to the defendant on this issue because under state law, if there were an actual conflict of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> interest, that conflict would result in automatic reversal regardless of whether any prejudice could be shown. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v.

Hall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199681\"><a href=\"/opinion/199681/dibenedetto-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6-7 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Fortini v.

Again utilizing the presumption that the state court's factual findings were correct, the district court concluded that attorney McBride had no conflict and that Teti could not establish any prejudice that would have resulted even if a conflict had existed. Finally, the court found no basis for habeas relief in the state court's rejection of the remaining ineffective assistance claims.</p>\n<p>The federal habeas court denied a later motion to amend or to alter its findings. It granted a certificate of appealability sua sponte regarding issues related to the effectiveness of Teti's counsel.</p>\n<p>In addressing these issues, we recite only so much of the case and underlying facts as needed for analysis of the denial of federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo; further, \"[w]hen the district court undertakes no independent factfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same position as the district court vis-à-vis the state court record,\" so we review the district court's factual conclusions de novo as well. <i>Pike v.

When a petitioner presses a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal habeas courts must defer to the state court determination unless it:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).</p>\n<p>Section 2254(d) applies to Teti's claim that Keene provided ineffective assistance of counsel due to an actual or potential conflict of interest because the MAC adjudicated that claim on the merits. A matter is \"adjudicated on the merits\" if there is a \"decision finally resolving the parties' claims, with res judicata effect, that is based on the substance of the claim advanced, rather than on a procedural, or other, ground.\" <i>Sellan v.

Even assuming that Keene's representation of Lobello and Teti overlapped for some period of time and even assuming that Keene was actively engaged in Teti's trial, Keene had stopped representing Lobello a year before the trial and long before he knew that Lobello was the informant in Teti's case. Further, the MAC found that Keene's representation of Lobello was very limited and would not have related in any way to Teti's case. Based on these facts, there were no competing loyalties and no possible detrimental effect on Teti's representation. To press this claim, then, Teti must challenge the factfinding on which the MAC's conclusion rested. We turn to § 2254(e).</p>\n<p>Our mode of analysis does not suggest, however, that habeas courts should always consider the reasonableness of the state court's determination under § 2254(d) before considering the validity of the state court factfinding under § 2254(e).

When Congress revised § 2254 under AEDPA, it removed language that had limited the presumption to determinations made \"after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue,\" as well as the statute's list of procedural defects that previously deprived state court factfinding of the presumption.

We agree with this approach. While it might seem questionable to presume the correctness of material facts not derived from a full and fair hearing in state court, the veracity of those facts can be tested through an evidentiary hearing before the district court where appropriate. <i>Cf. </i><i>Valdez,</i> 274 F.3d at 951 n. 17, 952 (evidentiary hearing can aid in federal court's assessment of reasonableness under § 2254(d) when state did not hold a full and fair hearing).</p>\n<p>Teti does not attempt to argue that he has clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption here. Instead he tries to refute the MAC's factual determinations by employing the same documents already considered by the state courts. That approach fails. Describing how different parties stated different versions of events does not constitute the needed showing of clear and convincing evidence; rather, the state trial judge's implicit credibility determinations, adopted by the MAC, are exactly the type of factual determinations to which we defer, at least short of any indication of serious error. <i>Rice,</i> 546 U.S. at 341-42, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145690\"><a href=\"/opinion/145690/rice-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That argument does not work either. First, the judge's in-court statements were not final determinations and thus not inconsistent with her later ruling. <i>Teti,</i> 801 N.E.2d at 285 n. 11 (\"That the judge, on first impression, believed there was a conflict did not prevent her from considering the issue further, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> then specifically finding, in a reasoned and reflective memorandum . . ., that there was, in fact, no conflict.\"). Second, such a determination by the state trial judge would be a legal  not factual  conclusion and thus not relevant to the § 2254(e)(1) inquiry.</p>\n<p>Because the presumption of correctness applies to all the state court's factfindings, and because Teti does not point us to any clear and convincing evidence that refutes those factfindings, we turn next to whether he should have been allowed discovery or an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Discovery Under Rule 6</i></p>\n<p>Habeas corpus proceedings under § 2254 are civil in nature, but they are governed by a discrete set of procedural rules. <i>Mayle v.

Indeed, the Advisory Committee Notes for Rule 8 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, regarding evidentiary hearings, suggest that <i>Townsend</i> still applies except to the extent it is specifically superceded by § 2254(e)(2). The Third Circuit, on the other hand, has read AEDPA as rendering all evidentiary hearings purely discretionary. <i>E.g., </i><i>Campbell v. Vaughn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768324\"><a href=\"/opinion/768324/dean-nathan-campbell-v-donald-t-vaughn-the-district-attorney-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 287 (3d Cir.2000) (\"AEDPA, unlike <i>Townsend</i> and <i>Keeney,</i> does not require that such a hearing be held. Instead, federal courts have discretion to grant [an evidentiary] hearing or not.\").</p>\n<p>At the least, where not explicitly prohibited by § 2254, federal habeas judges retain discretion to grant evidentiary hearings. <i>See</i> Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, Rule 8(a); <i>Schriro,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1939 (AEDPA did not change the \"basic rule\" that \"the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing [is] generally left to the sound discretion of district courts\"); <i>Guidry v. Dretke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span>, 323 (5th Cir.2005). But that discretion should be exercised in a restrained manner. As the Supreme Court noted in <i>Schriro,</i> Congress through AEDPA meant to curb delays and prevent retrials before habeas courts. 127 S.Ct. at 1940; <i>see also </i><i>Pike,</i> 492 F.3d at 70. As a result, federal evidentiary hearings seeking to rehear issues addressed by the state courts \"ought to be the exception, not the rule.\" <i>Pike,</i> 492 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p>We need not resolve today the question of whether federal habeas evidentiary hearings are ever mandated. First, AEDPA is clear on one point: an evidentiary hearing is prohibited if \"the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings\" unless <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> certain stringent exceptions apply. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2). It may seem odd to prohibit an evidentiary hearing where the defendant did not present the facts to a state court but not to prohibit one where he did. But the prohibition is analogous to a procedural default rule, furthering the principles of comity, finality, and federalism by requiring the prisoner to present his claims fully before the state courts. <i>Michael Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 436-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000).</p>\n<p>Section 2254(e)(2)'s bar applies where there has been a \"lack of diligence\" on the part of the petitioner or his counsel before the state courts. <i>Id.</i> at 432, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span>. Teti demonstrated such a lack of diligence. \"Diligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner, at a minimum, seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 437, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1479</span></a></span>. Teti's broad claims in his state court motion for a new trial did not raise any specific question sufficient to require the state trial judge to hold an evidentiary hearing. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bowersox,</i> 311 F.3d at 921-22 (petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing barred under § 2254(e)(2) where petitioner had submitted only broad allegations to the state court, in conflict with state's requirement of factual allegations sufficient to warrant relief if true). Further, Teti did not develop his argument for an evidentiary hearing in his appeal to the MAC. <i>Teti,</i> 801 N.E.2d at 289. Section 2254(e)(2) does include narrow exceptions that would excuse a petitioner's lack of diligence, but they clearly do not apply to Teti's situation: there is no new rule of constitutional law, nor any new evidence, much less any evidence that \"could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p>Second, even if Teti's request for an evidentiary hearing were not barred by § 2254(e)(2) for lack of diligence, he fails on another threshold matter, just as he did before the state trial court. Akin to Rule 6's \"good cause\" requirement, a habeas judge, before granting an evidentiary hearing, \"must [first] consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition's factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief.\" <i>Schriro,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1940; <i>see also </i><i>Townsend,</i> 372 U.S. at 312, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106544\"><a href=\"/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The requirement is not so stringent that Teti must point to specific facts he <i>will</i> establish that will entitle him to relief, but rather that his allegations would entitle him to relief and the hearing is likely to elicit the factual support for those allegations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Insyxiengmay,</i> 403 F.3d at 670. As the Fourth Circuit noted in the context of a state collateral review petition, \"it would create a `classic catch-22' if [a habeas] defendant were obliged to submit admissible evidence to the [habeas] court in order to be accorded an evidentiary hearing, when the defendant is seeking the hearing because he cannot, without subpoena power or mechanisms of discovery, otherwise secure such evidence.\" <i>Conaway,</i> 453 F.3d at 584. <i>But see </i><i>Campbell,</i> 209 F.3d at 290 (petitioner needs clear evidence <i>before</i> a habeas court can justify a new evidentiary hearing, at least where the state court also held an evidentiary hearing and there is a sufficient basis in the record for the state court's conclusions). On the other hand, Teti must allege more than that he received inadequate assistance; he must allege facts sufficient to overcome AEDPA deference to the state court's factfindings and legal conclusion to the contrary. <i>See </i><i>Schriro,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1940; <i>Bader,</i> 488 F.3d at 488.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> The district court correctly considered this threshold question, concluding that Teti had not given any \"indication that an evidentiary hearing would give rise to `clear and convincing evidence' that petitioner's trial counsel suffered from a conflict of interest.\" We turn, however, directly to the question of prejudice. <i>See </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 697, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span> (\"[A] court need not determine whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant. . . . If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, . . . that course should be followed.\").</p>\n<p>Teti argues that he suffered prejudice because he was unable to obtain a plea agreement. He does not, however, make the argument that his attorneys failed to obtain a plea agreement because of their conflicted loyalties. Nor would such an argument be plausible, given that Keene ceased representing Lobello shortly after, if not before, he began representing Teti. Teti instead argues that McBride was unable to secure a plea agreement for him because the Commonwealth was worried, once the conflict of interest concern was aired, that such an agreement might be vulnerable on appeal. The argument is hard to credit, as one would think a conviction would have been more vulnerable on appeal. Regardless, it is insufficient.</p>\n<p>Teti might be arguing that he was harmed because of procedural irregularities in the hearing before the state trial judge. The relevant harm, however, is the one emanating from Keene's alleged conflict of interest. If a federal evidentiary hearing could cure any procedural irregularities, Teti still has not explained what harm he would hope to demonstrate beyond the alleged plea agreement harm already discussed.</p>\n<p>Teti has not argued sufficient harm to satisfy <i>Mickens,</i> much less the prejudice needed to meet the more stringent standard for establishing ineffective assistance where counsel has a potential, rather than actual, conflict of interest. In short, Teti \"continues to assert he needs [an] evidentiary hearing to factually <i>develop</i> his constitutional claims, but he has failed at every level to make a factual <i>showing</i> (as opposed to conclusory statements) as to why those claims merit development through the crucible of an official hearing.\" <i>Reynolds v. Bagley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1287879\"><a href=\"/opinion/1287879/reynolds-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 555 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Because Teti provides no clear and convincing evidence that the MAC's factual determinations were erroneous, and because he has not adequately specified what facts he seeks to establish through discovery or an evidentiary hearing, the MAC's factual determinations stand, as does its ultimate conclusion under § 2254(d)(1) that Keene did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel due to any conflict of interest. <i>See </i><i>Allison,</i> 388 F.3d at 370-71.</p>\n<p>C. <i>Remaining Claims</i></p>\n<p>Teti also claims that McBride shared Keene's conflict of interest and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel for several additional reasons.</p>\n<p>The district court reviewed de novo the claim that McBride had a conflict. It did so on the basis that the MAC did not expressly rule on this issue, although the issue had been presented to it. <i>See </i><i>Fortini,</i> 257 F.3d at 47. We need not address whether this was the correct approach, for whether reviewed de novo or deferentially, Teti's claim fails. If Keene did not have a conflict, there was no derivative conflict in McBride, and like the state court, we see no possible prejudice to Teti.</p>\n<p>We rely on the district court's reasoning on the remaining ineffective assistance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> claims against McBride. The district court correctly applied § 2254(d)(1) to these claims, as they were addressed by the state court. The district court reasoned as follows: Because Teti's main defense was entrapment, McBride's failure to move to sever the two indictments and his allowance of the introduction of evidence on similar but uncharged drug transactions could have been part of a reasonable defense strategy to highlight that the same federal agent initiated all the transactions. Further, a motion to sever would have failed, as joinder was appropriate under state law. Finally, the relevant information about Teti's state of mind was provided when Teti himself testified as to his drug dependency and depression; McBride had promised nothing further in his opening statement. The MAC's conclusion that none of these arguments established ineffective assistance of counsel was therefore not an unreasonable application of federal law under § 2254(d)(1). We agree.</p>\n<p>Teti has been well and inventively represented on appeal. The denial of the petition for habeas relief is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Commissioner James Bender has been substituted for former Commissioner Kathleen Dennehy.</p>\n<p>[2]  Rule 35(b) allows the prosecutor to move for a reduced sentence based on the defendant's \"substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person\" after the defendant was sentenced. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[3]  The Ninth Circuit, for example, draws a slightly different distinction than the one described above. Under that court's approach, § 2254(d)(2) applies when the petitioner argues that the state court drew unreasonable conclusions based on the evidence already in the record; § 2254(e)(1) applies, on the other hand, when the petitioner wishes to bring in new evidence to challenge the facts found by the state court. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Blodgett,</i> 393 F.3d at 972, 978; <i>Taylor v. Maddox,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786028\"><a href=\"/opinion/786028/leif-taylor-v-thomas-m-maddox-interim-director-george-galaza-cal-terhune/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 999-1000 (9th Cir.2004).\n</p>\n<p>Professors Hertz and Liebman would apply the provisions sequentially: under their approach, courts should consider first whether a state court's factfindings are reasonable under § 2254(d)(2), and if they are, only then should the courts apply § 2254(e)(1)'s presumption of correctness. 1 Hertz &amp; Liebman § 20.2c.</p>\n<p>[4]  AEDPA did not change the standard for granting evidentiary hearings under § 2255, which applies to federal petitioners. This suggests that Congress intended \"to create a discrepancy between the (respectively, somewhat narrower and broader) rights to a hearing in section 2254 and section 2255.\" 2 Hertz &amp; Liebman § 41.6d. This discrepancy underscores the principles of comity and federalism embodied in § 2254.</p>\n\n</div>",
