Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Linda J. Thompson, with whom John M. Thompson and Thompson &\nThompson, P.C. was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          November 3, 2003\n\f               BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        Under the amended Armed Career\n\nCriminal Act (\"the Act\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (2000), a 15-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence is required for anyone convicted as a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm who has three or more prior\n\nconvictions for a \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug offense.\" This\n\nappeal by the government concerns the proper application of these\n\nlabels    to     Reginald    Shepard's    prior    guilty   pleas   under   state\n\nburglary statutes.          The issue is a recurring one.\n\n               On March 3, 1999, Shepard pled guilty to a charge of\n\nviolating the federal statute prohibiting a felon from possessing\n\na firearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2000).              Shepard had in fact sold\n\na Glock 17, 9 mm pistol and ammunition to an undercover federal\n\nagent at South Station in Boston.                 Shepard already had on his\n\nrecord dozens of prior state convictions, including eleven for\n\nbreaking and entering.           The government sought to have Shepard\n\nsentenced as an armed career criminal, arguing that at least five\n\nof these breaking and entering convictions were violent felonies\n\nunder the Act.\n\n               Under the Act, the phrase \"violent felony\" is not limited\n\nto crimes in which violence actually occurs; instead, the phrase is\n\ndefined to include inter alia \"any crime punishable by imprisonment\n\nfor   a   term    exceeding    one   year\"     that   \"is   burglary,   arson   or\n\nextortion . . . or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"                  18 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).           In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575\n\n(1990), the Supreme Court held that Congress intended \"burglary\" to\n\nmean       any    crime   under   state   law,   however   denominated,   that\n\nincorporated the elements of what the Court described as \"generic\n\nburglary\"--unlawful entry into \"a building or other structure, with\n\nintent to commit a crime.\"           Id. at 598-99.\n\n                 At Shepard's initial sentencing, the five convictions at\n\nissue were under one or the other of two Massachusetts statutes\n\nthat forbid breaking and entering a \"building,\" \"ship,\" \"vessel\" or\n\n\"vehicle\" with intent to commit a felony.1             In each of the state\n\ncases, the complaint merely charged Shepard in the boilerplate\n\nlanguage of the statutes, leaving it unclear just what kind of\n\nstructure Shepard had entered.            Thus, the complaints alone did not\n\nreveal whether Shepard had broken into a building or some lesser\n\nenclosure such as a car or boat.\n\n                 The \"complaint\" under Massachusetts procedure is the\n\nfinal step in the charging process, roughly equivalent to a federal\n\ninformation.         1 Massachusetts Criminal Practice § 4.1-4.2 (1998).\n\nIssued by a magistrate, the complaint is based on a complaint\n\napplication normally filed by a police officer and likely to\n\n\n       1\n      One of the statutes says \"motor vehicle\" instead of \"vehicle\"\nbut otherwise they are similar; the difference between them is that\none statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 16 (2000), is directed to\nbreaking and entering by night and carries a 20 year maximum, while\nthe other, ch. 266, § 18, has only a 10 year maximum and embraces\nbreaking and entering during the day as well as non-forcible entry\ninto a dwelling at night.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fincorporate or be accompanied by a police report.          Id.     The\n\napplication is customarily sworn and is automatically given to\n\ndefendants at their arraignments.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, § 22\n\n(2000); Super. Ct. Standing Order 2-86; 1 Massachusetts Criminal\n\nPractice § 4.2, 16.5(C).   Courts in Massachusetts can presume that\n\ndefendants know the information contained in police reports.       See\n\nCommonwealth v. Brown, 748 N.E.2d 972, 981 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001).\n\n          Forewarned by an earlier decision of this court, United\n\nStates v. Dueno, 171 F.3d 3 (1st Cir. 1999), the government secured\n\nthe state court files from Shepard's earlier convictions, presented\n\ncertified copies, and argued that the complaint applications and\n\npolice reports contained in the state court files showed that\n\nShepard's prior convictions were for entries into buildings and so\n\nconstituted   generic   burglaries    under   Taylor.   Taking   these\n\ndocuments at face value, they showed (with varying degrees of\n\nelaboration) the following as to the charges that had led to\n\nShepard's guilty pleas:\n\n\n          May 1989. Break in at 30 Harlem St. in Boston;\n          defendant discovered by an inhabitant in the\n          pantry.\n\n          March 1991.    Entry into 550 Arsenal St in\n          Watertown; defendant in back room of store.\n\n          July 1991.   Entry into 258 Norwell St. in\n          Boston; defendant found in hallway with\n          property taken from a broken-into apartment.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f            February 1994.     Attempted entry into 145\n            Gallivan Blvd; defendant found with arms\n            through broken glass window.2\n\n            The district court ruled that the complaint applications\n\nand police reports could not be considered and declined to sentence\n\nShepard under the Act, imposing instead a sentence of 46 months\n\n(which included a two-level upward departure).          United States v.\n\nShepard, 125 F. Supp. 2d 562, 572 (D. Mass. 2000) (\"Shepard I\").\n\nOn the government's appeal, this court reversed, ruling that there\n\nwas no \"absolute bar\" to consideration of police reports and\n\ncomplaint applications; the question, said the panel, was whether,\n\nin   the   contemporaneous   understanding   of   the    state   and   the\n\ndefendant, Shepard had pled guilty in the breaking and entering\n\ncases to entry of a building (rather than, say, a motor vehicle).\n\nUnited States v. Shepard, 231 F.3d 56, 67 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Shepard\n\nII\"), cert. denied 534 U.S. 829 (2001).\n\n            On remand, the government filed additional complaint\n\napplications or police reports from state court files evidencing\n\ntwo additional convictions.      According to these documents, one\n\nconviction was for a February 1981 break in to the Jamaica Plain\n\n\n\n      2\n      At the first sentencing hearing the government argued that\nShepard's conviction for an April 1989 break in to Crispus Attucks\nChildren's Center building should also be counted as generic\nburglary. Since the government did not provide the police reports\nor complaint applications for this conviction, only the PSR, it\nsimplifies our analysis if we ignore this conviction for the\npresent case.\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fHigh School gymnasium and the theft of property; the other was an\n\nattempted break in at 446 Shawmut Avenue where Shepard was found on\n\nthe fire escape next to a window that had been pried open with a\n\nknife.\n\n          Shepard submitted an affidavit saying essentially the\n\nsame thing as to all of the alleged predicate charges:\n\n          I am sure that, at the time of [the state court plea\n          hearing], the judge did not read this Incident\n          report to me and did not ask me whether or not the\n          information contained in the incident report was\n          true. I did not admit the truth of the information\n          contained in the Incident report as part of my plea\n          and I have never admitted in court that the facts\n          alleged in the reports are true.\n\n          After these submissions, the district court imposed the\n\nsame sentence as before.   United States v. Shepard, 181 F. Supp. 2d\n\n14, 18 (D. Mass. 2002) (\"Shepard III\").       The court emphasized\n\nShepard's affidavit denials that he had ever admitted in court the\n\nunderlying facts of the crimes and concluded that \"the police\n\nreports did not provide reliable evidence on the central question,\n\nwhat did the defendant plead to in the state court?\"     Id. at 17,\n\n19-20.   The government again appeals, arguing that complaint\n\napplications and police reports establish that Shepard pled guilty\n\nto breaking into buildings.\n\n          There is surely an air of make-believe about this case.\n\nNo one, and this includes Shepard and the district court, has\n\nseriously disputed that Shepard in fact broke into half a dozen or\n\nmore buildings and was consequently convicted upon pleas of guilty\n\n                                -6-\n\funder the two Massachusetts statutes in question.         Further, his\n\nstring of convictions--which the district court described as \"an\n\n18-year crime spree,\" Shepard I, 125 F. Supp. 2d at 565--shows that\n\nhe is just the kind of burglar whom Congress had in mind in\n\nadopting the tough 15 year minimum sentence for armed career\n\ncriminals.      Taylor recounts in numbing detail the legislative\n\nhistory showing Congress' aim to apply the Act to repeat burglars\n\nlater convicted of a gun crime.     Taylor, 495 U.S. at 581-90.\n\n             Congress' rationale was that a large percentage of all\n\ncrimes are committed by repeat offenders; that many of these crimes\n\nhave at least a potential for violence (e.g., the burglar who\n\nencounters a resident in the house being burgled); that after a\n\nseries of these crimes, the defendant is fairly described as a\n\nrepeat offender; and that when a repeat offender then also commits\n\na federal gun crime, it is time for that felon to serve a long\n\nprescribed minimum sentence. Taylor, 495 U.S. at 581-88. Whatever\n\nthe force of the theory, there is no doubt that Congress intended\n\nthat it be implemented.\n\n             Yet Taylor, while construing the term \"burglary\" broadly\n\n(based on common usage rather than common law), narrowed the Act\n\ndramatically in another respect.        Partly for practical reasons of\n\nadministration, Taylor forbade a de novo inquiry by the sentencing\n\ncourt into what conduct the defendant actually engaged in incident\n\nto the predicate offense, and focused instead on whether the crime\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fof conviction was necessarily a generic burglary (or some other\n\ncrime of violence). Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599-602. Admittedly, this\n\nsimplifies administration if the state statute describes generic\n\nburglary and nothing else.\n\n          The problem--which Taylor recognized and addressed--is\n\nthat state burglary statutes are often drafted to embrace both\n\nconduct that does constitute generic burglary and conduct that does\n\nnot (e.g., building versus vehicle3).   Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599-602.\n\nTaylor makes clear that where (as here) the statute embraces two\n\ndifferent crimes or categories of criminal conduct, the defendant\n\nwill be deemed guilty of a violent felony if one of the two\n\ncorresponds to generic burglary and that is the crime of conviction\n\nin the particular case.   Id. at 602.\n\n          But how can one tell whether generic burglary was the\n\ncrime of conviction if one does not look at what actually happened\n\nat the scene of the crime?   Taylor said that the sentencing court\n\ncan still look at the charging papers and jury instructions, which\n\n\n\n     3\n      Breaking and entering a vehicle is not generic burglary under\nTaylor's definition. 495 U.S. at 598-99. Our circuit has never\nsquarely decided whether burglary of vehicles or boats might still\nbe grounds for enhancement under the Act because they \"involve[]\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\nto another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), although prior dicta\nhave suggested that they do not qualify as violent felonies, see,\ne.g., Shepard II, 231 F.3d at 59. Since the parties do not dispute\nthis point, we assume it for present purposes, reserving always the\npeculiar problems posed by houseboats and camper vans, see United\nStates v. Peterson, 233 F.3d 101, 110 (1st Cir. 2000); United\nStates v. Sweeten, 933 F.2d 765, 770-72 (9th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                -8-\n\ftogether may well identify the crime of conviction.     Taylor, 495\n\nU.S. at 602.    The Court did not explicitly rule out attention to\n\nother court-related documents or say just how guilty pleas should\n\nbe parsed.    Until the Supreme Court addresses the open issues, we\n\nmust use our own reasoning, keeping faith with our own prior\n\nprecedents.\n\n          Let us start with basics.      Under Taylor, a burglary\n\nconviction by a jury would count as a crime of violence under the\n\nAct if the indictment and instructions made clear that the burglary\n\nwas of a house.    Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602.   The same would be true\n\nif instead the defendant pled guilty to such indictment naming a\n\nhouse as the burgled location.4    It would also be true, as this\n\ncourt held in United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234 (1st Cir.\n\n1992), even if the indictment were silent as to the venue so long\n\nas the case files showed that the plea was to burglary of a house.\n\nId. at 1236-37; accord United States v. Coleman, 158 F.3d 199, 202-\n\n03 (4th Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n     4\n      All twelve circuits that have addressed the issue have agreed\nthat Taylor analysis applies after a guilty plea, even though\nTaylor only explicitly explained how to resolve ambiguity when the\nprior convictions were obtained after jury trials.      See United\nStates v. Adams, 91 F.3d 114, 116 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied\n519 U.S. 1047 (1996) (collecting and joining decisions from the\n1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Circuits); United States v.\nHernandez, 218 F.3d 272, 278 (3rd Cir. 2000); United States v.\nHill, 131 F.3d 1056, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (applying parallel\nU.S.S.G. career criminal provision); United States v. Palmer, 68\nF.3d 52, 59 (2nd Cir. 1995); United States v. Cook, 26 F.3d 507,\n509 & n.5 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                 -9-\n\f           In Harris, Judge (now Justice) Breyer discussed the exact\n\nsituation before us: a defendant who has pled guilty to violating\n\na broadly worded statute that included both situations that would\n\nand   situations   that   would   arguably   not   be   violent    felonies.\n\nHarris, 964 F.2d at 1236-37.        As with Shepard's complaint, the\n\nindictment in Harris repeated the statutory boilerplate, leaving it\n\nunclear what category of offense was at issue.            Id.     The Harris\n\ncourt explained:\n\n           In such a case, we believe it would be\n           appropriate for the sentencing court to look\n           to the conduct in respect to which the\n           defendant was charged and pled guilty, not\n           because the court may properly be interested\n           (in   this   context)   in  the   violent   or\n           non-violent nature of that particular conduct,\n           but because that conduct may indicate that the\n           defendant and the government both believed\n           that    the    generically    violent    crime\n           (\"building\"), rather than the generically\n           non-violent crime (\"vehicle\") was at issue.\n\nId. at 1236.\n\n           Judge Breyer then described the presentence report's\n\nsummary of the case files from Harris's state convictions; these\n\nfiles (just like the complaint applications and police reports in\n\nShepard's case) made clear that the crimes were violent felonies--\n\nin Harris, that the defendant had twice physically assaulted the\n\nvictim.   Harris, 964 F.2d at 1236-37.       On this basis alone, this\n\ncourt concluded that Harris's prior convictions were properly\n\ntreated as violent felonies and (together with a third crime of\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fviolence) justified the 15 year minimum sentence prescribed by the\n\nAct.   Id. at 1237.\n\n            In United States v. Dueno, 171 F.3d 3 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nthis court arguably limited Harris in one respect.        In Dueno, the\n\ngovernment sought to characterize the predicate guilty pleas based\n\nnot on the original police reports in the state court case files\n\nbut rather upon the federal presentence report's description of the\n\nunderlying criminal conduct.    Id. at 6-7.    This had also been true\n\nin Harris but there no one had contested the reliance on the PSR.\n\nIn Dueno, the court--though describing the issue as a close one--\n\ndeclined to allow the PSR alone to resolve the issue.        Id. at 7.\n\n            The Dueno court endorsed Harris's general approach--as it\n\nhad to do absent en banc review, see Irving v. United States, 162\n\nF.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc), cert. denied 528 U.S. 812\n\n(1999)--but it noted that not a single document from the original\n\nstate court case files had been submitted for consideration, nor\n\nwas there any other \"account of what took place at Dueno's plea\n\nhearing.\"    Dueno, 171 F.3d at 7.      Absent any indication that the\n\nPSR accurately repeated the information from the original state\n\ncourt documents, the Dueno court rejected reliance on the PSR's\n\ndescription of the criminal conduct to rescue an enhanced sentence\n\nwhose primary ground was admittedly in error.       Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f           Our   en   banc   court   sought   to   clarify   our   stance   on\n\npresentence reports in a published order released shortly after\n\nDueno.5   We explained:\n\n            Our cases have approved resort to pre-sentence\n            reports but only to determine the character of the\n            criminal offense for which the defendant was\n            convicted (not whether violence was or was not used\n            on the particular occasion) [citing Harris], where\n            that determination cannot be made from the\n            statutory language itself or from the charging\n            documents,   and   only   where  the   report   was\n            sufficiently reliable on this issue [citing Dueno].\n\nUnited States v. Sacko, 178 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1999) (en banc\n\norder, June 16, 1999).       While this order does not spell out what\n\nmakes a PSR \"reliable,\" and other circuits are split on this issue,\n\ncompare United States v. Adams, 91 F.3d 114, 116 (11th Cir. 1996)\n\n(relying on PSR), with United States v. Potter, 895 F.2d 1231, 1238\n\n(9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied 497 U.S. 1008 (1990) (generally\n\nrejecting PSR), it does make clear two things:          first, presentence\n\nreports can be used in some situations; second, Harris remains\n\nsolid precedent in this circuit even after Dueno.\n\n           In Shepard's case the reliability of PSR descriptions is\n\nnot even an issue, for the government secured the original state\n\n\n\n     5\n      This order was in response to the government's motion for a\nrehearing en banc in United States v. Sacko, 178 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 1999). Sacko was released three days before Dueno and was\narguably in tension with the later opinion. Since the Sacko panel\nreleased an erratum altering the language in Sacko, our court\ndenied the petition for rehearing, but took the opportunity \"to\nmake clear the en banc court's view as to what is now settled law\nin this circuit.\" Sacko, 178 F.3d at 7.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcourt case files from six of Shepard's prior convictions, found in\n\nthem   the   complaint      applications      and    police    reports   that   had\n\nprompted the complaints, and made the latter available to the\n\nfederal sentencing court (and so also to us).              And Shepard has been\n\ngiven a full opportunity (by the remand in Shepard II) to explain\n\nany circumstance surrounding the pleas that might defeat the\n\nnatural inference that the pleas were to the crimes described in\n\nthe case files.\n\n             Of   course,    it   is   barely       possible   that   someone    in\n\nShepard's position might have pled guilty, not to the charge that\n\nunderlay the complaint (namely, burglary of a building), but to the\n\nburgling of some other venue such as a boat arguably not within the\n\ndefinition of generic burglary.          Conceivably, at the plea hearing\n\nsomeone might have explained in mitigation that 258 Norwell Street\n\nwas actually a boat dock address or, in a different instance, that\n\nShepard's target was not the Jamaica Plain High School gymnasium\n\nbut merely a car parked in front.\n\n             This, we say, is conceivable but highly unlikely; and it\n\nis even less likely--to the point of nearly impossible--that it or\n\nanything like it happened for most of Shepard's predicate pleas,\n\nand that the police reports were mistaken as to venue for four or\n\nmore of the six crimes.           Nor on remand did Shepard offer any\n\nevidence that this had happened; he said only that he had not\n\nspecifically admitted in open court to breaking into houses and\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthat the underlying police reports were not read to him at the plea\n\nhearings.\n\n            Against this background, it is \"clearly erroneous\" to\n\nfind that Shepard did not plead guilty to at least three burglaries\n\nof buildings.     Absent other evidence of peculiar circumstances,\n\nthere is a compelling inference that the plea was to the complaint\n\nand that    the   complaint   embodied   the   events   described   in   the\n\napplication or police report in the case file.             If there were\n\ncountervailing evidence to defeat the inference, we would defer to\n\nany reasonable interpretation of the conflict by the trier of fact.\n\nBut there is no other evidence, nor is it easily imaginable that\n\nthere would be.\n\n            In Harris Judge Breyer referred to what the government\n\nand defendant \"believed\" to be the subject of the predicate plea;\n\nbut he did not suggest that this required direct evidence of the\n\nparties' subjective states of mind.      Harris, 964 F.2d at 1236. His\n\nconcern was with the nature of the proceedings: in upholding the\n\nenhancement Harris relied on objective evidence to characterize the\n\npleas--namely, on police reports in the case file.           Unimpeached,\n\nthose files carried the day in Harris; they do so here as well.\n\n            Our view accords with that of the Fourth Circuit in\n\nColeman, 158 F.3d at 202-03.         In Coleman, the en banc court\n\napproved consideration of the \"statement of charges\" filed by a\n\n\"complaining witness\"--Maryland's equivalent of Massachusetts's\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcomplaint application--in order to determine whether the predicate\n\ncrime qualified under the Act.                 Id.   While the Coleman court\n\nmentioned that this document was formally considered part of the\n\n\"charging papers\" under Maryland law, we do not see how the label\n\ngiven to the document should make a difference, particularly in\n\nlight of Taylor's forceful rejection of the use of state labels.\n\nTaylor, 495 U.S. at 590-92.\n\n              Judged by what Congress wanted, this case is not a close\n\ncall.    If this court's precedents have confused matters, that is\n\nour own fault but it is no reason to perpetuate confusion.            Harris,\n\nwith the reliability qualification adopted by Dueno as to the PSR\n\n(a point not litigated in Harris and irrelevant here), is the law\n\nof this circuit until the Supreme Court or an en banc panel rules\n\notherwise.6     On remand, the district court must sentence Shepard\n\nunder the     Act   and   apply   the    mandatory    minimum   prescribed   by\n\nCongress.\n\n            The sentence of the district court is vacated and the\n\nmatter remanded for re-sentencing in conformity with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       In addition to the tension between the two decisions, our\nown prior remand in Shepard II may further have complicated matters\nby not calling attention to the en banc order in Sacko. In all\nevents, none of this confusion is the fault of the district judge\nwho sought conscientiously to carry out this court's earlier\nmandate.\n\n                                        -15-\n\f",

Under the amended Armed Career\n\nCriminal Act (\"the Act\"), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (2000), a 15-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence is required for anyone convicted as a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm who has three or more prior\n\nconvictions for a \"violent felony\" or \"serious drug offense.\" This\n\nappeal by the government concerns the proper application of these\n\nlabels    to     Reginald    Shepard's    prior    guilty   pleas   under   state\n\nburglary statutes.          The issue is a recurring one.\n\n               On March 3, 1999, Shepard pled guilty to a charge of\n\nviolating the federal statute prohibiting a felon from possessing\n\na firearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2000).              Shepard had in fact sold\n\na Glock 17, 9 mm pistol and ammunition to an undercover federal\n\nagent at South Station in Boston.                 Shepard already had on his\n\nrecord dozens of prior state convictions, including eleven for\n\nbreaking and entering.           The government sought to have Shepard\n\nsentenced as an armed career criminal, arguing that at least five\n\nof these breaking and entering convictions were violent felonies\n\nunder the Act.\n\n               Under the Act, the phrase \"violent felony\" is not limited\n\nto crimes in which violence actually occurs; instead, the phrase is\n\ndefined to include inter alia \"any crime punishable by imprisonment\n\nfor   a   term    exceeding    one   year\"     that   \"is   burglary,   arson   or\n\nextortion . . . or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"                  18 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

Thus, the complaints alone did not\n\nreveal whether Shepard had broken into a building or some lesser\n\nenclosure such as a car or boat.\n\n                 The \"complaint\" under Massachusetts procedure is the\n\nfinal step in the charging process, roughly equivalent to a federal\n\ninformation.         1 Massachusetts Criminal Practice § 4.1-4.2 (1998).\n\nIssued by a magistrate, the complaint is based on a complaint\n\napplication normally filed by a police officer and likely to\n\n\n       1\n      One of the statutes says \"motor vehicle\" instead of \"vehicle\"\nbut otherwise they are similar; the difference between them is that\none statute, Mass.

Taking   these\n\ndocuments at face value, they showed (with varying degrees of\n\nelaboration) the following as to the charges that had led to\n\nShepard's guilty pleas:\n\n\n          May 1989. Break in at 30 Harlem St. in Boston;\n          defendant discovered by an inhabitant in the\n          pantry.\n\n          March 1991.

According to these documents, one\n\nconviction was for a February 1981 break in to the Jamaica Plain\n\n\n\n      2\n      At the first sentencing hearing the government argued that\nShepard's conviction for an April 1989 break in to Crispus Attucks\nChildren's Center building should also be counted as generic\nburglary. Since the government did not provide the police reports\nor complaint applications for this conviction, only the PSR, it\nsimplifies our analysis if we ignore this conviction for the\npresent case.\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fHigh School gymnasium and the theft of property; the other was an\n\nattempted break in at 446 Shawmut Avenue where Shepard was found on\n\nthe fire escape next to a window that had been pried open with a\n\nknife.\n\n          Shepard submitted an affidavit saying essentially the\n\nsame thing as to all of the alleged predicate charges:\n\n          I am sure that, at the time of [the state court plea\n          hearing], the judge did not read this Incident\n          report to me and did not ask me whether or not the\n          information contained in the incident report was\n          true.

The court emphasized\n\nShepard's affidavit denials that he had ever admitted in court the\n\nunderlying facts of the crimes and concluded that \"the police\n\nreports did not provide reliable evidence on the central question,\n\nwhat did the defendant plead to in the state court?\"     Id. at 17,\n\n19-20.   The government again appeals, arguing that complaint\n\napplications and police reports establish that Shepard pled guilty\n\nto breaking into buildings.\n\n          There is surely an air of make-believe about this case.\n\nNo one, and this includes Shepard and the district court, has\n\nseriously disputed that Shepard in fact broke into half a dozen or\n\nmore buildings and was consequently convicted upon pleas of guilty\n\n                                -6-\n\funder the two Massachusetts statutes in question.         Further, his\n\nstring of convictions--which the district court described as \"an\n\n18-year crime spree,\" Shepard I, 125 F. Supp. 2d at 565--shows that\n\nhe is just the kind of burglar whom Congress had in mind in\n\nadopting the tough 15 year minimum sentence for armed career\n\ncriminals.      Taylor recounts in numbing detail the legislative\n\nhistory showing Congress' aim to apply the Act to repeat burglars\n\nlater convicted of a gun crime.     Taylor, 495 U.S. at 581-90.\n\n             Congress' rationale was that a large percentage of all\n\ncrimes are committed by repeat offenders; that many of these crimes\n\nhave at least a potential for violence (e.g., the burglar who\n\nencounters a resident in the house being burgled); that after a\n\nseries of these crimes, the defendant is fairly described as a\n\nrepeat offender; and that when a repeat offender then also commits\n\na federal gun crime, it is time for that felon to serve a long\n\nprescribed minimum sentence. Taylor, 495 U.S. at 581-88. Whatever\n\nthe force of the theory, there is no doubt that Congress intended\n\nthat it be implemented.\n\n             Yet Taylor, while construing the term \"burglary\" broadly\n\n(based on common usage rather than common law), narrowed the Act\n\ndramatically in another respect.        Partly for practical reasons of\n\nadministration, Taylor forbade a de novo inquiry by the sentencing\n\ncourt into what conduct the defendant actually engaged in incident\n\nto the predicate offense, and focused instead on whether the crime\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fof conviction was necessarily a generic burglary (or some other\n\ncrime of violence). Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599-602. Admittedly, this\n\nsimplifies administration if the state statute describes generic\n\nburglary and nothing else.\n\n          The problem--which Taylor recognized and addressed--is\n\nthat state burglary statutes are often drafted to embrace both\n\nconduct that does constitute generic burglary and conduct that does\n\nnot (e.g., building versus vehicle3).   Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599-602.\n\nTaylor makes clear that where (as here) the statute embraces two\n\ndifferent crimes or categories of criminal conduct, the defendant\n\nwill be deemed guilty of a violent felony if one of the two\n\ncorresponds to generic burglary and that is the crime of conviction\n\nin the particular case.   Id. at 602.\n\n          But how can one tell whether generic burglary was the\n\ncrime of conviction if one does not look at what actually happened\n\nat the scene of the crime?   Taylor said that the sentencing court\n\ncan still look at the charging papers and jury instructions, which\n\n\n\n     3\n      Breaking and entering a vehicle is not generic burglary under\nTaylor's definition. 495 U.S. at 598-99. Our circuit has never\nsquarely decided whether burglary of vehicles or boats might still\nbe grounds for enhancement under the Act because they \"involve[]\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\nto another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), although prior dicta\nhave suggested that they do not qualify as violent felonies, see,\ne.g., Shepard II, 231 F.3d at 59. Since the parties do not dispute\nthis point, we assume it for present purposes, reserving always the\npeculiar problems posed by houseboats and camper vans, see United\nStates v.

Until the Supreme Court addresses the open issues, we\n\nmust use our own reasoning, keeping faith with our own prior\n\nprecedents.\n\n          Let us start with basics.      Under Taylor, a burglary\n\nconviction by a jury would count as a crime of violence under the\n\nAct if the indictment and instructions made clear that the burglary\n\nwas of a house.    Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602.   The same would be true\n\nif instead the defendant pled guilty to such indictment naming a\n\nhouse as the burgled location.4    It would also be true, as this\n\ncourt held in United States v.

As with Shepard's complaint, the\n\nindictment in Harris repeated the statutory boilerplate, leaving it\n\nunclear what category of offense was at issue.            Id.     The Harris\n\ncourt explained:\n\n           In such a case, we believe it would be\n           appropriate for the sentencing court to look\n           to the conduct in respect to which the\n           defendant was charged and pled guilty, not\n           because the court may properly be interested\n           (in   this   context)   in  the   violent   or\n           non-violent nature of that particular conduct,\n           but because that conduct may indicate that the\n           defendant and the government both believed\n           that    the    generically    violent    crime\n           (\"building\"), rather than the generically\n           non-violent crime (\"vehicle\") was at issue.\n\nId. at 1236.\n\n           Judge Breyer then described the presentence report's\n\nsummary of the case files from Harris's state convictions; these\n\nfiles (just like the complaint applications and police reports in\n\nShepard's case) made clear that the crimes were violent felonies--\n\nin Harris, that the defendant had twice physically assaulted the\n\nvictim.   Harris, 964 F.2d at 1236-37.       On this basis alone, this\n\ncourt concluded that Harris's prior convictions were properly\n\ntreated as violent felonies and (together with a third crime of\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fviolence) justified the 15 year minimum sentence prescribed by the\n\nAct.   Id. at 1237.\n\n            In United States v. Dueno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198385\"><a href=\"/opinion/198385/united-states-v-dueno/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1999),\n\nthis court arguably limited Harris in one respect.        In Dueno, the\n\ngovernment sought to characterize the predicate guilty pleas based\n\nnot on the original police reports in the state court case files\n\nbut rather upon the federal presentence report's description of the\n\nunderlying criminal conduct.    Id. at 6-7.    This had also been true\n\nin Harris but there no one had contested the reliance on the PSR.\n\nIn Dueno, the court--though describing the issue as a close one--\n\ndeclined to allow the PSR alone to resolve the issue.        Id. at 7.\n\n            The Dueno court endorsed Harris's general approach--as it\n\nhad to do absent en banc review, see Irving v.

Sacko, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764358\"><a href=\"/opinion/764358/no-97-2386/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st\nCir. 1999). Sacko was released three days before Dueno and was\narguably in tension with the later opinion. Since the Sacko panel\nreleased an erratum altering the language in Sacko, our court\ndenied the petition for rehearing, but took the opportunity \"to\nmake clear the en banc court's view as to what is now settled law\nin this circuit.\" Sacko, 178 F.3d at 7.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcourt case files from six of Shepard's prior convictions, found in\n\nthem   the   complaint      applications      and    police    reports   that   had\n\nprompted the complaints, and made the latter available to the\n\nfederal sentencing court (and so also to us).              And Shepard has been\n\ngiven a full opportunity (by the remand in Shepard II) to explain\n\nany circumstance surrounding the pleas that might defeat the\n\nnatural inference that the pleas were to the crimes described in\n\nthe case files.\n\n             Of   course,    it   is   barely       possible   that   someone    in\n\nShepard's position might have pled guilty, not to the charge that\n\nunderlay the complaint (namely, burglary of a building), but to the\n\nburgling of some other venue such as a boat arguably not within the\n\ndefinition of generic burglary.          Conceivably, at the plea hearing\n\nsomeone might have explained in mitigation that 258 Norwell Street\n\nwas actually a boat dock address or, in a different instance, that\n\nShepard's target was not the Jamaica Plain High School gymnasium\n\nbut merely a car parked in front.\n\n             This, we say, is conceivable but highly unlikely; and it\n\nis even less likely--to the point of nearly impossible--that it or\n\nanything like it happened for most of Shepard's predicate pleas,\n\nand that the police reports were mistaken as to venue for four or\n\nmore of the six crimes.           Nor on remand did Shepard offer any\n\nevidence that this had happened; he said only that he had not\n\nspecifically admitted in open court to breaking into houses and\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthat the underlying police reports were not read to him at the plea\n\nhearings.\n\n            Against this background, it is \"clearly erroneous\" to\n\nfind that Shepard did not plead guilty to at least three burglaries\n\nof buildings.     Absent other evidence of peculiar circumstances,\n\nthere is a compelling inference that the plea was to the complaint\n\nand that    the   complaint   embodied   the   events   described   in   the\n\napplication or police report in the case file.             If there were\n\ncountervailing evidence to defeat the inference, we would defer to\n\nany reasonable interpretation of the conflict by the trier of fact.\n\nBut there is no other evidence, nor is it easily imaginable that\n\nthere would be.\n\n            In Harris Judge Breyer referred to what the government\n\nand defendant \"believed\" to be the subject of the predicate plea;\n\nbut he did not suggest that this required direct evidence of the\n\nparties' subjective states of mind.      Harris, 964 F.2d at 1236. His\n\nconcern was with the nature of the proceedings: in upholding the\n\nenhancement Harris relied on objective evidence to characterize the\n\npleas--namely, on police reports in the case file.           Unimpeached,\n\nthose files carried the day in Harris; they do so here as well.\n\n            Our view accords with that of the Fourth Circuit in\n\nColeman, 158 F.3d at 202-03.         In Coleman, the en banc court\n\napproved consideration of the \"statement of charges\" filed by a\n\n\"complaining witness\"--Maryland's equivalent of Massachusetts's\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fcomplaint application--in order to determine whether the predicate\n\ncrime qualified under the Act.                 Id.   While the Coleman court\n\nmentioned that this document was formally considered part of the\n\n\"charging papers\" under Maryland law, we do not see how the label\n\ngiven to the document should make a difference, particularly in\n\nlight of Taylor's forceful rejection of the use of state labels.\n\nTaylor, 495 U.S. at 590-92.\n\n              Judged by what Congress wanted, this case is not a close\n\ncall.    If this court's precedents have confused matters, that is\n\nour own fault but it is no reason to perpetuate confusion.            Harris,\n\nwith the reliability qualification adopted by Dueno as to the PSR\n\n(a point not litigated in Harris and irrelevant here), is the law\n\nof this circuit until the Supreme Court or an en banc panel rules\n\notherwise.6     On remand, the district court must sentence Shepard\n\nunder the     Act   and   apply   the    mandatory    minimum   prescribed   by\n\nCongress.\n\n            The sentence of the district court is vacated and the\n\nmatter remanded for re-sentencing in conformity with this decision.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       In addition to the tension between the two decisions, our\nown prior remand in Shepard II may further have complicated matters\nby not calling attention to the en banc order in Sacko. In all\nevents, none of this confusion is the fault of the district judge\nwho sought conscientiously to carry out this court's earlier\nmandate.\n\n                                        -15-\n\f</pre>",
