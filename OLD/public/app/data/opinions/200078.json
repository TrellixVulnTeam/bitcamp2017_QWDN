Defendant Jeffrey P.\n\nBarnard was charged in a single-count indictment with being a\n\nfelon-in-possession      of    firearms,       in   violation    of     18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 922(g)(1).     He moved to suppress evidence of firearms seized in\n\na warrant search, contending that the warrant lacked sufficient\n\ninformation to support a finding of probable cause.                   The district\n\ncourt granted the motion on the papers without hearing.                       United\n\nStates v. Barnard, 172 F. Supp. 2d 207 (D. Me. 2001).                   Following\n\nentry   of     the   suppression         order,     the     government        sought\n\nreconsideration,     arguing       the   applicability     of   the    good    faith\n\nexception under United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).                     The\n\ncourt denied the motion, and the government timely appealed.                     We\n\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3731 and now reverse.\n\n                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n             On December 1, 2000, Detective John Glidden of the\n\nMillinocket     Police   Department        obtained    a    warrant     to    search\n\ndefendant's    residence      in   Millinocket,     Maine.      The     supporting\n\naffidavit provided the following information.\n\n             Detective Glidden received two reports from other law\n\nenforcement personnel.        First, in a conversation on July 27, 2000,\n\nProbation Officer Paul Kelly conveyed information from a “very\n\nreliable” source (“source”) that defendant owns a .22 caliber rifle\n\nand may also have another firearm at his 22 Kelly Lane residence\n\nand that if police went to defendant’s residence there would be a\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fshooting.     Second, on November 30, 2000, Sergeant Donald Bolduc\n\npassed along information from a confidential informant (“CI”) whom\n\nBolduc believed to be “reliable” and who was working with the\n\nMillinocket    Police   Department    for   no   consideration.     The   CI\n\nreported having seen an SKS assault rifle and a .22 caliber rifle\n\nthe last time he was at defendant’s home on November 13 or 14,\n\n2000.    The   CI   stated   that    defendant   had   purchased   the    SKS\n\napproximately four months earlier from Jason Hartley, a resident of\n\nMillinocket.     He further stated that defendant had threatened\n\npeople, including him, with the SKS and that defendant kept the\n\nweapon beside his bed while he slept.        Finally, the CI stated that\n\ndefendant was a felon.\n\n            The affidavit further stated that on November 30, 2000,\n\nDetective Glidden ran a criminal records check on defendant that\n\nshowed four prior convictions for possessing a firearm after being\n\nconvicted of a felony, all within five years preceding the search.\n\n            Finally, Detective Glidden stated that he had been a\n\npolice officer for eleven years during which time he had written\n\nmany search warrants and investigated several cases involving\n\nillegal possession of firearms.       In his experience, people who own\n\nfirearms usually kept them at their residence.\n\n            A justice of the peace (“issuing justice”) issued the\n\nsearch warrant, and police personnel executed it on December 3,\n\n2000.   The search apparently yielded three firearms in defendant’s\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fpossession, including a .22 caliber rifle and an SKS assault rifle.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n              A.     Standard of Review\n\n              We    review     de   novo    the    district          court’s       “ultimate\n\ndetermination of whether a given set of facts constituted <probable\n\ncause.'”      United States v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 n.6 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).         Any factual findings made by the district court are\n\nreviewed for clear error.            Id.    In determining the sufficiency of\n\nan     affidavit,      we    consider       whether      the     “totality             of    the\n\ncircumstances” stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause\n\nto search the premises.             United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d\n\n279,    283   (1st    Cir.     1997).       We    examine      the    affidavit         in    “a\n\npractical, common-sense fashion” and accord “considerable deference\n\nto reasonable inferences the [issuing justice] may have drawn from\n\nthe    attested      facts.”        Zayas-Diaz,     95   F.3d        at     111    (internal\n\nquotations omitted). “Under the ‘probable cause’ standard, the\n\n‘totality      of    the    circumstances’        disclosed      in        the    supporting\n\naffidavits must demonstrate ‘a fair probability that contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.’” Id.,\n\n(quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983)).                                      In a\n\ndoubtful      or    marginal    case,      the   court   defers           to     the   issuing\n\nmagistrate’s determination of probable cause.                        Id.\n\n              B.    Analysis\n\n              Where an affidavit relies on the reports of unnamed\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\finformants, it must provide some information upon which the issuing\n\njustice can assess the credibility of the informant’s information.\n\nWe have adopted a nonexhaustive list of factors that a reviewing\n\ncourt will consider in a probable cause determination based on\n\ninformation from an informant.           These include:\n\n           whether an affidavit supports the probable\n           veracity or basis of knowledge of persons\n           supplying    hearsay   information;    whether\n           informant statements are self-authenticating;\n           whether some or all of the informant’s factual\n           statements    were    corroborated    wherever\n           reasonable and practicable . . .; and whether\n           a   law   enforcement   affiant   included   a\n           professional   assessment   of  the   probable\n           significance of the facts related by the\n           informant based on experience or expertise.\n\nKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 284 (internal quotations omitted); see\n\nalso   Zayas-Diaz,     95   F.3d   at   111.      “None   of   the   factors   is\n\nindispensable; thus, stronger evidence on one or more factors may\n\ncompensate for a weaker or deficient show on another.” Zayas-Diaz,\n\n95 F.3d at 111.\n\n                  1.   Law enforcement’s assertions of reliability\n\n           We turn first to Sergeant Bolduc’s assertion that he\n\nbelieved the CI to be “reliable.”             A mere assertion of reliability\n\nwithout any information regarding the basis for the officer’s\n\nbelief, such as past tips leading to arrests, is entitled to only\n\n“slight” weight.       Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 286.           However, Bolduc\n\nnot only gave his estimate of the CI’s reliability but backed it up\n\nwith information that the CI was working for the department for no\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fconsideration.    This information at least provided some assurance\n\nof reliability.      Unlike an anonymous tipster, the CI was known to\n\nthe police and could be held responsible if his assertions proved\n\ninaccurate or false.          Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 270 (2000)\n\n(citing Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146-47 (1972)).\n\n                  2.   Informant’s basis of knowledge\n\n          The credibility of an informant is enhanced to the extent\n\nhe has provided information that indicates first-hand knowledge.\n\nSee United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99, 102-03 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(“reliability of informant enhanced if detailed and derived from\n\ninformant’s personal observation rather than hearsay”)); see also\n\nGates, 462 U.S. at 234 (stating that the informant’s “explicit and\n\ndetailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement\n\nthat the event was observed first-hand entitles the tip to greater\n\nweight than might otherwise be the case”).                Here, the CI stated\n\nthat he saw the two firearms at defendant’s house and identified\n\nthe types of guns.      He also stated that defendant had threatened\n\nhim with the SKS.       This first-hand information provided a link\n\nbetween the illegal activity observed and the place to be searched.\n\nIt demonstrated the CI’s knowledge of concealed illegal activity as\n\nopposed   to   easily     knowable,        nonincriminating       facts.     See\n\nKhounsavanh,   113     F.3d    at   284.     This,   in   turn,    allowed   the\n\nallegation of illegal activity to be corroborated.             J.L., 529 U.S.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fat 272 (emphasizing that information must be reliable in its\n\nassertion of illegality as opposed to nonincriminating facts).\n\nThese first-hand details provide some assurance of reliability.\n\n                 There is no indication of personal knowledge for the\n\nCI’s further statements that (1) defendant had purchased the SKS\n\nfrom Jason Hartley four months previously, (2) defendant slept with\n\nthe SKS by his bed, and (3) defendant was a felon.           While these\n\nstatements are double hearsay, they need not be disregarded because\n\nthe information conforms to the CI’s first-hand information, which\n\nwas substantially corroborated.          See Gates, 462 U.S. at 244-45\n\n(involving double hearsay) (“It is enough, for the purposes of\n\nassessing probable cause, that corroboration through other sources\n\nof information reduced the chances of a reckless or prevaricating\n\ntale,   thus   providing   a   substantial   basis   for   crediting   the\n\nhearsay.” (internal quotations omitted)).\n\n                 3.   Corroboration\n\n           The affidavit provided two sources of corroboration:\n\nProbation Officer Kelly’s source’s report and Detective Glidden’s\n\ninvestigation. We must determine whether the corroboration made it\n\nsufficiently likely that the issuing justice could have concluded\n\nthat the crucial part of the CI’s story–that defendant, a felon,\n\nwas storing at least one firearm at his home–was true.                 See\n\nKhounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 284.         We note that the “risk that an\n\ninformant is lying or in error need not be wholly eliminated.”         Id.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fInstead, we must be confident that the likelihood of lying or an\n\ninaccurate informant is sufficiently reduced by corroborated facts\n\nand observation.   Id.\n\n          We first consider the cross-corroboration provided by\n\nProbation Officer Kelly’s source.    The district court rejected the\n\ngovernment’s contention that the information provided by Kelly’s\n\nsource cross-corroborated the report of Bolduc’s CI.      The court\n\nfound that the affidavit provided so little information about\n\neither informant that it is impossible to determine whether the two\n\nare actually different people, meaning that the two reports could\n\nnot corroborate each other.   Barnard, 172 F. Supp. 2d. at 211.\n\n          We disagree.   First, the affidavit’s description shows\n\nthat Detective Glidden understood that they were two people.      He\n\nreferred to the probation officer’s source as a “reliable source”\n\nand “[t]his subject,” whereas, he referred to the sergeant’s source\n\nas “confidential informant” or “CI.”        Second, the informants\n\napproached two different authorities, one a probation officer and\n\nthe other a police officer, who perform different functions in the\n\ncriminal justice system and are thus likely to have contact with\n\ndifferent individuals. Third, the CI provided information that the\n\nsource did not supply, namely, that defendant was a felon, that he\n\nslept with an SKS assault rifle next to his bed, and that he had\n\nthreatened people, including the CI, with the SKS. This additional\n\ninformation suggests that the CI was closer to defendant than the\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fsource. Fourth, both the government and the defense understood the\n\naffidavit to refer to two people as evidenced by their papers\n\nbelow.1        For these reasons, we conclude that in examining the\n\naffidavit       in   a    “practical,   common-sense       fashion”       the    issuing\n\njustice could reasonably infer the existence of two informants.\n\nSee Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d at 111; United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d\n\n1160, 1167 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n                The source’s account corroborates the CI’s allegation\n\nthat defendant was in possession of a .22 caliber rifle and\n\npossibly another firearm at his residence.                 The source also warned\n\nthat       a   shooting     would   occur    if   police     went    to   defendant’s\n\nresidence. This information dovetails with the CI’s statement that\n\ndefendant had threatened him and others with the SKS.                      As with the\n\nCI’s report, it is relevant that the source’s account identified\n\ncriminal activity, i.e., defendant’s possession of the .22 rifle.\n\n                Detective Glidden’s criminal background check provided\n\nfurther        corroboration.        See     Taylor,   985    F.2d    at    6.      His\n\ninvestigation corroborated the CI’s allegation that defendant was\n\na known felon.           Taken together, the source’s account and Detective\n\nGlidden’s investigation provide substantial corroboration for the\n\nCI’s crucial allegation of criminal conduct by defendant at his\n\nhome.      See Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 284; see also Taylor, 985 F.2d\n\n\n\n       1\n      We note that this issue was raised by the court sua sponte,\nnot having been raised in the briefing to the court.\n\n                                            -9-\n\fat 6 (holding that an informant’s very detailed and specific\n\naccount was corroborated where law enforcement simply conducted a\n\ncriminal background check).\n\n                4. Law enforcement’s professional assessment\n\n          Finally,   the   issuing   justice    could   credit   the   law\n\nenforcement   affiant’s    experience   and    pertinent   expertise   in\n\nevaluating the authenticity of the informant’s description of the\n\ntarget’s modus operandi.     Taylor, 985 F.2d at 6; see also United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891, 897 (1975) ([O]fficers are entitled\n\nto draw reasonable inferences from [] facts in light of their\n\nknowledge of the area and their prior experience . . . .”).        Here,\n\nDetective Glidden attested that during his eleven years' service on\n\nthe force, he had prior experience investigating illegal firearm\n\npossession cases that had resulted in the seizure of the firearm\n\nand the felon’s arrest.      Based on his experience, training, and\n\nconversations with other experienced officers, Detective Glidden\n\nstated that individuals who own guns generally keep them at their\n\nresidences.   In the eyes of the issuing justice, these statements\n\ncould have boosted the reliability of the CI’s information that\n\ndefendant kept two firearms at his home.        See Taylor, 985 F.2d at\n\n6.\n\n                              CONCLUSION\n\n          We conclude that “[t]aken together, these facts were\n\nsufficient to give the [issuing justice] a ‘substantial basis’ upon\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fwhich to conclude that there was a ‘fair probability’” that the\n\nfirearms would be found at defendant’s home. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d\n\nat 286 (citing Gates, 462 U.S. at 238).\n\n          Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

The supporting affidavit provided the following information.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Glidden received two reports from other law enforcement personnel. First, in a conversation on July 27, 2000, Probation Officer Paul Kelly conveyed information from a \"very reliable\" source (\"source\") that defendant owns a .22 caliber rifle and may also have another firearm at his 22 Kelly Lane residence and that if police went to defendant's residence there would be a shooting. Second, on November 30, 2000, Sergeant Donald Bolduc passed along information from a confidential informant (\"CI\") whom Bolduc believed to be \"reliable\" and who was working with the Millinocket Police Department for no consideration. The CI reported having seen an SKS assault rifle and a .22 caliber rifle the last time he was at defendant's home on November 13 or 14, 2000. The CI stated that defendant had purchased the SKS approximately four months earlier from Jason Hartley, a resident of Millinocket. He further stated that defendant had threatened people, including him, with the SKS and that defendant kept the weapon beside his bed while he slept. Finally, the CI stated that defendant was a felon.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit further stated that on November 30, 2000, Detective Glidden ran a criminal records check on defendant that showed four prior convictions for possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, all within five years preceding the search.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Detective Glidden stated that he had been a police officer for eleven years during which time he had written many search warrants and investigated several cases involving illegal possession of firearms. In his experience, people who own firearms usually kept them at their residence.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A justice of the peace (\"issuing justice\") issued the search warrant, and police personnel executed it on December 3, 2000. The search apparently yielded three firearms in defendant's possession, including a.22 caliber rifle and an SKS assault rifle.</p>\n      <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's \"ultimate determination of whether a given set of facts constituted `probable cause.'\" <i>United States v. Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 111 n. 6 (1st Cir.1996). Any factual findings made by the district court are reviewed for clear error. <i>Id.</i> In determining the sufficiency of an affidavit, we consider whether the \"totality of the circumstances\" stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search the premises. <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir.1997). We examine the affidavit in \"a practical, common-sense fashion\" and accord \"considerable deference to reasonable inferences the [issuing justice] may have drawn from the attested facts.\" <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111 (internal quotations omitted). \"Under the `probable cause' standard, the `totality of the circumstances' disclosed in the supporting affidavits must demonstrate `<i>a fair probability</i> that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.'\" <i>Id.,</i> (quoting <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). In a doubtful or marginal case, the court defers to the issuing magistrate's determination of probable cause. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an affidavit relies on the reports of unnamed informants, it must provide some information upon which the issuing justice can assess the credibility of the informant's information. We have adopted a nonexhaustive list of factors that a reviewing court will consider in a probable cause determination based on information from an informant. These include:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">whether an affidavit supports the probable veracity or basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information; whether informant statements are self-authenticating; whether some or all of the informant's factual statements were corroborated wherever reasonable and practicable ...; and whether a law enforcement affiant included a professional assessment of the probable significance of the facts related by the informant based on experience or expertise.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284 (internal quotations omitted); <i>see also Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111. \"None of the factors is indispensable; thus, stronger evidence on one or more factors may compensate for a weaker or deficient show on another.\" <i>Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111.</p>\n      <p>1. Law enforcement's assertions of reliability</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to Sergeant Bolduc's assertion that he believed the CI to be \"reliable.\" A mere assertion of reliability without any information regarding the basis for the officer's belief, such as past tips leading to arrests, is entitled to only \"slight\" weight. <i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 286. However, Bolduc not only gave his estimate of the CI's reliability but backed it up with information that the CI was working for the department for no consideration. This information at least provided some assurance of reliability. Unlike an anonymous tipster, the CI was known to the police and could be held responsible if his assertions proved inaccurate or false. <i>Florida v. J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000) (citing <i>Adams v. Williams,</i> 407 U.S. 143, 146-47, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972)).</p>\n      <p>2. Informant's basis of knowledge</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The credibility of an informant is enhanced to the extent he has provided information that indicates first-hand knowledge. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1993) (citing <i>United States v. Caggiano,</i> 899 F.2d 99, 102-03 (1st Cir.1990) (\"reliability of informant enhanced if detailed and derived from informant's personal observation rather than hearsay\")); <i>see also Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (stating that the informant's \"explicit and detailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement that the event was observed first-hand entitles the tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the case\"). Here, the CI stated that he saw the two firearms at defendant's house and identified the types of guns. He also stated that defendant had threatened him with the SKS. This first-hand information provided a link between the illegal activity observed and the place to be searched. It demonstrated the CI's knowledge of concealed illegal activity as opposed to easily knowable, nonincriminating facts. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284. This, in turn, allowed the allegation of illegal activity to be corroborated. <i>J.L.,</i> 529 U.S. at 272, 120 S.Ct. 1375 (emphasizing that information must be reliable in its assertion of illegality as opposed to nonincriminating facts). These first-hand details provide some assurance of reliability.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no indication of personal knowledge for the CI's further statements that (1) defendant had purchased the SKS from Jason Hartley four months previously, (2) defendant slept with the SKS by his bed, and (3) defendant was a felon. While these statements are double hearsay, they need not be disregarded because the information conforms to the CI's first-hand information, which was substantially corroborated. <i>See Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 244-45, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (involving double hearsay) (\"It is enough, for the purposes of assessing probable cause, that corroboration through other sources of information reduced the chances of a reckless or prevaricating tale, thus providing a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay.\" (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n      <p>3. Corroboration</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit provided two sources of corroboration: Probation Officer Kelly's source's report and Detective Glidden's investigation. We must determine whether the corroboration made it sufficiently likely that the issuing justice could have concluded that the crucial part of the CI's story-that defendant, a felon, was storing at least one firearm at his home-was true. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284. We note that the \"risk that an informant is lying or in error need not be wholly eliminated.\" <i>Id.</i> Instead, we must be confident that the likelihood of lying or an inaccurate informant is sufficiently reduced by corroborated facts and observation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider the cross-corroboration provided by Probation Officer Kelly's source. The district court rejected the government's contention that the information provided by Kelly's source cross-corroborated the report of Bolduc's CI. The court found that the affidavit provided so little information about either informant that it is impossible to determine whether the two are actually different people, meaning that the two reports could not corroborate each other. <i>Barnard,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d. at 211.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. First, the affidavit's description shows that Detective Glidden understood that they were two people. He referred to the probation officer's source as a \"reliable source\" and \"[t]his subject,\" whereas, he referred to the sergeant's source as \"confidential informant\" or \"CI.\" Second, the informants approached two different authorities, one a probation officer and the other a police officer, who perform different functions in the criminal justice system and are thus likely to have contact with different individuals. Third, the CI provided information that the source did not supply, namely, that defendant was a felon, that he slept with an SKS assault rifle next to his bed, and that he had threatened people, including the CI, with the SKS. This additional information suggests that the CI was closer to defendant than the source. Fourth, both the government and the defense understood the affidavit to refer to two people as evidenced by their papers below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For these reasons, we conclude that in examining the affidavit in a \"practical, commonsense fashion\" the issuing justice could reasonably infer the existence of two informants. <i>See Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111; <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The source's account corroborates the CI's allegation that defendant was in possession of a .22 caliber rifle and possibly another firearm at his residence. The source also warned that a shooting would occur if police went to defendant's residence. This information dovetails with the CI's statement that defendant had threatened him and others with the SKS. As with the CI's report, it is relevant that the source's account identified criminal activity, i.e., defendant's possession of the .22 rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Glidden's criminal background check provided further corroboration. <i>See Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6. His investigation corroborated the CI's allegation that defendant was a known felon. Taken together, the source's account and Detective Glidden's investigation provide substantial corroboration for the CI's crucial allegation of criminal conduct by defendant at his home. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284; <i>see also Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6 (holding that an informant's very detailed and specific account was corroborated where law enforcement simply conducted a criminal background check).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>4. Law enforcement's professional assessment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the issuing justice could credit the law enforcement affiant's experience and pertinent expertise in evaluating the authenticity of the informant's description of the target's modus operandi. <i>Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6; <i>see also United States v. Ortiz,</i> 422 U.S. 891, 897, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975) (\"[O]fficers are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from [] facts in light of their knowledge of the area and their prior experience....\"). Here, Detective Glidden attested that during his eleven years' service on the force, he had prior experience investigating illegal firearm possession cases that had resulted in the seizure of the firearm and the felon's arrest. Based on his experience, training, and conversations with other experienced officers, Detective Glidden stated that individuals who own guns generally keep them at their residences. In the eyes of the issuing justice, these statements could have boosted the reliability of the CI's information that defendant kept two firearms at his home. <i>See Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that \"[t]aken together, these facts were sufficient to give the [issuing justice] a `substantial basis' upon which to conclude that there was a `fair probability'\" that the firearms would be found at defendant's home. <i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 286 (citing <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that this issue was raised by the court sua sponte, not having been raised in the briefing to the court</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731 and now reverse.</p>\n      <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 2000, Detective John Glidden of the Millinocket Police Department obtained a warrant to search defendant's residence in Millinocket, Maine. The supporting affidavit provided the following information.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Glidden received two reports from other law enforcement personnel. First, in a conversation on July 27, 2000, Probation Officer Paul Kelly conveyed information from a \"very reliable\" source (\"source\") that defendant owns a .22 caliber rifle and may also have another firearm at his 22 Kelly Lane residence and that if police went to defendant's residence there would be a shooting. Second, on November 30, 2000, Sergeant Donald Bolduc passed along information from a confidential informant (\"CI\") whom Bolduc believed to be \"reliable\" and who was working with the Millinocket Police Department for no consideration. The CI reported having seen an SKS assault rifle and a .22 caliber rifle the last time he was at defendant's home on November 13 or 14, 2000. The CI stated that defendant had purchased the SKS approximately four months earlier from Jason Hartley, a resident of Millinocket. He further stated that defendant had threatened people, including him, with the SKS and that defendant kept the weapon beside his bed while he slept. Finally, the CI stated that defendant was a felon.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit further stated that on November 30, 2000, Detective Glidden ran a criminal records check on defendant that showed four prior convictions for possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, all within five years preceding the search.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Detective Glidden stated that he had been a police officer for eleven years during which time he had written many search warrants and investigated several cases involving illegal possession of firearms. In his experience, people who own firearms usually kept them at their residence.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A justice of the peace (\"issuing justice\") issued the search warrant, and police personnel executed it on December 3, 2000. The search apparently yielded three firearms in defendant's possession, including a.22 caliber rifle and an SKS assault rifle.</p>\n      <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's \"ultimate determination of whether a given set of facts constituted `probable cause.'\" <i>United States v.

We must determine whether the corroboration made it sufficiently likely that the issuing justice could have concluded that the crucial part of the CI's story-that defendant, a felon, was storing at least one firearm at his home-was true. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284. We note that the \"risk that an informant is lying or in error need not be wholly eliminated.\" <i>Id.</i> Instead, we must be confident that the likelihood of lying or an inaccurate informant is sufficiently reduced by corroborated facts and observation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider the cross-corroboration provided by Probation Officer Kelly's source. The district court rejected the government's contention that the information provided by Kelly's source cross-corroborated the report of Bolduc's CI. The court found that the affidavit provided so little information about either informant that it is impossible to determine whether the two are actually different people, meaning that the two reports could not corroborate each other. <i>Barnard,</i> 172 F.Supp.2d. at 211.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. First, the affidavit's description shows that Detective Glidden understood that they were two people. He referred to the probation officer's source as a \"reliable source\" and \"[t]his subject,\" whereas, he referred to the sergeant's source as \"confidential informant\" or \"CI.\" Second, the informants approached two different authorities, one a probation officer and the other a police officer, who perform different functions in the criminal justice system and are thus likely to have contact with different individuals. Third, the CI provided information that the source did not supply, namely, that defendant was a felon, that he slept with an SKS assault rifle next to his bed, and that he had threatened people, including the CI, with the SKS. This additional information suggests that the CI was closer to defendant than the source. Fourth, both the government and the defense understood the affidavit to refer to two people as evidenced by their papers below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For these reasons, we conclude that in examining the affidavit in a \"practical, commonsense fashion\" the issuing justice could reasonably infer the existence of two informants. <i>See Zayas-Diaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111; <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598972\"><a href=\"/opinion/598972/united-states-v-jose-a-garcia-united-states-v-pablo-h-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1167 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The source's account corroborates the CI's allegation that defendant was in possession of a .22 caliber rifle and possibly another firearm at his residence. The source also warned that a shooting would occur if police went to defendant's residence. This information dovetails with the CI's statement that defendant had threatened him and others with the SKS. As with the CI's report, it is relevant that the source's account identified criminal activity, i.e., defendant's possession of the .22 rifle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Detective Glidden's criminal background check provided further corroboration. <i>See Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6. His investigation corroborated the CI's allegation that defendant was a known felon. Taken together, the source's account and Detective Glidden's investigation provide substantial corroboration for the CI's crucial allegation of criminal conduct by defendant at his home. <i>See Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 284; <i>see also Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6 (holding that an informant's very detailed and specific account was corroborated where law enforcement simply conducted a criminal background check).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>4. Law enforcement's professional assessment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the issuing justice could credit the law enforcement affiant's experience and pertinent expertise in evaluating the authenticity of the informant's description of the target's modus operandi. <i>Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6; <i>see also United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109312\"><a href=\"/opinion/109312/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span>, 897, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109312\"><a href=\"/opinion/109312/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, Detective Glidden attested that during his eleven years' service on the force, he had prior experience investigating illegal firearm possession cases that had resulted in the seizure of the firearm and the felon's arrest. Based on his experience, training, and conversations with other experienced officers, Detective Glidden stated that individuals who own guns generally keep them at their residences. In the eyes of the issuing justice, these statements could have boosted the reliability of the CI's information that defendant kept two firearms at his home. <i>See Taylor,</i> 985 F.2d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that \"[t]aken together, these facts were sufficient to give the [issuing justice] a `substantial basis' upon which to conclude that there was a `fair probability'\" that the firearms would be found at defendant's home. <i>Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d at 286 (citing <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 238, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
