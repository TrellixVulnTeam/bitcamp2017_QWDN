William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n               Selya, Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     William F. Lee, with whom Robert D. Keefe, Stephen A. Jonas,\nMark D. Selwyn, Hale and Dorr LLP, Richard G. Taranto, and Farr &\nTaranto were on brief, for appellant.\n     James E. Arnold, Trial Attorney, United States Department of\nJustice, with whom Michael K. Loucks, Chief, Health Care Fraud\nUnit, and Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          October 22, 2003\n\f            SELYA,    Circuit    Judge.         Although     the     attorney-client\n\nprivilege    may    be   the    most    venerable       of   the     privileges    for\n\nconfidential communications, its accouterments are not the most\n\nclearly delineated.          These appeals, which require us to answer\n\ndelicate questions concerning implied waivers of the privilege,\n\nbear witness to that point.\n\n            The    appeals     have    their     genesis     in    an   investigatory\n\nsubpoena duces tecum issued by a federal grand jury (we use the\n\nadjective     \"investigatory\"          because     no   indictments        have    yet\n\neventuated from the grand jury probe).                  The subpoenaed party, a\n\ncorporation, refused to produce certain of the requested documents\n\non the ground that they were shielded by the attorney-client and\n\nwork-product       privileges.         The     government         sought   to   compel\n\nproduction,    contending       that    any    attendant     privilege      had   been\n\nwaived.     The district court, eschewing an evidentiary hearing,\n\nordered the corporation to produce the documents and cited it for\n\ncontempt when it declined to do so.              These appeals — there are two\n\nbecause the corporation filed a notice of appeal after the court\n\nordered production of the withheld documents and another after the\n\ncourt adjudged it in contempt — followed.\n\n            After careful consideration, we conclude that the record\n\nfails to support the lower court's finding of a broad subject\n\nmatter waiver.       Accordingly, we reverse the turnover order and\n\nvacate the contempt citation.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We start with an abbreviated account of the events\n\nleading to the turnover order.         Consistent with the secrecy that\n\ntypically attaches to grand jury matters, see, e.g., Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 6(e), these appeals have gone forward under an order sealing the\n\nbriefs, the parties' proffers, and other pertinent portions of the\n\nrecord.   To preserve that confidentiality, we use fictitious names\n\nfor all affected parties and furnish only such background facts as\n\nare necessary to provide ambiance.\n\n           In   the   fall    of   1998,   XYZ   Corporation   (XYZ)   began\n\ndistributing a neoteric medical device.            Soon after distribution\n\nbegan, XYZ learned that, on some occasions, the device was not\n\nfunctioning properly.        It conducted an internal investigation and\n\nsought the advice of outside counsel to determine an appropriate\n\ncourse of action.\n\n           In fairly short order, XYZ made a preliminary decision to\n\nwithdraw the device from the market (at least temporarily). Before\n\ndoing so, however, XYZ's existing supply agreement obligated it to\n\nconsult with its co-venturer, Smallco.           Representatives of the two\n\ncompanies conferred telephonically.              The participants in that\n\ndiscussion included two officers of XYZ, outside counsel for XYZ\n\n(Bernard Barrister), the principals of Smallco, and Smallco's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fmedical    advisor.1        During     this       conversation,      which     we    shall\n\nhereafter    refer     to   as   \"the    call,\"         Barrister    advocated       XYZ's\n\nposition in the face of strong counterarguments from the Smallco\n\nhierarchs    (who    wished      to     keep      the    device     on   the    market).\n\nUnbeknownst to XYZ, Smallco recorded the call.\n\n            The     next    day,      XYZ     contacted      the     Food      and    Drug\n\nAdministration (the FDA) to discuss the emerging problems.                               A\n\ndialogue ensued.        Less than one month after its initial contact\n\nwith the FDA, XYZ voluntarily withdrew the device from the market.\n\n            The Department of Justice got wind of what had transpired\n\nand commenced an investigation into the distribution of the device.\n\nAs part of this probe, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena\n\nrequiring XYZ to produce an array of documents.2                         XYZ withheld\n\ncertain of the documents, instead producing privilege logs indexing\n\nwhat had been retained and the claims of privilege applicable\n\nthereto.    As early as April of 2001, the government requested XYZ\n\nto waive its claims of privilege.                 XYZ refused.\n\n            In late 2001, the government obtained a tape recording of\n\nthe call.    The government thereafter asked XYZ for permission to\n\n\n     1\n      There is some suggestion in the record that two other\nemployees of XYZ were on the line during the call. We need not\nresolve this uncertainty as the presence or absence of these\nindividuals would not affect our analysis.\n     2\n      The grand jury also caused subpoenas duces tecum to be served\non Barrister and Barrister's law firm. Those subpoenas are not\nbefore us (although we note parenthetically that neither recipient\nhas surrendered the documents).\n\n                                            -4-\n\faudit the tape.       XYZ replied that it would not seek to prevent the\n\ngovernment from listening but admonished that this decision should\n\nnot be viewed as a waiver of any privilege protecting other\n\ncommunications.        The government agreed — in writing — to this\n\ncondition.      The investigation continued.\n\n             In February of 2002, federal prosecutors met with XYZ's\n\nnew outside counsel to inform XYZ of the direction of their\n\ninvestigation.        Pursuant to the request of a government attorney,\n\nXYZ's counsel authored two letters responding to concerns voiced at\n\nthe February meeting.       Each contained a footnote on the first page\n\nstating explicitly that the letter should not be construed as a\n\nwaiver     of   the    attorney-client    or   work-product   privileges.3\n\nFollowing this correspondence, representatives of XYZ again met\n\n\n\n\n     3\n         The language, in its entirety, read:\n\n             We submit this letter pursuant to Rule\n             11(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n             Procedure.   This letter may not be used as\n             evidence against [XYZ] or any subsidiary,\n             affiliate, successor or assign, employee or\n             agent, in any civil or criminal proceeding.\n             This letter describes certain facts as we\n             understand them from the record developed\n             during the Government's investigation. It is\n             not intended to, and should not be interpreted\n             to, constitute admissions on behalf of [XYZ]\n             or any related entities or persons. It also\n             is not intended, and should not be construed,\n             as any waiver of the attorney-client, the\n             attorney work product, or any other applicable\n             privilege.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwith the prosecutors to discuss the possible indictment of XYZ\n\nand/or its officers.   This meeting took place in May of 2002.\n\n          In April of 2003 — after persistently requesting a\n\nvoluntary waiver of the attorney-client privilege for two full\n\nyears — the government changed its tune.        It repaired to the\n\nfederal district court and filed a motion to compel production of\n\nthe disputed documents.   In its motion, the government argued in\n\neffect that XYZ already had waived the attorney-client privilege as\n\nto the most important documents described in the subpoena.        The\n\nmotion asserted that, during the call, Barrister had given legal\n\nadvice in the presence of third parties and had disclosed legal\n\nadvice previously provided to XYZ.    In the government's view, this\n\nconduct effected a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to\n\nall communications anent the marketing and withdrawal of the device\n\nfor a period extending from August 12, 1998 to October 8, 1998.    As\n\na fallback, the government asseverated that XYZ had waived the\n\nattorney-client   privilege   by   means   of   the   pre-indictment\n\npresentations made in response to the prosecutors' requests.       To\n\nclose the circle, the government maintained that the work-product\n\ndoctrine, if applicable at all, likewise had been waived.4\n\n\n\n     4\n      In addition, the government claimed that the crime-fraud\nexception to the attorney-client and work-product privileges\nabrogated any protections that had not been waived. Because the\ndistrict court did not reach this claim, we express no opinion on\nit. The government remains free, if it so chooses, to reassert\nthis claim in the district court.\n\n                                -6-\n\f             The district court, acting ex parte, granted the motion\n\nto compel.    In a four-sentence order, the court ruled that XYZ had\n\n\"waived its attorney-client privilege with respect to the subject\n\nmatter of the [call].\"    When the government moved for an expedited\n\nhearing to clarify the order and XYZ sought reconsideration, the\n\ndistrict court again acted summarily. Without either conducting an\n\nevidentiary hearing or entertaining argument, it ruled ore sponte\n\nthat XYZ's waiver of the attorney-client privilege applied both\n\nretrospectively (i.e., to communications before the call relating\n\nto the \"same matter\") and prospectively (i.e., to communications\n\nafter the call relating to the \"same matter\").\n\n             In its bench decision, the district court went well\n\nbeyond the three-month waiver window envisioned by the government;\n\nit declared, in effect, that the waiver was to operate without\n\nlimit   of    time   (indeed,   the     court   noted,   as   to   future\n\ncommunications, that the waiver would have effect \"so long as\n\npeople are talking about that same subject,\" and might apply up to\n\nthe time of trial).       The court exempted from the waiver any\n\nattorney-client communications about the waiver issue itself and\n\nprovided guidance as to the scope of the waiver by referring to the\n\n\"doctrine of completeness.\"      The court declined to resolve any\n\nadditional issues, stating that it would cross those bridges as the\n\nneed arose.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                   Notwithstanding the district court's order, XYZ refused\n\nto produce the documents.                  The district court held the corporation\n\nin contempt (thus brushing aside, inter alia, its claim of a work-\n\nproduct        privilege),5          but    stayed     further      proceedings     pending\n\nappellate review.              We have jurisdiction over the ensuing appeals\n\nbecause XYZ subjected itself to a citation for contempt.                          See In re\n\nGrand Jury Subpoenas, 123 F.3d 695, 696-97 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nII.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                   On   an   appeal    concerning       a   claim    of    privilege,     the\n\nstandard of review depends on the precise issue being litigated.\n\nSee Cavallaro v. United States, 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 129 F.3d 681, 683 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).       We review rulings on questions of law de novo, findings of\n\nfact for clear error, and judgment calls — such as evidentiary\n\ndeterminations — for abuse of discretion.                        Cavallaro, 284 F.3d at\n\n245.        The standard of review is not altered by the fact that the\n\ndistrict court granted the motion without much elaboration of its\n\nthinking.          FDIC v. Ogden Corp., 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\"Although a lower court's elucidation of its reasoning invariably\n\neases the appellate task, motions often are decided summarily.                             .\n\n.   .       [W]e     are     aware    of    no   authority       that     would   allow   us\n\n\n\n\n        5\n      This implied dismissal of the work-product privilege was\nfully consistent with comments made by the court in the course of\nits earlier bench decision.\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fautomatically to vary the standard of review depending on whether\n\na district court has taken the time to explain its rationale.\"                Id.\n\n            With these background principles in mind, we proceed to\n\nthe merits.      In undertaking that task, we are mindful that, on the\n\nfacts of this case, the question whether XYZ has waived the\n\nattorney-client       privilege    is    governed   by   federal   common   law.\n\nUnited States v. Rakes, 136 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nIII.     ANALYSIS\n\n             Despite a grand jury's vaunted right to every man's\n\nevidence,       it   must,   nevertheless,     respect    a   valid   claim    of\n\nprivilege.       United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 346 (1974).\n\nBut the party who invokes the privilege bears the burden of\n\nestablishing that it applies to the communications at issue and\n\nthat it has not been waived.            See State of Maine v. United States\n\nDep't of the Interior, 298 F.3d 60, 71 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Bollin, 264 F.3d 391, 412 (4th Cir. 2001).                  Thus, XYZ\n\nmust carry the devoir of persuasion here.\n\n            The attorney-client privilege is well-established and its\n\nrationale straightforward.         By safeguarding communications between\n\nclient    and    lawyer,     the   privilege   encourages     full    and   free\n\ndiscussion, better enabling the client to conform his conduct to\n\nthe dictates of the law and to present legitimate claims and\n\ndefenses if litigation ensues.            See Upjohn Co. v. United States,\n\n449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).          Still, the privilege is not limitless,\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fand courts must take care to apply it only to the extent necessary\n\nto achieve its underlying goals.              In re Grand Jury Subpoena\n\n(Custodian of Records, Newparent, Inc.), 274 F.3d 563, 571 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).      In other words, the attorney-client privilege must be\n\nnarrowly construed because it comes with substantial costs and\n\nstands as an obstacle of sorts to the search for truth.                See United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709-10 (1974).\n\n            The dimensions of the privilege itself are reasonably\n\nwell honed.      The privilege protects only those communications that\n\nare confidential and are made for the purpose of seeking or\n\nreceiving legal advice.         See Bollin, 264 F.3d at 412; see also 8\n\nJohn Henry Wigmore, Evidence § 2292, at 554 (John T. McNaughton ed.\n\n1961).     The idea that the attorney-client privilege may be waived\n\nis a direct outgrowth of this well-established construction.                   When\n\notherwise privileged communications are disclosed to a third party,\n\nthe   disclosure     destroys    the    confidentiality        upon    which    the\n\nprivilege is      premised.      See 2     Paul   R.   Rice,   Attorney-Client\n\nPrivilege in the U.S. § 9:79, at 357 (2d ed. 1999).\n\n            Waivers come in various sizes and shapes. The easy cases\n\ntend to be those of express waiver.           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nLussier,    71   F.3d   456,   462   (2d   Cir.   1995);   United      States   v.\n\nKingston, 971 F.2d 481, 490 (10th Cir. 1992); Catino v. Travelers\n\nIns. Co., 136 F.R.D. 534, 536-37 (D. Mass. 1991).                        The more\n\ndifficult cases tend to involve implied waivers.                      While it is\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fgenerally accepted that conduct can serve to waive the attorney-\n\nclient privilege by implication,         see, e.g., Jack B. Weinstein &\n\nMargaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 503.41 (Joseph\n\nM. McLaughlin ed. 1997) (collecting cases), the case law does not\n\noffer much assistance as to how broadly such implied waivers sweep.\n\nLike most courts, this court has yet to develop a jurisprudence\n\nclarifying the scope of such implied waivers. See United States v.\n\nDesir, 273 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          In approaching these unanswered questions, we start with\n\nthe unarguable proposition that the attorney-client privilege is\n\nhighly valued.    Accordingly, courts should be cautious about\n\nfinding implied waivers.    See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219\n\nF.3d 175, 186 (2d Cir. 2000).       Claims of implied waiver must be\n\nevaluated in light of principles of logic and fairness.          See 2\n\nRice, supra § 9:79, at 357.      That evaluation demands a fastidious\n\nsifting of the facts and a careful weighing of the circumstances.\n\nDesir, 273 F.3d at 45-46.   Considering the need for this precise,\n\nfact-specific tamisage, it is not surprising that the case law\n\nreveals few genuine instances of implied waiver.         See 8 Wigmore,\n\nsupra § 2327, at 635.\n\n                            A.    The Call.\n\n          With these considerations in mind, we turn first to the\n\ngovernment's contention that XYZ impliedly waived the attorney-\n\nclient privilege when it \"sought, obtained, and discussed legal\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fadvice\" from Barrister in the presence of outsiders.                 Appellee's\n\nBr. at 26.     The district court not only found such a waiver but\n\nalso concluded that it extended, without limit of time, to all past\n\nand future communications on the subject matters discussed during\n\nthe call.     We think that the court erred as a matter of law in\n\nmaking these determinations.\n\n             For   the   attorney-client     privilege    to    attach     to   a\n\ncommunication, it must have been made in confidence and for the\n\npurpose of securing or conveying legal advice. See Cavallaro, 284\n\nF.3d at 245; see also 8 Wigmore, supra § 2292, at 554.                      The\n\nprivilege evaporates the moment that confidentiality ceases to\n\nexist.   With isthmian exceptions not pertinent here, the presence\n\nof   third    parties     is   sufficient    to    undermine        the   needed\n\nconfidentiality.     See 8 Wigmore, supra § 2311, at 601-03 & nn. 6-8\n\n(collecting cases).         So here:      XYZ knew that third parties —\n\nrepresentatives of Smallco — were participating in the call. Thus,\n\nit could not have had any expectation of confidentiality as to\n\nmatters discussed        therein.   The    lack   of   such    an   expectation\n\nshattered the necessary confidentiality. See In re San Juan Dupont\n\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litig., 859 F.2d 1007, 1016 n.6 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n(\"Absent an expectation of confidentiality, none accrues.\").\n\n             The short of it is that Barrister, regardless of his\n\nprofessional relationship with XYZ, did not provide confidential\n\nadvice during the call but, rather, merely helped to advocate XYZ's\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fposition to its co-venturer. Consequently, the communications made\n\nduring the call were not confidential (and, therefore, not subject\n\nto a colorable claim of privilege).\n\n           The fact that no privilege attached to the call brings\n\nthe government's waiver argument into sharper focus. It is crystal\n\nclear that any previously privileged information actually revealed\n\nduring the call lost any veneer of privilege.         See, e.g., von Bulow\n\nv. von Bulow (In re von Bulow), 828 F.2d 94, 102-03 (2d Cir. 1987);\n\nIn re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 817-18 (D.C. Cir. 1982).          XYZ does\n\nnot contest the occurrence of such a waiver (indeed, it never\n\nlisted the call on its privilege log).               Rather, the bone of\n\ncontention is whether that waiver had a ripple effect, i.e.,\n\nwhether   it   reached   anything    beyond   that   which   was   actually\n\ndisclosed.     We think not.\n\n           There was no express waiver, so the question is one of\n\nimplied waiver.     It is well accepted that waivers by implication\n\ncan sometimes extend beyond the matter actually revealed.              See,\n\ne.g., In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d at 182-83; Sedco\n\nInt'l, S.A. v. Cory, 683 F.2d 1201, 1206 (8th Cir. 1982).             Such\n\nwaivers are almost invariably premised on fairness concerns.           See\n\nvon Bulow, 828 F.2d at 101-03. As one respected treatise explains,\n\n\"[t]he courts have identified a common denominator in waiver by\n\nimplication:     in each case, the party asserting the privilege\n\nplaced protected information in issue for personal benefit through\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fsome affirmative act, and the court found that to allow the\n\nprivilege to protect against disclosure of that information\" would\n\nhave been unfair to the opposing party.                 3 Weinstein, supra §\n\n503.41[1].     See also Sedco, 683 F.2d at 1206 (noting that courts\n\nhave found waiver by implication when a client (i) testifies\n\nconcerning    portions    of   an    attorney-client     communication,   (ii)\n\nplaces the attorney-client relationship itself at issue, or (iii)\n\nasserts reliance on an attorney's advice as an element of a claim\n\nor defense).\n\n            A paradigmatic example of this phenomenon is a case\n\ninvolving an advice of counsel defense.                When such a defense is\n\nraised, the pleader puts the nature of its lawyer's advice squarely\n\nin issue, and, thus, communications embodying the subject matter of\n\nthe advice typically lose protection.           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nBilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir. 1991).             Implying a subject\n\nmatter waiver in such a case ensures fairness because it disables\n\nlitigants from using the attorney-client privilege as both a sword\n\nand a shield. Were the law otherwise, the client could selectively\n\ndisclose fragments helpful to its cause, entomb other (unhelpful)\n\nfragments, and in that way kidnap the truth-seeking process.\n\n             Virtually every reported instance of an implied waiver\n\nextending    to    an   entire      subject   matter    involves   a   judicial\n\ndisclosure, that is, a disclosure made in the course of a judicial\n\nproceeding.       See von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 103 (collecting cases).\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fThis uniformity is not mere happenstance; it exists because such a\n\nlimitation makes eminently good sense.                     Accordingly, we hold, as a\n\nmatter of first impression in this circuit, that the extrajudicial\n\ndisclosure of attorney-client communications, not thereafter used\n\nby    the   client      to    gain     adversarial           advantage     in    judicial\n\nproceedings, cannot work an implied waiver of all confidential\n\ncommunications on the same subject matter.                       Accord von Bulow, 828\n\nF.2d at 102-03; Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States, 54 Fed.\n\nCl. 306, 316 (2002).\n\n            The rationale behind our holding is self-evident.                         When\n\nan    attorney        participates      in      an     extrajudicial        meeting     or\n\nnegotiation, his participation alone does not justify implying a\n\nbroad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\nThere is a qualitative difference between offering testimony at\n\ntrial or asserting an advice of counsel defense in litigation, on\n\nthe   one    hand,      and    engaging      in      negotiations         with   business\n\nassociates,      on    the    other    hand.         In    the   former    setting,    the\n\nlikelihood of prejudice looms:                 once a litigant chooses to put\n\nprivileged communications at issue, only the revelation of all\n\nrelated exchanges will allow the truth-seeking process to function\n\nunimpeded.       In the latter scenario, however, such concerns are\n\nabsent. The party has introduced its lawyer into the negotiations,\n\nbut that act, in and of itself, does nothing to cause prejudice to\n\nthe    opposition       or     to     subvert        the     truth-seeking       process.\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fFurthermore, a rule that would allow broad subject matter waivers\n\nto be implied from such communications would provide perverse\n\nincentives:          parties would leave attorneys out of commercial\n\nnegotiations for fear that their inclusion would later force\n\nwholesale disclosure of confidential information.                        This would\n\nstrike at the heart of the attorney-client relationship — and would\n\ndo   so     despite      the   absence   of    any   eclipsing      reason    for   the\n\nimplication of a waiver.            Where a party has not thrust a partial\n\ndisclosure        into   ongoing    litigation,      fairness      concerns   neither\n\nrequire      nor    permit     massive   breaching     of    the     attorney-client\n\nprivilege.6        See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d at 188-89\n\n(finding no broad waiver when disclosure occurred in grand jury\n\ntestimony and government did not show sufficient prejudice).\n\n              Viewed      against   this      backdrop,     the   district    court's\n\nturnover order cannot be sustained.              Although plotting the precise\n\nline       that    separates    judicial      disclosures     from    extrajudicial\n\ndisclosures sometimes can be difficult, no such difficulties are\n\npresented here.          The call took place entirely outside the judicial\n\n\n\n       6\n      Nothing in this opinion is intended to suggest that\nextrajudicial disclosures can never work an implied waiver of\nanything beyond that which actually was disclosed. But such cases\nwill be rare, and the scope of any ensuing waiver will be narrow.\nSee von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 102 n.1. For today, it suffices that\nthe government has neither argued for a narrow waiver nor\nidentified any particular document to which such a waiver might\nextend. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990) (explaining that arguments not made in a party's briefs need\nnot be considered).\n\n                                         -16-\n\fcontext.   The parties to it were co-venturers bent on ironing out\n\nwrinkles and reaching a joint business decision.        Given these\n\nfacts, it would be fanciful to suggest that the disclosures cited\n\nby the government were made in anticipation of litigation.\n\n           That gets the grease from the goose.    Because the call\n\nwas plainly extrajudicial, the district court erred in using it as\n\na fulcrum for the implication of a broad subject matter waiver of\n\nthe attorney-client privilege.     See von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 103;\n\nElectro Scientific Indus. v. Gen. Scanning, Inc., 175 F.R.D. 539,\n\n543-44 (N.D. Cal. 1997).\n\n           The government argues that even extrajudicial disclosures\n\nshould be given broad scope when the waiving party seeks later to\n\nuse that disclosure to its advantage.       We agree in part:    if\n\nconfidential information is revealed in an extrajudicial context\n\nand later reused in a judicial setting, the circumstances of the\n\ninitial disclosure will not immunize the client against a claim of\n\nwaiver. See Electro Scientific, 175 F.R.D. at 544 (explaining that\n\na past extrajudicial disclosure will not cause any prejudice in\n\nsubsequent litigation as long as the disclosing party \"does not try\n\nto use [the disclosure] in this litigation\"); cf. United States v.\n\nWorkman, 138 F.3d 1261, 1263-64 (8th Cir. 1998) (finding subject\n\nmatter waiver after client placed attorney's advice in issue in\n\ncourt case).   The key is that the subsequent disclosure, on its\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fown, would suffice to waive the privilege.    Here, however, XYZ has\n\nnot made use of the call in any judicial proceeding.7\n\n          At the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that a\n\nprospective waiver will very rarely be warranted in extrajudicial\n\ndisclosure   cases.   Courts   have   generally   allowed   prospective\n\nwaivers in discrete and limited situations, almost invariably\n\ninvolving advice of counsel defenses.     See, e.g., Minn. Specialty\n\nCrops, Inc. v. Minn. Wild Hockey Club, 210 F.R.D. 673, 679 (D.\n\nMinn. 2002); Chiron Corp. v. Genentech, Inc., 179 F. Supp. 2d 1182,\n\n1187 (E.D. Cal. 2001).   Every case the government cites in support\n\nof the district court's imposition of a prospective waiver involves\n\nprecisely this scenario.   See Minn. Specialty Crops, 210 F.R.D. at\n\n679 (finding a prospective waiver effected “by the adoption of [an]\n\nadvice-of-counsel defense\"); Chiron Corp., 179 F. Supp. 2d at 1188\n\n(same); Gabriel Capital, L.P. v. Natwest Finance, Inc., No. 99-\n\nCiv.-10488, 2001 WL 1132050, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2001)\n\n(same); Dunhall Pharms., Inc. v. Discus Dental, Inc., 994 F. Supp.\n\n1202, 1209 n.3 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (finding subject matter waiver\n\nthroughout the time period of alleged patent infringement when\n\nputative infringer asserted advice of counsel defense); see also\n\nGlenmede Trust Co. v. Thompson, 56 F.3d 476, 486 (3d Cir. 1995)\n\n(finding broad waiver where advice of counsel defense had been\n\n\n     7\n      To the extent that the government implies that XYZ used the\ncall in its pre-indictment proffers, that argument fails for the\nreasons discussed in Part III(B), infra.\n\n                                -18-\n\fasserted); Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Travenol Labs., Inc., 676 F.\n\nSupp. 831, 832 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (same).\n\n          Enforcing a prospective waiver in such a case makes\n\nsense:   once a litigant puts the legal advice given to him at\n\nissue, the opposing party should be entitled to all the information\n\non that same subject regardless of when it was compiled.                This\n\nensures that a litigant is not able to present only selected bits\n\nof the story and thus distort the truth-seeking process.         The case\n\nat hand is not one in which an advice of counsel defense has been\n\nasserted — indeed, there is no pending proceeding to serve as a\n\nvehicle for such a defense — and no such ends would be served by\n\nimplying a broad prospective waiver.\n\n                B.   Presentations to the Government.\n\n          Our   odyssey   is   not    yet   finished.   Even   though    the\n\ndistrict court did not reach the issue, the government invites us\n\nto consider, as an alternative basis on which to uphold the\n\nturnover order, its argument that XYZ's pre-indictment proffers\n\nwaived the attorney-client privilege.         See Intergen N.V. v. Grina,\n\n344 F.3d 134, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 03-1056, slip op. at 13]\n\n(explaining that the court of appeals can affirm a judgment on any\n\nground made manifest by the record). The parties have briefed this\n\nissue, the facts pertaining to it are essentially uncontradicted,\n\nand an adjudication will expedite matters.        These factors convince\n\nus to accept the government's invitation.\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\f             Many years ago, Justice Holmes warned that those who deal\n\nwith the government must turn square corners.              Rock Island, Ark. &\n\nLa. R.R. Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 141, 143 (1920).                     That\n\nadvice cuts both ways:         those who deal with the government have a\n\nright to expect fair treatment in return.            The principle that the\n\ngovernment     must    turn    square      corners   in    dealing   with    its\n\nconstituents is dispositive here.\n\n             The facts are these.       At the time the government filed\n\nthe motion to compel, it had been engaged in discussions with XYZ\n\nfor over two years.         During that span, the government repeatedly\n\nhad requested that XYZ waive the attorney-client privilege vis-à-\n\nvis communications concerning the device's withdrawal from the\n\nmarket, and XYZ steadfastly had refused.                  When the government\n\nsought permission to audit the tape recording of the call, XYZ\n\nagreed on the express condition that leave \"was not to be viewed as\n\na   waiver     of     any     applicable      privilege    protecting       other\n\ncommunications.\"      The government acceded to this condition.\n\n             In February of 2002, government attorneys met with XYZ's\n\noutside   counsel     to    discuss   the    threatened    indictment   of    the\n\ncorporation and/or its officers.            The government acknowledges that\n\nit solicited a response from XYZ in hopes of gaining information so\n\nthat an indictment, if one eventuated, would be based on a fully\n\ninformed account of the product-withdrawal decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f            Initially, this solicitation went unheeded.                In late\n\nApril, however, the government wrote to XYZ's outside counsel,\n\nformally identifying the corporation as a target of the grand jury\n\ninvestigation.     That letter apparently got XYZ's attention.                The\n\nnext month, its counsel responded to the government's earlier\n\nrequest.    This epistle, dated May 10, 2002, began with a clear and\n\nexplicit statement, quoted supra note 3, that nothing contained\n\ntherein should be deemed a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe letter set forth various reasons why the government should\n\nforgo an indictment.     It contained only one glancing mention of an\n\nattorney-client    communication      —     a   reference   to   the   call   (a\n\ncommunication     to   which   the    attorney-client       privilege    never\n\nattached).    In all events, the government never replied either to\n\nthis letter or to the privilege reservation contained therein.\n\n             The May 10 letter advised the prosecutors that XYZ's\n\ncounsel would be sending additional material within the next few\n\nweeks in order to complete the response that the government had\n\nsolicited.     As promised, XYZ's counsel sent a follow-up letter\n\neleven days later.       This missive contained the same privilege\n\nreservation (again conspicuously displayed on the first page).                 In\n\nthe body of the letter, counsel discussed communications between\n\nXYZ and the FDA during September of 1998 (some of which involved\n\nBarrister).      Once again, the privilege reservation evoked no\n\nresponse.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            Both of counsel's letters referred to an anticipated\n\nmeeting with the government.             That meeting occurred on May 22,\n\n2002.   As the first order of business, XYZ's counsel renewed the\n\nprivilege reservation, stating that any disclosures made during the\n\nmeeting should not be interpreted as waiving the attorney-client\n\nprivilege.        The    government's      representatives          received   this\n\nannouncement in stony silence. XYZ's presentation proved fruitless\n\nand the colloquy between the parties apparently ground to a halt.\n\nThat was the state of affairs when the government endeavored to\n\nsubpoena the disputed documents.\n\n            The   government     now     claims     that    these    presentations\n\nresulted in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to the\n\nsubjects     discussed     therein.           But   the     circumstances,     and\n\nparticularly the government's own conduct, belie that claim.                    XYZ\n\nwas careful to condition each and every disclosure on a clearly\n\nstated privilege reservation.            The government did not raise the\n\nslightest    question    when    these    reservations       were    stated,   but,\n\nrather, kept the dialogue going and invited additional disclosures.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, we think that XYZ reasonably\n\ninterpreted the government's silence as an acceptance of the\n\nreservations.      Cf. McGurn v. Bell Microprods., Inc., 284 F.3d 86,\n\n90 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that silence can serve as acceptance of\n\na   condition     when   the    offeree,      despite      having    a   reasonable\n\nopportunity to reject the condition, takes the benefit of the offer\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fwithout saying anything); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §\n\n69(1)(a) (similar).\n\n             To be sure, the government now says that XYZ, if it\n\nwanted to guarantee preservation of the attorney-client privilege,\n\nshould have secured a written agreement to that effect.                    In the\n\nabsence of such a step, the government suggests, the unilaterally\n\nimposed privilege reservation was impuissant.           This argument lacks\n\nforce.\n\n             As we have said, in some cases silence can be the basis\n\nof acceptance.       See, e.g., McGurn, 284 F.3d at 90.         In this case,\n\nthe undisputed       facts   show   that   the   government    knew   of     XYZ's\n\nintention to operate under a privilege reservation from the time\n\nthat    it   first   secured    a   tape   recording   of     the   call.       It\n\nunquestionably accepted the reservation at that time.                  XYZ then\n\nrepeated the reservation on the occasion of each of the three\n\nsucceeding pre-indictment presentations (two written and one oral).\n\nThe government voiced no objection to the privilege reservation at\n\nany of these times.       Its silence encouraged (indeed, allowed) the\n\ndisclosures to go forward.\n\n             Here, moreover, the government does not deny that it knew\n\nof     the   oft-repeated      privilege    reservations.           Hence,     the\n\ngovernment's long delay in raising a claim of waiver is itself an\n\nindication of such knowledge.         See Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Digital\n\nIsland, Inc., Nos. 144, 149, 2002 WL 1285126, at *6 (N.D. Cal. May\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f30, 2002) (finding privilege reservation valid, in part because\n\nopposition waited eight months after supposed waiver before seeking\n\nto compel production of documents).                In turn, the     government's\n\nready acceptance of the proffers' benefits, notwithstanding its\n\nknowledge of the privilege reservations, makes its current position\n\nuntenable.        Cf. 3 A's Towing Co. v. P & A. Well Serv., Inc., 642\n\nF.2d 756, 758 n.3 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding ratification where delay\n\nin repudiating was long and failure to repudiate was \"accompanied\n\nby acts indicating approval . . . such as receiving and retaining\n\nthe benefits\").\n\n             In     short,     the     privilege     reservations      were   not\n\nunilaterally        imposed,    but,      rather,    were   accepted     by   the\n\ngovernment's consistent course of conduct.              That course of conduct\n\nsignaled clearly the government's intention to acquiesce in the\n\nprivilege     reservations.          We     conclude,   therefore,     that   the\n\nreservations were fully effective here.                 Having lured XYZ into\n\nmaking a series of proffers, the government cannot now be allowed\n\nto contradict that reasonable understanding by arguing, after the\n\nfact, that it never acceded to the reservations. Cf. United States\n\nv. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"Having one's cake\n\nand eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").\n\n            Although we ground this result in equitable principles,\n\nit also comports with sound policy.                 Arm's-length negotiations\n\nbetween the government and private parties, in advance of an\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\findictment, aid the truth-seeking process.          Such negotiations are\n\nto everybody's advantage.         They give potential defendants an\n\nopportunity to explain away suspicious circumstances, give the\n\ngovernment    an   opportunity   to    avoid   embarrassing    and   wasteful\n\nmistakes, and give the public a greater likelihood of a just\n\nresult.   Requiring the government to turn square corners in such\n\nnegotiations will make potential defendants more willing to deal\n\nwith the government in the future.           Conversely, refusing to hold\n\nthe government to such a standard will send a signal to future\n\nlitigants to negotiate with the government only at their peril.\n\nThat is not a message that we wish to send — nor is it one that\n\nwould serve the government's interests.\n\n          In a perfect world, of course, XYZ would have secured a\n\nwritten acknowledgment of its privilege reservation in advance of\n\neach and every disclosure.       But XYZ did secure one such written\n\nacknowledgment, and its failure to do so on subsequent occasions is\n\nclearly outweighed by two facts:         (i) it repeatedly set forth its\n\nposition, and (ii) the government failed to question the privilege\n\nreservation in a timely manner.          Under the circumstances of this\n\ncase, we find that the proffers were made in the course of ongoing\n\nplea negotiations; that XYZ explicitly reserved all claims of\n\nattorney-client privilege with respect thereto; that the government\n\neffectively    acquiesced   in   these       reservations;    and    that   the\n\ngovernment is bound by them.            Consequently, XYZ reserved the\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fattorney-client    privilege   by     means   of   its   pre-indictment\n\npresentations.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.8   We hold that XYZ's extrajudicial\n\ndisclosure did not give rise, by implication, to a broad subject\n\nmatter waiver.     We further hold that the government's seeming\n\nacquiescence in XYZ's privilege reservations precludes any claim\n\nthat XYZ's pre-indictment presentations worked a waiver of any\n\napplicable privilege.    Accordingly, we reverse the order appealed\n\nfrom, vacate the contempt citation, and remand to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.\n\n\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      In view of the fact that the attorney-client privilege\nremains intact, we need not address the work-product doctrine. Nor\ndo we need to reach the government's contention that the inadequate\ndetail on the privilege logs resulted in a waiver. If this is a\nline of attack that the government wishes to pursue, the district\ncourt should consider it in the first instance.\n\n                                 -26-\n\f",

These appeals, which require us to answer delicate questions concerning implied waivers of the privilege, bear witness to that point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeals have their genesis in an investigatory subpoena duces tecum issued by a federal grand jury (we use the adjective \"investigatory\" because no indictments have yet eventuated from the grand jury probe). The subpoenaed party, a corporation, refused to produce certain of the requested documents on the ground that they were shielded by the attorney-client and work-product privileges. The government sought to compel production, contending that any attendant privilege had been waived. The district court, eschewing an evidentiary hearing, ordered the corporation to produce the documents and cited it for contempt when it declined to do so. These appeals &#8212; there are two because the corporation filed a notice of appeal after the court ordered production of the withheld documents and another after the court adjudged it in contempt &#8212; followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration, we conclude that the record fails to support the lower court's finding of a broad subject matter waiver. Accordingly, we reverse the turnover order and vacate the contempt citation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with an abbreviated account of the events leading to the turnover order. Consistent with the secrecy that typically attaches to grand jury matters, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e), these appeals have gone forward under an order sealing the briefs, the parties' proffers, and other pertinent portions of the record. To preserve that confidentiality, we use fictitious names for all affected parties and furnish only such background facts as are necessary to provide ambiance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1998, XYZ Corporation (XYZ) began distributing a neoteric medical device. Soon after distribution began, XYZ learned that, on some occasions, the device was not functioning properly. It conducted an internal investigation and sought the advice of outside counsel to determine an appropriate course of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairly short order, XYZ made a preliminary decision to withdraw the device from the market (at least temporarily). Before doing so, however, XYZ's existing supply agreement obligated it to consult with its co-venturer, Smallco. Representatives of the two companies conferred telephonically. The participants in that discussion included two officers of XYZ, outside counsel for XYZ (Bernard Barrister), the principals of Smallco, and Smallco's medical advisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> During this conversation, which we shall hereafter refer to as \"the call,\" Barrister advocated XYZ's position in the face of strong counter-arguments from the Smallco hierarchs (who wished to keep the device on the market). Unbeknownst to XYZ, Smallco recorded the call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, XYZ contacted the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) to discuss the emerging problems. A dialogue ensued. Less than one month after its initial contact with the FDA, XYZ voluntarily withdrew the device from the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Justice got wind of what had transpired and commenced an investigation into the distribution of the device. As part of this probe, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena requiring XYZ to produce an array of documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> XYZ withheld certain of the documents, instead producing privilege logs indexing what had been retained and the claims of privilege applicable thereto. As early as April of 2001, the government requested XYZ to waive its claims of privilege. XYZ refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 2001, the government obtained a tape recording of the call. The government thereafter asked XYZ for permission to audit the tape. XYZ replied that it would not seek to prevent the government from listening but admonished that this decision should not be viewed as a waiver of any privilege protecting other communications. The government agreed &#8212; in writing &#8212; to this condition. The investigation continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 2002, federal prosecutors met with XYZ's new outside counsel to inform XYZ of the direction of their investigation. Pursuant to the request of a government attorney, XYZ's counsel authored two letters responding to concerns voiced at the February meeting. Each contained a footnote on the first page stating explicitly that the letter should not be construed as a waiver of the attorney-client or work-product privileges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Following this correspondence, representatives of XYZ again met with the prosecutors to discuss the possible indictment of XYZ and/or its officers. This meeting took place in May of 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2003 &#8212; after persistently requesting a voluntary waiver of the attorney-client privilege for two full years &#8212; the government changed its tune. It repaired to the federal district court and filed a motion to compel production of the disputed documents. In its motion, the government argued in effect that XYZ already had waived the attorney-client privilege as to the most important documents described in the subpoena. The motion asserted that, during the call, Barrister had given legal advice in the presence of third parties and had disclosed legal advice previously provided to XYZ. In the government's view, this conduct effected a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to all communications anent the marketing and withdrawal of the device for a period extending from August 12, 1998 to October 8, 1998. As a fallback, the government asseverated that XYZ had waived the attorney-client privilege by means of the pre-indictment presentations made in response to the prosecutors' requests. To close the circle, the government maintained that the work-product doctrine, if applicable at all, likewise had been waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, acting ex parte, granted the motion to compel. In a four-sentence order, the court ruled that XYZ had \"waived its attorney-client privilege with respect to the subject matter of the [call].\" When the government moved for an expedited hearing to clarify the order and XYZ sought reconsideration, the district court again acted summarily. Without either conducting an evidentiary hearing or entertaining argument, it ruled <i>ore sponte</i> that XYZ's waiver of the attorney-client privilege applied both retrospectively (i.e., to communications before the call relating to the \"same matter\") and prospectively (i.e., to communications after the call relating to the \"same matter\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its bench decision, the district court went well beyond the three-month waiver window envisioned by the government; it declared, in effect, that the waiver was to operate without limit of time (indeed, the court noted, as to future communications, that the waiver would have effect \"so long as people are talking about that same subject,\" and might apply up to the time of trial). The court exempted from the waiver any attorney-client communications about the waiver issue itself and provided guidance as to the scope of the waiver by referring to the \"doctrine of completeness.\" The court declined to resolve any additional issues, stating that it would cross those bridges as the need arose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the district court's order, XYZ refused to produce the documents. The district court held the corporation in contempt (thus brushing aside, inter alia, its claim of a work-product privilege),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but stayed further proceedings pending appellate review. We have jurisdiction over the ensuing appeals because XYZ subjected itself to a citation for contempt. <i>See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas,</i> 123 F.3d 695, 696-97 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On an appeal concerning a claim of privilege, the standard of review depends on the precise issue being litigated. <i>See Cavallaro v. United States,</i> 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 129 F.3d 681, 683 (1st Cir.1997). We review rulings on questions of law de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and judgment calls &#8212; such as evidentiary determinations &#8212; for abuse of discretion. <i>Cavallaro,</i> 284 F.3d at 245. The standard of review is not altered by the fact that the district court granted the motion without much elaboration of its thinking. <i>FDIC v. Ogden Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir.2000). \"Although a lower court's elucidation of its reasoning invariably eases the appellate task, motions often are decided summarily.... [W]e are aware of no authority that would allow us automatically to vary the standard of review depending on whether a district court has taken the time to explain its rationale.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these background principles in mind, we proceed to the merits. In undertaking that task, we are mindful that, on the facts of this case, the question whether XYZ has waived the attorney-client privilege is governed by federal common law. <i>United States v. Rakes,</i> 136 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite a grand jury's vaunted right to every man's evidence, it must, nevertheless, respect a valid claim of privilege. <i>United States v. Calandra,</i> 414 U.S. 338, 346, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). But the party who invokes the privilege bears the burden of establishing that it applies to the communications at issue and that it has not been waived. <i>See State of Maine v. United States Dep't of the Interior,</i> 298 F.3d 60, 71 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Bollin,</i> 264 F.3d 391, 412 (4th Cir.2001). Thus, XYZ must carry the devoir of persuasion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attorney-client privilege is well-established and its rationale straightforward. By safeguarding communications between client and lawyer, the privilege encourages full and free discussion, better enabling the client to conform his conduct to the dictates of the law and to present legitimate claims and defenses if litigation ensues. <i>See Upjohn Co. v. United States,</i> 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). Still, the privilege is not limitless, and courts must take care to apply it only to the extent necessary to achieve its underlying goals. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Custodian of Records, Newparent, Inc.),</i> 274 F.3d 563, 571 (1st Cir.2001). In other words, the attorney-client privilege must be narrowly construed because it comes with substantial costs and stands as an obstacle of sorts to the search for truth. <i>See United States v. Nixon,</i> 418 U.S. 683, 709-10, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dimensions of the privilege itself are reasonably well honed. The privilege protects only those communications that are confidential and are made for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice. <i>See Bollin,</i> 264 F.3d at 412; <i>see also</i> 8 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2292, at 554 (John T. McNaughton ed. 1961). The idea that the attorney-client privilege may be waived is a direct outgrowth of this well-established construction. When otherwise privileged communications are disclosed to a third party, the disclosure destroys the confidentiality upon which the privilege is premised. <i>See</i> 2 Paul R. Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the U.S. &#167; 9:79, at 357 (2d ed. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waivers come in various sizes and shapes. The easy cases tend to be those of express waiver. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Lussier,</i> 71 F.3d 456, 462 (2d Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Kingston,</i> 971 F.2d 481, 490 (10th Cir.1992); <i>Catino v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</i> 136 F.R.D. 534, 536-37 (D.Mass. 1991). The more difficult cases tend to involve implied waivers. While it is generally accepted that conduct can serve to waive the attorney-client privilege by implication, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 503.41 (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed.1997) (collecting cases), the case law does not offer much assistance as to how broadly such implied waivers sweep. Like most courts, this court has yet to develop a jurisprudence clarifying the scope of such implied waivers. <i>See United States v. Desir,</i> 273 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In approaching these unanswered questions, we start with the unarguable proposition that the attorney-client privilege is highly valued. Accordingly, courts should be cautious about finding implied waivers. <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 219 F.3d 175, 186 (2d Cir.2000). Claims of implied waiver must be evaluated in light of principles of logic and fairness. <i>See</i> 2 Rice, <i>supra</i> &#167; 9:79, at 357. That evaluation demands a fastidious sifting of the facts and a careful weighing of the circumstances. <i>Desir,</i> 273 F.3d at 45-46. Considering the need for this precise, fact-specific tamisage, it is not surprising that the case law reveals few genuine instances of implied waiver. <i>See</i> 8 Wigmore, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2327, at 635.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Call.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these considerations in mind, we turn first to the government's contention that XYZ impliedly waived the attorney-client privilege when it \"sought, obtained, and discussed legal advice\" from Barrister in the presence of outsiders. Appellee's Br. at 26. The district court not only found such a waiver but also concluded that it extended, without limit of time, to all past and future communications on the subject matters discussed during the call. We think that the court erred as a matter of law in making these determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the attorney-client privilege to attach to a communication, it must have been made in confidence and for the purpose of securing or conveying legal advice. <i>See Cavallaro,</i> 284 F.3d at 245; <i>see also</i> 8 Wigmore, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2292, at 554. The privilege evaporates the moment that confidentiality ceases to exist. With isthmian exceptions not pertinent here, the presence of third parties is sufficient to undermine the needed confidentiality. <i>See</i> 8 Wigmore, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2311, at 601-03 &amp; nn. 6-8 (collecting cases). So here: XYZ knew that third parties &#8212; representatives of Smallco &#8212; were participating in the call. Thus, it could not have had any expectation of confidentiality as to matters discussed therein. The lack of such an expectation shattered the necessary confidentiality. <i>See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 859 F.2d 1007, 1016 n. 6 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Absent an expectation of confidentiality, none accrues.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that Barrister, regardless of his professional relationship with XYZ, did not provide confidential advice during the call but, rather, merely helped to advocate XYZ's position to its co-venturer. Consequently, the communications made during the call were not confidential (and, therefore, not subject to a colorable claim of privilege).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that no privilege attached to the call brings the government's waiver argument into sharper focus. It is crystal clear that any previously privileged information actually revealed during the call lost any veneer of privilege. <i>See, e.g., von Bulow v. von Bulow (In re von Bulow),</i> 828 F.2d 94, 102-03 (2d Cir.1987); <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> 676 F.2d 793, 817-18 (D.C.Cir.1982). XYZ does not contest the occurrence of such a waiver (indeed, it never listed the call on its privilege log). Rather, the bone of contention is whether that waiver had a ripple effect, i.e., whether it reached anything beyond that which was actually disclosed. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no express waiver, so the question is one of implied waiver. It is well accepted that waivers by implication can sometimes extend beyond the matter actually revealed. <i>See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 219 F.3d at 182-83; <i>Sedco Int'l, S.A. v. Cory,</i> 683 F.2d 1201, 1206 (8th Cir.1982). Such waivers are almost invariably premised on fairness concerns. <i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 101-03. As one respected treatise explains, \"[t]he courts have identified a common denominator in waiver by implication: in each case, the party asserting the privilege placed protected information in issue for personal benefit through some affirmative act, and the court found that to allow the privilege to protect against disclosure of that information\" would have been unfair to the opposing party. 3 Weinstein, <i>supra</i> &#167; 503.41[1]. <i>See also Sedco,</i> 683 F.2d at 1206 (noting that courts have found waiver by implication when a client (i) testifies concerning portions of an attorney-client communication, (ii) places the attorney-client relationship itself at issue, or (iii) asserts reliance on an attorney's advice as an element of a claim or defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A paradigmatic example of this phenomenon is a case involving an advice of counsel defense. When such a defense is raised, the pleader puts the nature of its lawyer's advice squarely in issue, and, thus, communications embodying the subject matter of the advice typically lose protection. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bilzerian,</i> 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir.1991). Implying a subject matter waiver in such a case ensures fairness because it disables litigants from using the attorney-client privilege as both a sword and a shield. Were the law otherwise, the client could selectively disclose fragments helpful to its cause, entomb other (unhelpful) fragments, and in that way kidnap the truth-seeking process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually every reported instance of an implied waiver extending to an entire subject matter involves a judicial disclosure, that is, a disclosure made in the course of a judicial proceeding. <i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 103 (collecting cases). This uniformity is not mere happenstance; it exists because such a limitation makes eminently good sense. Accordingly, we hold, as a matter of first impression in this circuit, that the extrajudicial disclosure of attorney-client communications, not thereafter used by the client to gain adversarial advantage in judicial proceedings, cannot work an implied waiver of all confidential communications on the same subject matter. <i>Accord von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 102-03; <i>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States,</i> 54 Fed. Cl. 306, 316 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale behind our holding is self-evident. When an attorney participates in an extrajudicial meeting or negotiation, his participation alone does not justify implying a broad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege. There is a qualitative difference between offering testimony at trial or asserting an advice of counsel defense in litigation, on the one hand, and engaging in negotiations with business associates, on the other hand. In the former setting, the likelihood of prejudice looms: once a litigant chooses to put privileged communications at issue, only the revelation of all related exchanges will allow the truth-seeking process to function unimpeded. In the latter scenario, however, such concerns are absent. The party has introduced its lawyer into the negotiations, but that act, in and of itself, does nothing to cause prejudice to the opposition or to subvert the truth-seeking process. Furthermore, a rule that would allow broad subject matter waivers to be implied from such communications would provide perverse incentives: parties would leave attorneys out of commercial negotiations for fear that their inclusion would later force wholesale disclosure of confidential information. This would strike at the heart of the attorney-client relationship &#8212; and would do so despite the absence of any eclipsing reason for the implication of a waiver. Where a party has not thrust a partial disclosure into ongoing litigation, fairness concerns neither require nor permit massive breaching of the attorney-client privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 219 F.3d at 188-89 (finding no broad waiver when disclosure occurred in grand jury testimony and government did not show sufficient prejudice).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, the district court's turnover order cannot be sustained. Although plotting the precise line that separates judicial disclosures from extrajudicial disclosures sometimes can be difficult, no such difficulties are presented here. The call took place entirely outside the judicial context. The parties to it were co-venturers bent on ironing out wrinkles and reaching a joint business decision. Given these facts, it would be fanciful to suggest that the disclosures cited by the government were made in anticipation of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That gets the grease from the goose. Because the call was plainly extrajudicial, the district court erred in using it as a fulcrum for the implication of a broad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege. <i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 103; <i>Electro Scientific Indus. v. Gen. Scanning, Inc.,</i> 175 F.R.D. 539, 543-44 (N.D.Cal. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that even extrajudicial disclosures should be given broad scope when the waiving party seeks later to use that disclosure to its advantage. We agree in part: if confidential information is revealed in an extrajudicial context and later reused in a judicial setting, the circumstances of the initial disclosure will not immunize the client against a claim of waiver. <i>See Electro Scientific,</i> 175 F.R.D. at 544 (explaining that a past extrajudicial disclosure will not cause any prejudice in subsequent litigation as long as the disclosing party \"does not try to use [the disclosure] in this litigation\"); <i>cf. United States v. Workman,</i> 138 F.3d 1261, 1263-64 (8th Cir.1998) (finding subject matter waiver after client placed attorney's advice in issue in court case). The key is that the subsequent disclosure, <i>on its own,</i> would suffice to waive the privilege. Here, however, XYZ has not made use of the call in any judicial proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that a <i>prospective</i> waiver will very rarely be warranted in extrajudicial disclosure cases. Courts have generally allowed prospective waivers in discrete and limited situations, almost invariably involving advice of counsel defenses. <i>See, e.g., Minn. Specialty Crops, Inc. v. Minn. Wild Hockey Club,</i> 210 F.R.D. 673, 679 (D.Minn. 2002); <i>Chiron Corp. v. Genentech, Inc.,</i> 179 F.Supp.2d 1182, 1187 (E.D.Cal.2001). Every case the government cites in support of the district court's imposition of a prospective waiver involves precisely this scenario. <i>See Minn. Specialty Crops,</i> 210 F.R.D. at 679 (finding a prospective waiver effected \"by the adoption of [an] advice-of-counsel defense\"); <i>Chiron Corp.,</i> 179 F.Supp.2d at 1188 (same); <i>Gabriel Capital, L.P. v. Natwest Finance, Inc.,</i> No. 99-Civ.-10488, 2001 WL 1132050, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2001) (same); <i>Dunhall Pharms., Inc. v. Discus Dental, Inc.,</i> 994 F.Supp. 1202, 1209 n. 3 (C.D.Cal.1998) (finding subject matter waiver throughout the time period of alleged patent infringement when putative infringer asserted advice of counsel defense); <i>see also Glenmede Trust Co. v. Thompson,</i> 56 F.3d 476, 486 (3d Cir.1995) (finding broad waiver where advice of counsel defense had been asserted); <i>Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Travenol Labs., Inc.,</i> 676 F.Supp. 831, 832 (N.D.Ill. 1987) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enforcing a prospective waiver in such a case makes sense: once a litigant puts the legal advice given to him at issue, the opposing party should be entitled to all the information on that same subject regardless of when it was compiled. This ensures that a litigant is not able to present only selected bits of the story and thus distort the truth-seeking process. The case at hand is not one in which an advice of counsel defense has been asserted &#8212; indeed, there is no pending proceeding to serve as a vehicle for such a defense &#8212; and no such ends would be served by implying a broad prospective waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Presentations to the Government.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our odyssey is not yet finished. Even though the district court did not reach the issue, the government invites us to consider, as an alternative basis on which to uphold the turnover order, its argument that XYZ's pre-indictment proffers waived the attorney-client privilege. <i>See Intergen N.V. v. Grina,</i> 344 F.3d 134, 142 (1st Cir.2003) [slip op. at 13] (explaining that the court of appeals can affirm a judgment on any ground made manifest by the record). The parties have briefed this issue, the facts pertaining to it are essentially uncontradicted, and an adjudication will expedite matters. These factors convince us to accept the government's invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many years ago, Justice Holmes warned that those who deal with the government must turn square corners. <i>Rock Island, Ark. &amp; La. R.R. Co. v. United States,</i> 254 U.S. 141, 143, 41 S.Ct. 55, 65 L.Ed. 188 (1920). That advice cuts both ways: those who deal with the government have a right to expect fair treatment in return. The principle that the government must turn square corners in dealing with its constituents is dispositive here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these. At the time the government filed the motion to compel, it had been engaged in discussions with XYZ for over two years. During that span, the government repeatedly had requested that XYZ waive the attorney-client privilege vis-&#224;-vis communications concerning the device's withdrawal from the market, and XYZ steadfastly had refused. When the government sought permission to audit the tape recording of the call, XYZ agreed on the express condition that leave \"was not to be viewed as a waiver of any applicable privilege protecting other communications.\" The government acceded to this condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 2002, government attorneys met with XYZ's outside counsel to discuss the threatened indictment of the corporation and/or its officers. The government acknowledges that it solicited a response from XYZ in hopes of gaining information so that an indictment, if one eventuated, would be based on a fully informed account of the product-withdrawal decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, this solicitation went unheeded. In late April, however, the government wrote to XYZ's outside counsel, formally identifying the corporation as a target of the grand jury investigation. That letter apparently got XYZ's attention. The next month, its counsel responded to the government's earlier request. This epistle, dated May 10, 2002, began with a clear and explicit statement, quoted <i>supra</i> note 3, that nothing contained therein should be deemed a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. The letter set forth various reasons why the government should forgo an indictment. It contained only one glancing mention of an attorney-client communication &#8212; a reference to the call (a communication to which the attorney-client privilege never attached). In all events, the government never replied either to this letter or to the privilege reservation contained therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The May 10 letter advised the prosecutors that XYZ's counsel would be sending additional material within the next few weeks in order to complete the response that the government had solicited. As promised, XYZ's counsel sent a follow-up letter eleven days later. This missive contained the same privilege reservation (again conspicuously displayed on the first page). In the body of the letter, counsel discussed communications between XYZ and the FDA during September of 1998 (some of which involved Barrister). Once again, the privilege reservation evoked no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of counsel's letters referred to an anticipated meeting with the government. That meeting occurred on May 22, 2002. As the first order of business, XYZ's counsel renewed the privilege reservation, stating that any disclosures made during the meeting should not be interpreted as waiving the attorney-client privilege. The government's representatives received this announcement in stony silence. XYZ's presentation proved fruitless and the colloquy between the parties apparently ground to a halt. That was the state of affairs when the government endeavored to subpoena the disputed documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government now claims that these presentations resulted in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to the subjects discussed therein. But the circumstances, and particularly the government's own conduct, belie that claim. XYZ was careful to condition each and every disclosure on a clearly stated privilege reservation. The government did not raise the slightest question when these reservations were stated, but, rather, kept the dialogue going and invited additional disclosures. In the circumstances of this case, we think that XYZ reasonably interpreted the government's silence as an acceptance of the reservations. <i>Cf. McGurn v. Bell Microprods., Inc.,</i> 284 F.3d 86, 90 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that silence can serve as acceptance of a condition when the offeree, despite having a reasonable opportunity to reject the condition, takes the benefit of the offer without saying anything); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 69(1)(a) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government now says that XYZ, if it wanted to guarantee preservation of the attorney-client privilege, should have secured a written agreement to that effect. In the absence of such a step, the government suggests, the unilaterally imposed privilege reservation was impuissant. This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, in some cases silence can be the basis of acceptance. <i>See, e.g., McGurn,</i> 284 F.3d at 90. In this case, the undisputed facts show that the government knew of XYZ's intention to operate under a privilege reservation from the time that it first secured a tape recording of the call. It unquestionably accepted the reservation at that time. XYZ then repeated the reservation on the occasion of each of the three succeeding pre-indictment presentations (two written and one oral). The government voiced no objection to the privilege reservation at any of these times. Its silence encouraged (indeed, allowed) the disclosures to go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the government does not deny that it knew of the oft-repeated privilege reservations. Hence, the government's long delay in raising a claim of waiver is itself an indication of such knowledge. <i>See Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Digital Island, Inc.,</i> No. C-00-3509CW, 2002 WL 1285126, at *6 (N.D.Cal. May 30, 2002) (finding privilege reservation valid, in part because opposition waited eight months after supposed waiver before seeking to compel production of documents). In turn, the government's ready acceptance of the proffers' benefits, notwithstanding its knowledge of the privilege reservations, makes its current position untenable. <i>Cf. 3 A's Towing Co. v. P &amp; A. Well Serv., Inc.,</i> 642 F.2d 756, 758 n. 3 (5th Cir.1981) (finding ratification where delay in repudiating was long and failure to repudiate was \"accompanied by acts indicating approval... such as receiving and retaining the benefits\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the privilege reservations were not unilaterally imposed, but, rather, were accepted by the government's consistent course of conduct. That course of conduct signaled clearly the government's intention to acquiesce in the privilege reservations. We conclude, therefore, that the reservations were fully effective here. Having lured XYZ into making a series of proffers, the government cannot now be allowed to contradict that reasonable understanding by arguing, after the fact, that it never acceded to the reservations. <i>Cf. United States v. Tierney,</i> 760 F.2d 382, 388 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Having one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we ground this result in equitable principles, it also comports with sound policy. Arm's-length negotiations between the government and private parties, in advance of an indictment, aid the truth-seeking process. Such negotiations are to everybody's advantage. They give potential defendants an opportunity to explain away suspicious circumstances, give the government an opportunity to avoid embarrassing and wasteful mistakes, and give the public a greater likelihood of a just result. Requiring the government to turn square corners in such negotiations will make potential defendants more willing to deal with the government in the future. Conversely, refusing to hold the government to such a standard will send a signal to future litigants to negotiate with the government only at their peril. That is not a message that we wish to send &#8212; nor is it one that would serve the government's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a perfect world, of course, XYZ would have secured a written acknowledgment of its privilege reservation in advance of each and every disclosure. But XYZ did secure one such written acknowledgment, and its failure to do so on subsequent occasions is clearly outweighed by two facts: (i) it repeatedly set forth its position, and (ii) the government failed to question the privilege reservation in a timely manner. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the proffers were made in the course of ongoing plea negotiations; that XYZ explicitly reserved all claims of attorney-client privilege with respect thereto; that the government effectively acquiesced in these reservations; and that the government is bound by them. Consequently, XYZ reserved the attorney-client privilege by means of its pre-indictment presentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We hold that XYZ's extrajudicial disclosure did not give rise, by implication, to a broad subject matter waiver. We further hold that the government's seeming acquiescence in XYZ's privilege reservations precludes any claim that XYZ's pre-indictment presentations worked a waiver of any applicable privilege. Accordingly, we reverse the order appealed from, vacate the contempt citation, and remand to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is some suggestion in the record that two other employees of XYZ were on the line during the call.

For today, it suffices that the government has neither argued for a narrow waiver nor identified any particular document to which such a waiver might extend. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that arguments not made in a party's briefs need not be considered).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the government implies that XYZ used the call in its pre-indictment proffers, that argument fails for the reasons discussed in Part III(B),<i>infra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In view of the fact that the attorney-client privilege remains intact, we need not address the work-product doctrine.

The subpoenaed party, a corporation, refused to produce certain of the requested documents on the ground that they were shielded by the attorney-client and work-product privileges. The government sought to compel production, contending that any attendant privilege had been waived. The district court, eschewing an evidentiary hearing, ordered the corporation to produce the documents and cited it for contempt when it declined to do so. These appeals &#8212; there are two because the corporation filed a notice of appeal after the court ordered production of the withheld documents and another after the court adjudged it in contempt &#8212; followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration, we conclude that the record fails to support the lower court's finding of a broad subject matter waiver.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with an abbreviated account of the events leading to the turnover order. Consistent with the secrecy that typically attaches to grand jury matters, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e), these appeals have gone forward under an order sealing the briefs, the parties' proffers, and other pertinent portions of the record. To preserve that confidentiality, we use fictitious names for all affected parties and furnish only such background facts as are necessary to provide ambiance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1998, XYZ Corporation (XYZ) began distributing a neoteric medical device. Soon after distribution began, XYZ learned that, on some occasions, the device was not functioning properly. It conducted an internal investigation and sought the advice of outside counsel to determine an appropriate course of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fairly short order, XYZ made a preliminary decision to withdraw the device from the market (at least temporarily). Before doing so, however, XYZ's existing supply agreement obligated it to consult with its co-venturer, Smallco. Representatives of the two companies conferred telephonically. The participants in that discussion included two officers of XYZ, outside counsel for XYZ (Bernard Barrister), the principals of Smallco, and Smallco's medical advisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> During this conversation, which we shall hereafter refer to as \"the call,\" Barrister advocated XYZ's position in the face of strong counter-arguments from the Smallco hierarchs (who wished to keep the device on the market). Unbeknownst to XYZ, Smallco recorded the call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, XYZ contacted the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) to discuss the emerging problems. A dialogue ensued. Less than one month after its initial contact with the FDA, XYZ voluntarily withdrew the device from the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Justice got wind of what had transpired and commenced an investigation into the distribution of the device. As part of this probe, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena requiring XYZ to produce an array of documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> XYZ withheld certain of the documents, instead producing privilege logs indexing what had been retained and the claims of privilege applicable thereto. As early as April of 2001, the government requested XYZ to waive its claims of privilege. XYZ refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 2001, the government obtained a tape recording of the call. The government thereafter asked XYZ for permission to audit the tape. XYZ replied that it would not seek to prevent the government from listening but admonished that this decision should not be viewed as a waiver of any privilege protecting other communications. The government agreed &#8212; in writing &#8212; to this condition. The investigation continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 2002, federal prosecutors met with XYZ's new outside counsel to inform XYZ of the direction of their investigation. Pursuant to the request of a government attorney, XYZ's counsel authored two letters responding to concerns voiced at the February meeting. Each contained a footnote on the first page stating explicitly that the letter should not be construed as a waiver of the attorney-client or work-product privileges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Following this correspondence, representatives of XYZ again met with the prosecutors to discuss the possible indictment of XYZ and/or its officers. This meeting took place in May of 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2003 &#8212; after persistently requesting a voluntary waiver of the attorney-client privilege for two full years &#8212; the government changed its tune. It repaired to the federal district court and filed a motion to compel production of the disputed documents. In its motion, the government argued in effect that XYZ already had waived the attorney-client privilege as to the most important documents described in the subpoena. The motion asserted that, during the call, Barrister had given legal advice in the presence of third parties and had disclosed legal advice previously provided to XYZ. In the government's view, this conduct effected a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to all communications anent the marketing and withdrawal of the device for a period extending from August 12, 1998 to October 8, 1998. As a fallback, the government asseverated that XYZ had waived the attorney-client privilege by means of the pre-indictment presentations made in response to the prosecutors' requests. To close the circle, the government maintained that the work-product doctrine, if applicable at all, likewise had been waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, acting ex parte, granted the motion to compel. In a four-sentence order, the court ruled that XYZ had \"waived its attorney-client privilege with respect to the subject matter of the [call].\" When the government moved for an expedited hearing to clarify the order and XYZ sought reconsideration, the district court again acted summarily. Without either conducting an evidentiary hearing or entertaining argument, it ruled <i>ore sponte</i> that XYZ's waiver of the attorney-client privilege applied both retrospectively (i.e., to communications before the call relating to the \"same matter\") and prospectively (i.e., to communications after the call relating to the \"same matter\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its bench decision, the district court went well beyond the three-month waiver window envisioned by the government; it declared, in effect, that the waiver was to operate without limit of time (indeed, the court noted, as to future communications, that the waiver would have effect \"so long as people are talking about that same subject,\" and might apply up to the time of trial). The court exempted from the waiver any attorney-client communications about the waiver issue itself and provided guidance as to the scope of the waiver by referring to the \"doctrine of completeness.\" The court declined to resolve any additional issues, stating that it would cross those bridges as the need arose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the district court's order, XYZ refused to produce the documents.

By safeguarding communications between client and lawyer, the privilege encourages full and free discussion, better enabling the client to conform his conduct to the dictates of the law and to present legitimate claims and defenses if litigation ensues. <i>See Upjohn Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span> (1981). Still, the privilege is not limitless, and courts must take care to apply it only to the extent necessary to achieve its underlying goals. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Custodian of Records, Newparent, Inc.),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199669\"><a href=\"/opinion/199669/qn-re-grand-jury-v-q/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir.2001). In other words, the attorney-client privilege must be narrowly construed because it comes with substantial costs and stands as an obstacle of sorts to the search for truth. <i>See United States v. Nixon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span>, 709-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109101\"><a href=\"/opinion/109101/united-states-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The privilege protects only those communications that are confidential and are made for the purpose of seeking or receiving legal advice. <i>See Bollin,</i> 264 F.3d at 412; <i>see also</i> 8 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2292, at 554 (John T. McNaughton ed. 1961). The idea that the attorney-client privilege may be waived is a direct outgrowth of this well-established construction. When otherwise privileged communications are disclosed to a third party, the disclosure destroys the confidentiality upon which the privilege is premised. <i>See</i> 2 Paul R. Rice, Attorney-Client Privilege in the U.S. &#167; 9:79, at 357 (2d ed. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waivers come in various sizes and shapes. The easy cases tend to be those of express waiver. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Lussier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709202\"><a href=\"/opinion/709202/united-states-v-roger-lussier/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 462 (2d Cir.1995); <i>United States v.

The more difficult cases tend to involve implied waivers. While it is generally accepted that conduct can serve to waive the attorney-client privilege by implication, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence &#167; 503.41 (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed.1997) (collecting cases), the case law does not offer much assistance as to how broadly such implied waivers sweep. Like most courts, this court has yet to develop a jurisprudence clarifying the scope of such implied waivers. <i>See United States v. Desir,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199719\"><a href=\"/opinion/199719/united-states-v-desir/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In approaching these unanswered questions, we start with the unarguable proposition that the attorney-client privilege is highly valued. Accordingly, courts should be cautious about finding implied waivers. <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769504\"><a href=\"/opinion/769504/in-re-grand-jury-proceedings-united-states-of-america-v-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 186 (2d Cir.2000). Claims of implied waiver must be evaluated in light of principles of logic and fairness. <i>See</i> 2 Rice, <i>supra</i> &#167; 9:79, at 357. That evaluation demands a fastidious sifting of the facts and a careful weighing of the circumstances. <i>Desir,</i> 273 F.3d at 45-46. Considering the need for this precise, fact-specific tamisage, it is not surprising that the case law reveals few genuine instances of implied waiver. <i>See</i> 8 Wigmore, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2327, at 635.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Call.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these considerations in mind, we turn first to the government's contention that XYZ impliedly waived the attorney-client privilege when it \"sought, obtained, and discussed legal advice\" from Barrister in the presence of outsiders. Appellee's Br. at 26. The district court not only found such a waiver but also concluded that it extended, without limit of time, to all past and future communications on the subject matters discussed during the call. We think that the court erred as a matter of law in making these determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the attorney-client privilege to attach to a communication, it must have been made in confidence and for the purpose of securing or conveying legal advice. <i>See Cavallaro,</i> 284 F.3d at 245; <i>see also</i> 8 Wigmore, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2292, at 554. The privilege evaporates the moment that confidentiality ceases to exist. With isthmian exceptions not pertinent here, the presence of third parties is sufficient to undermine the needed confidentiality. <i>See</i> 8 Wigmore, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2311, at 601-03 &amp; nn. 6-8 (collecting cases). So here: XYZ knew that third parties &#8212; representatives of Smallco &#8212; were participating in the call. Thus, it could not have had any expectation of confidentiality as to matters discussed therein. The lack of such an expectation shattered the necessary confidentiality. <i>See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513182\"><a href=\"/opinion/513182/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-petition-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1016 n. 6 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Absent an expectation of confidentiality, none accrues.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that Barrister, regardless of his professional relationship with XYZ, did not provide confidential advice during the call but, rather, merely helped to advocate XYZ's position to its co-venturer. Consequently, the communications made during the call were not confidential (and, therefore, not subject to a colorable claim of privilege).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that no privilege attached to the call brings the government's waiver argument into sharper focus. It is crystal clear that any previously privileged information actually revealed during the call lost any veneer of privilege. <i>See, e.g., von Bulow v. von Bulow (In re von Bulow),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493894\"><a href=\"/opinion/493894/in-re-claus-von-bulow-martha-von-bulow-by-her-next-friends-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 102-03 (2d Cir.1987); <i>In re Sealed Case,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403325\"><a href=\"/opinion/403325/in-re-sealed-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span>, 817-18 (D.C.Cir.1982). XYZ does not contest the occurrence of such a waiver (indeed, it never listed the call on its privilege log). Rather, the bone of contention is whether that waiver had a ripple effect, i.e., whether it reached anything beyond that which was actually disclosed. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no express waiver, so the question is one of implied waiver. It is well accepted that waivers by implication can sometimes extend beyond the matter actually revealed. <i>See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 219 F.3d at 182-83; <i>Sedco Int'l, S.A. v. Cory,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406495\"><a href=\"/opinion/406495/sedco-international-s-a-v-william-f-cory-and-marcella-mckillip/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span>, 1206 (8th Cir.1982). Such waivers are almost invariably premised on fairness concerns. <i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 101-03. As one respected treatise explains, \"[t]he courts have identified a common denominator in waiver by implication: in each case, the party asserting the privilege placed protected information in issue for personal benefit through some affirmative act, and the court found that to allow the privilege to protect against disclosure of that information\" would have been unfair to the opposing party. 3 Weinstein, <i>supra</i> &#167; 503.41[1]. <i>See also Sedco,</i> 683 F.2d at 1206 (noting that courts have found waiver by implication when a client (i) testifies concerning portions of an attorney-client communication, (ii) places the attorney-client relationship itself at issue, or (iii) asserts reliance on an attorney's advice as an element of a claim or defense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A paradigmatic example of this phenomenon is a case involving an advice of counsel defense. When such a defense is raised, the pleader puts the nature of its lawyer's advice squarely in issue, and, thus, communications embodying the subject matter of the advice typically lose protection. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bilzerian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556608\"><a href=\"/opinion/556608/united-states-v-paul-a-bilzerian/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1285</span></a></span>, 1292 (2d Cir.1991). Implying a subject matter waiver in such a case ensures fairness because it disables litigants from using the attorney-client privilege as both a sword and a shield. Were the law otherwise, the client could selectively disclose fragments helpful to its cause, entomb other (unhelpful) fragments, and in that way kidnap the truth-seeking process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually every reported instance of an implied waiver extending to an entire subject matter involves a judicial disclosure, that is, a disclosure made in the course of a judicial proceeding. <i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 103 (collecting cases). This uniformity is not mere happenstance; it exists because such a limitation makes eminently good sense. Accordingly, we hold, as a matter of first impression in this circuit, that the extrajudicial disclosure of attorney-client communications, not thereafter used by the client to gain adversarial advantage in judicial proceedings, cannot work an implied waiver of all confidential communications on the same subject matter. <i>Accord von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 102-03; <i>Yankee Atomic Elec. Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span>, 316 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale behind our holding is self-evident. When an attorney participates in an extrajudicial meeting or negotiation, his participation alone does not justify implying a broad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege. There is a qualitative difference between offering testimony at trial or asserting an advice of counsel defense in litigation, on the one hand, and engaging in negotiations with business associates, on the other hand. In the former setting, the likelihood of prejudice looms: once a litigant chooses to put privileged communications at issue, only the revelation of all related exchanges will allow the truth-seeking process to function unimpeded. In the latter scenario, however, such concerns are absent. The party has introduced its lawyer into the negotiations, but that act, in and of itself, does nothing to cause prejudice to the opposition or to subvert the truth-seeking process. Furthermore, a rule that would allow broad subject matter waivers to be implied from such communications would provide perverse incentives: parties would leave attorneys out of commercial negotiations for fear that their inclusion would later force wholesale disclosure of confidential information. This would strike at the heart of the attorney-client relationship &#8212; and would do so despite the absence of any eclipsing reason for the implication of a waiver. Where a party has not thrust a partial disclosure into ongoing litigation, fairness concerns neither require nor permit massive breaching of the attorney-client privilege.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See In re Grand Jury Proceedings,</i> 219 F.3d at 188-89 (finding no broad waiver when disclosure occurred in grand jury testimony and government did not show sufficient prejudice).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, the district court's turnover order cannot be sustained. Although plotting the precise line that separates judicial disclosures from extrajudicial disclosures sometimes can be difficult, no such difficulties are presented here. The call took place entirely outside the judicial context. The parties to it were co-venturers bent on ironing out wrinkles and reaching a joint business decision. Given these facts, it would be fanciful to suggest that the disclosures cited by the government were made in anticipation of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That gets the grease from the goose. Because the call was plainly extrajudicial, the district court erred in using it as a fulcrum for the implication of a broad subject matter waiver of the attorney-client privilege. <i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 103; <i>Electro Scientific Indus. v. Gen. Scanning, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></span>, 543-44 (N.D.Cal. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that even extrajudicial disclosures should be given broad scope when the waiving party seeks later to use that disclosure to its advantage. We agree in part: if confidential information is revealed in an extrajudicial context and later reused in a judicial setting, the circumstances of the initial disclosure will not immunize the client against a claim of waiver. <i>See Electro Scientific,</i> 175 F.R.D. at 544 (explaining that a past extrajudicial disclosure will not cause any prejudice in subsequent litigation as long as the disclosing party \"does not try to use [the disclosure] in this litigation\"); <i>cf. United States v. Workman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752384\"><a href=\"/opinion/752384/united-states-v-roger-d-workman/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span>, 1263-64 (8th Cir.1998) (finding subject matter waiver after client placed attorney's advice in issue in court case). The key is that the subsequent disclosure, <i>on its own,</i> would suffice to waive the privilege. Here, however, XYZ has not made use of the call in any judicial proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that a <i>prospective</i> waiver will very rarely be warranted in extrajudicial disclosure cases. Courts have generally allowed prospective waivers in discrete and limited situations, almost invariably involving advice of counsel defenses. <i>See, e.g., Minn. Specialty Crops, Inc. v. Minn. Wild Hockey Club,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></span>, 679 (D.Minn. 2002); <i>Chiron Corp. v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span>, 1187 (E.D.Cal.2001). Every case the government cites in support of the district court's imposition of a prospective waiver involves precisely this scenario. <i>See Minn. Specialty Crops,</i> 210 F.R.D. at 679 (finding a prospective waiver effected \"by the adoption of [an] advice-of-counsel defense\"); <i>Chiron Corp.,</i> 179 F.Supp.2d at 1188 (same); <i>Gabriel Capital, L.P. v.

This ensures that a litigant is not able to present only selected bits of the story and thus distort the truth-seeking process. The case at hand is not one in which an advice of counsel defense has been asserted &#8212; indeed, there is no pending proceeding to serve as a vehicle for such a defense &#8212; and no such ends would be served by implying a broad prospective waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Presentations to the Government.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our odyssey is not yet finished. Even though the district court did not reach the issue, the government invites us to consider, as an alternative basis on which to uphold the turnover order, its argument that XYZ's pre-indictment proffers waived the attorney-client privilege. <i>See Intergen N.V. v. Grina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200660\"><a href=\"/opinion/200660/intergen-n-v-v-grina/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.2003) [slip op. at 13] (explaining that the court of appeals can affirm a judgment on any ground made manifest by the record). The parties have briefed this issue, the facts pertaining to it are essentially uncontradicted, and an adjudication will expedite matters. These factors convince us to accept the government's invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many years ago, Justice Holmes warned that those who deal with the government must turn square corners. <i>Rock Island, Ark. &amp; La. R.R. Co. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99652\"><a href=\"/opinion/99652/rock-island-a-lr-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 143, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></span> (1920). That advice cuts both ways: those who deal with the government have a right to expect fair treatment in return. The principle that the government must turn square corners in dealing with its constituents is dispositive here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these. At the time the government filed the motion to compel, it had been engaged in discussions with XYZ for over two years. During that span, the government repeatedly had requested that XYZ waive the attorney-client privilege vis-&#224;-vis communications concerning the device's withdrawal from the market, and XYZ steadfastly had refused. When the government sought permission to audit the tape recording of the call, XYZ agreed on the express condition that leave \"was not to be viewed as a waiver of any applicable privilege protecting other communications.\" The government acceded to this condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February of 2002, government attorneys met with XYZ's outside counsel to discuss the threatened indictment of the corporation and/or its officers. The government acknowledges that it solicited a response from XYZ in hopes of gaining information so that an indictment, if one eventuated, would be based on a fully informed account of the product-withdrawal decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, this solicitation went unheeded. In late April, however, the government wrote to XYZ's outside counsel, formally identifying the corporation as a target of the grand jury investigation. That letter apparently got XYZ's attention. The next month, its counsel responded to the government's earlier request. This epistle, dated May 10, 2002, began with a clear and explicit statement, quoted <i>supra</i> note 3, that nothing contained therein should be deemed a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. The letter set forth various reasons why the government should forgo an indictment. It contained only one glancing mention of an attorney-client communication &#8212; a reference to the call (a communication to which the attorney-client privilege never attached). In all events, the government never replied either to this letter or to the privilege reservation contained therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The May 10 letter advised the prosecutors that XYZ's counsel would be sending additional material within the next few weeks in order to complete the response that the government had solicited. As promised, XYZ's counsel sent a follow-up letter eleven days later. This missive contained the same privilege reservation (again conspicuously displayed on the first page). In the body of the letter, counsel discussed communications between XYZ and the FDA during September of 1998 (some of which involved Barrister). Once again, the privilege reservation evoked no response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of counsel's letters referred to an anticipated meeting with the government. That meeting occurred on May 22, 2002. As the first order of business, XYZ's counsel renewed the privilege reservation, stating that any disclosures made during the meeting should not be interpreted as waiving the attorney-client privilege. The government's representatives received this announcement in stony silence. XYZ's presentation proved fruitless and the colloquy between the parties apparently ground to a halt. That was the state of affairs when the government endeavored to subpoena the disputed documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government now claims that these presentations resulted in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to the subjects discussed therein. But the circumstances, and particularly the government's own conduct, belie that claim. XYZ was careful to condition each and every disclosure on a clearly stated privilege reservation. The government did not raise the slightest question when these reservations were stated, but, rather, kept the dialogue going and invited additional disclosures. In the circumstances of this case, we think that XYZ reasonably interpreted the government's silence as an acceptance of the reservations. <i>Cf. McGurn v. Bell Microprods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199886\"><a href=\"/opinion/199886/mcgurn-v-bell-microproducts/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that silence can serve as acceptance of a condition when the offeree, despite having a reasonable opportunity to reject the condition, takes the benefit of the offer without saying anything); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 69(1)(a) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government now says that XYZ, if it wanted to guarantee preservation of the attorney-client privilege, should have secured a written agreement to that effect. In the absence of such a step, the government suggests, the unilaterally imposed privilege reservation was impuissant. This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, in some cases silence can be the basis of acceptance. <i>See, e.g., McGurn,</i> 284 F.3d at 90. In this case, the undisputed facts show that the government knew of XYZ's intention to operate under a privilege reservation from the time that it first secured a tape recording of the call. It unquestionably accepted the reservation at that time. XYZ then repeated the reservation on the occasion of each of the three succeeding pre-indictment presentations (two written and one oral). The government voiced no objection to the privilege reservation at any of these times. Its silence encouraged (indeed, allowed) the disclosures to go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, the government does not deny that it knew of the oft-repeated privilege reservations. Hence, the government's long delay in raising a claim of waiver is itself an indication of such knowledge. <i>See Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Digital Island, Inc.,</i> No. C-00-3509CW, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1285126</span></span>, at *6 (N.D.Cal. May 30, 2002) (finding privilege reservation valid, in part because opposition waited eight months after supposed waiver before seeking to compel production of documents). In turn, the government's ready acceptance of the proffers' benefits, notwithstanding its knowledge of the privilege reservations, makes its current position untenable. <i>Cf. 3 A's Towing Co. v. P &amp; A. Well Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387882\"><a href=\"/opinion/387882/3-as-towing-company-v-p-a-well-service-inc-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 758 n. 3 (5th Cir.1981) (finding ratification where delay in repudiating was long and failure to repudiate was \"accompanied by acts indicating approval... such as receiving and retaining the benefits\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the privilege reservations were not unilaterally imposed, but, rather, were accepted by the government's consistent course of conduct. That course of conduct signaled clearly the government's intention to acquiesce in the privilege reservations. We conclude, therefore, that the reservations were fully effective here. Having lured XYZ into making a series of proffers, the government cannot now be allowed to contradict that reasonable understanding by arguing, after the fact, that it never acceded to the reservations. <i>Cf. United States v. Tierney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451517\"><a href=\"/opinion/451517/united-states-v-robert-f-tierney/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Having one's cake and eating it, too, is not in fashion in this circuit.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we ground this result in equitable principles, it also comports with sound policy. Arm's-length negotiations between the government and private parties, in advance of an indictment, aid the truth-seeking process. Such negotiations are to everybody's advantage. They give potential defendants an opportunity to explain away suspicious circumstances, give the government an opportunity to avoid embarrassing and wasteful mistakes, and give the public a greater likelihood of a just result. Requiring the government to turn square corners in such negotiations will make potential defendants more willing to deal with the government in the future. Conversely, refusing to hold the government to such a standard will send a signal to future litigants to negotiate with the government only at their peril. That is not a message that we wish to send &#8212; nor is it one that would serve the government's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a perfect world, of course, XYZ would have secured a written acknowledgment of its privilege reservation in advance of each and every disclosure. But XYZ did secure one such written acknowledgment, and its failure to do so on subsequent occasions is clearly outweighed by two facts: (i) it repeatedly set forth its position, and (ii) the government failed to question the privilege reservation in a timely manner. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the proffers were made in the course of ongoing plea negotiations; that XYZ explicitly reserved all claims of attorney-client privilege with respect thereto; that the government effectively acquiesced in these reservations; and that the government is bound by them. Consequently, XYZ reserved the attorney-client privilege by means of its pre-indictment presentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We hold that XYZ's extrajudicial disclosure did not give rise, by implication, to a broad subject matter waiver. We further hold that the government's seeming acquiescence in XYZ's privilege reservations precludes any claim that XYZ's pre-indictment presentations worked a waiver of any applicable privilege. Accordingly, we reverse the order appealed from, vacate the contempt citation, and remand to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is some suggestion in the record that two other employees of XYZ were on the line during the call.

But such cases will be rare, and the scope of any ensuing waiver will be narrow<i>See von Bulow,</i> 828 F.2d at 102 n. 1. For today, it suffices that the government has neither argued for a narrow waiver nor identified any particular document to which such a waiver might extend. <i>See United States v.
