William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                     and Woodcock,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Thomas More Dickinson, with whom Law Office of Thomas M.\nDickinson was on brief, for appellant.\n     C. Russell Bengtson, with whom Carroll Kelly & Murphy was on\nbrief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           December 30, 2009\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD,      Circuit     Judge.        In    this    diversity   action\n\ninvolving a products liability claim, Robert Esposito challenges\n\nthe district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants, Dewalt Industries, Black & Decker, and Home Depot.\n\nEsposito argues on appeal that the case was improperly removed to\n\nfederal court and that the district court erroneously precluded his\n\nexpert witness.    We reject the argument based on improper removal,\n\nbut we agree that, in the circumstances of this case, the expert\n\nwitness should not have been precluded. Accordingly, we vacate the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                    I.    Facts\n\n           In   March    2003,    while    he     was   operating   a    power   saw\n\nmanufactured by Dewalt Industries (\"Dewalt\"), Robert Esposito's\n\nleft hand came into contact with the saw's unguarded blade.                      The\n\nsaw   severed   three    of   his    fingers,       none   of    which   could   be\n\nreattached.     In March 2006, Esposito filed a complaint in Rhode\n\nIsland state court against Dewalt, Black & Decker (the company that\n\npackaged the saw), and Home Depot (the company that sold the saw).\n\nEsposito claimed that the saw was defective because its blade guard\n\ndid not engage properly and that the defendants were jointly and\n\nseverally liable for his injury.               Home Depot was served with the\n\ncomplaint on March 17.        The other defendants were served on March\n\n21.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f             On April 3, two of the defendants, Dewalt and Black &\n\nDecker, filed a notice of removal in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Rhode Island.       On April 13, the other\n\ndefendant, Home Depot, filed its answer in federal court.\n\n             On May 3, Esposito moved to remand the matter back to the\n\nstate court.    In support of his motion, he claimed a defect in the\n\nremoval process in that Home Depot had not consented to removal\n\nwithin the thirty-day period as required by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1446(b).    That failure, Esposito claimed, breached the unanimity\n\nrequirement: that each defendant in a multi-defendant case consent\n\nto removal within thirty days of receiving service. The defendants\n\nopposed Esposito's motion.\n\n             The district court denied the motion, concluding that\n\nHome Depot's answer, which had been filed in federal court within\n\nthe thirty day period, constituted consent to removal under the\n\ncircumstances.     Esposito v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 436 F. Supp.\n\n2d 343, 347 (D.R.I. 2006).\n\n             In July 2006, the district court set pre-trial discovery\n\nand disclosure deadlines, including a deadline for the written\n\ndisclosure of experts under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.     These deadlines were pushed back twice:   first at the\n\nrequest of the defendants and second at the request of Esposito.\n\nThe second extension required the parties to wrap up fact discovery\n\nby May 31, 2007; Esposito to disclose experts by June 21; and the\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdefendants to disclose experts by July 14.                  Dispositive motions\n\nwere due by August 16.\n\n            Operating under this revised timetable, the parties and\n\ntheir   respective    experts     arranged       to   participate     in    a   joint\n\nexamination of the saw.         At this examination, which took place on\n\nApril 20, Steven Thomas inspected the saw on Esposito's behalf.\n\nThomas's curriculum vitae had been sent to the defendants prior to\n\nthis examination.          When the time came to disclose Thomas as his\n\nexpert, however, Esposito failed to do so.               Instead, on August 1,\n\nhe filed a motion requesting that the court further extend the\n\nrelevant    deadlines      by   ninety     days.      The    defendants     opposed\n\nEsposito's extension request and on August 3 they filed a summary\n\njudgment motion premised on the plaintiff's lack of an expert.\n\n            The magistrate judge denied Esposito's request for a\n\nfurther extension, and Esposito appealed this decision to the\n\ndistrict    court.         Expressing     reluctance,       the   district      court\n\nnevertheless endorsed the magistrate judge's decision and denied\n\nEsposito's motion for an extension.              The court recognized that the\n\ndenial of the plaintiff's request for an extension amounted to a\n\ndispositive ruling, noting that \"Both of the parties acknowledge\n\nthat the decision to exclude [Esposito's] expert as a result of\n\nmissing     the   discovery     deadlines        will,   without     much       doubt,\n\neffectively dispose of the case.\" Nevertheless, the district court\n\nconcluded    that    the    denial   of    the     extension,     which    precluded\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fEsposito's expert, was justified.       In so concluding, the district\n\ncourt noted that Esposito had failed to offer a legitimate reason\n\nfor missing the deadline.    The court also expressed its concern\n\nthat lesser sanctions, such as the imposition of fines and costs,\n\nmight \"send the message that noncompliance or inattention to\n\ndeadlines can be purchased for a price.\"\n\n          As predicted, the district court's ruling sounded the\n\ndeath knell for Esposito's case.    The magistrate judge recommended\n\nthat the district court grant the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment and the district court agreed, entering judgment for the\n\ndefendants.1   This appeal followed.\n\n                          II.    Discussion\n\n          We first examine the removal issue, turning then to the\n\nsanction question.\n\n                            A.    Removal\n\n          Under the removal statute, a defendant in a state court\n\naction may remove the action to federal court so long as the\n\nplaintiff could have originally filed the action in federal court.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441 (permitting removal of cases where the federal\n\ncourt would have had \"original jurisdiction\").       Where the action\n\ninvolves multiple defendants, however, the right of removal is\n\nsubject to the so-called \"unanimity requirement.\"        See Chicago,\n\n\n     1\n        In opposing the defendants' summary judgment motion,\nEsposito provided and relied upon an engineering report from\nThomas. The magistrate judge struck this report.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fRock Island & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Martin, 178 U.S. 245, 247-48 (1900).\n\nThis requirement is at issue in this case.\n\n            The unanimity requirement is derived from 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1446, which sets forth the procedure for removing a state action to\n\nfederal court.       Loftis v. UPS, 342 F.3d 509, 516 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\nIn a case where a plaintiff has sued multiple defendants in state\n\ncourt, an \"all for one and one for all\" rule applies with respect\n\nto removal.       See Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co., 178 U.S. at\n\n247-48.    That is, subject to a few exceptions not applicable here,\n\nall defendants must consent to remove the case for removal to be\n\neffected.       Id.; see also 11C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller\n\n& Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 3731 (3d. ed.\n\n1998) (\"Ordinarily, all of the defendants in the state court action\n\nmust consent to the removal . . . .\").\n\n            The requirement of unanimity serves the interests of\n\nplaintiffs,       defendants    and    the    judiciary.       Plaintiffs    are\n\nadvantaged, because, were the right to removal an independent\n\nrather than joint right, defendants could split the litigation,\n\nforcing a plaintiff to pursue its case in two separate forums.               See\n\nSansone v. Morton Mach. Works, Inc., 188 F. Supp. 2d 182, 184\n\n(D.R.I. 2002) (citing Getty Oil Corp., Div. of Texaco, Inc. v. Ins.\n\nCo.   of   N.    Am.,   841   F.2d    1254,   1262   n.11   (5th   Cir.   1988)).\n\nDefendants also stand to benefit from the requirement, as it\n\nprecludes one defendant from imposing his choice of forum on a co-\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fdefendant.   Id. (citation omitted).         And the unanimity requirement\n\nprevents the needless duplication of litigation, thereby preserving\n\ncourt   resources   and   eliminating       the   unattractive   prospect    of\n\ninconsistent state and federal adjudications. Spillers v. Tillman,\n\n959 F. Supp. 364, 369 (S.D. Miss. 1997).\n\n           The defect in the removal process resulting from a\n\nfailure of unanimity is not considered to be a jurisdictional\n\ndefect, and unless a party moves to remand based on this defect,\n\nthe defect is waived and the action may proceed in federal court.\n\nSee Loftis, 342 F.3d at 516-17; see also 11C Wright, Miller &\n\nCooper,   Federal    Practice   and    Procedure      ยง   3739   (\"After    the\n\nexpiration of the thirty-day period following the filing of the\n\nremoval notice, the right to object to nonjurisdictional defects in\n\nthe removal process is considered waived.\").\n\n           Here, Esposito timely objected to the perceived failure\n\nof the defendants to comply with the unanimity requirement. Before\n\nthe district court, as he does now, Esposito argued that Home Depot\n\nfailed to consent to removal within the statutorily prescribed\n\nthirty-day period.    The district court rejected this argument.             As\n\nnoted above, it concluded that Home Depot's answer in federal\n\ncourt, filed within the applicable thirty day period, constituted\n\nconsent to removal under the circumstances of the case. Our review\n\nof this conclusion is de novo.        Loftis, 434 F.3d at 514.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f             Although    the   unanimity      requirement   itself    is   well-\n\nsettled, the various ways that it may be satisfied are less so.                We\n\nhave   not   spoken     directly   to   the    question,    but   a   number   of\n\nguideposts do exist.\n\n             The removal statute itself speaks generally to the manner\n\nof removal.     In relevant part, section (a) provides that:\n\n             [A] defendant or defendants desiring to remove\n             any civil action . . . from a State court\n             shall file in the [appropriate] district court\n             of the United States a notice of removal\n             signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal\n             Rules of Civil Procedure and containing a\n             short and plain statement of the grounds for\n             removal, together with a copy of all process,\n             pleadings, and orders served upon such\n             defendant or defendants in such action.\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1446(a).\n\n             Consistent with this statute, a defendant may express its\n\ndesire to remove by signing the notice of removal filed by co-\n\ndefendants.     But, the consensus among courts is that conduct less\n\nexplicit than joining the notice will suffice.               See Pritchett v.\n\nCottrell, Inc., 512 F.3d 1057, 1062 (8th Cir. 2008) (\"[E]ach\n\ndefendant need not necessarily sign the notice of removal.\")\n\n(citation omitted); Getty Oil Corp., Div. of Texaco, Inc., 841 F.2d\n\nat 1262 n.11 (\"This does not mean that each defendant must sign the\n\noriginal petition for removal\"); see also Sansone, 188 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 184; Tate v. Mercedes-Benz USA, Inc., 151 F. Supp. 2d 222, 224\n\n(N.D.N.Y. 2001).\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            Although a few courts have gone so far as to say that a\n\ndefendant may orally consent to removal before the district court,\n\nColin v. Schmidt, 528 F. Supp. 355, 358-59 (D.R.I. 1981), Clyde v.\n\nNat'l Data Corp., 609 F. Supp. 216, 218 (N.D. Ga. 1985), courts\n\ntypically require some type of writing that evinces consent,\n\nLoftis, 342 F.3d at 517 (\"[A]ll defendants in the action must join\n\nin the removal petition or file their consent to removal in writing\n\nwithin thirty days . . . .\" (emphasis added)); see also Pritchett,\n\n512 F.3d at 1062; Gillis v. Louisiana, 294 F.3d 755, 759 (5th Cir.\n\n2002); Roe v. O'Donohue, 38 F.3d 298, 301 (7th Cir. 1994); Tate,\n\n151 F. Supp. 2d at 224.\n\n            What type of writing will be satisfactory engenders yet\n\nanother divergence of opinion.         Some courts have held that an\n\nanswer by a defendant that is silent on removal may nevertheless\n\nestablish consent, while other courts have reached the opposite\n\nconclusion.   Compare Hernandez v. Six Flags Magic Mountain, Inc.,\n\n688 F. Supp. 560, 562 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (holding that an answer\n\nsilent on removal can establish consent), and Glover v. W.R. Grace\n\n& Co., Inc., 773 F. Supp. 964, 965 (E.D. Tex. 1991) (same), with\n\nLocal Union No. 172 v. P.J. Dick, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1025\n\n(S.D. Ohio 2003) (holding that an answer filed that fails to\n\nexpressly   consent   to   removal   does   not   satisfy   the   unanimity\n\nrequirement), and Unicom Sys., Inc. v. Nat'l Louis Univ., 262 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 638, 643 & n.6 (E.D. Va. 2003) (same).       At least one court\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fhas held that a defendant's answer is insufficient to establish\n\nconsent to removal even where it explicitly acknowledges the\n\nremoval of the case to federal court.   Prod. Stamping Corp. v. Md.\n\nCas. Co., 829 F. Supp. 1074, 1077 (E.D. Wis. 1993).\n\n          Although mindful of the principle that removal statutes\n\nare to be narrowly construed, Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets,\n\n313 U.S. 100, 108-09 (1941), we nevertheless are not inclined to\n\nestablish a wooden rule, regardless of whether such a rule would\n\nhave the benefit of promoting clarity.      And in this particular\n\ncase, even assuming that Home Depot's answer failed to satisfy the\n\nunanimity requirement, resulting in a technical defect in the\n\nremoval process, the defect was subsequently cured when Home Depot\n\nopposed Esposito's remand motion, thereby clearly communicating its\n\ndesire to be in federal court.    See Harper v. AutoAlliance Int'l,\n\nInc., 392 F.3d 195, 202 (6th Cir. 2002) (\"In addition, the fact\n\nthat [the defendant] opposed [the plaintiff's] motion to remand\n\ncured any purported defect in the removal petition.\").      Because\n\nthis cure occurred prior to the entry of summary judgment, a remand\n\nto the state court was not required.      Cf. Caterpillar Inc. v.\n\nLewis, 519 U.S. 61, 76 (1996); see Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d\n\n699, 703 (9th Cir. 1998) (citing Caterpillar, 519 U.S. at 77, for\n\nthe proposition that \"a procedural defect existing at the time of\n\nremoval but cured prior to entry of judgment does not warrant\n\nreversal and remand of the matter to state court\").\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f            In a case such as this one, where the parties have\n\nalready invested valuable resources in pursuing this litigation in\n\nfederal court and where a remand to state court would not serve the\n\npurposes    of   the   unanimity   requirement,    reaching     an   opposite\n\nconclusion would place form before function.         Parrino, 146 F.3d at\n\n703; Glover, 773 F. Supp. at 965; 11C Wright, Miller & Cooper,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure ยง 3739 (\"[T]he preferable result\n\nseems to be to continue to allow procedural defects in the removal\n\nprocedure be cured so the removed action can remain in federal\n\ncourt.     A contrary conclusion does not seem consistent with the\n\nstatutory    character     of   the     removal   right   and    seems   too\n\ntechnical.\").     We refuse to do so, and thus uphold the denial of\n\nthe remand motion.\n\n            Of course, it is undoubtedly the better practice for a\n\ndefendant who wants to be in federal court to join the removal\n\nnotice explicitly, either by signing the notice itself or by filing\n\nits consent.     By failing to do so in this case, Home Depot ran the\n\nrisk that the district court might find a breach of the unanimity\n\nrequirement and remand this action to the state court, a decision\n\nwe would have been powerless to review.           28 U.S.C. ยง 1447(d) (a\n\ndistrict court's order remanding a case to the state court from\n\nwhich it was removed is unreviewable on appeal or otherwise);\n\nThings Remembered, Inc. v.

Discovery Sanction\n\n              The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide the basic\n\nframework for disclosure of experts.             Rule 26 requires a party to\n\n\"disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be\n\nused at trial to present [expert] evidence.\"                     Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(a)(2)(A).      Where a district court has established a disclosure\n\ndate, as in this case, a party must disclose the expert's identity\n\nat this ordered time.            Id. at (a)(2)(C).           If a party's expert\n\ndisclosure is untimely, the party is not allowed to use that\n\nwitness or relevant expert information \"to supply evidence on a\n\nmotion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was\n\nsubstantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n\n              Preclusion,    however,      \"is   not    a    strictly   mechanical\n\nexercise.\"      Santiago-Diaz v. Laboratorio Clinico y de Referencia\n\ndel   Este,    456   F.3d   272,   276    (1st   Cir.       2006).   And,   in   its\n\ndiscretion, the district court may choose a less severe sanction.\n\nId.; see also LaPlace-Bayard v. Batlle, 295 F.3d 157, 162 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"[D]istrict courts have broad discretion in meting out . .\n\n. sanctions for Rule 26 violations.\") (citation omitted).\n\n              Where a district court does opt in favor of preclusion,\n\nwe review that decision with reference to a host of factors,\n\nincluding:      (1) the history of the litigation; (2) the sanctioned\n\n                                         -12-\n\fparty's need for the precluded evidence; (3) the sanctioned party's\n\njustification (or lack of one) for its late disclosure; (4) the\n\nopponent-party's ability to overcome the late disclosure's adverse\n\neffects -- e.g., the surprise and prejudice associated with the\n\nlate disclosure; and (5) the late disclosure's impact on the\n\ndistrict court's docket.   Macaulay v. Anas, 321 F.3d 45, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); see also Santiago-Diaz, 456 F.3d at 276-77.       When\n\nreviewing the district court's sanction decision we must keep in\n\nmind that district courts are generally in a better position to\n\ndetermine the propriety of a particular sanction and, accordingly,\n\nour review of the district court's ultimate choice is deferential.\n\nAnas, 321 F.3d at 51 (\"Because trial judges tend to have an\n\nintimate knowledge of the variables that enter into the equation,\n\nappellate review of sanctions orders is deferential.\") (citations\n\nomitted); Fashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1082\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).    Consistent with this deference, we review a\n\ndistrict court's decision to exclude expert evidence for an abuse\n\nof discretion, understanding that the sanctioned party shoulders a\n\n\"heavy burden\" when attempting to show that such an abuse has\n\noccurred.   See Santiago-Diaz, 456 F.3d at 275.2\n\n\n     2\n       We note that Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\ngives district courts great discretion to issue sanctions where a\nparty fails to comply with case-management deadlines. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 16(f). It is not entirely clear whether the preclusion sanction\nhere was levied under Rule 16 or Rule 37, although Esposito cited\nRule 37 in his motion to permit expert testimony. In any event,\n\n                               -13-\n\f            Here, the district court was undoubtedly entitled to\n\nimpose some type of sanction on Esposito.                 Esposito failed to\n\ncomply with a court-imposed deadline that he himself had suggested,\n\nand he could not offer a legitimate justification for his non-\n\ncompliance. And despite Esposito's argument that the appearance of\n\nhis expert at the inspection of the saw constituted an \"informal\n\ndisclosure,\" the rules require formal disclosure for a reason:\n\nwithout it, parties like the defendants in this case may be\n\nhindered in their ability to prepare effectively for trial.                 See\n\nFed.   R.   Civ.   P.    26   (a)(2)(B)      (establishing   that,    \"[u]nless\n\notherwise     stipulated      or   ordered    by   the   court,\"    the   formal\n\ndisclosure of an expert \"must be accompanied by a written report\"\n\nthat contains a host of information relevant to the expert's\n\ntestimony).\n\n            Nevertheless, whether the facts here justified the actual\n\nsanction imposed -- the preclusion of the expert witness -- is a\n\ncloser question.        We start by stating the obvious.           The sanction\n\nhere had serious consequences.         Esposito's need for the expert was\n\nso great that the magistrate judge's decision to preclude the\n\n\n\n\nwhether we are reviewing a sanction imposed under Rule 16 or Rule\n37, the considerations are generally the same, as is the deference\nwe afford the district court's choice of sanction. See Santiago-\nDiaz, 456 F.3d at 277 (discussing cases dealing with sanctions\nimposed under Rule 16 in examining the preclusion of evidence under\nRule 37). Accordingly, we would reach the same result here under\neither rule.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fexpert, although technically not a dismissal of Esposito's case,\n\neffectively amounted to one. See Primus v. United States, 389 F.3d\n\n231, 234 (1st Cir. 2004).        The district court acknowledged as much\n\nwhen it affirmed the magistrate judge's imposition of the sanction,\n\nobserving that \"Both of the parties acknowledge that the decision\n\nto exclude the Plaintiff's expert as a result of missing the\n\ndiscovery deadlines will, without much doubt, effectively dispose\n\nof the case.\"\n\n          Because   all    parties     acknowledged        that   the   sanction\n\ncarried the force of a dismissal, the justification for it must be\n\ncomparatively more robust.        Young v. Gordon 330 F.3d 76, 81 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (\"To be sure, dismissal ordinarily should be employed as\n\na sanction only when a plaintiff's misconduct is extreme.\"); Tower\n\nVentures, Inc. v. City of Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)   (recognizing      that    dismissal       should    not    be    granted\n\n\"casually\").    After      considering      the    other    relevant     factors\n\ndescribed above, we conclude that the circumstances here do not\n\njustify such strong medicine.\n\n          In reaching this conclusion, we view the history of the\n\nlitigation as particularly enlightening.            This is not a case of a\n\nparty repeatedly balking at court-imposed deadlines.                    Esposito\n\nmissed one deadline and requested an extension of the pre-trial and\n\ntrial dates after missing that deadline, albeit several weeks after\n\nthe deadline had passed.     Compare Santiago-Diaz, 456 F.3d at 277 &\n\n                                     -15-\n\fn.4 (noting, in upholding the preclusion of a late-disclosed expert\n\nwitness, that the sanctioned party's \"dereliction was both obvious\n\nand repeated\" and that \"[t]he record makes manifest that the\n\nplaintiff was guilty of several discovery violations besides those\n\nrelated to her expert witness\").            Nor is this a case where the\n\nsanctioned party ignored pre-sanction warnings from the district\n\ncourt.   See Young, 330 F.3d at 79.          Nor does this case involve,\n\nfrom all appearances, an act of calculated gamesmanship on the part\n\nof the sanctioned party.     Neither the defendants nor the district\n\ncourt in this case have characterized Esposito's failure to comply\n\nwith the disclosure deadline as strategic in nature.\n\n           To be sure, not every factor cuts in Esposito's favor.\n\nFirst,   he   never    offered   a   legitimate    reason   for   his   late\n\ndisclosure.     See Macaulay, 321 F.3d at 52 (finding that the\n\ndistrict court's preclusion of the expert evidence was appropriate\n\nwhere, among other things, \"the appellant [had not] advanced any\n\nreal justification for [the] tardy emergence [of the expert's\n\nreport]\").    Second, although the defendants here do not discuss in\n\nany great detail how the late disclosure prejudiced them, they\n\nobviously went through the pains of preparing a dispositive summary\n\njudgment motion premised on Esposito's lack of an expert in an\n\nexpert-dependent case. See Gagnon v. Teledyne Princeton, Inc., 437\n\nF.3d 188, 198 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[P]rejudice also exists in [the\n\ndefendants]   having    prepared     a   dispositive   motion   for   summary\n\n                                     -16-\n\fjudgment predicated on the preclusion of the expert testimony.\");\n\nPrimus, 389 F.3d at 236.        And finally, Esposito's failure to\n\ndisclose his expert by the scheduled date had a clear effect on the\n\ndistrict court's docket.     In his motion to extend, Esposito sought\n\nto push back the relevant pre-trial and trial dates by ninety days,\n\nrequiring the district court to further move dates that had already\n\nbeen extended twice.\n\n           Even taking these considerations into account, however,\n\nwe still must face up to the fact that we are presented with a\n\nfatal sanction levied for a single oversight.        We have not been\n\nable to uncover a case from this circuit sustaining a comparable\n\nsanction   under   similar   circumstances.   See   Benitez-Garcia   v.\n\nGonzalez-Vega, 468 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"Defendants do not\n\ncite to us, and we have been unable to find, a case from this\n\ncircuit sustaining a dismissal with prejudice imposed solely for a\n\nsingle allegation of noncompliance with a single (albeit multi-\n\npart) discovery order -- at least where that non-compliance was\n\nnever brought to the plaintiffs' attention by the court prior to\n\ndismissing the case.\"); see also Malot v. Dorado Beach Cottages\n\nAssocs., 478 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2007) (same).       In our view, a\n\nless severe remedy could have easily achieved the same aims as the\n\npreclusion of the expert while still giving Esposito, potentially\n\nthe innocent victim of a defective product, his day in court.\n\nMalot, 478 F.3d at 43 (recognizing \"the strong presumption in favor\n\n                                  -17-\n\fof   deciding    cases    on   the    merits\");    Young,   330   F.3d       at   81\n\n(referencing the \"salutary policy favoring the disposition of cases\n\non the merits\").\n\n            The defendants urge us to uphold the district court's\n\nsanction.       They    rely   principally    on   our   decisions      in   Tower\n\nVentures, Inc. and Young.            In both of these cases, we upheld a\n\ndistrict court's decision to dismiss the case of a party that had\n\nfailed to comply with case-management deadlines.             Tower Ventures,\n\nInc., 296 F.3d at 48; Young, 330 F.3d at 83.                In each of those\n\ncases, however, the conduct of the sanctioned party was measurably\n\nmore egregious than Esposito's conduct was here.\n\n            In Tower Ventures, Inc., the sanctioned party, Tower\n\nVentures,    had      committed   \"serial     violations    of    the    court's\n\nscheduling order.\"        296 F.3d at 45.      The violations were missed\n\ndiscovery deadlines, and the final one was particularly flagrant:\n\nTower Ventures waited eighty-one days after the discovery deadline\n\nhad passed, and eighteen days after its motion for summary judgment\n\nwas due, to ask the court for a further extension.                Id.    By that\n\ntime, the district court had already issued a show cause order,\n\nasking Tower Ventures why its action should not be dismissed with\n\nprejudice.      Id.\n\n            In Young, the district court dismissed Young's case\n\nbecause of Young's \"repeated failures to comply with court orders.\"\n\n330 F.3d at 78.          In particular, Young (i) failed to join the\n\n                                       -18-\n\fopposition in filing a joint statement containing a proposed\n\npretrial schedule as ordered by the court; (ii) did not respond to\n\nthe opposition's counter-claims until the court warned him that his\n\nfailure to do so could result in a dismissal; and (iii) refused to\n\nappear for his own deposition, even after the court ordered him to\n\nappear and warned him that a failure to do so could result in a\n\ndismissal of his action.    Id. at 79.\n\n          Here,   by   contrast,   Esposito   missed   only   one   court-\n\nscheduled deadline, and his behavior was not nearly as brazen as\n\nthe behavior of the sanctioned parties in either of those cases.\n\nHe neither engaged in the same level of foot-dragging as was\n\npresent in Tower Ventures, nor sloughed off a warning from the\n\ndistrict court like the plaintiff in Young.\n\n          We do not wish to casually discount the district court's\n\nconcern that a lesser sanction, such as the imposition of fines or\n\ncosts, might send a message to other litigants that \"inattention to\n\ndeadlines can be purchased for a price.\"       The deterrence value of\n\na sanction may certainty factor into a district court's calculus.\n\nBut, allowing the general interest in deterrence to hold too much\n\nsway in the analysis runs afoul of the principle that \"sanction[s]\n\nmust be handled on a case-by-case basis.\"       Young, 330 F.3d at 81.\n\nIn other words, the punishment must approximately fit the crime.\n\nHere, it did not.      In the absence of a greater conviction that\n\nparties will indeed attempt to purchase their way out of discovery\n\n                                   -19-\n\fcompliance as a result of our holding in this case, we are not\n\npersuaded that the sanction here was justified.\n\n                              III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons provided above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's   denial   of   the   motion   to   remand,   but   we   reverse   the\n\nexclusion of the expert testimony, vacate the entry of summary\n\njudgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion, including the possible imposition of sanctions within the\n\ndistrict court's discretion. The parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n            -Concurring and Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f            WOODCOCK,      District       Judge,    concurring        in     part     and\n\ndissenting in part.\n\n            I concur fully with the majorityโs thoughtful resolution\n\nof the removal issue.        I disagree, however, with the majorityโs\n\nconclusion    that   the    district      judge    abused     his   discretion        by\n\nprecluding Espositoโs expert witness because I believe that, in\n\nreaching    this   conclusion,      the    majority     has    applied       a    higher\n\ndismissal standard to a Rule 37(c) discretionary sanction.                             I\n\nrespectfully dissent.\n\nI.         Two Standards:           Dismissal and Rule 37(c)(1) Witness\nPreclusion\n\n            A.       The Dismissal Standard\n\n            Dismissal      with    prejudice       is   different          from     other\n\nsanctions.    Benitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 4 (describing dismissal as\n\nโthe harshest sanctionโ); Ortiz-Anglada v. Ortiz-Perez, 183 F.3d\n\n65, 67 (1st Cir. 1999) (describing dismissal with prejudice for\n\nfailure to prosecute as โdrasticโ); Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land\n\nServ., Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1075-76 (1st Cir. 1990) (describing\n\ndismissal as โthe most severe sanctionโ).                   A district court is\n\nallowed to employ dismissal as a sanction โonly when a plaintiffโs\n\nmisconduct is extreme.โ           Young, 330 F.3d at 81.            Dismissal as a\n\nsanction is โreserved for cases of โextremely protracted inaction\n\n(measured in years), disobedience of court orders, ignorance of\n\nwarnings,    contumacious         conduct,    or    some      other        aggravating\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\fcircumstances.โโ        Benitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 4 (quoting Cosme\n\nNieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987)).             Concerns of\n\nfairness underlie this heightened standard, since the law favors\n\nโdisposition on the merits,โ Ortiz-Anglada, 183 F.3d at 66-67, and\n\nthe non-compliant party should be given โnotice and an opportunity\n\nto be heard.โ     Benitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 5.       Further, โwhere the\n\ncase is close, courts should prefer less severe sanctions that\n\npreserve the possibility of disposition on the merits.โ Pomales v.\n\nCelulares Telefonica, Inc., 342 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           B.       The Rule 37(c) Sanction Standard\n\n           The imposition of a lesser sanction under Rule 37(c),\n\nsuch as witness preclusion, is not held to the high dismissal\n\nstandard and does not require egregious and repetitive misconduct.\n\nInstead, Rule 37(c)(1) โrequires the near automatic exclusion of\n\nRule 26 information that is not timely disclosed.โ               Wilson v.\n\nBradlees of New England, Inc., 250 F.3d 10, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThough the automatic nature of the preclusion sanction is softened\n\nby the Macaulay factors, witness preclusion is not held to the\n\nrigorous standards of dismissal.           See Macaulay, 321 F.3d at 51\n\n(listing as factors the history of the litigation, the proponentโs\n\nneed for the challenged evidence, the justification (if any) for\n\nthe late disclosure, the opponentโs ability to overcome its adverse\n\neffects   (such    as   surprise   and   prejudice),    and   court   docket\n\nconsiderations).\n\n                                    -22-\n\f               C.        Leading to Dismissal\n\n               This case touches on which standard applies when the\n\nsanction of witness preclusion ultimately results in dismissal. My\n\nview is that the Rule 37(c)(1) standard applies, not the dismissal\n\nstandard or something in between.\n\nII.            Rule 37(c)(1)\n\n          A.             Automatic       Exclusion       as   the     Sanction    in    the\nOrdinary Case\n\n               Rule 37(c)(1) provides:\n\n               If a party fails to provide information or\n               identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a)\n               or (e), the party is not allowed to use that\n               information or witness to supply evidence on a\n               motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless\n               the failure was substantially justified or is\n               harmless.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).                Esposito violated his obligation to\n\ndisclose his expert testimony first and on time as required both by\n\nRule       26(a)(2)(C)      and   by   the     court    order   in    this    case.3     In\n\nprecluding         Espositoโs     expert,      the     district     court    imposed    the\n\nโautomatic sanctionโ of exclusion.

P. 26 advisory\n\ncommitteeโs note, 1993 amendments (stating that โ[p]aragraph (1)\n\nprevents       a    party    from      using    as     evidence      any    witnesses    or\n\n\n       3\n       Rule 26(a)(2)(C) states that โ[a] party must make these\ndisclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court\norders.โ Fed.

Esposito was required under\nthe terms of the April 16, 2007 Court Order to make his expert\ndisclosures by June 21, 2007 and to make his disclosures before the\ndefendants made theirs. Esposito violated both Rule and the Order.\n\n\n                                             -23-\n\finformation that, without substantial justification, has not been\n\ndisclosed as required by Rules 26(a) and 26(e)(1).

Level 3 Commcโns, Inc.,\n\n272 F.3d 49, 60 (1st Cir. 2001))).          Here, by excluding the expertโs\n\ntestimony, the district court imposed the โmandatory preclusionโ\n\nsanction that the Rule, the advisory committee, and this circuit\n\ncontemplate will be imposed in the โordinary case.โ Santiago-Diaz,\n\n456 F.3d at 276.    I find it difficult to conclude that the district\n\njudge abused his discretion in doing so.\n\n           B.       Exceptions to the Automatic Sanction of Exclusion\n\n           Rule    37(c)    allows   for    exceptions     to    the    automatic\n\nsanction   of   exclusion    when    the   partyโs    failure    to    comply   is\n\nโsubstantially justifiedโ or โharmless.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n\nHere, neither exception applies.\n\n           1.       Substantial Justification\n\n           There    was    no   justification        at   all,   much    less    a\n\nsubstantial one, for Espositoโs failure to timely disclose his\n\nexpert.    Espositoโs attorney ultimately conceded that the failure\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fto comply with express terms of both Rule 26(a) and the court\n\nscheduling order was no oneโs fault but his own.\n\n                  2.     Harmless\n\n                  Examples   of      โharmlessโ   late    disclosure   under      Rule\n\n37(c)(1)          in   the   advisory     committee      notes   suggest   that    the\n\nโharmlessโ component has limited application, and the failure to\n\nmake a timely and complete expert disclosure does not fit.4                        The\n\ndistrict court identified two types of harm caused by Espositoโs\n\nfailure to disclose:            (1) Harm specific to the defendants in this\n\ncase,       and    (2)   harm   to    future   defendants    and   efficient      court\n\nadministration.           Standing alone, each would justify the exclusion\n\nsanction; taken together, the two factors demonstrate that late\n\ndisclosure here was not harmless and the district judgeโs decision\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n\n                  The district courtโs first concern was the impact on the\n\n\n        4\n            The Advisory Committee observed:\n                  Limiting the automatic sanction to violations\n                  โwithout substantial justification,โ coupled\n                  with the exception for violations that are\n                  โharmlessโ is needed to avoid unduly harsh\n                  penalties in a variety of situations, e.g.,\n                  the   inadvertent   omission   from   a   Rule\n                  26(a)(1)(A) disclosure of the name of a\n                  potential witness known to all parties; the\n                  failure to list as a trial witness a person so\n                  listed by another party; or the lack of\n                  knowledge of a pro se litigant of the\n                  requirement to make disclosures.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37 advisory committeeโs note, 1993 amendments.\n\n                                           -25-\n\fdefendants. The magistrate judge (whose opinion the district court\n\nadopted) observed that if Esposito were permitted to make a belated\n\nexpert disclosure, defendants would be forced to have their expert\n\nreview Espositoโs expertโs report and make new disclosures in\n\nresponse.   Further, the magistrate judge noted that the defendants\n\nhad filed a motion for summary judgment based on the absence of a\n\nplaintiffโs expert, and, if the late disclosure were allowed, they\n\nwould have to file a new summary judgment motion or withdraw the\n\none already filed.\n\n            Implicit in these concerns is the effect of Espositoโs\n\nnon-disclosure on the sequential disclosure process mandated by the\n\nscheduling order and the resulting unfairness to the defendants.\n\nBy   Espositoโs     neglect,    the   party   with    the   burden     of   proof\n\nsuccessfully shifted the burden of disclosure.              This is what the\n\ndistrict    judge    was     referring   to    when    he   wrote    that,    if\n\nnoncompliance with scheduling orders resulted in mere fines or\n\ncosts, โ[p]laintiffs might seek to avoid initial expert disclosure\n\nin order to gain unfair advantage in litigation.โ\n\n            The district courtโs second concern has several angles.\n\nFirst, the district judge was troubled that if Espositoโs failure\n\nwere   excused,     future     plaintiffs,    emboldened    by   the    lenient\n\ntreatment of Esposito, might make a cold-blooded judgment that the\n\nadvantage of receiving the defense expertโs opinions first exceeds\n\nthe disadvantage of paying court-ordered fines and costs.                    The\n\n                                      -26-\n\fdistrict judge worried that to some the fines or sanctions might be\n\nโa price worth paying.โ\n\n           The district court expressed a related institutional\n\nconcern that if parties perceive that noncompliance or inattention\n\nto   deadlines   can   be   ignored,   overlooked   without   significant\n\nconsequence, or purchased for a price, the courtโs ability to\n\nefficiently manage its docket would be compromised.           This is not\n\ntrivial.   The federal rules and local practice are rife with time\n\nhurdles, the violation of which can lead to the imposition of a\n\nrange of the exclusion sanction.       This has been a conscious choice\n\nby the Rules Committee. As this circuit has recognized, experience\n\nhas taught that the parties cannot be left to police themselves,\n\nand courts routinely impose and enforce deadlines to bring complex\n\nfederal cases to fruition.     The federal bar is acutely aware of the\n\ncertainty of exclusion, and the lawyers proceed accordingly.            A\n\ndeadline without a sanction severe enough to cause compliance is\n\nnot a deadline at all; it is a suggestion.      See Macaulay, 321 F.3d\n\nat 51 (stating that โtrial judges must work a complicated equation,\n\nbalancing fairness to the parties with the need to manage crowded\n\ndocketsโ).\n\n           In this context, the district court expressed concern\n\nthat the failure to exclude in this case would lead others to seize\n\nupon the benevolence of the district court to gain unwarranted\n\nstrategic advantages, as happened here, by forcing the defense to\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdisclose its experts first. This type of consideration is, as this\n\ncircuit has repeatedly recognized, a legitimate concern for the\n\ndistrict court.      Young, 330 F.3d at 83 (observing that deterrence\n\nof others from similar misconduct is a proper purpose for a\n\ndistrict judge fashioning a sanction); Macaulay, 321 F.3d at 51\n\n(discussing the district judgeโs right to consider the impact of\n\nthe sanction on the courtโs docket); Tower Ventures, Inc., 296 F.3d\n\nat   46   (stating   that     โthe   courtโs    efforts   at    stewardship   are\n\nundermined where, as here, a party cavalierly flouts the courtโs\n\nscheduling ordersโ).\n\n            C.      First Circuit Authority\n\n            There    is   a   decade   of     First   Circuit   authority     that\n\nsupports the exclusion of an expert if a party fails to make a\n\ntimely disclosure.        See Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., 529\n\nF.3d 8, 18 (1st Cir. 2008); Beaudette v. Louisville Ladder, Inc.,\n\n462 F.3d 22, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2006); Santiago-Diaz, 456 F.3d at 276;\n\nGagnon, 437 F.3d at 191; Primus, 389 F.3d at 234-36; Young, 330\n\nF.3d at 81-83; McCaulay, 321 F.3d at 50-53; Tower Ventures, 296\n\nF.3d at 46; Lohnes, 272 F.3d at 59-61; Ortiz-Lopez v. Sociedad\n\nEspanola de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia, 248 F.3d 29, 33-36 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); Klonoski v. Mahlab, 156 F.3d 255, 269 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nDistrict courts in this circuit have routinely followed suit.                 See\n\nAlves v. Mazda Motors of America, Inc., 448 F. Supp. 2d 285, 293-97\n\n(D. Mass. 2006); Peterson v. Scotia Prince Cruises, Ltd., 222\n\n                                       -28-\n\fF.R.D. 216, 217-18 (D. Me. 2004).      I concede that each case stands\n\non its own facts and each can be distinguished in sometimes subtle\n\nand sometimes significant ways, but up to now the consistent\n\nmessage from this circuit has been that the trial bar must comply\n\nwith expert designation orders or face the likelihood that the\n\nexpert witness will be excluded.\n\n          D.    The Decision to Exclude\n\n          The   district   judgeโs     decision   to    exclude   a   late-\n\ndesignated expert would ordinarily pass as an unremarkable and\n\nexpected exercise of judicial discretion.              The district judge\n\nissued a thoughtful written opinion, discussed the sanctioning\n\nalternatives,   and   elected,   for   clearly-stated     and   permissible\n\nreasons, to impose the sanction of exclusion.\n\nIII. The Sanctionโs Result\n\n          What makes this case different than a garden variety\n\nimposition of the automatic sanction of exclusion?          It must be the\n\nharshness of the result:         The district court entered summary\n\njudgment against a person who sustained a serious physical injury\n\nwhile using the defendantsโ product.\n\n          A.    A New Dismissal Standard\n\n          The majority seems to impose a new two-part analysis\n\nbefore a district court may order a sanction that later leads to\n\ndismissal: First, the district court must consider the traditional\n\nRule 37(c) Macaulay factors; second, the district court must\n\n                                  -29-\n\fcompare the violation at issue with conduct that had previously\n\njustified dismissal.5          The majority thus grafts the dismissal\n\nstandard   onto    the   traditional      37(c)   rubric.     In   effect,   the\n\nmajority reads a bifurcated sanction standard into Rule 37(c): For\n\nsanctions not leading to dismissal, the Rule 37(c) discretionary\n\nstandard    as    elaborated    by   Macauley     applies;   for   Rule    37(c)\n\nsanctions leading to dismissal, the higher dismissal standard\n\napplies.\n\n            B.     Rule 37(c) Sanction Resulting in Dismissal\n\n            There are good reasons not to adopt a rule that the\n\nhigher dismissal standard should apply when a district court\n\nimposes a lesser sanction that can over time lead to dismissal.\n\nThe most convincing is that the dispositive impact is not always\n\nobvious    when   the    sanction    is   imposed.6    In    countless    cases,\n\n     5\n        Ironically, the majority introduces this standard in\nreversing the district judge, who applied the same two-step\nanalysis that the majority now proposes.       The district judge\nconsidered all the Rule 37(c) factors and went on to evaluate the\ncase under the dismissal standard, expressly discussing Young and\nTower Ventures. At the same time, I agree with the majority that\nif the higher dismissal standard applies, it would be difficult to\naffirm the district court, since there is no evidence in this\nrecord of Young or Tower Ventures levels of misconduct.\n     6\n       A sanctioning court is often not in a good position to\npredict such consequences. Here, although both parties and the\ndistrict judge correctly predicted that preclusion was tantamount\nto dismissal, it is not inconceivable that Esposito could have\nasserted the malfunction theory to avoid summary judgment. See\nWalker v. General Elec. Co., 968 F.2d 120 (1st Cir. 1992); Canning\nv. Broan-Nutone, LLC, No. 05-15, 2007 WL 1112355, at *16-17 (D.Me.\nMarch 30, 2007) (recognizing the applicability of res ipsa loquitur\nin the product liability context). The point is not that Esposito\nerred in failing to assert the malfunction theory as a defense (it\n\n                                      -30-\n\fseemingly lesser sanctions turn out to be the functional equivalent\n\nto dismissal under a different guise.         Exclusion of a document,\n\nrestriction of the scope of a deposition, striking a late-disclosed\n\nlay witnessโs testimonyโall may seem non-dispositive at the time.\n\nHowever, when the dispositive motion is filed or as the trial\n\nproceeds, the sanction may prove to have been decisive.                  The\n\ndistrict judge who at the time of imposition thinks the sanction is\n\nrelatively lenient may have instead condemned the violator to the\n\ntime and expense of a losing trial.          Even the imposition of a\n\nmonetary   sanction   for   a   party   without   resources   can   be   the\n\nfeatherweight that tips the scales and forces an unfavorable\n\nsettlement.   The point is that the imposition of a sanction must be\n\nevaluated based on the standards applicable to the sanction itself,\n\nnot to its range of potential consequences. Otherwise, in addition\n\nto evaluating and punishing the conduct that precipitated the\n\nsanction, the district judge will be required to assess its overall\n\nimpact on the parties and the case itself, an assessment the\n\ndistrict judge is unlikely to be able to accurately make at the\n\ntime. If the district courtโs prediction that the sanction will be\n\n\nwas likely inapplicable), but that, when he imposed the sanction,\nthe district judge may have incorrectly assumed exclusion would\nautomatically lead to dismissal. If the higher dismissal standard\nis applied to a Rule 37(c) sanction, the court will avoid imposing\na sanction that could lead to dismissal unless the circumstances\nare egregious. If the court has guessed wrong and the exclusion\nwould not have led to dismissal, the offending party will have\navoided exclusion under a more forgiving standard than Rule 37(c)\ncontemplates.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fless than dispositive turns out to be inaccurate, it may well lead\n\nto a retrospective appellate determination that the district court\n\nshould have applied a higher dismissal standard and that it abused\n\nits discretion, not for imposing the sanction, but for failing to\n\naccurately predict its effect.\n\n          I acknowledge that a policy argument can be made that\n\nthere should be a different standard for Rule 37(c) cases, such as\n\nthis one, where โall parties acknowledged that the sanction carried\n\nthe force of a dismissal.โ   But the language of Rule 37(c) does not\n\nsuggest a separate standard for the narrow band of cases where the\n\ndistrict judge is reasonably certain the sanction will end up\n\ncausing a dismissal, and to date the First Circuit has not carved\n\nout such an exception.\n\n          To be clear, I have no quarrel with the proposition that\n\nthe district court should take into consideration the likely\n\nconsequence of a sanction, at least when the judge concludes that\n\nthe consequence is obvious.      The Macauley factors include โthe\n\nproponentโs need for the challenged evidence,โ 321 F.3d at 51, and\n\nthe likelihood that the proponentโs case will fail should be\n\nconsidered under this factor. But here the district judge did just\n\nthat.   In any event, I do not agree that the likelihood of\n\ndismissal should transform a judgeโs discretionary imposition of\n\nthe usual sanction into an abuse of that discretion or, put another\n\nway, that under Macauley, the prospect of dismissal trumps the\n\n                                 -32-\n\fother factors and elevates the usual sanction into a dismissal\n\nanalysis requiring egregious conduct.\n\nIV.   Consequences\n\n           I worry that the majorityโs opinion will leave district\n\njudges at sea as to when they are authorized to impose a sanction\n\nif it leads or could lead to dismissal.             Ironically, under the\n\nmajorityโs formulation, the sanction of exclusion will end up being\n\napplied only when it does not really matter and not imposed when it\n\ndoes.\n\n           It would seem the obverse should be the case:              If the\n\nwitness is critical, the proponent has a compelling incentive to\n\ncomply with the deadlines precisely because the exclusion will mean\n\nmore.   In the long run, I believe the imposition of dismissal\n\nstandards on sanctions leading to dismissal will prove unfortunate.\n\nYoung, 330 F.3d at 83 (โSanctions are often intended to do more\n\nthan calibrate the scales between a particular plaintiff and a\n\nparticular defendant.         One principle purpose is to deter others\n\nfrom similar misconduct.โ).\n\n           I am also worried that the majorityโs decision will be\n\nread to extend to thousands of district court sanction decisions\n\nthat up to now have been viewed as the normal course of business.\n\nThe   failure   to   timely    respond   to   a   motion,   the   failure   to\n\nadequately respond to a statement of material fact in a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the failure to list an exhibit or witness before\n\n                                    -33-\n\ftrial, and the myriad of other routine miscues often lead to\n\nexclusion or waiver and later can be causally traced to an adverse\n\njudgment.        The list goes on and on and is the grist for the\n\ndistrict court mill.         In short, district courts routinely impose\n\nsanctions, great and small, that lead directly and indirectly to\n\none party winning and the other losing.\n\n               I am concerned that the majorityโs opinion will be cited\n\nto force the trial court to back away from imposing what up to now\n\nhas been the expected sanction and that the lackadaisical will draw\n\nheart, the compliant will suffer, and the ability of the district\n\ncourt to manage its docket will be compromised.            To date, district\n\njudges have imposed the Rule 37(c)(1) sanction of exclusion with\n\nconfidence that the appellate court will affirm their exercise of\n\ndiscretion, but from now on, a district court will be wary of\n\nexcluding evidence that could lead later to judgment against the\n\noffending party, unless the violator โengaged in the same level of\n\nfoot-dragging as was present in Tower Ventures, nor sloughed off a\n\nwarning from the district court like the plaintiff in Young.โ                The\n\nnormal    Rule    37(c)(1)    sanction   of   preclusion    for    failure    to\n\ndesignate an expert will become extraordinary, applicable only\n\nwhere    the    violator   has   demonstrated   a   pattern   of   persistent\n\nviolation.        This result runs contrary to the Ruleโs mandate;\n\nexclusion becomes the exception, and a lesser sanction the rule.               7\n\n\n     7\n       As a practical matter, the appellate court may never know the\nextent to which this decision causes district judges to avoid the\n\n                                     -34-\n\f           Finally, the majority states that โa less severe remedy\n\ncould have easily achieved the same aims as the preclusion of the\n\nexpert.โ   Preclusion aside, the other Rule 37(c)(1) sanctions are\n\npayment of reasonable expenses, informing the jury of the partyโs\n\nfailure, any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi), or\n\nโother appropriate sanctions.โ    Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)(A)-(C).\n\nThe orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi) are nearly all the\n\nequivalent of expert preclusion or more severe.         See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.   37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi)   (setting     forth   a   range   of   sanctions,\n\nincluding directing that the matters embraced in the discovery\n\norder be established for purposes of the action, prohibiting the\n\ndisobedient party from supporting or opposing the designated claims\n\nor defenses, striking the pleadings in whole or in part, dismissing\n\nthe action or proceeding in whole or in part, or rendering a\n\ndefault judgment).\n\n           The majority implicitly approves a โlesser sanction, such\n\nas the imposition of fines or costsโ and concludes that โ[i]n the\n\nabsence of a greater conviction that parties will indeed attempt to\n\npurchase their way out of discovery compliance as a result of our\n\n\nautomatic sanction of exclusion. Faced with appellate authority\nstating that, absent a pattern of egregious conduct, witness\nexclusion will constitute an abuse of discretion if it leads to\ndismissal, district courts are likely to seek safer ground and\nimpose lesser sanctions. Neither party is likely to appeal such a\nruling; the offender will not, and the compliant party will know\nthat the lesser sanction fits squarely within the trial courtโs\nbroad range of sanctioning discretion.\n\n                                 -35-\n\fholding in this case, we are not persuaded that the sanction here\n\nwas justified.โ   At least as it concerns the danger of compliance\n\nbeing purchased at a price, the correct monetary sanction is an\n\nexceedingly tricky question.8 What quantum of โgreater convictionโ\n\nwill be necessary before a trial judge can properly conclude that\n\nthe parties have attempted โto purchase their way out of discovery\n\ncomplianceโ?    How does a trial court go about establishing this\n\nfactor?9   And, what amount, if any, will effectively deter parties\n\nfrom attempting to purchase their way out of discovery compliance?\n\n           It is difficult to know on this record, which is exactly\n\nthe point.     As this circuit has often recognized, the district\n\ncourt, with its more intimate familiarity with the parties, the\n\nattorneys, the travel of the case, the court docket, and other\n\nfactors, is in a far better position to make this judgment.   Here,\n\nthe district judge considered the imposition of a monetary sanction\n\nand concluded no amount would work because a fine or costs would\n\nโsend the message that noncompliance or inattention to deadlines\n\ncan be purchased for a price.โ     Instead, he made the difficult,\n\ncase specific judgment to exclude, and I conclude that, in doing\n     8\n       At the same time, I concede that more traditional monetary\nsanction evaluations are not nearly as difficult to calculate, and\ndistrict courts are fully capable of assessing attorneyโs fees and\ncosts for the rippling impact of late expert disclosure.\n     9\n       As Rule 37(c) provides exclusion as the automatic sanction,\nit would seem that the burden to convince the trial court not to\nimpose the sanction of exclusion โ and that offending parties are\nnot attempting to purchase their way out of discovery compliance โ\nshould rest with the offenders, not with the compliant party or the\ntrial court.\n\n                                -36-\n\fso, the district judge acted within the scope of his authorized\n\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n\n                             -37-\n\f",

In    this    diversity   action\n\ninvolving a products liability claim, Robert Esposito challenges\n\nthe district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants, Dewalt Industries, Black & Decker, and Home Depot.\n\nEsposito argues on appeal that the case was improperly removed to\n\nfederal court and that the district court erroneously precluded his\n\nexpert witness.    We reject the argument based on improper removal,\n\nbut we agree that, in the circumstances of this case, the expert\n\nwitness should not have been precluded. Accordingly, we vacate the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                    I.    Facts\n\n           In   March    2003,    while    he     was   operating   a    power   saw\n\nmanufactured by Dewalt Industries (\"Dewalt\"), Robert Esposito's\n\nleft hand came into contact with the saw's unguarded blade.                      The\n\nsaw   severed   three    of   his    fingers,       none   of    which   could   be\n\nreattached.     In March 2006, Esposito filed a complaint in Rhode\n\nIsland state court against Dewalt, Black & Decker (the company that\n\npackaged the saw), and Home Depot (the company that sold the saw).\n\nEsposito claimed that the saw was defective because its blade guard\n\ndid not engage properly and that the defendants were jointly and\n\nseverally liable for his injury.               Home Depot was served with the\n\ncomplaint on March 17.        The other defendants were served on March\n\n21.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f             On April 3, two of the defendants, Dewalt and Black &\n\nDecker, filed a notice of removal in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Rhode Island.       On April 13, the other\n\ndefendant, Home Depot, filed its answer in federal court.\n\n             On May 3, Esposito moved to remand the matter back to the\n\nstate court.    In support of his motion, he claimed a defect in the\n\nremoval process in that Home Depot had not consented to removal\n\nwithin the thirty-day period as required by statute. See 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1446(b).    That failure, Esposito claimed, breached the unanimity\n\nrequirement: that each defendant in a multi-defendant case consent\n\nto removal within thirty days of receiving service. The defendants\n\nopposed Esposito's motion.\n\n             The district court denied the motion, concluding that\n\nHome Depot's answer, which had been filed in federal court within\n\nthe thirty day period, constituted consent to removal under the\n\ncircumstances.     Esposito v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 436 F. Supp.\n\n2d 343, 347 (D.R.I. 2006).\n\n             In July 2006, the district court set pre-trial discovery\n\nand disclosure deadlines, including a deadline for the written\n\ndisclosure of experts under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.     These deadlines were pushed back twice:   first at the\n\nrequest of the defendants and second at the request of Esposito.\n\nThe second extension required the parties to wrap up fact discovery\n\nby May 31, 2007; Esposito to disclose experts by June 21; and the\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdefendants to disclose experts by July 14.                  Dispositive motions\n\nwere due by August 16.\n\n            Operating under this revised timetable, the parties and\n\ntheir   respective    experts     arranged       to   participate     in    a   joint\n\nexamination of the saw.         At this examination, which took place on\n\nApril 20, Steven Thomas inspected the saw on Esposito's behalf.\n\nThomas's curriculum vitae had been sent to the defendants prior to\n\nthis examination.          When the time came to disclose Thomas as his\n\nexpert, however, Esposito failed to do so.               Instead, on August 1,\n\nhe filed a motion requesting that the court further extend the\n\nrelevant    deadlines      by   ninety     days.      The    defendants     opposed\n\nEsposito's extension request and on August 3 they filed a summary\n\njudgment motion premised on the plaintiff's lack of an expert.\n\n            The magistrate judge denied Esposito's request for a\n\nfurther extension, and Esposito appealed this decision to the\n\ndistrict    court.         Expressing     reluctance,       the   district      court\n\nnevertheless endorsed the magistrate judge's decision and denied\n\nEsposito's motion for an extension.              The court recognized that the\n\ndenial of the plaintiff's request for an extension amounted to a\n\ndispositive ruling, noting that \"Both of the parties acknowledge\n\nthat the decision to exclude [Esposito's] expert as a result of\n\nmissing     the   discovery     deadlines        will,   without     much       doubt,\n\neffectively dispose of the case.\" Nevertheless, the district court\n\nconcluded    that    the    denial   of    the     extension,     which    precluded\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fEsposito's expert, was justified.       In so concluding, the district\n\ncourt noted that Esposito had failed to offer a legitimate reason\n\nfor missing the deadline.    The court also expressed its concern\n\nthat lesser sanctions, such as the imposition of fines and costs,\n\nmight \"send the message that noncompliance or inattention to\n\ndeadlines can be purchased for a price.\"\n\n          As predicted, the district court's ruling sounded the\n\ndeath knell for Esposito's case.    The magistrate judge recommended\n\nthat the district court grant the defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment and the district court agreed, entering judgment for the\n\ndefendants.1   This appeal followed.\n\n                          II.    Discussion\n\n          We first examine the removal issue, turning then to the\n\nsanction question.\n\n                            A.    Removal\n\n          Under the removal statute, a defendant in a state court\n\naction may remove the action to federal court so long as the\n\nplaintiff could have originally filed the action in federal court.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441 (permitting removal of cases where the federal\n\ncourt would have had \"original jurisdiction\").       Where the action\n\ninvolves multiple defendants, however, the right of removal is\n\nsubject to the so-called \"unanimity requirement.\"        See Chicago,\n\n\n     1\n        In opposing the defendants' summary judgment motion,\nEsposito provided and relied upon an engineering report from\nThomas. The magistrate judge struck this report.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fRock Island & Pac. Ry. Co. v.

See Chicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co., 178 U.S. at\n\n247-48.    That is, subject to a few exceptions not applicable here,\n\nall defendants must consent to remove the case for removal to be\n\neffected.       Id.; see also 11C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Plaintiffs    are\n\nadvantaged, because, were the right to removal an independent\n\nrather than joint right, defendants could split the litigation,\n\nforcing a plaintiff to pursue its case in two separate forums.

Before\n\nthe district court, as he does now, Esposito argued that Home Depot\n\nfailed to consent to removal within the statutorily prescribed\n\nthirty-day period.    The district court rejected this argument.             As\n\nnoted above, it concluded that Home Depot's answer in federal\n\ncourt, filed within the applicable thirty day period, constituted\n\nconsent to removal under the circumstances of the case. Our review\n\nof this conclusion is de novo.

We\n\nhave   not   spoken     directly   to   the    question,    but   a   number   of\n\nguideposts do exist.\n\n             The removal statute itself speaks generally to the manner\n\nof removal.     In relevant part, section (a) provides that:\n\n             [A] defendant or defendants desiring to remove\n             any civil action . . . from a State court\n             shall file in the [appropriate] district court\n             of the United States a notice of removal\n             signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal\n             Rules of Civil Procedure and containing a\n             short and plain statement of the grounds for\n             removal, together with a copy of all process,\n             pleadings, and orders served upon such\n             defendant or defendants in such action.\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1446(a).\n\n             Consistent with this statute, a defendant may express its\n\ndesire to remove by signing the notice of removal filed by co-\n\ndefendants.

When\n\nreviewing the district court's sanction decision we must keep in\n\nmind that district courts are generally in a better position to\n\ndetermine the propriety of a particular sanction and, accordingly,\n\nour review of the district court's ultimate choice is deferential.\n\nAnas, 321 F.3d at 51 (\"Because trial judges tend to have an\n\nintimate knowledge of the variables that enter into the equation,\n\nappellate review of sanctions orders is deferential.\") (citations\n\nomitted); Fashion House, Inc. v.

Consistent with this deference, we review a\n\ndistrict court's decision to exclude expert evidence for an abuse\n\nof discretion, understanding that the sanctioned party shoulders a\n\n\"heavy burden\" when attempting to show that such an abuse has\n\noccurred.   See Santiago-Diaz, 456 F.3d at 275.2\n\n\n     2\n       We note that Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\ngives district courts great discretion to issue sanctions where a\nparty fails to comply with case-management deadlines. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 16(f). It is not entirely clear whether the preclusion sanction\nhere was levied under Rule 16 or Rule 37, although Esposito cited\nRule 37 in his motion to permit expert testimony. In any event,\n\n                               -13-\n\f            Here, the district court was undoubtedly entitled to\n\nimpose some type of sanction on Esposito.                 Esposito failed to\n\ncomply with a court-imposed deadline that he himself had suggested,\n\nand he could not offer a legitimate justification for his non-\n\ncompliance. And despite Esposito's argument that the appearance of\n\nhis expert at the inspection of the saw constituted an \"informal\n\ndisclosure,\" the rules require formal disclosure for a reason:\n\nwithout it, parties like the defendants in this case may be\n\nhindered in their ability to prepare effectively for trial.                 See\n\nFed.   R.   Civ.   P.    26   (a)(2)(B)      (establishing   that,    \"[u]nless\n\notherwise     stipulated      or   ordered    by   the   court,\"    the   formal\n\ndisclosure of an expert \"must be accompanied by a written report\"\n\nthat contains a host of information relevant to the expert's\n\ntestimony).\n\n            Nevertheless, whether the facts here justified the actual\n\nsanction imposed -- the preclusion of the expert witness -- is a\n\ncloser question.        We start by stating the obvious.           The sanction\n\nhere had serious consequences.         Esposito's need for the expert was\n\nso great that the magistrate judge's decision to preclude the\n\n\n\n\nwhether we are reviewing a sanction imposed under Rule 16 or Rule\n37, the considerations are generally the same, as is the deference\nwe afford the district court's choice of sanction. See Santiago-\nDiaz, 456 F.3d at 277 (discussing cases dealing with sanctions\nimposed under Rule 16 in examining the preclusion of evidence under\nRule 37). Accordingly, we would reach the same result here under\neither rule.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fexpert, although technically not a dismissal of Esposito's case,\n\neffectively amounted to one.

The district court acknowledged as much\n\nwhen it affirmed the magistrate judge's imposition of the sanction,\n\nobserving that \"Both of the parties acknowledge that the decision\n\nto exclude the Plaintiff's expert as a result of missing the\n\ndiscovery deadlines will, without much doubt, effectively dispose\n\nof the case.\"\n\n          Because   all    parties     acknowledged        that   the   sanction\n\ncarried the force of a dismissal, the justification for it must be\n\ncomparatively more robust.

After      considering      the    other    relevant     factors\n\ndescribed above, we conclude that the circumstances here do not\n\njustify such strong medicine.\n\n          In reaching this conclusion, we view the history of the\n\nlitigation as particularly enlightening.            This is not a case of a\n\nparty repeatedly balking at court-imposed deadlines.                    Esposito\n\nmissed one deadline and requested an extension of the pre-trial and\n\ntrial dates after missing that deadline, albeit several weeks after\n\nthe deadline had passed.     Compare Santiago-Diaz, 456 F.3d at 277 &\n\n                                     -15-\n\fn.4 (noting, in upholding the preclusion of a late-disclosed expert\n\nwitness, that the sanctioned party's \"dereliction was both obvious\n\nand repeated\" and that \"[t]he record makes manifest that the\n\nplaintiff was guilty of several discovery violations besides those\n\nrelated to her expert witness\").            Nor is this a case where the\n\nsanctioned party ignored pre-sanction warnings from the district\n\ncourt.   See Young, 330 F.3d at 79.          Nor does this case involve,\n\nfrom all appearances, an act of calculated gamesmanship on the part\n\nof the sanctioned party.     Neither the defendants nor the district\n\ncourt in this case have characterized Esposito's failure to comply\n\nwith the disclosure deadline as strategic in nature.\n\n           To be sure, not every factor cuts in Esposito's favor.\n\nFirst,   he   never    offered   a   legitimate    reason   for   his   late\n\ndisclosure.     See Macaulay, 321 F.3d at 52 (finding that the\n\ndistrict court's preclusion of the expert evidence was appropriate\n\nwhere, among other things, \"the appellant [had not] advanced any\n\nreal justification for [the] tardy emergence [of the expert's\n\nreport]\").    Second, although the defendants here do not discuss in\n\nany great detail how the late disclosure prejudiced them, they\n\nobviously went through the pains of preparing a dispositive summary\n\njudgment motion premised on Esposito's lack of an expert in an\n\nexpert-dependent case. See Gagnon v. Teledyne Princeton, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202058\"><a href=\"/opinion/202058/gagnon-v-teledyne-princeton/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[P]rejudice also exists in [the\n\ndefendants]   having    prepared     a   dispositive   motion   for   summary\n\n                                     -16-\n\fjudgment predicated on the preclusion of the expert testimony.\");\n\nPrimus, 389 F.3d at 236.        And finally, Esposito's failure to\n\ndisclose his expert by the scheduled date had a clear effect on the\n\ndistrict court's docket.     In his motion to extend, Esposito sought\n\nto push back the relevant pre-trial and trial dates by ninety days,\n\nrequiring the district court to further move dates that had already\n\nbeen extended twice.\n\n           Even taking these considerations into account, however,\n\nwe still must face up to the fact that we are presented with a\n\nfatal sanction levied for a single oversight.        We have not been\n\nable to uncover a case from this circuit sustaining a comparable\n\nsanction   under   similar   circumstances.

In our view, a\n\nless severe remedy could have easily achieved the same aims as the\n\npreclusion of the expert while still giving Esposito, potentially\n\nthe innocent victim of a defective product, his day in court.\n\nMalot, 478 F.3d at 43 (recognizing \"the strong presumption in favor\n\n                                  -17-\n\fof   deciding    cases    on   the    merits\");    Young,   330   F.3d       at   81\n\n(referencing the \"salutary policy favoring the disposition of cases\n\non the merits\").\n\n            The defendants urge us to uphold the district court's\n\nsanction.       They    rely   principally    on   our   decisions      in   Tower\n\nVentures, Inc. and Young.            In both of these cases, we upheld a\n\ndistrict court's decision to dismiss the case of a party that had\n\nfailed to comply with case-management deadlines.             Tower Ventures,\n\nInc., 296 F.3d at 48; Young, 330 F.3d at 83.                In each of those\n\ncases, however, the conduct of the sanctioned party was measurably\n\nmore egregious than Esposito's conduct was here.\n\n            In Tower Ventures, Inc., the sanctioned party, Tower\n\nVentures,    had      committed   \"serial     violations    of    the    court's\n\nscheduling order.\"        296 F.3d at 45.      The violations were missed\n\ndiscovery deadlines, and the final one was particularly flagrant:\n\nTower Ventures waited eighty-one days after the discovery deadline\n\nhad passed, and eighteen days after its motion for summary judgment\n\nwas due, to ask the court for a further extension.                Id.    By that\n\ntime, the district court had already issued a show cause order,\n\nasking Tower Ventures why its action should not be dismissed with\n\nprejudice.      Id.\n\n            In Young, the district court dismissed Young's case\n\nbecause of Young's \"repeated failures to comply with court orders.\"\n\n330 F.3d at 78.          In particular, Young (i) failed to join the\n\n                                       -18-\n\fopposition in filing a joint statement containing a proposed\n\npretrial schedule as ordered by the court; (ii) did not respond to\n\nthe opposition's counter-claims until the court warned him that his\n\nfailure to do so could result in a dismissal; and (iii) refused to\n\nappear for his own deposition, even after the court ordered him to\n\nappear and warned him that a failure to do so could result in a\n\ndismissal of his action.    Id. at 79.\n\n          Here,   by   contrast,   Esposito   missed   only   one   court-\n\nscheduled deadline, and his behavior was not nearly as brazen as\n\nthe behavior of the sanctioned parties in either of those cases.\n\nHe neither engaged in the same level of foot-dragging as was\n\npresent in Tower Ventures, nor sloughed off a warning from the\n\ndistrict court like the plaintiff in Young.\n\n          We do not wish to casually discount the district court's\n\nconcern that a lesser sanction, such as the imposition of fines or\n\ncosts, might send a message to other litigants that \"inattention to\n\ndeadlines can be purchased for a price.\"       The deterrence value of\n\na sanction may certainty factor into a district court's calculus.\n\nBut, allowing the general interest in deterrence to hold too much\n\nsway in the analysis runs afoul of the principle that \"sanction[s]\n\nmust be handled on a case-by-case basis.\"       Young, 330 F.3d at 81.\n\nIn other words, the punishment must approximately fit the crime.\n\nHere, it did not.      In the absence of a greater conviction that\n\nparties will indeed attempt to purchase their way out of discovery\n\n                                   -19-\n\fcompliance as a result of our holding in this case, we are not\n\npersuaded that the sanction here was justified.\n\n                              III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons provided above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's   denial   of   the   motion   to   remand,   but   we   reverse   the\n\nexclusion of the expert testimony, vacate the entry of summary\n\njudgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion, including the possible imposition of sanctions within the\n\ndistrict court's discretion.

Standing alone, each would justify the exclusion\n\nsanction; taken together, the two factors demonstrate that late\n\ndisclosure here was not harmless and the district judgeโs decision\n\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n\n                  The district courtโs first concern was the impact on the\n\n\n        4\n            The Advisory Committee observed:\n                  Limiting the automatic sanction to violations\n                  โwithout substantial justification,โ coupled\n                  with the exception for violations that are\n                  โharmlessโ is needed to avoid unduly harsh\n                  penalties in a variety of situations, e.g.,\n                  the   inadvertent   omission   from   a   Rule\n                  26(a)(1)(A) disclosure of the name of a\n                  potential witness known to all parties; the\n                  failure to list as a trial witness a person so\n                  listed by another party; or the lack of\n                  knowledge of a pro se litigant of the\n                  requirement to make disclosures.\n\nFed.

The magistrate judge (whose opinion the district court\n\nadopted) observed that if Esposito were permitted to make a belated\n\nexpert disclosure, defendants would be forced to have their expert\n\nreview Espositoโs expertโs report and make new disclosures in\n\nresponse.   Further, the magistrate judge noted that the defendants\n\nhad filed a motion for summary judgment based on the absence of a\n\nplaintiffโs expert, and, if the late disclosure were allowed, they\n\nwould have to file a new summary judgment motion or withdraw the\n\none already filed.\n\n            Implicit in these concerns is the effect of Espositoโs\n\nnon-disclosure on the sequential disclosure process mandated by the\n\nscheduling order and the resulting unfairness to the defendants.\n\nBy   Espositoโs     neglect,    the   party   with    the   burden     of   proof\n\nsuccessfully shifted the burden of disclosure.              This is what the\n\ndistrict    judge    was     referring   to    when    he   wrote    that,    if\n\nnoncompliance with scheduling orders resulted in mere fines or\n\ncosts, โ[p]laintiffs might seek to avoid initial expert disclosure\n\nin order to gain unfair advantage in litigation.โ\n\n            The district courtโs second concern has several angles.\n\nFirst, the district judge was troubled that if Espositoโs failure\n\nwere   excused,     future     plaintiffs,    emboldened    by   the    lenient\n\ntreatment of Esposito, might make a cold-blooded judgment that the\n\nadvantage of receiving the defense expertโs opinions first exceeds\n\nthe disadvantage of paying court-ordered fines and costs.                    The\n\n                                      -26-\n\fdistrict judge worried that to some the fines or sanctions might be\n\nโa price worth paying.โ\n\n           The district court expressed a related institutional\n\nconcern that if parties perceive that noncompliance or inattention\n\nto   deadlines   can   be   ignored,   overlooked   without   significant\n\nconsequence, or purchased for a price, the courtโs ability to\n\nefficiently manage its docket would be compromised.           This is not\n\ntrivial.   The federal rules and local practice are rife with time\n\nhurdles, the violation of which can lead to the imposition of a\n\nrange of the exclusion sanction.       This has been a conscious choice\n\nby the Rules Committee. As this circuit has recognized, experience\n\nhas taught that the parties cannot be left to police themselves,\n\nand courts routinely impose and enforce deadlines to bring complex\n\nfederal cases to fruition.     The federal bar is acutely aware of the\n\ncertainty of exclusion, and the lawyers proceed accordingly.            A\n\ndeadline without a sanction severe enough to cause compliance is\n\nnot a deadline at all; it is a suggestion.      See Macaulay, 321 F.3d\n\nat 51 (stating that โtrial judges must work a complicated equation,\n\nbalancing fairness to the parties with the need to manage crowded\n\ndocketsโ).\n\n           In this context, the district court expressed concern\n\nthat the failure to exclude in this case would lead others to seize\n\nupon the benevolence of the district court to gain unwarranted\n\nstrategic advantages, as happened here, by forcing the defense to\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdisclose its experts first. This type of consideration is, as this\n\ncircuit has repeatedly recognized, a legitimate concern for the\n\ndistrict court.

I concede that each case stands\n\non its own facts and each can be distinguished in sometimes subtle\n\nand sometimes significant ways, but up to now the consistent\n\nmessage from this circuit has been that the trial bar must comply\n\nwith expert designation orders or face the likelihood that the\n\nexpert witness will be excluded.\n\n          D.    The Decision to Exclude\n\n          The   district   judgeโs     decision   to    exclude   a   late-\n\ndesignated expert would ordinarily pass as an unremarkable and\n\nexpected exercise of judicial discretion.              The district judge\n\nissued a thoughtful written opinion, discussed the sanctioning\n\nalternatives,   and   elected,   for   clearly-stated     and   permissible\n\nreasons, to impose the sanction of exclusion.\n\nIII. The Sanctionโs Result\n\n          What makes this case different than a garden variety\n\nimposition of the automatic sanction of exclusion?          It must be the\n\nharshness of the result:         The district court entered summary\n\njudgment against a person who sustained a serious physical injury\n\nwhile using the defendantsโ product.\n\n          A.    A New Dismissal Standard\n\n          The majority seems to impose a new two-part analysis\n\nbefore a district court may order a sanction that later leads to\n\ndismissal: First, the district court must consider the traditional\n\nRule 37(c) Macaulay factors; second, the district court must\n\n                                  -29-\n\fcompare the violation at issue with conduct that had previously\n\njustified dismissal.5          The majority thus grafts the dismissal\n\nstandard   onto    the   traditional      37(c)   rubric.     In   effect,   the\n\nmajority reads a bifurcated sanction standard into Rule 37(c): For\n\nsanctions not leading to dismissal, the Rule 37(c) discretionary\n\nstandard    as    elaborated    by   Macauley     applies;   for   Rule    37(c)\n\nsanctions leading to dismissal, the higher dismissal standard\n\napplies.\n\n            B.     Rule 37(c) Sanction Resulting in Dismissal\n\n            There are good reasons not to adopt a rule that the\n\nhigher dismissal standard should apply when a district court\n\nimposes a lesser sanction that can over time lead to dismissal.\n\nThe most convincing is that the dispositive impact is not always\n\nobvious    when   the    sanction    is   imposed.6    In    countless    cases,\n\n     5\n        Ironically, the majority introduces this standard in\nreversing the district judge, who applied the same two-step\nanalysis that the majority now proposes.       The district judge\nconsidered all the Rule 37(c) factors and went on to evaluate the\ncase under the dismissal standard, expressly discussing Young and\nTower Ventures. At the same time, I agree with the majority that\nif the higher dismissal standard applies, it would be difficult to\naffirm the district court, since there is no evidence in this\nrecord of Young or Tower Ventures levels of misconduct.\n     6\n       A sanctioning court is often not in a good position to\npredict such consequences. Here, although both parties and the\ndistrict judge correctly predicted that preclusion was tantamount\nto dismissal, it is not inconceivable that Esposito could have\nasserted the malfunction theory to avoid summary judgment. See\nWalker v. General Elec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992); Canning\nv. Broan-Nutone, LLC, No. 05-15, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1112355</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16-17 (D.Me.\nMarch 30, 2007) (recognizing the applicability of res ipsa loquitur\nin the product liability context). The point is not that Esposito\nerred in failing to assert the malfunction theory as a defense (it\n\n                                      -30-\n\fseemingly lesser sanctions turn out to be the functional equivalent\n\nto dismissal under a different guise.         Exclusion of a document,\n\nrestriction of the scope of a deposition, striking a late-disclosed\n\nlay witnessโs testimonyโall may seem non-dispositive at the time.\n\nHowever, when the dispositive motion is filed or as the trial\n\nproceeds, the sanction may prove to have been decisive.                  The\n\ndistrict judge who at the time of imposition thinks the sanction is\n\nrelatively lenient may have instead condemned the violator to the\n\ntime and expense of a losing trial.          Even the imposition of a\n\nmonetary   sanction   for   a   party   without   resources   can   be   the\n\nfeatherweight that tips the scales and forces an unfavorable\n\nsettlement.   The point is that the imposition of a sanction must be\n\nevaluated based on the standards applicable to the sanction itself,\n\nnot to its range of potential consequences. Otherwise, in addition\n\nto evaluating and punishing the conduct that precipitated the\n\nsanction, the district judge will be required to assess its overall\n\nimpact on the parties and the case itself, an assessment the\n\ndistrict judge is unlikely to be able to accurately make at the\n\ntime. If the district courtโs prediction that the sanction will be\n\n\nwas likely inapplicable), but that, when he imposed the sanction,\nthe district judge may have incorrectly assumed exclusion would\nautomatically lead to dismissal. If the higher dismissal standard\nis applied to a Rule 37(c) sanction, the court will avoid imposing\na sanction that could lead to dismissal unless the circumstances\nare egregious. If the court has guessed wrong and the exclusion\nwould not have led to dismissal, the offending party will have\navoided exclusion under a more forgiving standard than Rule 37(c)\ncontemplates.\n\n                                   -31-\n\fless than dispositive turns out to be inaccurate, it may well lead\n\nto a retrospective appellate determination that the district court\n\nshould have applied a higher dismissal standard and that it abused\n\nits discretion, not for imposing the sanction, but for failing to\n\naccurately predict its effect.\n\n          I acknowledge that a policy argument can be made that\n\nthere should be a different standard for Rule 37(c) cases, such as\n\nthis one, where โall parties acknowledged that the sanction carried\n\nthe force of a dismissal.โ   But the language of Rule 37(c) does not\n\nsuggest a separate standard for the narrow band of cases where the\n\ndistrict judge is reasonably certain the sanction will end up\n\ncausing a dismissal, and to date the First Circuit has not carved\n\nout such an exception.\n\n          To be clear, I have no quarrel with the proposition that\n\nthe district court should take into consideration the likely\n\nconsequence of a sanction, at least when the judge concludes that\n\nthe consequence is obvious.      The Macauley factors include โthe\n\nproponentโs need for the challenged evidence,โ 321 F.3d at 51, and\n\nthe likelihood that the proponentโs case will fail should be\n\nconsidered under this factor. But here the district judge did just\n\nthat.   In any event, I do not agree that the likelihood of\n\ndismissal should transform a judgeโs discretionary imposition of\n\nthe usual sanction into an abuse of that discretion or, put another\n\nway, that under Macauley, the prospect of dismissal trumps the\n\n                                 -32-\n\fother factors and elevates the usual sanction into a dismissal\n\nanalysis requiring egregious conduct.\n\nIV.   Consequences\n\n           I worry that the majorityโs opinion will leave district\n\njudges at sea as to when they are authorized to impose a sanction\n\nif it leads or could lead to dismissal.             Ironically, under the\n\nmajorityโs formulation, the sanction of exclusion will end up being\n\napplied only when it does not really matter and not imposed when it\n\ndoes.\n\n           It would seem the obverse should be the case:              If the\n\nwitness is critical, the proponent has a compelling incentive to\n\ncomply with the deadlines precisely because the exclusion will mean\n\nmore.   In the long run, I believe the imposition of dismissal\n\nstandards on sanctions leading to dismissal will prove unfortunate.\n\nYoung, 330 F.3d at 83 (โSanctions are often intended to do more\n\nthan calibrate the scales between a particular plaintiff and a\n\nparticular defendant.         One principle purpose is to deter others\n\nfrom similar misconduct.โ).\n\n           I am also worried that the majorityโs decision will be\n\nread to extend to thousands of district court sanction decisions\n\nthat up to now have been viewed as the normal course of business.\n\nThe   failure   to   timely    respond   to   a   motion,   the   failure   to\n\nadequately respond to a statement of material fact in a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the failure to list an exhibit or witness before\n\n                                    -33-\n\ftrial, and the myriad of other routine miscues often lead to\n\nexclusion or waiver and later can be causally traced to an adverse\n\njudgment.        The list goes on and on and is the grist for the\n\ndistrict court mill.         In short, district courts routinely impose\n\nsanctions, great and small, that lead directly and indirectly to\n\none party winning and the other losing.\n\n               I am concerned that the majorityโs opinion will be cited\n\nto force the trial court to back away from imposing what up to now\n\nhas been the expected sanction and that the lackadaisical will draw\n\nheart, the compliant will suffer, and the ability of the district\n\ncourt to manage its docket will be compromised.            To date, district\n\njudges have imposed the Rule 37(c)(1) sanction of exclusion with\n\nconfidence that the appellate court will affirm their exercise of\n\ndiscretion, but from now on, a district court will be wary of\n\nexcluding evidence that could lead later to judgment against the\n\noffending party, unless the violator โengaged in the same level of\n\nfoot-dragging as was present in Tower Ventures, nor sloughed off a\n\nwarning from the district court like the plaintiff in Young.โ                The\n\nnormal    Rule    37(c)(1)    sanction   of   preclusion    for    failure    to\n\ndesignate an expert will become extraordinary, applicable only\n\nwhere    the    violator   has   demonstrated   a   pattern   of   persistent\n\nviolation.        This result runs contrary to the Ruleโs mandate;\n\nexclusion becomes the exception, and a lesser sanction the rule.               7\n\n\n     7\n       As a practical matter, the appellate court may never know the\nextent to which this decision causes district judges to avoid the\n\n                                     -34-\n\f           Finally, the majority states that โa less severe remedy\n\ncould have easily achieved the same aims as the preclusion of the\n\nexpert.โ   Preclusion aside, the other Rule 37(c)(1) sanctions are\n\npayment of reasonable expenses, informing the jury of the partyโs\n\nfailure, any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi), or\n\nโother appropriate sanctions.โ    Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)(A)-(C).\n\nThe orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi) are nearly all the\n\nequivalent of expert preclusion or more severe.         See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.   37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi)   (setting     forth   a   range   of   sanctions,\n\nincluding directing that the matters embraced in the discovery\n\norder be established for purposes of the action, prohibiting the\n\ndisobedient party from supporting or opposing the designated claims\n\nor defenses, striking the pleadings in whole or in part, dismissing\n\nthe action or proceeding in whole or in part, or rendering a\n\ndefault judgment).\n\n           The majority implicitly approves a โlesser sanction, such\n\nas the imposition of fines or costsโ and concludes that โ[i]n the\n\nabsence of a greater conviction that parties will indeed attempt to\n\npurchase their way out of discovery compliance as a result of our\n\n\nautomatic sanction of exclusion. Faced with appellate authority\nstating that, absent a pattern of egregious conduct, witness\nexclusion will constitute an abuse of discretion if it leads to\ndismissal, district courts are likely to seek safer ground and\nimpose lesser sanctions. Neither party is likely to appeal such a\nruling; the offender will not, and the compliant party will know\nthat the lesser sanction fits squarely within the trial courtโs\nbroad range of sanctioning discretion.\n\n                                 -35-\n\fholding in this case, we are not persuaded that the sanction here\n\nwas justified.โ   At least as it concerns the danger of compliance\n\nbeing purchased at a price, the correct monetary sanction is an\n\nexceedingly tricky question.8 What quantum of โgreater convictionโ\n\nwill be necessary before a trial judge can properly conclude that\n\nthe parties have attempted โto purchase their way out of discovery\n\ncomplianceโ?    How does a trial court go about establishing this\n\nfactor?9   And, what amount, if any, will effectively deter parties\n\nfrom attempting to purchase their way out of discovery compliance?\n\n           It is difficult to know on this record, which is exactly\n\nthe point.     As this circuit has often recognized, the district\n\ncourt, with its more intimate familiarity with the parties, the\n\nattorneys, the travel of the case, the court docket, and other\n\nfactors, is in a far better position to make this judgment.   Here,\n\nthe district judge considered the imposition of a monetary sanction\n\nand concluded no amount would work because a fine or costs would\n\nโsend the message that noncompliance or inattention to deadlines\n\ncan be purchased for a price.โ     Instead, he made the difficult,\n\ncase specific judgment to exclude, and I conclude that, in doing\n     8\n       At the same time, I concede that more traditional monetary\nsanction evaluations are not nearly as difficult to calculate, and\ndistrict courts are fully capable of assessing attorneyโs fees and\ncosts for the rippling impact of late expert disclosure.\n     9\n       As Rule 37(c) provides exclusion as the automatic sanction,\nit would seem that the burden to convince the trial court not to\nimpose the sanction of exclusion โ and that offending parties are\nnot attempting to purchase their way out of discovery compliance โ\nshould rest with the offenders, not with the compliant party or the\ntrial court.\n\n                                -36-\n\fso, the district judge acted within the scope of his authorized\n\ndiscretion.\n\n\n\n\n                             -37-\n\f</pre>",
