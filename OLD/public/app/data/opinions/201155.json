Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Timothy Q. Feeley, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Catherine K. Byrne, Federal Defender Office, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            July 27, 2004\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    Luis Amaya Manzanares (\"Amaya\"), a\n\nnative of El Salvador, apparently entered the United States without\n\nauthorization; the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"),\n\nas it was then called, says that it has no record of a lawful entry\n\nby Amaya.     In 1990, Amaya applied for asylum and was granted an\n\n\"employment authorization card\" by the INS, renewed annually while\n\nhis asylum claim was being considered.        See 8 C.F.R. § 264.1(b)\n\n(2004). The card differs from the alien registration card--the so-\n\ncalled \"green card\"--available to aliens who are legal permanent\n\nresidents.    See id.\n\n            According to the government, Amaya sought employment in\n\nlate 2001 and early 2002 with two different service companies doing\n\nbusiness in secure areas at Logan Airport in Boston. Under federal\n\nregulations, such employment requires an access badge granted after\n\nreview of an application to the airport operator and a criminal\n\nbackground check.       In support of his applications, the government\n\nsays that Amaya submitted both his genuine employment authorization\n\ncard and a green card bearing his name, photo, signature and actual\n\n\"alien number\" issued incident to his asylum application.\n\n             Thereafter, the government says that it determined that\n\nthe green card was a forgery. INS records, according to the\n\ngovernment, show that no green card was ever issued to Amaya. In\n\nApril 2002, a grand jury indicted Amaya for use or attempted use of\n\na forged, counterfeited, altered or falsely made green card.        18\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 1546(a) (2000). Thereafter, in October 2002, the district\n\ncourt scheduled trial for January 6, 2003.\n\n            On December 31, 2002, the prosecutor told defense counsel\n\nthat the prosecution had just learned that an INS agent not\n\ninvolved in the case had spoken to Amaya on or about January 24,\n\n2002, and that Amaya had made inculpatory statements concerning his\n\nacquisition of the green card.    On January 2, 2003, Amaya moved to\n\ndismiss the indictment because of the \"late disclosure.\"    After an\n\nevidentiary hearing held the next day, the district court refused\n\nto dismiss but ordered that any statements by Amaya to the agent be\n\nsuppressed.1\n\n            On January 2, 2003, the government also filed a trial\n\nbrief and list of trial exhibits, including two exhibits provided\n\nto Amaya's counsel on December 31, 2002.      One exhibit, entitled\n\n\"certificate of nonexistence of record,\" was prepared by the chief\n\nof the INS Records Services Branch on December 30, 2002, and stated\n\nin part that the INS maintained records of entry and that a\n\ndiligent search showed no \"lawful admission\" into the United States\n\nby Amaya.   A second exhibit, similarly titled, said that there was\n\nno record of issuance of the green card used by Amaya.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The district court did not dispute the prosecutor's claim\nthat his office was unaware of the agent's encounter with Amaya\nuntil December 31, 2002, and that the evidence was then promptly\ndisclosed; but in any event the government has not sought review of\nthe suppression order.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f             On January 6, 2003, the date scheduled for trial, Amaya\n\nmoved to exclude both exhibits on the ground that they had been\n\ndisclosed    unduly     late,    allegedly    in   violation     of    applicable\n\ndisclosure     rules.      Amaya      also   argued   that     the    certificate\n\nindicating Amaya's unlawful entry was irrelevant and, if relevant,\n\nshould be excluded as unduly prejudicial.             Fed. R. Evid. 401, 403.\n\nAmaya also moved in limine to suppress, as irrelevant and unduly\n\nprejudicial, any testimony that Amaya had entered the country\n\nunlawfully.\n\n             When the district judge took the bench, he announced that\n\nhe was granting both motions. He said, perhaps referring mainly to\n\nfirst of the two certificates but logically encompassing both, that\n\nthe evidence had not been turned over in timely fashion.                      And,\n\napparently referring to the testimony as to unlawful entry, the\n\njudge said that he would exclude it too because \"I don't think it\n\nis relevant at all to the issue in this case.\"\n\n             The prosecutor then asked to address the court, defended\n\nthe disclosure     of    the    certificates    as    timely   and    urged   that\n\nevidence of Amaya's unlawful entry was being offered \"simply to\n\nprove the crime that he is charged with.\"                 The district court\n\nreiterated its ruling, noting that it was not suggesting bad faith\n\nby the government.       Further argument by a supervising prosecutor\n\nwas   also    unavailing        and   the    government      then     filed   this\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\finterlocutory appeal from the January 6 ruling.            18 U.S.C. § 3731\n\n(2000).2\n\n              The controlling issue is whether evidence that Amaya\n\nentered the country unlawfully is admissible to show an element of\n\nthe crime charged.        Although the district court excluded proposed\n\ndocumentary evidence to that effect--the certificate indicating\n\nlack of lawful entry--on a procedural ground, the court also ruled\n\nthat any testimonial reference to Amaya’s unlawful entry was barred\n\nas irrelevant.       If the latter ruling is sound, the certificate\n\ninsofar as it relates to unlawful entry would be inadmissible even\n\nwithout the procedural bar.\n\n              Nevertheless,   the   procedural    ruling    has   substantial\n\nimplications for the government’s conduct of future prosecutions\n\nand so it is best to begin by addressing that ruling.             The Federal\n\nRules    of    Criminal    Procedure    provide   that,    on   request,   the\n\ngovernment in a criminal case must disclose to the defense\n\n              books, papers, documents, data, photographs,\n              tangible objects, buildings or places . . . if\n              the   item   is   within   the   government’s\n              possession, custody, or control and . . . the\n\n\n     2\n      The judge excluded both the certificate and related testimony\nbefore hearing from the prosecutor and then, when requested, gave\nthe prosecutor an opportunity to change the court's mind. Although\nthe prosecutor may not have explicitly stated that he wanted the\ncourt to reconsider its ruling as to the testimony as well as the\ncertificate, the relevance issue is common to both and the\nprosecutor did more than enough to make plain the government's view\nthat the unlawful entry evidence was relevant to an element of the\ncrime. Thus, we treat the objection as fully preserved. Cf. Beech\nAircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. 153, 174-75 & n.22 (1988).\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           government intends to use the item in its\n           case-in-chief at trial.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E).       By local rule, the district court\n\nrequires such production within 28 days of arraignment.             D. Mass.\n\nR. 116.1(C)(1)(a).3   Whether Rule 16(a)(1)(E) is intended to apply\n\nto substitutes for testimony, such as a deposition or certificate\n\nas to what government records do or do not contain, may be open to\n\nquestion; but we will assume arguendo that the rules do apply.\n\n           Nevertheless, the rule by its terms is directed to\n\nmaterials that the government actually possesses. By contrast, the\n\ndocument in question, which was a short-cut to avoid having a\n\nrecord-keeper testify, was created for trial purposes well after\n\nthe arraignment (and then promptly turned over to the defense);\n\nindeed, it was created--perhaps on a precautionary basis--just\n\nbefore   the   district   court   ruled,   shortly   in   advance    of   the\n\nscheduled trial, that the government could not offer Amaya's\n\nadmission that he had bought the green card.\n\n           On the face of the matter, Rule 16(a)(1)(E) did not apply\n\nto the document until it was created.        See United States v. Kahl,\n\n583 F.2d 1351, 1354 (5th Cir. 1978) (upholding a district court's\n\nrefusal to grant discovery of government statistical compilations,\n\n\n\n     3\n      On its face, the local rule applies only to materials listed\nin Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(A)-(D); but subsection (E)'s\nprovisions were located in (C) at the time of the local rule's last\namendment in 1998. The parties have ignored the relocation and, as\nit does not alter the outcome in this case, so do we.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fwhen such compilations did not exist); United States v. Schmebari,\n\n484 F.2d    931,   935   (4th   Cir.    1973)      (\"[T]he    government   cannot\n\ndisclose what it does not have. . . .\"); cf. United States v.\n\nHarper, 432 F.2d 100, 102 (5th Cir. 1970) (holding that \"the\n\nfailure to produce non-required records when they do not exist\" is\n\nnot a violation of the Jencks Act).\n\n            Conceivably a remedy could be found if the government\n\nwere manipulating the timing for its creation of evidence to\n\nprejudice the defense; but nothing of the kind is evident in this\n\ncase.   Nor is there any reason to think that the defense was\n\nprejudiced by the timing of the disclosure.                  Whatever objections\n\nthe defense might have as to admissibility, it had good reason to\n\nfear that the government would offer testimony to show that Amaya\n\nwas an unlawful entrant who knowingly used a forged green card\n\nbecause he could not get a valid one.\n\n            This brings us to the broader question of the relevance\n\nof any showing of unlawful entry.            In order to show that Amaya was\n\nguilty of    the   crime   charged--use       of    a    false   green   card--the\n\ngovernment had to show (1) that Amaya used the card or attempted to\n\ndo so (which is probably not in dispute), (2) that the card was\n\nfalse and (3) that he knew it was false.                18 U.S.C. §1546(a).    The\n\nquestion is whether the proof that the government wants to offer--\n\nthat Amaya entered the country as an illegal alien--is relevant to\n\neither of these last two elements.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f           The government asserts that Amaya's unlawful entry is\n\nrelevant to both falsity and knowledge, but the first of the two\n\nelements--falsity--is     something   of   a   red   herring.      Strictly\n\nspeaking, Amaya's unlawful entry (if proved) makes it more likely\n\nthat the card is false than it would be without evidence of such\n\nentry; after all, an unlawful entrant would have use for a false\n\ngreen card, while a lawful entrant would have a far better chance\n\nof qualifying for a valid card.\n\n           But proof that the card was false could be furnished\n\nstraightforwardly by a certification or other testimony that no\n\nsuch card had been issued to Amaya.            Indeed, in this case the\n\ngovernment apparently has the false card in hand and could prove\n\nits falsity directly.     By contrast, a certificate showing Amaya's\n\nunlawful entry (and perhaps his continued lack of eligibility for\n\na green card) has only circumstantial bearing on the question\n\nwhether the card is a fake.\n\n           No sensible judge would be likely to let in the unlawful\n\nentry evidence to show falsity.       Rule 403 does not give judges a\n\nfree hand to refashion the government's proof to make cases less\n\ndramatic   or   more   even-handed.     Yet    a   judge   who   allowed   in\n\nprejudicial evidence--and here we mean unfairly prejudicial--to\n\nprove something that was so easily and definitively proved without\n\nsuch prejudice and by more straightforward means would be courting\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\freversal.    This argument for relevance thus tends more to taint\n\nthan to assist the government's position.\n\n            The other reason given for the evidence--to show that\n\nAmaya knew that the card was false--has much more substance.              At\n\nfirst blush one might think, after proof that the card was false,\n\nthat further independent evidence of Amaya’s knowledge would be\n\nunnecessary for conviction.       After all, if the card were false,\n\nthen Amaya could not have obtained it from the INS.               The most\n\nnatural alternative explanation would be that he purchased it from\n\nsomeone who deals in green card forgeries, knowing that he was\n\npurchasing a fake.\n\n            Yet conceivably some juror might think that there are\n\nmeans by which Amaya might have acquired a false green card without\n\nnecessarily knowing that it was false.       Perhaps a lawyer or other\n\nintermediary had, for a price, offered to procure a valid green\n\ncard and then delivered it to Amaya representing that it was valid.\n\nTrue, a judge might limit argument by defense counsel about such\n\npossibilities in the absence of some proof, but the government was\n\nnot obliged to gamble and could reasonably look for relevant\n\nevidence of knowledge.     So relevant evidence to show knowledge was\n\nhardly a waste of time.\n\n            Arguing for relevance, the government says that because\n\nillegal aliens    cannot   get   green   cards   until   their   status   is\n\nadjusted, Amaya must therefore have known that his own card was\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fnecessarily false.4     The government does not fully explain its\n\nreasoning and certainly did not do so to the district judge; but\n\nthe government's conclusion is correct for at least one reason and\n\npossibly for two, although the second poses a trickier issue that\n\nneed not be resolved.\n\n          The most straightforward reason for relevance is that\n\nAmaya's status as an unlawful entrant who has not upgraded his\n\nstatus makes it more likely that he acquired the forged green card\n\nby buying it from someone who was obviously not a government agent\n\nauthorized to issue it.     This might be conceived of as motive\n\nevidence (one who is an unlawful entrant has a motive to buy a\n\nforged green card) or mechanically (someone with Amaya's status\n\nwould have been rebuffed if he had sought a green card from the INS\n\nand so had to resort to the black market).\n\n          Either way, if Amaya bought the green card on the black\n\nmarket, this practically assures that Amaya knew the card he\n\nacquired was forged rather than valid.       It is not simply the\n\npossession of a forged document that creates a strong inference of\n\nknowledge that it is false; someone with a single forged $20 bill\n\nin his wallet may as easily be a victim rather than a perpetrator.\n\nRather, it is the added proof (that Amaya's status prevented him\n\n\n     4\n      The possibility remains that Amaya might have entered\nunlawfully but adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent\nresident thereafter. According to the government, the certificate\nexcluded by the trial court also indicated that Amaya's status had\nnot been upgraded.\n\n                                -10-\n\ffrom getting a valid green card from the INS) which greatly\n\nincreases the chances that he engaged in a transaction that by its\n\nnature would also have led him to believe that the document he had\n\nobtained was not valid.\n\n          Thus, we cannot agree that the unlawful entry evidence\n\nwas not \"relevant\" to an element of the crime charged.                Yes, the\n\nstandard of review on appeal of evidentiary rulings is often said\n\nto be for \"abuse of discretion\" (although the phrase is somewhat\n\nmisleading, see Invessys, Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 369 F.3d 16, 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2004)).    But whether a fact tends to make another fact\n\nmore or less likely depends heavily on the logic of the connection,\n\nand there is no \"discretion\" to ignore a logical relationship. Cf.\n\nTiller v. Baghdady, 244 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          There     is   an   alternative      argument   for    relevance.\n\nConceivably, a jury might be able to infer without independent\n\nproof that someone who is an unlawful entrant in the United States\n\nis quite likely to know that he or she cannot get a valid green\n\ncard and therefore that Amaya, since he was found with a forged\n\ngreen card, quite likely knew that it had to be forged.                A jury\n\nmight think that such knowledge would be widespread among unlawful\n\nentrants--or at least those who, like Amaya, had been in this\n\ncountry for a substantial period and had previously sought work.\n\n          The   state    of   knowledge   in   the   community   is    not   an\n\nadjudicative fact about Amaya's own knowledge, which would be\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fsubject to strict standards of proof.     Compare Fed. R. Evid. 201.\n\nRather, the likely state of knowledge in the community is a\n\n\"background\" fact about how the world works, and such facts if\n\nplausible can be inferred without direct proof.      This is an issue\n\nnot much discussed in the cases and not subject to very clear\n\nstandards, see United States v. Amado-Nunez, 357 F.3d 119, 121-22\n\n(1st Cir. 2004), and we need not resolve the problem here.\n\n          It is enough for relevance that unlawful entry increases\n\nthe likelihood that Amaya did acquire the false green card on the\n\nblack market and therefore knew it to be forged.      True, one might\n\nask why Amaya needed a forged green card if he had a temporary work\n\ncard from the INS (but perhaps he got the forgery before the work\n\ncard).    Anyway,     \"considerations   [that]   arguably   reduce   the\n\nprobative value of [particular acts] do not destroy the relevance\n\nof the acts altogether.\"     Nation-Wide Check Corp. v. Forest Hills\n\nDistribs., Inc., 692 F.2d 214, 219 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n          In moving to exclude the evidence, Amaya argued not only\n\nlack of relevance but also undue prejudice; evidence, although\n\nrelevant, may still be excluded because its prejudicial impact\n\nsubstantially outweighs its probative value.       Fed. R. Evid. 403;\n\nUnited States v. Balthazard, 360 F.3d 309, 313-14 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nIn this case the argument for such an exclusion under Rule 403 is\n\nfar from frivolous.    It was not expressly resolved by the district\n\ncourt only because the evidence was excluded on other grounds.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          Proof of Amaya’s unlawful entry is prejudicial in the\n\nsense intended by Rule 403.      This is not because it hurts Amaya--\n\nall relevant evidence by the government does that--but because it\n\nintroduces a factor into the case that might encourage the jury to\n\ndislike or disapprove of the defendant independent of the merits.\n\nSee United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(evidence \"invit[ing] the jury to render a verdict on an improper\n\nemotional basis\").\n\n          The extent of likely prejudice should not be overstated:\n\nsome jurors might not care whether Amaya was an unlawful entrant\n\nand others might well assume--even without the government’s direct\n\nproof--that Amaya had entered unlawfully, just because of proof\n\nthat the green card was not genuine.        Still, Amaya would be better\n\noff without proof of unlawful entry, especially in a case that some\n\njurors might   think    was   overcharged    and   should   not   have   been\n\nbrought; after all, Amaya had a temporary employment card.\n\n          Curiously, the government suggests that proof of unlawful\n\nentry is essential to its case, but it is hard to see why.           If the\n\ngovernment proved that Amaya used a forged green card and did not\n\nget it from the INS, a jury could impute knowledge of falsity to\n\nAmaya--at least absent proof from Amaya that the forged card was\n\nacquired in (surely unusual) circumstances leading him to believe\n\nthat it was valid.     Unlike a single forged $20 bill, illegal green\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fcards with name, photo and alien number do not show up in one's\n\npocket by chance.\n\n          Thus, we have a debatable case under Rule 403. The proof\n\nof unlawful entry is not crucial to the government’s case, which is\n\nadequate without such proof and which is bolstered by the proof\n\nonly to a limited degree; at least in theory, Amaya could have\n\nentered unlawfully and still somehow ended up with a false green\n\ncard that he believed to be valid.      And the unlawful entry evidence\n\nis prejudicial.     Yet the rule provides for exclusion only if the\n\nprejudice “substantially” outweighs probative value.\n\n          Ordinarily the district judge is entitled to latitude in\n\napplying Rule 403 to particular facts, partly because the issue\n\nturns on a balancing of unquantifiable considerations, United\n\nStates v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1997); Dente v. Riddell,\n\nInc., 664 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1981), and in this case the call is\n\nclose enough that a judgment either way is defensible.          But we\n\ncannot affirm the district judge on a ground he did not adopt,\n\nunless the issue could be decided only one way.         Cf. Vincent v.\n\nLouis Marx & Co., Inc., 874 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          Amaya is entitled to present this alternative Rule 403\n\nground for exclusion to the district judge; and if the judge\n\nexcludes the evidence on this ground (as appears likely), his\n\nresolution must stand whether or not the government then chooses to\n\ndismiss the case.     If the case goes forward and Amaya chooses to\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\ftestify, the district judge has explicitly reserved the question\n\nwhether   unlawful     entry   evidence        might     be     admissible      for\n\nimpeachment.\n\n           One   issue    remains.         Amaya   has   suggested     that     the\n\ngovernment failed to explain adequately to the district court why\n\nthe   unlawful-entry     evidence    was    relevant.         One   objecting    to\n\nevidence must state the ground, unless it is clear from context,\n\nFed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1); United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34\n\nF.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 1994), but the rules do not say how much a\n\nparty arguing for admissibility must say to preserve a proffer\n\nbeyond making clear the substance of the offer.\n\n           Here the proffer was preserved.          The government told the\n\ndistrict judge that its evidence of unlawful entry was relevant to\n\nan element of the offense and did not mislead the district judge;\n\nit was not asked to elaborate on the reasoning behind its relevance\n\nargument nor given much opportunity to do so.                       Further, the\n\ngovernment’s concern about proving knowledge had already been aired\n\nat the earlier hearing that led to excluding the agent’s testimony\n\non Amaya’s inculpatory statements.\n\n           Under   these     circumstances,        the    exclusion      of     the\n\ncertificate of unlawful entry and the grant of the motion in limine\n\nexcluding testimony must be reversed and the matter remanded to the\n\ndistrict court without prejudice to its consideration of the Rule\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f403 objection.   The government has said almost nothing about the\n\nother certificate so we need not address it.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                         Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f              TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, dissenting.        Considering the\n\nnumber   of    green   card   violations   that   have   been   successfully\n\nprosecuted each year,5 one might ask how it was that the government\n\nwas able to proceed without the benefit of a ruling in its favor\n\nsuch as the present one.        The fact is that such evidence has not,\n\nup until now, been admitted to prove § 1546 violations.             In this\n\nregard, it is pertinent to emphasize that neither the government\n\nnor, for that matter, the majority have cited to any reported case\n\nallowing evidence of such extraneous conduct to be admitted for the\n\npurpose of establishing a green card violation.           I must confess to\n\nequal frustration in searching in vain for such jurisprudence.\n\n              The   government's   claim   that    INS   Certificates    are\n\nregularly used as proof in criminal cases, and its citation to\n\nUnited States v. Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d 612, 616-17 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), as authority for this proposition, is at best disingenuous.\n\nSuch certificates have been approved as relevant evidence in\n\nillegal re-entry cases to prove that the Attorney General has not\n\ngranted permission to re-enter the United States.          Id. There is no\n\nreported case approving use of such a certificate in a situation\n\nsuch as in the present case.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      In 2002 (the last date available) there were 380 prosecutions\nnationwide of 18 U.S.C. § 1546 violations resulting in 375\nconvictions. See Fed. Justice Statistics Program, Defendants in\nCriminal Cases in U.S. District Court, Fiscal Year 2002, at\nhttp://frjc.urban.org/noframe/wqs/q_data_1.cfm#2002.\n\n                                    -17-\n\f              Given the totality of the circumstances, including those\n\nthat will be presently discussed, I believe it is fair to conclude\n\nthat the government's insistence on introducing the accused's\n\nallegedly illegal entry into this country to prove use by him of an\n\nillegal green card is fueled by inappropriate considerations.             To\n\nme, it is an indicia that the government wants to bolster an\n\nunsympathetic prosecution (the fact is that defendant did not need\n\na green card to work in this country) by introducing uncharged\n\nillegal activity,6 to so prejudice the accused in the eyes of the\n\njury that its findings regarding the charged illegal action will\n\nbecome a foregone conclusion. See United States v. Varoudakis, 233\n\nF.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir. 2000).           Particularly if it is accepted,\n\narguendo, that the government has an otherwise strong case (as the\n\nmajority points out, INS records show no green card was ever issued\n\nto Amaya, maj. op. at 2, and that the government can prove that the\n\ngreen card which it has in its possession is false, id. at 8), it\n\nbecomes transparent that the introduction of the uncharged illegal\n\nentry    is    intended   only   for    the   purpose   of   inappropriately\n\ninfluencing the jury regarding the illegal green card charge.           The\n\ndistrict judge was correct in not approving such conduct.                See\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The use of uncharged conduct in criminal proceedings has\nrecently become the focus of Supreme Court attention and scrutiny\nin a not totally unrelated context. See Blakely v. Washington,\n2004 WL 1402697 (U.S.S.C. June 24, 2004).\n\n                                       -18-\n\fUnited States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 796-800 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n              What I find most disturbing about the outcome of this\n\nappeal   is    the    majority's   glossing   over,   not   to    say   totally\n\nbypassing, well-established appellate standards for reviewing the\n\nevidentiary rulings of a trial court.\n\n              It is black letter law that we review a trial court's\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.          See United States v.\n\nGilbert, 181 F.3d 152, 160 (1st Cir. 1999); Aguilar-Aranceta, 58\n\nF.3d at 798.         \"In deciding such issues -- relevance, confusion,\n\nreliability, helpfulness -- the district court has a comparative\n\nadvantage . . . . Thus, so long as there is no misstatement of the\n\nlegal standard and the result reached is not clearly unreasonable,\n\nthe district judge's ruling is usually respected.\"               United States\n\nv. Schneider, 111 F.3d 197, 201 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United\n\nStates v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir. 1995)).               This standard\n\nis so high that of the nearly 2,700 published opinions of this\n\ncourt in the last five years, in only eleven cases have the\n\nevidentiary rulings of the district court been overturned.               Thus,\n\nthe majority's conclusions are not only wrong, but unusually so.\n\nNevertheless, in reaching the wrong result, the majority's ruling\n\nis quite revealing.\n\n              For the INS Certificate to be relevant evidence it must\n\nassist in proving an element of the crime charged.           \"[W]e consider\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fthe relationship of the evidence sought to be admitted to the\n\nelements of the offense and to [any] relevant defenses offered by\n\nthe [defendant].\"      United States v. Smith, 940 F.2d 710, 713 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).      The statute under which Amaya is charged has three\n\nelements:     (1) the use or attempted use; (2) of an \"illegal\" green\n\ncard;   (3)    that   Amaya   knew    was   not   genuine.   See   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1546(a).      Contrary to the majority's conclusions, I am of the\n\nopinion that nothing in the INS Certificate makes it more or less\n\nprobable that defendant knew the green card he used was not\n\nauthentic.      The government argues that since Amaya entered the\n\ncountry illegally and had not regularized his status, he could not\n\nobtain a green card, and thus, it is probable that he knew the\n\ngreen card was not genuine.          This argument is tenuous at best.      At\n\nthe time of the events at issue here, Amaya was no longer an\n\nillegal alien in the sense that he was not immediately deportable\n\nand thus the alleged link between his illegal entry and the\n\nfraudulent green card is not apparent. Given the temporal distance\n\nbetween the two events and the intervening petition for asylum, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the INS\n\nCertificate as irrelevant.\n\n              The majority indicates that \"[n]o sensible judge would be\n\nlikely to let in the unlawful entry evidence to show falsity.\" Maj.\n\nop. at 8.      But in this respect, the fact is that the prosecutor\n\ntold the trial judge that this evidence was being offered \"to prove\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fthe crime charged,\" i.e. use of a false card.7            It would thus seem\n\nappropriate to conclude that the trial judge's exclusion of such\n\nevidence was not an abuse of discretion, and was not clearly\n\nunreasonable, and thus should be upheld.            But the majority rules\n\notherwise.\n\n             The next decisional inconsistency is equally intriguing.\n\nThe majority concludes that \"a judge who allow[s] in prejudicial\n\nevidence --[unfairly prejudicial]--8 to prove something that [is]\n\nso easily and definitively proved without such prejudice and by\n\nmore straightforward means [,] . . . court[s] reversal.\"               Id.   It\n\nthen points to the fact that the false card was in the possession\n\nof the government, and that therefore \"further independent evidence\n\nof Amaya's knowledge [is] unnecessary for conviction.\"             Id at 9.\n\nIt would seem that this conclusion, which I agree with, would\n\ninevitably    lead   to   the   application    of   the   previously   stated\n\nprinciple     regarding    allowance   in     evidence    of   unnecessarily\n\n\n\n     7\n      This evidence also treads close to the line set forth in\nFederal Rule of Evidence 404(b), though the question was not\nbriefed by the parties. As the government acknowledged before the\ndistrict court, there may also be unexplored issues related to Rule\n404(b). The prosecutor stated \"I would suggest that - I am not\noffering this evidence to sully his character or for some other\npurpose such as that. I am offering it simply to prove the crime\nthat he is charged with.\"   Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of prior\ncrimes as evidence of a defendant's propensity to commit a present\ncrime.\n     8\n      The majority admits that \"[p]roof of Amaya's unlawful entry\nis surely prejudicial in the sense intended by Rule 403.\" Maj. op.\nat 13. This would be difficult to deny.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fprejudicial evidence.         However, the majority totally negates these\n\ncorrect conclusions, and instead reaches a contradictory result\n\nbased on a series of speculations and surmises about jury behavior\n\nand possible lawyer arguments, with but a passing mention of the\n\napplicable standard of review in favor of \"logic.\"                Maj. op. at 11.\n\n\"Upon this point a page of history is worth a volume of logic.\"\n\nNew York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349 (1921)(Holmes,\n\nJ.).9\n\n              The majority concedes, as it must, that \"the argument for\n\nexclusion [of the illegal entry evidence] under Rule 403 is far\n\nfrom frivolous.\"          Maj. op. at 12.        Were it to apply the settled\n\nstandard of review to this conclusion, affirmance of the trial\n\njudge's ruling would be mandated. Instead, again relying on flawed\n\ntheories     of   predictive    conduct     by    jurors,    it   downgrades     the\n\nconcession by stating that \"the extent of likely prejudice here\n\nshould not be overstated\".            Id at 13.    Of course, this is not the\n\ncase.       In truth, the effect on a jury of the introduction in\n\nevidence of       prior    criminal    conduct     by   a   defendant   cannot   be\n\nunderstated.      That juries treat prior bad acts evidence as highly\n\nprobative of the charged crime has been confirmed by empirical\n\ninvestigations.      See United States v. Daniels, 770 F.2d 1111, 1116\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1985); Harry Kalven, Jr. & Hans Zeisel, The American\n\n\n        9\n      See also Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Common Law 5\n(1881)(\"The life of the law has not been logic: it has been\nexperience.\").\n\n                                        -22-\n\fJury 160     (1966);    see     also   Abraham       P.

Wissler & Michael J.\n\nSaks, On the Inefficacy of Limiting Instructions: When Jurors Use\n\nPrior Conviction Evidence To Decide on Guilt, 9 L. & Hum. Behav. 37\n\n(1985).     No one who has tried a criminal case before a jury would\n\nslight the impact of such evidence in influencing the outcome of\n\nthat proceeding.        The experienced trial judge that decided to\n\nexclude it in this case, himself a former federal prosecutor, was\n\nsurely fully cognizant of the unfair prejudice to defendant lurking\n\nin   this   evidence,     and    properly      exercised         his   discretion    in\n\nexcluding it as irrelevant and unnecessary.                      An appellate court\n\nshould not disturb this ruling, at a minimum, because it was not\n\nclearly unreasonable.\n\n             With respect, although the majority correctly states the\n\nelements of the crime charged, maj. op. at 7, I believe it\n\nstretches the bounds of legality, reason and logic beyond the\n\nbreaking point in its attempt to connect the illegal evidence to\n\nthe crime charged.       Id. at 10-11.       It again resorts to speculative\n\npredictions,     which        regretfully,       I        find   inappropriate      and\n\nunconvincing.\n\n             I see no reason why we should give the government a\n\nsecond bite at the apple by remanding the case for what amounts to\n\na second Rule 403 balancing, one which I believe has already\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\feffectively taken place when the district court exercised its\n\ndiscretion to exclude the evidence proffered by the government.\n\n          Because I believe that the decision of the district court\n\nwas correct when viewed against the recognized standard of review,\n\nand because it was well within its discretionary power to so rule,\n\nI would affirm.\n\n          I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

In 1990, Amaya applied for asylum and was granted an \"employment authorization card\" by the INS, renewed annually while his asylum claim was being considered. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;264.1(b) (2004). The card differs from the alien registration card &#8212; the so-called \"green card\" &#8212; available to aliens who are legal permanent residents. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government, Amaya sought employment in late 2001 and early 2002 with two different service companies doing business in secure areas at Logan Airport in Boston. Under federal regulations, such employment requires an access badge granted after review of an application to the airport operator and a criminal background check. In support of his applications, the government says that Amaya submitted both his genuine employment authorization card and a green card bearing his name, photo, signature and actual \"alien number\" issued incident to his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the government says that it determined that the green card was a forgery. INS records, according to the government, show that no green card was ever issued to Amaya. In April 2002, a grand jury indicted Amaya for use or attempted use of a forged, counterfeited, altered or falsely made green card. 18 U.S.C. &#167;1546(a) (2000). Thereafter, in October 2002, the district court scheduled trial for January 6, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 2002, the prosecutor told defense counsel that the prosecution had just learned that an INS agent not involved in the case had spoken to Amaya on or about January 24, 2002, and that Amaya had made inculpatory statements concerning his acquisition of the green card. On January 2, 2003, Amaya moved to dismiss the indictment because of the \"late disclosure.\" After an evidentiary hearing held the next day, the district court refused to dismiss but ordered that any statements by Amaya to the agent be suppressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2003, the government also filed a trial brief and list of trial exhibits, including two exhibits provided to Amaya's counsel on December 31, 2002. One exhibit, entitled \"certificate of nonexistence of record,\" was prepared by the chief of the INS Records Services Branch on December 30, 2002, and stated in part that the INS maintained records of entry and that a diligent search showed no \"lawful admission\" into the United States by Amaya. A second exhibit, similarly titled, said that there was no record of issuance of the green card used by Amaya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 2003, the date scheduled for trial, Amaya moved to exclude both exhibits on the ground that they had been disclosed unduly late, allegedly in violation of applicable disclosure rules. Amaya also argued that the certificate indicating Amaya's unlawful entry was irrelevant and, if relevant, should be excluded as unduly prejudicial. Fed.R.Evid. 401, 403. Amaya also moved <i>in limine</i> to suppress, as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, any testimony that Amaya had entered the country unlawfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district judge took the bench, he announced that he was granting both motions. He said, perhaps referring mainly to first of the two certificates but logically encompassing both, that the evidence had not been turned over in timely fashion. And, apparently referring to the testimony as to unlawful entry, the judge said that he would exclude it too because \"I don't think it is relevant at all to the issue in this case.\" The prosecutor then asked to address the court, defended the disclosure of the certificates as timely and urged that evidence of Amaya's unlawful entry was being offered \"simply to prove the crime that he is charged with.\" The district court reiterated its ruling, noting that it was not suggesting bad faith by the government. Further argument by a supervising prosecutor was also unavailing and the government then filed this interlocutory appeal from the January 6 ruling. 18 U.S.C. &#167;3731 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The controlling issue is whether evidence that Amaya entered the country unlawfully is admissible to show an element of the crime charged. Although the district court excluded proposed documentary evidence to that effect &#8212; the certificate indicating lack of lawful entry &#8212; on a procedural ground, the court also ruled that any testimonial reference to Amaya's unlawful entry was barred as irrelevant. If the latter ruling is sound, the certificate insofar as it relates to unlawful entry would be inadmissible even without the procedural bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the procedural ruling has substantial implications for the government's conduct of future prosecutions and so it is best to begin by addressing that ruling. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that, on request, the government in a criminal case must disclose to the defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places ... if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control and ... the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E). By local rule, the district court requires such production within 28 days of arraignment. D. Mass. R. 116.1(C)(1)(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Whether Rule 16(a)(1)(E) is intended to apply to substitutes for testimony, such as a deposition or certificate as to what government records do or do not contain, may be open to question; but we will assume <i>arguendo</i> that the rules do apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the rule by its terms is directed to materials that the government actually possesses. By contrast, the document in question, which was a short-cut to avoid having a record-keeper testify, was created for trial purposes well after the arraignment (and then promptly turned over to the defense); indeed, it was created &#8212; perhaps on a precautionary basis &#8212; just before the district court ruled, shortly in advance of the scheduled trial, that the government could not offer Amaya's admission that he had bought the green card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the face of the matter, Rule 16(a)(1)(E) did not apply to the document until it was created. <i>See United States v. Kahl,</i> 583 F.2d 1351, 1354 (5th Cir.1978) (upholding a district court's refusal to grant discovery of government statistical compilations, when such compilations did not exist); <i>United States v. Schembari,</i> 484 F.2d 931, 935 (4th Cir.1973) (\"[T]he government cannot disclose what it does not have....\"); <i>cf. United States v. Harper,</i> 432 F.2d 100, 102 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that \"the failure to produce non-required records when they do not exist\" is not a violation of the Jencks Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably a remedy could be found if the government were manipulating the timing for its creation of evidence to prejudice the defense; but nothing of the kind is evident in this case. Nor is there any reason to think that the defense was prejudiced by the timing of the disclosure. Whatever objections the defense might have as to admissibility, it had good reason to fear that the government would offer testimony to show that Amaya was an unlawful entrant who knowingly used a forged green card because he could not get a valid one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the broader question of the relevance of any showing of unlawful entry. In order to show that Amaya was guilty of the crime charged &#8212; use of a false green card &#8212; the government had to show (1) that Amaya used the card or attempted to do so (which is probably not in dispute), (2) that the card was false and (3) that he knew it was false. 18 U.S.C. &#167;1546(a). The question is whether the proof that the government wants to offer &#8212; that Amaya entered the country as an illegal alien &#8212; is relevant to either of these last two elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that Amaya's unlawful entry is relevant to both falsity and knowledge, but the first of the two elements &#8212; falsity &#8212; is something of a red herring. Strictly speaking, Amaya's unlawful entry (if proved) makes it more likely that the card is false than it would be without evidence of such entry; after all, an unlawful entrant would have use for a false green card, while a lawful entrant would have a far better chance of qualifying for a valid card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But proof that the card was false could be furnished straightforwardly by a certification or other testimony that no such card had been issued to Amaya. Indeed, in this case the government apparently has the false card in hand and could prove its falsity directly. By contrast, a certificate showing Amaya's unlawful entry (and perhaps his continued lack of eligibility for a green card) has only circumstantial bearing on the question whether the card is a fake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No sensible judge would be likely to let in the unlawful entry evidence to show falsity. Rule 403 does not give judges a free hand to refashion the government's proof to make cases less dramatic or more even-handed. Yet a judge who allowed in prejudicial evidence &#8212; and here we mean unfairly prejudicial &#8212; to prove something that was so easily and definitively proved without such prejudice and by more straightforward means would be courting reversal. <i>This</i> argument for relevance thus tends more to taint than to assist the government's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other reason given for the evidence &#8212; to show that Amaya knew that the card was false &#8212; has much more substance. At first blush one might think, after proof that the card was false, that further independent evidence of Amaya's knowledge would be unnecessary for conviction. After all, if the card were false, then Amaya could not have obtained it from the INS. The most natural alternative explanation would be that he purchased it from someone who deals in green card forgeries, knowing that he was purchasing a fake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet conceivably some juror might think that there are means by which Amaya might have acquired a false green card without necessarily knowing that it was false. Perhaps a lawyer or other intermediary had, for a price, offered to procure a valid green card and then delivered it to Amaya representing that it was valid. True, a judge might limit argument by defense counsel about such possibilities in the absence of some proof, but the government was not obliged to gamble and could reasonably look for relevant evidence of knowledge. So relevant evidence to show knowledge was hardly a waste of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguing for relevance, the government says that because illegal aliens cannot get green cards until their status is adjusted, Amaya must therefore have known that his own card was necessarily false.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government does not fully explain its reasoning and certainly did not do so to the district judge; but the government's conclusion is correct for at least one reason and possibly for two, although the second poses a trickier issue that need not be resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most straightforward reason for relevance is that Amaya's status as an unlawful entrant who has not upgraded his status makes it more likely that he acquired the forged green card by buying it from someone who was obviously not a government agent authorized to issue it. This might be conceived of as motive evidence (one who is an unlawful entrant has a motive to buy a forged green card) or mechanically (someone with Amaya's status would have been rebuffed if he had sought a green card from the INS and so had to resort to the black market).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Either way, if Amaya bought the green card on the black market, this practically assures that Amaya knew the card he acquired was forged rather than valid. It is not simply the possession of a forged document that creates a strong inference of knowledge that it is false; someone with a single forged $20 bill in his wallet may as easily be a victim rather than a perpetrator. Rather, it is the <i>added</i> proof (that Amaya's status prevented him from getting a valid green card from the INS) which greatly increases the chances that he engaged in a transaction that by its nature would also have led him to believe that the document he had obtained was not valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we cannot agree that the unlawful entry evidence was not \"relevant\" to an element of the crime charged. Yes, the standard of review on appeal of evidentiary rulings is often said to be for \"abuse of discretion\" (although the phrase is somewhat misleading, <i>see Invessys, Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Cos.,</i> 369 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.2004)). But whether a fact tends to make another fact more or less likely depends heavily on the logic of the connection, and there is no \"discretion\" to ignore a logical relationship. <i>Cf. Tiller v. Baghdady,</i> 244 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an alternative argument for relevance. Conceivably, a jury might be able to infer without independent proof that someone who is an unlawful entrant in the United States is quite likely to know that he or she cannot get a valid green card and therefore that Amaya, since he was found with a forged green card, quite likely knew that it had to be forged. A jury might think that such knowledge would be widespread among unlawful entrants &#8212; or at least those who, like Amaya, had been in this country for a substantial period and had previously sought work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of knowledge in the community is not an adjudicative fact about Amaya's own knowledge, which would be subject to strict standards of proof. <i>Compare</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201. Rather, the likely state of knowledge in the community is a \"background\" fact about how the world works, and such facts if plausible can be inferred without direct proof. This is an issue not much discussed in the cases and not subject to very clear standards, <i>see United States v. Amado-Nunez,</i> 357 F.3d 119, 121-22 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2864, 159 L.Ed.2d 284 (2004), and we need not resolve the problem here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough for relevance that unlawful entry increases the likelihood that Amaya did acquire the false green card on the black market and therefore knew it to be forged. True, one might ask why Amaya needed a forged green card if he had a temporary work card from the INS (but perhaps he got the forgery before the work card). Anyway, \"considerations [that] arguably reduce the probative value of [particular acts] do not destroy the relevance of the acts altogether.\" <i>Nation-Wide Check Corp. v. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc.,</i> 692 F.2d 214, 219 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In moving to exclude the evidence, Amaya argued not only lack of relevance but also undue prejudice; evidence, although relevant, may still be excluded because its prejudicial impact substantially outweighs its probative value. Fed.R.Evid. 403; <i>United States v. Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d 309, 313-14 (1st Cir.2004). In this case the argument for such an exclusion under Rule 403 is far from frivolous. It was not expressly resolved by the district court only because the evidence was excluded on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof of Amaya's unlawful entry is prejudicial in the sense intended by Rule 403. This is not because it hurts Amaya &#8212; all relevant evidence by the government does that &#8212; but because it introduces a factor into the case that might encourage the jury to dislike or disapprove of the defendant independent of the merits. <i>See United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir.2000) (evidence \"invit[ing] the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent of likely prejudice should not be overstated: some jurors might not care whether Amaya was an unlawful entrant and others might well assume &#8212; even without the government's direct proof &#8212; that Amaya had entered unlawfully, just because of proof that the green card was not genuine. Still, Amaya would be better off without proof of unlawful entry, especially in a case that some jurors might think was overcharged and should not have been brought; after all, Amaya had a temporary employment card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, the government suggests that proof of unlawful entry is essential to its case, but it is hard to see why. If the government proved that Amaya used a forged green card and did not get it from the INS, a jury could impute knowledge of falsity to Amaya &#8212; at least absent proof from Amaya that the forged card was acquired in (surely unusual) circumstances leading him to believe that it was valid. Unlike a single forged $20 bill, illegal green cards with name, photo and alien number do not show up in one's pocket by chance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have a debatable case under Rule 403. The proof of unlawful entry is not crucial to the government's case, which is adequate without such proof and which is bolstered by the proof only to a limited degree; at least in theory, Amaya could have entered unlawfully and still somehow ended up with a false green card that he believed to be valid. And the unlawful entry evidence is prejudicial. Yet the rule provides for exclusion only if the prejudice \"substantially\" outweighs probative value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily the district judge is entitled to latitude in applying Rule 403 to particular facts, partly because the issue turns on a balancing of unquantifiable considerations, <i>United States v. Pitrone,</i> 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Dente v. Riddell, Inc.,</i> 664 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1981), and in this case the call is close enough that a judgment either way is defensible. But we cannot affirm the district judge on a ground he did not adopt, unless the issue could be decided only one way. <i>Cf. Vincent v. Louis Marx &amp; Co., Inc.,</i> 874 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amaya is entitled to present this alternative Rule 403 ground for exclusion to the district judge; and if the judge excludes the evidence on this ground (as appears likely), his resolution must stand whether or not the government then chooses to dismiss the case. If the case goes forward and Amaya chooses to testify, the district judge has explicitly reserved the question whether unlawful entry evidence might be admissible for impeachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One issue remains. Amaya has suggested that the government failed to explain adequately to the district court why the unlawful entry evidence was relevant. One objecting to evidence must state the ground, unless it is clear from context, Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1); <i>United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa,</i> 34 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.1994), but the rules do not say how much a party arguing for admissibility must say to preserve a proffer beyond making clear the substance of the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the proffer was preserved. The government told the district judge that its evidence of unlawful entry was relevant to an element of the offense and did not mislead the district judge; it was not asked to elaborate on the reasoning behind its relevance argument nor given much opportunity to do so. Further, the government's concern about proving knowledge had already been aired at the earlier hearing that led to excluding the agent's testimony on Amaya's inculpatory statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the exclusion of the certificate of unlawful entry and the grant of the motion <i>in limine</i> excluding testimony must be <i>reversed</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> to the district court without prejudice to its consideration of the Rule 403 objection. The government has said almost nothing about the other certificate so we need not address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court did not dispute the prosecutor's claim that his office was unaware of the agent's encounter with Amaya until December 31, 2002, and that the evidence was then promptly disclosed; but in any event the government has not sought review of the suppression order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The judge excluded both the certificate and related testimony before hearing from the prosecutor and then, when requested, gave the prosecutor an opportunity to change the court's mind. Although the prosecutor may not have explicitly stated that he wanted the court to reconsider its ruling as to the testimony as well as the certificate, the relevance issue is common to both and the prosecutor did more than enough to make plain the government's view that the unlawful entry evidence was relevant to an element of the crime. Thus, we treat the objection as fully preserved<i>Cf. Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey,</i> 488 U.S. 153, 174-75 &amp; n. 22, 109 S.Ct. 439, 102 L.Ed.2d 445 (1988).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> On its face, the local rule applies only to materials listed in Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A)-(D); but subsection (E)'s provisions were located in (C) at the time of the local rule's last amendment in 1998.

The fact is that such evidence has not, up until now, been admitted to prove &#167;1546 violations. In this regard, it is pertinent to emphasize that neither the government nor, for that matter, the majority have cited to any reported case allowing evidence of such extraneous conduct to be admitted for the purpose of establishing a green card violation. I must confess to equal frustration in searching in vain for such jurisprudence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's claim that INS Certificates are regularly used as proof in criminal cases, and its citation to <i>United States v. Scantleberry-Frank,</i> 158 F.3d 612, 616-17 (1st Cir.1998), as authority for this proposition, is at best disingenuous. Such certificates have been approved as relevant evidence in illegal <i>re-entry</i> cases to prove that the Attorney General has not granted permission to re-enter the United States. <i>Id.</i> There is no reported case approving use of such a certificate in a situation such as in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the totality of the circumstances, including those that will be presently discussed, I believe it is fair to conclude that the government's insistence on introducing the accused's allegedly illegal entry into this country to prove use by him of an illegal green card is fueled by inappropriate considerations. To me, it is an indicia that the government wants to bolster an unsympathetic prosecution (the fact is that defendant did not need a green card to work in this country) by introducing <i>uncharged</i> illegal activity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to so prejudice the accused in the eyes of the jury that its findings regarding the charged illegal action will become a foregone conclusion. <i>See United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 122 (1st Cir.2000). Particularly if it is accepted, <i>arguendo,</i> that the government has an otherwise strong case (as the majority points out, INS records show no green card was ever issued to Amaya, maj. op. at 40-41, and that the government can prove that the green card which it has in its possession is false, <i>id.</i> at 43), it becomes transparent that the introduction of the uncharged illegal entry is intended only for the purpose of inappropriately influencing the jury regarding the illegal green card charge. The district judge was correct in not approving such conduct. <i>See United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta,</i> 58 F.3d 796, 796-800 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What I find most disturbing about the outcome of this appeal is the majority's glossing over, not to say totally bypassing, well-established appellate standards for reviewing the evidentiary rulings of a trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is black letter law that we review a trial court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v.

Schneider,</i> 111 F.3d 197, 201 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>United States v. Shay,</i> 57 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir.1995)). This standard is so high that of the nearly 2,700 published opinions of this court in the last five years, in only eleven cases have the evidentiary rulings of the district court been overturned. Thus, the majority's conclusions are not only wrong, but unusually so. Nevertheless, in reaching the wrong result, the majority's ruling is quite revealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the INS Certificate to be relevant evidence it must assist in proving an element of the crime charged. \"[W]e consider the relationship of the evidence sought to be admitted to the elements of the offense and to [any] relevant defenses offered by the [defendant].\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 940 F.2d 710, 713 (1st Cir.1991). The statute under which Amaya is charged has three elements: (1) the use or attempted use; (2) of an \"illegal\" green card; (3) that Amaya knew was not genuine. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1546(a). Contrary to the majority's conclusions, I am of the opinion that nothing in the INS Certificate makes it more or less probable that defendant knew the green card he used was not authentic. The government argues that since Amaya entered the country illegally and had not regularized his status, he could not obtain a green card, and thus, it is probable that he knew the green card was not genuine. This argument is tenuous at best. At the time of the events at issue here, Amaya was no longer an illegal alien in the sense that he was not immediately deportable and thus the alleged link between his illegal entry and the fraudulent green card is not apparent. Given the temporal distance between the two events and the intervening petition for asylum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the INS Certificate as irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority indicates that \"[n]o sensible judge would be likely to let in the unlawful entry evidence to show falsity.\" Maj. op. at 43. But in this respect, the fact is that the prosecutor told the trial judge that this evidence was being offered \"to prove the crime charged,\" i.e. use of a false card.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It would thus seem appropriate to conclude that the trial judge's exclusion of such evidence was not an abuse of discretion, and was not clearly unreasonable, and thus should be upheld. But the majority rules otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next decisional inconsistency is equally intriguing.

It would seem that this conclusion, which I agree with, would inevitably lead to the application of the previously stated principle regarding allowance in evidence of unnecessarily prejudicial evidence. However, the majority totally negates these correct conclusions, and instead reaches a contradictory result based on a series of speculations and surmises about jury behavior and possible lawyer arguments, with but a passing mention of the applicable standard of review in favor of \"logic.\" Maj. op. at 44. \"Upon this point a page of history is worth a volume of logic.\" <i>New York Trust Co. v.

Instead, again relying on flawed theories of predictive conduct by jurors, it downgrades the concession by stating that \"the extent of likely prejudice here should not be overstated\". <i>Id</i> at 45. Of course, this is not the case. In truth, the effect on a jury of the introduction in evidence of prior criminal conduct by a defendant cannot be <i>understated.</i> That juries treat prior bad acts evidence as highly probative of the charged crime has been confirmed by empirical investigations. <i>See United States v. Daniels,</i> 770 F.2d 1111, 1116 (D.C.Cir.1985); Harry Kalven, Jr. &amp; Hans Zeisel, <i>The American Jury</i> 160 (1966); <i>see also</i> Abraham P.

Saks, <i>On the Inefficacy of Limiting Instructions: When Jurors Use Prior Conviction Evidence To Decide on Guilt,</i> 9 L. &amp; Hum. Behav. 37 (1985). No one who has tried a criminal case before a jury would slight the impact of such evidence in influencing the outcome of that proceeding. The experienced trial judge that decided to exclude it in this case, himself a former federal prosecutor, was surely fully cognizant of the unfair prejudice to defendant lurking in this evidence, and properly exercised his discretion in excluding it as irrelevant and unnecessary.

In 1990, Amaya applied for asylum and was granted an \"employment authorization card\" by the INS, renewed annually while his asylum claim was being considered. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167;264.1(b) (2004). The card differs from the alien registration card &#8212; the so-called \"green card\" &#8212; available to aliens who are legal permanent residents. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government, Amaya sought employment in late 2001 and early 2002 with two different service companies doing business in secure areas at Logan Airport in Boston. Under federal regulations, such employment requires an access badge granted after review of an application to the airport operator and a criminal background check. In support of his applications, the government says that Amaya submitted both his genuine employment authorization card and a green card bearing his name, photo, signature and actual \"alien number\" issued incident to his asylum application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the government says that it determined that the green card was a forgery. INS records, according to the government, show that no green card was ever issued to Amaya. In April 2002, a grand jury indicted Amaya for use or attempted use of a forged, counterfeited, altered or falsely made green card. 18 U.S.C. &#167;1546(a) (2000). Thereafter, in October 2002, the district court scheduled trial for January 6, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 2002, the prosecutor told defense counsel that the prosecution had just learned that an INS agent not involved in the case had spoken to Amaya on or about January 24, 2002, and that Amaya had made inculpatory statements concerning his acquisition of the green card. On January 2, 2003, Amaya moved to dismiss the indictment because of the \"late disclosure.\" After an evidentiary hearing held the next day, the district court refused to dismiss but ordered that any statements by Amaya to the agent be suppressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 2, 2003, the government also filed a trial brief and list of trial exhibits, including two exhibits provided to Amaya's counsel on December 31, 2002. One exhibit, entitled \"certificate of nonexistence of record,\" was prepared by the chief of the INS Records Services Branch on December 30, 2002, and stated in part that the INS maintained records of entry and that a diligent search showed no \"lawful admission\" into the United States by Amaya. A second exhibit, similarly titled, said that there was no record of issuance of the green card used by Amaya.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 6, 2003, the date scheduled for trial, Amaya moved to exclude both exhibits on the ground that they had been disclosed unduly late, allegedly in violation of applicable disclosure rules. Amaya also argued that the certificate indicating Amaya's unlawful entry was irrelevant and, if relevant, should be excluded as unduly prejudicial. Fed.R.Evid. 401, 403. Amaya also moved <i>in limine</i> to suppress, as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, any testimony that Amaya had entered the country unlawfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district judge took the bench, he announced that he was granting both motions. He said, perhaps referring mainly to first of the two certificates but logically encompassing both, that the evidence had not been turned over in timely fashion. And, apparently referring to the testimony as to unlawful entry, the judge said that he would exclude it too because \"I don't think it is relevant at all to the issue in this case.\" The prosecutor then asked to address the court, defended the disclosure of the certificates as timely and urged that evidence of Amaya's unlawful entry was being offered \"simply to prove the crime that he is charged with.\" The district court reiterated its ruling, noting that it was not suggesting bad faith by the government. Further argument by a supervising prosecutor was also unavailing and the government then filed this interlocutory appeal from the January 6 ruling. 18 U.S.C. &#167;3731 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The controlling issue is whether evidence that Amaya entered the country unlawfully is admissible to show an element of the crime charged. Although the district court excluded proposed documentary evidence to that effect &#8212; the certificate indicating lack of lawful entry &#8212; on a procedural ground, the court also ruled that any testimonial reference to Amaya's unlawful entry was barred as irrelevant. If the latter ruling is sound, the certificate insofar as it relates to unlawful entry would be inadmissible even without the procedural bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the procedural ruling has substantial implications for the government's conduct of future prosecutions and so it is best to begin by addressing that ruling. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that, on request, the government in a criminal case must disclose to the defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places ... if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control and ... the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(E). By local rule, the district court requires such production within 28 days of arraignment. D. Mass. R. 116.1(C)(1)(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Whether Rule 16(a)(1)(E) is intended to apply to substitutes for testimony, such as a deposition or certificate as to what government records do or do not contain, may be open to question; but we will assume <i>arguendo</i> that the rules do apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the rule by its terms is directed to materials that the government actually possesses. By contrast, the document in question, which was a short-cut to avoid having a record-keeper testify, was created for trial purposes well after the arraignment (and then promptly turned over to the defense); indeed, it was created &#8212; perhaps on a precautionary basis &#8212; just before the district court ruled, shortly in advance of the scheduled trial, that the government could not offer Amaya's admission that he had bought the green card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the face of the matter, Rule 16(a)(1)(E) did not apply to the document until it was created. <i>See United States v.

Nor is there any reason to think that the defense was prejudiced by the timing of the disclosure. Whatever objections the defense might have as to admissibility, it had good reason to fear that the government would offer testimony to show that Amaya was an unlawful entrant who knowingly used a forged green card because he could not get a valid one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the broader question of the relevance of any showing of unlawful entry. In order to show that Amaya was guilty of the crime charged &#8212; use of a false green card &#8212; the government had to show (1) that Amaya used the card or attempted to do so (which is probably not in dispute), (2) that the card was false and (3) that he knew it was false. 18 U.S.C. &#167;1546(a). The question is whether the proof that the government wants to offer &#8212; that Amaya entered the country as an illegal alien &#8212; is relevant to either of these last two elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that Amaya's unlawful entry is relevant to both falsity and knowledge, but the first of the two elements &#8212; falsity &#8212; is something of a red herring. Strictly speaking, Amaya's unlawful entry (if proved) makes it more likely that the card is false than it would be without evidence of such entry; after all, an unlawful entrant would have use for a false green card, while a lawful entrant would have a far better chance of qualifying for a valid card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But proof that the card was false could be furnished straightforwardly by a certification or other testimony that no such card had been issued to Amaya. Indeed, in this case the government apparently has the false card in hand and could prove its falsity directly. By contrast, a certificate showing Amaya's unlawful entry (and perhaps his continued lack of eligibility for a green card) has only circumstantial bearing on the question whether the card is a fake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No sensible judge would be likely to let in the unlawful entry evidence to show falsity. Rule 403 does not give judges a free hand to refashion the government's proof to make cases less dramatic or more even-handed. Yet a judge who allowed in prejudicial evidence &#8212; and here we mean unfairly prejudicial &#8212; to prove something that was so easily and definitively proved without such prejudice and by more straightforward means would be courting reversal. <i>This</i> argument for relevance thus tends more to taint than to assist the government's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other reason given for the evidence &#8212; to show that Amaya knew that the card was false &#8212; has much more substance. At first blush one might think, after proof that the card was false, that further independent evidence of Amaya's knowledge would be unnecessary for conviction. After all, if the card were false, then Amaya could not have obtained it from the INS. The most natural alternative explanation would be that he purchased it from someone who deals in green card forgeries, knowing that he was purchasing a fake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet conceivably some juror might think that there are means by which Amaya might have acquired a false green card without necessarily knowing that it was false. Perhaps a lawyer or other intermediary had, for a price, offered to procure a valid green card and then delivered it to Amaya representing that it was valid. True, a judge might limit argument by defense counsel about such possibilities in the absence of some proof, but the government was not obliged to gamble and could reasonably look for relevant evidence of knowledge. So relevant evidence to show knowledge was hardly a waste of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguing for relevance, the government says that because illegal aliens cannot get green cards until their status is adjusted, Amaya must therefore have known that his own card was necessarily false.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The government does not fully explain its reasoning and certainly did not do so to the district judge; but the government's conclusion is correct for at least one reason and possibly for two, although the second poses a trickier issue that need not be resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most straightforward reason for relevance is that Amaya's status as an unlawful entrant who has not upgraded his status makes it more likely that he acquired the forged green card by buying it from someone who was obviously not a government agent authorized to issue it. This might be conceived of as motive evidence (one who is an unlawful entrant has a motive to buy a forged green card) or mechanically (someone with Amaya's status would have been rebuffed if he had sought a green card from the INS and so had to resort to the black market).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Either way, if Amaya bought the green card on the black market, this practically assures that Amaya knew the card he acquired was forged rather than valid. It is not simply the possession of a forged document that creates a strong inference of knowledge that it is false; someone with a single forged $20 bill in his wallet may as easily be a victim rather than a perpetrator. Rather, it is the <i>added</i> proof (that Amaya's status prevented him from getting a valid green card from the INS) which greatly increases the chances that he engaged in a transaction that by its nature would also have led him to believe that the document he had obtained was not valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we cannot agree that the unlawful entry evidence was not \"relevant\" to an element of the crime charged. Yes, the standard of review on appeal of evidentiary rulings is often said to be for \"abuse of discretion\" (although the phrase is somewhat misleading, <i>see Invessys, Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2004)). But whether a fact tends to make another fact more or less likely depends heavily on the logic of the connection, and there is no \"discretion\" to ignore a logical relationship. <i>Cf. Tiller v. Baghdady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199324\"><a href=\"/opinion/199324/tiller-v-baghdady/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an alternative argument for relevance. Conceivably, a jury might be able to infer without independent proof that someone who is an unlawful entrant in the United States is quite likely to know that he or she cannot get a valid green card and therefore that Amaya, since he was found with a forged green card, quite likely knew that it had to be forged. A jury might think that such knowledge would be widespread among unlawful entrants &#8212; or at least those who, like Amaya, had been in this country for a substantial period and had previously sought work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of knowledge in the community is not an adjudicative fact about Amaya's own knowledge, which would be subject to strict standards of proof. <i>Compare</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201. Rather, the likely state of knowledge in the community is a \"background\" fact about how the world works, and such facts if plausible can be inferred without direct proof. This is an issue not much discussed in the cases and not subject to very clear standards, <i>see United States v. Amado-Nunez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784973\"><a href=\"/opinion/784973/united-states-v-jose-amado-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 121-22 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

True, one might ask why Amaya needed a forged green card if he had a temporary work card from the INS (but perhaps he got the forgery before the work card). Anyway, \"considerations [that] arguably reduce the probative value of [particular acts] do not destroy the relevance of the acts altogether.\" <i>Nation-Wide Check Corp. v. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410380\"><a href=\"/opinion/410380/nation-wide-check-corporation-inc-v-forest-hills-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 219 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In moving to exclude the evidence, Amaya argued not only lack of relevance but also undue prejudice; evidence, although relevant, may still be excluded because its prejudicial impact substantially outweighs its probative value.

This is not because it hurts Amaya &#8212; all relevant evidence by the government does that &#8212; but because it introduces a factor into the case that might encourage the jury to dislike or disapprove of the defendant independent of the merits. <i>See United States v. Varoudakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199172\"><a href=\"/opinion/199172/united-states-v-varoudakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2000) (evidence \"invit[ing] the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent of likely prejudice should not be overstated: some jurors might not care whether Amaya was an unlawful entrant and others might well assume &#8212; even without the government's direct proof &#8212; that Amaya had entered unlawfully, just because of proof that the green card was not genuine. Still, Amaya would be better off without proof of unlawful entry, especially in a case that some jurors might think was overcharged and should not have been brought; after all, Amaya had a temporary employment card.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curiously, the government suggests that proof of unlawful entry is essential to its case, but it is hard to see why. If the government proved that Amaya used a forged green card and did not get it from the INS, a jury could impute knowledge of falsity to Amaya &#8212; at least absent proof from Amaya that the forged card was acquired in (surely unusual) circumstances leading him to believe that it was valid. Unlike a single forged $20 bill, illegal green cards with name, photo and alien number do not show up in one's pocket by chance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we have a debatable case under Rule 403. The proof of unlawful entry is not crucial to the government's case, which is adequate without such proof and which is bolstered by the proof only to a limited degree; at least in theory, Amaya could have entered unlawfully and still somehow ended up with a false green card that he believed to be valid. And the unlawful entry evidence is prejudicial.

The government told the district judge that its evidence of unlawful entry was relevant to an element of the offense and did not mislead the district judge; it was not asked to elaborate on the reasoning behind its relevance argument nor given much opportunity to do so. Further, the government's concern about proving knowledge had already been aired at the earlier hearing that led to excluding the agent's testimony on Amaya's inculpatory statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the exclusion of the certificate of unlawful entry and the grant of the motion <i>in limine</i> excluding testimony must be <i>reversed</i> and the matter <i>remanded</i> to the district court without prejudice to its consideration of the Rule 403 objection.

The fact is that such evidence has not, up until now, been admitted to prove &#167;1546 violations. In this regard, it is pertinent to emphasize that neither the government nor, for that matter, the majority have cited to any reported case allowing evidence of such extraneous conduct to be admitted for the purpose of establishing a green card violation.

Such certificates have been approved as relevant evidence in illegal <i>re-entry</i> cases to prove that the Attorney General has not granted permission to re-enter the United States. <i>Id.</i> There is no reported case approving use of such a certificate in a situation such as in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the totality of the circumstances, including those that will be presently discussed, I believe it is fair to conclude that the government's insistence on introducing the accused's allegedly illegal entry into this country to prove use by him of an illegal green card is fueled by inappropriate considerations. To me, it is an indicia that the government wants to bolster an unsympathetic prosecution (the fact is that defendant did not need a green card to work in this country) by introducing <i>uncharged</i> illegal activity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to so prejudice the accused in the eyes of the jury that its findings regarding the charged illegal action will become a foregone conclusion. <i>See United States v.

Particularly if it is accepted, <i>arguendo,</i> that the government has an otherwise strong case (as the majority points out, INS records show no green card was ever issued to Amaya, maj. op. at 40-41, and that the government can prove that the green card which it has in its possession is false, <i>id.</i> at 43), it becomes transparent that the introduction of the uncharged illegal entry is intended only for the purpose of inappropriately influencing the jury regarding the illegal green card charge. The district judge was correct in not approving such conduct. <i>See United States v.

This standard is so high that of the nearly 2,700 published opinions of this court in the last five years, in only eleven cases have the evidentiary rulings of the district court been overturned. Thus, the majority's conclusions are not only wrong, but unusually so.

The statute under which Amaya is charged has three elements: (1) the use or attempted use; (2) of an \"illegal\" green card; (3) that Amaya knew was not genuine. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;1546(a). Contrary to the majority's conclusions, I am of the opinion that nothing in the INS Certificate makes it more or less probable that defendant knew the green card he used was not authentic. The government argues that since Amaya entered the country illegally and had not regularized his status, he could not obtain a green card, and thus, it is probable that he knew the green card was not genuine. This argument is tenuous at best. At the time of the events at issue here, Amaya was no longer an illegal alien in the sense that he was not immediately deportable and thus the alleged link between his illegal entry and the fraudulent green card is not apparent. Given the temporal distance between the two events and the intervening petition for asylum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the INS Certificate as irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority indicates that \"[n]o sensible judge would be likely to let in the unlawful entry evidence to show falsity.\" Maj. op. at 43. But in this respect, the fact is that the prosecutor told the trial judge that this evidence was being offered \"to prove the crime charged,\" i.e. use of a false card.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It would thus seem appropriate to conclude that the trial judge's exclusion of such evidence was not an abuse of discretion, and was not clearly unreasonable, and thus should be upheld.

It would seem that this conclusion, which I agree with, would inevitably lead to the application of the previously stated principle regarding allowance in evidence of unnecessarily prejudicial evidence. However, the majority totally negates these correct conclusions, and instead reaches a contradictory result based on a series of speculations and surmises about jury behavior and possible lawyer arguments, with but a passing mention of the applicable standard of review in favor of \"logic.\" Maj. op. at 44. \"Upon this point a page of history is worth a volume of logic.\" <i>New York Trust Co. v.

Instead, again relying on flawed theories of predictive conduct by jurors, it downgrades the concession by stating that \"the extent of likely prejudice here should not be overstated\". <i>Id</i> at 45. Of course, this is not the case.

No one who has tried a criminal case before a jury would slight the impact of such evidence in influencing the outcome of that proceeding. The experienced trial judge that decided to exclude it in this case, himself a former federal prosecutor, was surely fully cognizant of the unfair prejudice to defendant lurking in this evidence, and properly exercised his discretion in excluding it as irrelevant and unnecessary.
