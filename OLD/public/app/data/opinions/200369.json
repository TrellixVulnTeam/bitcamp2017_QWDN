Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Tina Schneider, for appellant.\n     David Hennessy, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 6, 2003\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.       On March 26, 2002, Norma\n\nNieves (\"Nieves\") pled guilty to an indictment charging that she\n\nconspired to distribute crack cocaine (\"crack\") from September 13,\n\n1999 to December 10, 1999, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (2000),\n\nand distributed crack and cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841.    On June 7, 2002, the district court sentenced her to\n\n60 months imprisonment, a supervised release term of four years on\n\nthe conspiracy count and three years on the distribution counts,\n\nand a $500 special assessment.\n\n           Nieves challenges her sentence, arguing that the district\n\ncourt erred in holding her responsible for a drug sale as to which\n\nshe had consistently disputed her involvement and erred in giving\n\nher a term of supervised release in excess of the default statutory\n\nmaximum.   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                  I.   Attack on Term of Imprisonment\n\n           Because Nieves pled guilty to an indictment that did not\n\ncontain a specific drug quantity, the district court determined\n\nwhether Nieves was accountable for 1.63 grams of crack sold on\n\nDecember 7, 1999 by Alex Nieves (\"Alex\"), Nieves's son and co-\n\nconspirator, to a cooperating witness (\"CW\").\n\n           A.   Arguments Before the District Court\n\n           The government contended that the facts supported holding\n\nNieves accountable under an aiding and abetting theory, U.S.\n\nSentencing      Guidelines   Manual     (\"U.S.S.G.\"   or   \"Sentencing\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fGuidelines\") § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (2002), or under a theory of jointly\n\nundertaken criminal conduct, U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).                  According\n\nto the presentence report, on December 7, 1999, Alex delivered\n\ncrack to the CW at the CW's home and said that he would return with\n\nmore.      When    Alex   failed   to   return,      the   CW   called    Nieves's\n\nresidence.     The CW inquired as to Alex's whereabouts, and Nieves\n\nasked if Alex had just delivered crack to the CW.               The CW responded\n\nthat Alex had, but he was supposed to deliver more.                 Nieves then\n\nagreed to call the CW if she heard from Alex.              A short time later,\n\nAlex called the CW and said that he was on his way; he then\n\ndelivered additional crack to the CW.\n\n             In her objection to the presentence report, Nieves argued\n\nthat she could not be held accountable for the December 7 sale\n\nbecause she withdrew from the drug conspiracy in October of 1999,\n\nwhen she told the CW that due to her pregnancy she had stopped\n\nusing drugs and would no longer help the CW acquire drugs.                      In\n\nresponse, the CW congratulated her on her decision and wished her\n\nluck with her pregnancy.       Nieves did not have further contact with\n\nthe   CW   until   December   7,   1999,      when   the   CW   called    Nieves's\n\nresidence looking for Alex.         Nieves contended that nothing in the\n\nphone call indicated that Nieves either spoke with Alex before he\n\ncompleted the cocaine sale or knew that Alex supplied the CW with\n\ndrugs until after the sale was completed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            After considering the parties' arguments, the district\n\ncourt held Nieves accountable for the 1.63 grams of crack, finding\n\n\"that she was a part of [the December 7, 1999] transaction, aided\n\nand abetted its completion, and cooperated with the further contact\n\nbetween the supplier and her son.\"\n\n            By including the December 7 sale, the total amount of\n\ncocaine base attributable to Nieves rose above five grams and\n\nsubjected   her    to   a    mandatory   minimum   five-year   sentence    of\n\nimprisonment.     Nieves challenges the district court's       attribution\n\nof the December 7 sale to her.\n\n            B.    Standard of Review\n\n            At sentencing, the government must prove drug quantity by\n\na preponderance of the evidence.           United States v. Eke, 117 F.3d\n\n19, 22 (1st Cir. 1997).        Nieves's attack on the sentencing court's\n\ninclusion of the December 7 sale is an attack on the court's\n\nfindings of fact, which we review for clear error, United States v.\n\nCaba, 241 F.3d 98, 102 (1st Cir. 2001), and an attack on its\n\napplication of law, which we review under a sliding-scale standard,\n\nUnited States v. Howard (In re Extradition of Howard), 996 F.2d\n\n1320, 1328 (1st Cir. 1993).        \"The standard of review applicable to\n\nmixed questions usually depends upon where they fall along the\n\ndegree-of-deference         continuum:   the   more   fact-dominated      the\n\nquestion, the more likely it is that the trier's resolution of it\n\nwill be accepted unless shown to be clearly erroneous.\"           Id.\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f             C.    Relevant Conduct\n\n             Nieves   argues   that    the     government    did   not     present\n\nsufficient evidence for the district court to hold her responsible\n\nfor the December 7 sale under either an aiding and abetting theory\n\nor under a theory of jointly undertaken criminal conduct.                         We\n\ndisagree. The sentencing guidelines instruct the district court to\n\nhold   the   defendant    responsible        both   for   acts   she   personally\n\ncommitted and for acts attributable to her as relevant conduct.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.\n\n             The    district   court   did     not    err   in   finding    by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Nieves aided and abetted the\n\nfinal drug sale.       See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (stating that the\n\ncourt shall determine the sentencing range on the basis of \"all\n\nacts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded,\n\ninduced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\").                       The\n\ntelephone call in which Nieves agreed to tell Alex to call the CW\n\n-- while aware that the CW wanted to purchase drugs -- established\n\nNieves's knowledge of the sale and constituted sufficient evidence\n\nto support a finding of aiding and abetting.                 United States v.\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that the crucial\n\nelement of aiding and abetting is a showing -- \"that may be made\n\nwholly on the basis of circumstantial evidence\" -- \"that the\n\ndefendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the\n\nunderlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal\").\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          Similarly, the district court did not err in finding by\n\na preponderance of the evidence that Nieves was responsible for the\n\nDecember transaction under a conspiracy theory.                  U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3\n\n(a)(1)(B) (stating that \"in the case of jointly undertaken criminal\n\nactivity,\" the defendant's guideline range is determined by \"all\n\nreasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance\n\nof the jointly undertaken criminal activity\").                  Nieves admitted to\n\nhaving arranged prior drug purchases for the CW and to having had\n\na drug-trafficking relationship with Alex.                This evidence coupled\n\nwith the telephone call between Nieves and the CW constituted\n\nsufficient evidence for finding that the December 7 transaction was\n\n\"a reasonably foreseeable act[] . . . of others in furtherance of\n\nthe jointly undertaken criminal activity.\"                Id.\n\n          Nieves argues that she cannot be held responsible under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) because she had successfully withdrawn\n\nfrom the conspiracy prior to the December 7 sale.                 To withdraw from\n\nan ongoing conspiracy, Nieves must do more than merely cease\n\nselling drugs.     United States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2002). \"In order to withdraw, a conspirator must act affirmatively\n\neither to defeat or disavow the purposes of the conspiracy.\"\n\nUnited States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Phillips, 664 F.2d 971, 1018 (5th Cir. 1981)).\n\n\"Typically,   there     must   be   evidence    of    a    full     confession   to\n\nauthorities   or    a   communication      by   the       accused    to   his    co-\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fconspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.\"\n\nUnited States v. Juodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir. 1987) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n            Nieves contends that she withdrew from the conspiracy\n\nwhen she told the CW that due to her pregnancy she would no longer\n\ntake or sell drugs. Even assuming that the district court believed\n\nNieves's rendition of her conversation with the CW, the sentencing\n\ncourt did not err in finding that by later agreeing to help the CW\n\ncontact Alex in order to procure drugs, Nieves had not truly\n\n\"disavow[ed] the purposes of the conspiracy.\"                 United States v.\n\nPiva, 870 F.2d 753, 757 (1st Cir. 1989).                Consequently, we find\n\nthat the district court did not err in holding Nieves accountable\n\nfor the 1.63 grams of crack in dispute.\n\n                  II.    Supervised Release Challenge\n\n            Nieves's final argument is that the sentencing court\n\ncommitted    Apprendi    error   by   sentencing        her   to    a   period   of\n\nsupervised release beyond the statutory maximum.1                  The conspiracy\n\ncount was a Class C offense, for which 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)\n\nauthorizes    only   a    three-year        term   of    supervised      release.\n\n\n\n1\n   To the extent that Nieves attempts to make out a claim based on\nU.S.S.G. § 5D1.2, see United States v. Nelson-Rodríguez, No. 00-\n1422, slip op. at 73-74 (1st Cir. Feb. 7, 2003), that claim has\nbeen procedurally defaulted by her failure to advert to it in her\nopening brief. United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 922 n.7\n(1st Cir. 1993) (stating that \"it is well settled that a legal\nargument made for the first time in an appellant's reply brief\ncomes too late and need not be addressed\" (citation omitted)).\n\n                                      -7-\n\fTherefore, she argues, the court erred in sentencing her to four\n\nyears    of   supervised       release.          As   Nieves   acknowledges,           her\n\nsupervised release claim is reviewable only for plain error because\n\nshe failed to make her Apprendi claim below.                     United States v.\n\nAllen, 312 F.3d 512, 514 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              According to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 476\n\n(2000), it is a constitutional requirement \"that any fact (other\n\nthan prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a\n\ncrime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and\n\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Nieves claims that the district\n\ncourt erred because the body of the indictment did not specify any\n\namount   of    drugs,    yet   the     court     sentenced     her   to    a    term    of\n\nsupervised release in excess of the maximum sentence allowable\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) and 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b).\n\n              Although Nieves phrases her claim in terms of Apprendi,\n\nthe   claim    ultimately      boils    down     to   a   question    of       statutory\n\nconstruction,     a     question     our    recent     decisions     have      answered\n\nadversely to Nieves.        In United States v. López, 299 F.3d 84 (1st\n\nCir. 2002), we determined that the \"at least\" language in 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B) \"establishes a mandatory minimum term of supervised\n\nrelease, but no maximum.\"              López, 299 F.3d at 89-90.                Then in\n\nUnited States v. Cortés-Claudio, 312 F.3d 17, 18-19 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), we held that 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b) \"does not limit the length\n\nof supervised release terms in cases under § 841.\"                    Consequently,\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fthe maximum term of supervised release that the sentencing court\n\ncould have imposed ranged from the mandatory minimum set forth in\n\n§ 841(b) up to life.   Nieves is therefore left without a viable\n\nclaim because \"Apprendi simply does not apply to guideline findings\n\n(including, inter alia, drug weight calculations) that increase the\n\ndefendant's sentence, but do not elevate the sentence to a point\n\nbeyond the lowest applicable statutory maximum.\"   United States v.\n\nCaba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

The telephone call in which Nieves agreed to tell Alex to call the CW &#8212; while aware that the CW wanted to purchase drugs &#8212; established Nieves's knowledge of the sale and constituted sufficient evidence to support a finding of aiding and abetting. <i>United States v.

Therefore, she argues, the court erred in sentencing her to four years of supervised release. As Nieves acknowledges, her supervised release claim is reviewable only for plain error because she failed to make her <i>Apprendi</i> claim below. <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 312 F.3d 512, 514 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to <i>Apprendi v.

In <i>United States v.

Attack on Term of Imprisonment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Nieves pled guilty to an indictment that did not contain a specific drug quantity, the district court determined whether Nieves was accountable for 1.63 grams of crack sold on December 7, 1999 by Alex Nieves (\"Alex\"), Nieves's son and co-conspirator, to a cooperating witness (\"CW\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Arguments Before the District Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contended that the facts supported holding Nieves accountable under an aiding and abetting theory, U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"Sentencing Guidelines\") &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (2002), or under a theory of jointly undertaken criminal conduct, U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). According to the presentence report, on December 7, 1999, Alex delivered crack to the CW at the CW's home and said that he would return with more. When Alex failed to return, the CW called Nieves's residence. The CW inquired as to Alex's whereabouts, and Nieves asked if Alex had just delivered crack to the CW. The CW responded that Alex had, but he was supposed to deliver more. Nieves then agreed to call the CW if she heard from Alex. A short time later, Alex called the CW and said that he was on his way; he then delivered additional crack to the CW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her objection to the presentence report, Nieves argued that she could not be held accountable for the December 7 sale because she withdrew from the drug conspiracy in October of 1999, when she told the CW that due to her pregnancy she had stopped using drugs and would no longer help the CW acquire drugs. In response, the CW congratulated her on her decision and wished her luck with her pregnancy. Nieves did not have further contact with the CW until December 7, 1999, when the CW called Nieves's residence looking for Alex. Nieves contended that nothing in the phone call indicated that Nieves either spoke with Alex before he completed the cocaine sale or knew that Alex supplied the CW with drugs until after the sale was completed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering the parties' arguments, the district court held Nieves accountable for the 1.63 grams of crack, finding \"that she was a part of [the December 7, 1999] transaction, aided and abetted its completion, and cooperated with the further contact between the supplier and her son.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By including the December 7 sale, the total amount of cocaine base attributable to Nieves rose above five grams and subjected her to a mandatory minimum five-year sentence of imprisonment. Nieves challenges the district court's attribution of the December 7 sale to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the government must prove drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v.
