Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya, and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Terrance McCarthy on brief for appellant.\n     William H. Connolly, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on motion for summary disposition\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           February 26, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Mark Nutter was indicted\n\non one count of arson, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(i); three\n\ncounts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and one\n\ncount of using fire to commit mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 844(h)(1).    After a jury trial, he was convicted on all five\n\ncounts and sentenced to a five-year mandatory minimum term of\n\nincarceration    for   arson   under   18   U.S.C.   §   844(i),   to   run\n\nconcurrently with five-year sentences on each of the mail fraud\n\ncounts, plus a consecutive ten-year mandatory minimum term of\n\nincarceration on the use-of-fire count under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)(1).\n\n            In this direct appeal, the defendant raises three issues.\n\nIn his counseled brief, he argues that the district court erred in\n\ninstructing the jury on the interstate commerce element of the\n\narson count and in concluding that it had no authority under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a) to sentence him below the applicable statutory\n\nminimums.    In a supplemental pro se brief, he further argues that\n\nthe district court violated the Speedy Trial Act by granting\n\nvarious continuances without adequately explaining its reasons for\n\ndoing so.\n\n            Taking the arguments in the order in which the errors\n\npurportedly occurred, we turn, first, to the defendant's pro se\n\nclaim that the district court violated the Speedy Trial Act.             We\n\nneed not reach the merits of that argument because the defendant\n\nwaived it by failing to move for dismissal on that ground before\n\n                                   -2-\n\ftrial.      See 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2); see also United States v.\n\nBelton, 520 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 286\n\n(2008).\n\n             This brings us to the defendant's challenge to the jury\n\ninstruction     on   the    interstate   commerce      element    of    the   arson\n\ncharge.1      Because      the   defendant    failed   either    to    propose   an\n\nalternate instruction on that point or to object to the instruction\n\ngiven before the jury retired, this claim of error is reviewable\n\nonly for plain error.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d), 52(b); see also\n\nUnited States v. Riccio, 529 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir. 2008).                 \"'[T]he\n\nplain error hurdle, high in all events, nowhere looms larger than\n\n\n     1\n         That instruction was as follows:\n\n                  In order to prove the charge of arson,\n             the government must prove . . . beyond a\n             reasonable doubt . . . that the damaged\n             property was used in or affected interstate\n             commerce.\n\n                                      * * *\n\n                  The government must . . . prove that the\n             property the defendant damaged or destroyed\n             was used in or affected interstate commerce.\n             Interstate commerce means commerce or business\n             between any place in one state and another\n             place outside that state.      It also means\n             commerce between places within the same state,\n             but passing through any place outside the\n             state.\n\n                  As a matter of law, rental property used\n             for commercial purposes is in or affecting\n             interstate commerce.\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fin the context of alleged instructional errors.'\" United States v.\n\nGarcia-Ortiz, 528 F.3d 74, 81 (1st Cir.) (quoting United States v.\n\nPaniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir. 2001)), cert. denied,\n\n129 S. Ct. 254 (2008).             To clear that hurdle, the defendant must\n\nshow \"'(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious\n\nand which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.'\"                 Id. (quoting United States\n\nv. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n               The defendant has not demonstrated that an error occurred\n\nand so stumbles at the first prong.              He argues that by instructing\n\nthe    jury     \"that    the    damaged   rental       property      was    'used   for\n\ncommer[ci]al purposes . . . [and] affected interstate commerce,'\"\n\nthe instruction \"usurped the province of the jury\" and \"eliminated\n\n[the       interstate    commerce]    element     from     their     deliberations.\"\n\nActually,       the     court   instructed      the    jury,    twice,      that    \"the\n\ngovernment must prove\" that the damaged property was used in or\n\naffected interstate commerce; the court then stated, \"[a]s a matter\n\nof    law\"--not       fact--that    \"rental     property      used    for   commercial\n\npurposes is in or affecting interstate commerce.\"2                           It never\n\ninstructed the jury that the damaged property was, in fact, rental\n\nproperty       used    for   commercial    purposes      or    that    the    property\n\n\n       2\n      The defendant concedes the accuracy of that statement of the\nlaw, as he must. See Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858, 862\n(1985); United States v. Medeiros, 897 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                          -4-\n\fotherwise    was     used   in   or    affected      interstate     commerce.\n\nConsequently, no error occurred.           See   United States v. Gomez, 87\n\nF.3d 1093, 1097 (9th Cir. 1996) (characterizing similarly worded\n\ninstruction as \"correctly delegat[ing] the factual determination to\n\nthe jury, leaving the determination of the legal standard to the\n\ncourt\"); see also United States v. Stackpole, 811 F.2d 689, 696\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) (finding no error when court \"did not instruct the\n\njury that the building was used in interstate commerce, but rather\n\nthat if they believed some particular testimony, that testimony\n\nwould be enough on that issue\" (emphases omitted)).\n\n            To    cinch   matters,    in    both   its   initial   and   final\n\ninstructions, the court clearly instructed the jury on its role as\n\nfactfinder as opposed to the court's role as law-giver. Considered\n\nin context and \"as part of the whole trial,\" United States v.\n\nMartínez-Vives, 475 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted), the challenged instruction was not error, plain or\n\notherwise.       We therefore need not reach the second, third, or\n\nfourth prongs of the plain-error standard.\n\n             The defendant's sentencing argument can be readily\n\n dispatched.       The district court correctly concluded that it had\n\n no choice but to impose a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence on\n\n the use-of-fire count consecutive to the five-year mandatory\n\n minimum sentence on the arson count.              See 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)\n\n (providing that a defendant convicted of this offense \"shall, in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\faddition to the punishment provided for [the underlying] felony\n\n[here, mail fraud], be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years\"\n\nand further providing, \"nor shall the term of imprisonment\n\nimposed under this subsection run concurrently with any other\n\nterm of imprisonment\").            The defendant's only argument to the\n\ncontrary      is   that   the    resulting       sentence    was     \"greater     than\n\nnecessary\" to serve the purposes of sentencing in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a) and the principles articulated in a trio of\n\nSupreme Court cases.        See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005); Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007); Gall\n\nv.   United    States,     128    S.   Ct.      586   (2007).      As    this   court\n\nrecognized shortly after Booker, that decision had no effect on\n\nstatutory      mandatory        minimum      sentences,      United      States    v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005); although the\n\nguidelines are no longer mandatory, sentencing courts must still\n\nabide by statutory mandatory minimums.                 United States v. Ortiz,\n\n447 F.3d 28, 38-39 (1st Cir. 2006).                   Indeed, Kimbrough itself\n\nrecognizes as much.         Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 574 (recognizing\n\nthat \"district courts [remain] constrained by the mandatory\n\nminimums Congress prescribed\").\n\n              Finding all three of the defendant's arguments to be\n\nunavailing,        we   grant    the   government's         motion      for   summary\n\ndisposition and affirm the conviction and the sentence.                       See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",

We therefore need not reach the second, third, or\n\nfourth prongs of the plain-error standard.\n\n             The defendant's sentencing argument can be readily\n\n dispatched.       The district court correctly concluded that it had\n\n no choice but to impose a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence on\n\n the use-of-fire count consecutive to the five-year mandatory\n\n minimum sentence on the arson count.              See 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)\n\n (providing that a defendant convicted of this offense \"shall, in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\faddition to the punishment provided for [the underlying] felony\n\n[here, mail fraud], be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years\"\n\nand further providing, \"nor shall the term of imprisonment\n\nimposed under this subsection run concurrently with any other\n\nterm of imprisonment\").            The defendant's only argument to the\n\ncontrary      is   that   the    resulting       sentence    was     \"greater     than\n\nnecessary\" to serve the purposes of sentencing in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a) and the principles articulated in a trio of\n\nSupreme Court cases.
