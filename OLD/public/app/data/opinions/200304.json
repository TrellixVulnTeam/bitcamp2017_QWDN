This case concerns the\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction of federal district courts pursuant to\n\n§     252(e)(6)       of     the   Telecommunications         Act   of    1996    (the\n\n\"Telecommunications Act\" or \"Act\"), 47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6) (2000),\n\nand    the    scope     of    immunity    of    a   state    commission   and    state\n\ncommissioners from suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).                    In October\n\n1999, The       Destek       Group,    Inc.    (\"Destek\"),    Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\ninitiated this action in the district court against the State of\n\nNew        Hampshire,        Public     Utilities     Commission     (the        \"State\n\nCommission\"), Members of the Commission (the \"Commissioners\"),1 and\n\nVerizon       New   England,       Inc.   (\"Verizon\"),2      Defendants-Appellees.\n\nDestek sought judicial review pursuant to § 252(e)(6) of the Act,\n\nas well as injunctive relief and damages from the State Commission,\n\nthe Commissioners, and Verizon pursuant to § 1983 for violations of\n\nthe Telecommunications Act and the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.                 Ultimately, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for the State Commission, the Commissioners, and\n\nVerizon on all claims, save the § 1983 claim for prospective\n\ninjunctive relief against the Commissioners.                    The district court\n\ndenied Destek's summary judgment motion.                      Destek stipulated to\n\n\n\n       1\n      The members of the Commission are Douglas Patch, Susan S.\nGeiger, and Nancy Brockway.\n       2\n      The company we refer to as Verizon throughout this opinion\nwas known as New England Telephone and Telegraph Company and did\nbusiness as Bell Atlantic-New Hampshire prior to August 1, 2000.\n\n                                              -3-\n\fdismissal with prejudice of the § 1983 claim for prospective\n\ninjunctive relief in order to proceed with this appeal.\n\n                                 I.\n\n             On March 16, 1999, Verizon executed an agreement (the\n\n\"Agreement\") with the University of New Hampshire in which Verizon\n\ncontracted to provide asynchronous transfer mode (\"ATM\")3 cell\n\nrelay service to the University of New Hampshire within the State\n\nof New Hampshire at a uniform statewide rate of $655.75 per\n\ninterface4 per month, provided the University of New Hampshire\n\npurchase at least thirty interfaces.     On June 4, 1999, Verizon\n\nsubmitted a petition with the State Commission seeking approval of\n\nthe Agreement as a special contract pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\n\n\n     3\n         ATM is\n\n     [a] network architecture that divides messages into\n     fixed-size units (called cells) of small size (53 bytes)\n     and that establishes a switched connection between the\n     originating and receiving stations. . . . The advantage\n     of breaking all transmissions into small-sized cells is\n     that the network can transmit voice, audio, and computer\n     data over a single line without any single type of data\n     dominating the transmission. ATM's connection-oriented\n     design differs from the Internet's connectionless design;\n     unlike the Internet, ATM enables service providers to\n     bill by network usage and is capable of very high\n     transmission speeds.\n\nB. Pfaffenberger, Webster's New World Computer Dictionary 30 (9th\ned. 2001).\n     4\n      An interface, generally, is \"the connection between two\nhardware devices, between two applications, or between different\nsections of a computer network.\" Pfaffenberger, supra note 3, at\n196.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fAnn. § 378:18 (2002).5      Verizon claimed that the Agreement would\n\nenable   the   University   of   New    Hampshire   to   provide   \"distance\n\nlearning\"6 services to New Hampshire school students and libraries,\n\nas well as high speed internet access.7\n\n           On June 25, 1999, Destek8 sought to intervene in the\n\nState Commission proceedings and opposed the approval of the\n\nAgreement.     Destek maintained, inter alia, that special contracts\n\npursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 378:18, such as the Agreement at\n\nissue, are discriminatory and minimize competition.          Additionally,\n\n\n     5\n      Section 378:18, entitled \"Special Contracts for Service,\"\nprovides\n\n     Nothing herein shall prevent a public utility from making\n     a contract for service at rates other than those fixed by\n     its schedules of general application, if special\n     circumstances exist which render such departure from the\n     general schedules just and consistent with the public\n     interest and, except as provided in [N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n     §] 378:18-b, the commission shall by order allow such\n     contract to take effect.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 378:18.     Section 378:18-b provides that\nspecial contracts for telephone utilities shall become effective\nthirty days after filing provided certain rate conditions are met.\nId. § 378:18-b.\n     6\n      Distance learning is \"[t]he use of telecommunications (and,\nincreasingly the Internet) to provide educational outreach programs\nfor students at remote locations.\" Pfaffenberger, supra note 3, at\n118.\n     7\n      Concurrently, Verizon sought to keep certain cost data\nrelevant to the Agreement confidential by filing a motion for a\nprotective order, which the State Commission granted on October 4,\n1999.\n     8\n      Destek provides telecommunications services throughout New\nHampshire and New England.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fDestek noted that the University of New Hampshire had not filed\n\nwith the State Commission to become a telecommunications reseller\n\nor competitive local exchange carrier (\"CLEC\").9\n\n             By an order dated July 7, 1999, the State Commission\n\napproved the proposed special contract, subject to two conditions:\n\n(1) the State Commission required that Verizon file a tariff,\n\nwithin ninety days, making ATM services available statewide with\n\nthe same terms, conditions, and at the same prices as in the\n\nAgreement; and (2) the State Commission required that Verizon\n\nresubmit the Agreement to the State Commission disclosing more\n\ndetails     regarding   the   ATM   circuits.10   Noting   the   special\n\ncircumstances of this Agreement, the State Commission opined that\n\nthe public interest strongly favored quick approval of the contract\n\nbecause any delay could deny school children the benefits of ATM\n\nservices.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      A CLEC \"is a local exchange carrier [(\"LEC\")] that now is\npermitted (thanks to the U.S. 1996 Telecommunications Act) to\ncompete in local telephone markets with the incumbent local\nexchange carrier [(\"ILEC\")], the company that possessed a monopoly\nin that market prior to the passage of the 1996 reforms.\"\nPfaffenberger, supra note 3, at 75.\n\n     An LEC is \"[a] public telephone company that provides local\nservices.\" Id. at 218.\n     10\n          Subsequently, Verizon complied with these conditions.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f            Destek sought reconsideration of the State Commission's\n\norder,11    arguing      that    approval      of    the   Agreement      violated,\n\ninter alia, (1) the Telecommunications Act, and (2) the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.                 Specifically, Destek argued\n\nthat (1) Congress intended the Act to promote competition and thus,\n\nspecial contracts, as defined by N. H. Rev. Stat. § 378:18, are\n\npreempted by the Act because they stifle competition; and (2) to\n\nthe extent that special contracts are not preempted, the State\n\nCommission's approval of this special contract violates § 251(b)\n\nand § 253(a) of the Act.         In an order dated November 22, 1999, the\n\nState Commission denied Destek's motion for reconsideration.\n\n            On October 18, 1999, Destek filed suit in the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Hampshire. Destek's amended\n\ncomplaint       sought   declaratory      relief,      injunctive    relief,      and\n\ndamages, raising three specific claims.                First, Destek asserted a\n\nright      to     judicial      review      under      §      252(e)(6)    of     the\n\nTelecommunications        Act,    claiming     that     the    Agreement    was    an\n\ninterconnection agreement12 and discriminatory and contrary to the\n\n\n     11\n      In addition, the New Hampshire Office of the Consumer\nAdvocate   and   Vitts   Networks,   Inc., filed motions   for\nreconsideration of the State Commission's order. These motions\nwere denied by the State Commission.\n     12\n      An interconnection agreement is a contract between an ILEC\nand a telecommunications carrier linking their two networks\ntogether for mutual exchange consistent with the duties set out in\n47 U.S.C. § 251. Section 252 describes, inter alia, the procedures\nby which the parties may reach an interconnection agreement (either\nby negotiation or arbitration) and the procedures for State\n\n                                         -7-\n\fpublic interest.     Second, Destek sought injunctive relief and\n\ndamages from the State Commission, the Commissioners, and Verizon,\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for alleged violations of Destek's\n\nrights under the Act, citing the State Commission's approval of the\n\nAgreement without considering the federal standards for approval of\n\ninterconnection agreements. Third, Destek sought injunctive relief\n\nand damages, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against the State\n\nCommission and the Commissioners for alleged violations of Destek's\n\nrights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by\n\nrepeated denials of Destek's requests for a hearing.\n\n            All parties sought summary judgment based on the agency\n\nrecord developed before the State Commission.   The district court\n\n(1) granted Verizon's motion for summary judgment in its entirety,\n\n(2) granted partial summary judgment for the State Commission and\n\nthe Commissioners, and (3) denied Destek's motion for summary\n\njudgment.    First, the district court found that Destek could not\n\nproceed under § 252(e)(6) of the Act because the State Commission\n\nhad not made a \"determination\" under that section, a prerequisite\n\nfor federal district court review. Second, the district court held\n\nthat Destek's failure to demonstrate that Verizon's conduct was\n\nfairly attributable to the State precluded Destek from asserting §\n\n1983 claims against Verizon, a private actor.   Third, the district\n\n\ncommission approval or rejection of the agreement.     47 U.S.C. §\n252.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fcourt held that the State Commission and Commissioners in their\n\nofficial capacities were immune from suit under § 1983.     Fourth,\n\nthe district court found that Destek's claims for damages against\n\nthe Commissioners in their individual capacities were barred by the\n\ndoctrine of \"quasi-judicial\" immunity. Finally, the district court\n\ndenied both the Commissioners' and Destek's motions for summary\n\njudgment with respect to Destek's § 1983 claim for prospective\n\ninjunctive relief, finding a potentially viable claim for seeking\n\nto compel the Commissioners to comply with the Telecommunications\n\nAct, depending on the resolution of genuine issues of material fact\n\nas to whether the Agreement was subject to the Act.\n\n          In order to allow this appeal to proceed to this court,\n\nDestek stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of claims not\n\nresolved against it by the district court's summary judgment\n\ndecision, including the § 1983 claim for prospective injunctive\n\nrelief.   On September 28, 2001, the district court entered final\n\njudgment based on the stipulation.   This appeal follows.\n\n                               II.\n\n          Destek raises four main arguments on appeal: the district\n\ncourt erred in concluding that (1) the State Commission had not\n\nmade a § 252 \"determination\"; (2) Verizon was not liable under §\n\n1983; (3) the State Commission and Commissioners acting in their\n\nofficial capacity were immune from the § 1983 claims; and (4) the\n\nCommissioners were immune from the § 1983 claim in their individual\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fcapacities.    We disagree with Destek and for the reasons discussed\n\nbelow affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n           We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.   R.I. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp. v. Hayes, 64 F.3d 22,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 1995).          Summary judgment is appropriate when the\n\nrecord reflects \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . .\n\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).           We review the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are\n\ndrawn in that party's favor.          Hayes, 64 F.3d at 25.        \"[W]e are\n\n'mindful that the party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal\n\ncourt carries the burden of proving its existence.'\" P.R. Tel. Co.\n\nv. Telecomms.

In addition, we recognize that a party seeking\n\nimmunity bears the burden of showing that immunity is justified.\n\nBettencourt v. Bd. of Registration in Med., 904 F.2d 772, 784 n.15\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                      A.\n\n           First, Destek argues that the district court erred in\n\nholding that Destek lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the\n\nState Commission had not made a § 252 \"determination.\" We disagree\n\nand affirm the district court's dismissal.          Ultimately, the State\n\nCommission    never   made   a    determination   for   the   purposes   of   §\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f252(e)(6) and Destek never raised this issue before the State\n\nCommission.\n\n          A principal purpose of the Telecommunications Act is to\n\nincrease competition in the market for local telephone services.\n\nSee Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat.\n\n56, 56; P.R. Tel. Co., 189 F.3d at 7.                The statute imposes\n\nobligations    on     companies       that   control      the     existing\n\ntelecommunications network in the local area, known as ILECs.          See\n\n47 U.S.C. § 251; P.R. Tel. Co., 189 F.3d at 7.        Verizon is an ILEC.\n\n          Section 252 of the Act provides a comprehensive framework\n\nwithin which competitor telecommunications carriers, seeking to\n\nenter the local market, may negotiate interconnection agreements\n\n(linking the two networks for mutual exchange of traffic) with\n\nILECs.    47   U.S.C.    §   252.13      Under   §   252(e)(1),   if   the\n\ntelecommunications carrier and the ILEC agree on the terms for the\n\ninterconnection, the parties must submit their interconnection\n\nagreement to the relevant state regulatory commission for review.\n\nId. § 252(e)(1).    The state commission must then either approve or\n\ndisapprove the voluntarily negotiated interconnection agreement\n\nwithin ninety days; otherwise the agreement is deemed approved.\n\nId. § 252(e)(4).\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      If the parties are unable to voluntarily negotiate an\ninterconnection  agreement,  §   252 provides for compulsory\narbitration. 47 U.S.C. § 252(b).\n\n                                  -11-\n\f           Section 252(e)(2)(A) provides, in relevant part, that the\n\nstate   commission     may    only   reject       a   proposed      interconnection\n\nagreement adopted by voluntary negotiation if\n\n     (i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates\n     against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the\n     agreement; or (ii) the implementation of such agreement\n     or portion is not consistent with the public interest,\n     convenience, and necessity . . . .\n\nId. § 252(e)(2)(A).\n\n           Finally, § 252(e)(6) allows any party aggrieved by the\n\nstate commission's determination under § 252 to seek judicial\n\nreview, in a federal district court, of the determination for\n\ncompliance with §§ 251 and 252.           Id. § 252(e)(6).          Under § 252, the\n\nonly \"determination\" that can be made by a state commission in the\n\ncase of a voluntarily negotiated interconnection agreement is the\n\ndetermination of whether to approve or reject it.                    See id. § 252.\n\n           A fundamental principle of the structure of our democracy\n\nis that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.                          E.g.,\n\nOwen Equip. & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978);\n\nU.S.I. Props. Corp. v. M.D. Constr. Co., 230 F.3d 489, 499 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     The power of lower federal courts is limited to\n\njurisdiction authorized by the Constitution and expressly conferred\n\nby Congress.    Id.\n\n           In   this    case,    Destek         sought   review      of     the    State\n\nCommission's    actions      under   §    252(e)(6)      of   the    Act.         Section\n\n252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\f     [i]n any case in which a State commission makes a\n     determination under this section, any party aggrieved by\n     such determination may bring an action in an appropriate\n     Federal district court to determine whether the agreement\n     or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of\n     this title and this section.\n\n47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6) (emphasis added).               Thus, in order for a\n\nfederal district court to have jurisdiction under this section,\n\nCongress required (1) a determination by the state commission under\n\n§ 252, approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement; and (2)\n\na party aggrieved by that determination.          Clearly, the dispositive\n\njurisdictional inquiry under § 252(e)(6) is whether there was a\n\n\"determination\" for the purposes of that section.              We will assume,\n\nwithout deciding,    for   the   purpose    of    this      inquiry,    that   the\n\nAgreement is an interconnection agreement.\n\n          Verizon    and   the   University      of   New    Hampshire    sought\n\napproval of their Agreement as a special contract, pursuant to N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 378:18.    Upon motion to intervene, Destek argued\n\nthat such contracts were discriminatory and anticompetitive, never\n\nmentioning   the   Telecommunications      Act.       The    State     Commission\n\nconditionally approved the Agreement as a special contract. Destek\n\nsought reconsideration of the State Commission's approval, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that the Agreement violated § 251(b) (describing the\n\nobligations of local exchange carriers not to impose discriminatory\n\nconditions on the resale of telecommunications)14 and § 253(a)\n\n\n     14\n      Section 251, entitled \"Interconnection,\" imposes the general\nduty on telecommunications providers to interconnect by, inter\n\n                                   -13-\n\f(prohibiting state and local regulations from creating barriers to\n\nentry) of the Act.           The State Commission denied the motion for\n\nreconsideration.        Destek then sought review of this case in the\n\ndistrict court, claiming that the State Commission had made a\n\n\"determination\" for the purposes of § 252(e)(6).                       The district\n\ncourt correctly found this claim to be without merit.                     The record\n\nindicates     that     no    determination     approving        or     rejecting     an\n\ninterconnection agreement, pursuant to § 252, was made by the State\n\nCommission.      The    State    Commission       reviewed      and    approved     the\n\nAgreement solely under New Hampshire state law.                       Accordingly, §\n\n252(e)(6)     cannot    be    the    court's      source     of      subject   matter\n\njurisdiction in this case.\n\n            Moreover, \"orderly procedure and good administration\n\nrequire that objections to the proceedings of an administrative\n\nagency be made while it has opportunity for correction in order to\n\nraise issues reviewable by the courts.\"                  United States v. L.A.\n\nTucker   Truck   Lines,      Inc.,   344   U.S.    33,     37   (1952);    see     also\n\nPepperell Assocs. v. EPA, 246 F.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding\n\n\n\nalia, not imposing unreasonable conditions on resale of\ntelecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. § 251. Here, Destek argued\nthat the approval of the special contract between the University of\nNew Hampshire and Verizon (or for that matter any special contract)\nviolated this duty to interconnect with Destek by imposing\ndiscriminatory conditions, in favor of the University of New\nHampshire, on the resale of Verizon's telecommunications services.\nDestek did not argue to the State Commission that the Agreement was\nan interconnection agreement between the University of New\nHampshire and Verizon.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fthat a claim not timely raised before an administrative agency\n\ncould not be subject to judicial review).          The record indicates\n\nthat Destek raised this issue for the first time before the\n\ndistrict court.      In other words, Destek failed to timely present\n\nthis issue before the State Commission, and thus deprived the State\n\nCommission of the opportunity to address the issue.            Subjecting\n\nthe State Commission to federal court jurisdiction, in this case,\n\nwould violate the State Commission's autonomy.            See, e.g., id.\n\n(noting     that   \"this   rule   preserves   judicial   economy,   agency\n\nautonomy, and accuracy of result by requiring full development of\n\nthe issues in the administrative setting to obtain judicial review\"\n\n(quoting N. Wind, Inc. v. Daley, 200 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted))).\n\n             Accordingly, the district court correctly dismissed this\n\nclaim because it was not properly before the court for judicial\n\nreview.15\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      Destek finds this result troubling because Destek believes\nthis result means that \"if the state commission approves such an\nagreement under State law, and fails to affirmatively find that it\nis, or is not, an interconnection agreement, that decision cannot\nbe reviewed under the provisions of § 252(e)(6).\"      Br. for the\nAppellant at 12.    This court does not share Destek's concerns\nbecause we do not believe that § 252(e)(6) is a mechanism to compel\na state commission's application of the Telecommunications Act. A\nclaim that the State Commission violated federal law is distinct\nfrom a claim that the State Commission acted under federal-law\nauthority, and only the latter claim is relevant to this case.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f                                             B.\n\n                 Second, the district court found that Destek's claims\n\nagainst Verizon, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, were without merit.                         We\n\nagree.16\n\n                 Section    1983    allows   plaintiffs      to   seek     redress   for\n\n\"deprivation of any rights, privileges, and immunities secured by\n\nthe Constitution and laws.\"              42 U.S.C. § 1983.        A critical element\n\nof any § 1983 claim is that the plaintiff show deprivation caused\n\nby   a        person   acting   \"under    color   of   any    statute,      ordinance,\n\nregulation, custom, or usage of any State or Territory or the\n\nDistrict         of    Columbia.\"     Id.;    Gonzalez-Morales        v.    Hernandez-\n\nArencibia, 221 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).                   As a result of this\n\n\"color of state law\" requirement, § 1983 rarely provides a cause of\n\naction against a private individual, \"restrict[ing] § 1983 to\n\n'state action.'\" Id. (quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S.\n\n922, 935 (1982)).          Only when a private individual's conduct can be\n\ndeemed \"fairly attributable to the State\" will a § 1983 cause of\n\naction exist against that individual.                  Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937;\n\nGonzalez-Morales, 221 F.3d at 49.\n\n\n\n\n         16\n      Because we hold that Destek's claims are barred on other\ngrounds, we need not resolve whether Destek's allegations amount to\na § 1983 claim.\n\n                                          -16-\n\f          Destek failed to show any conduct by Verizon that was\n\nfairly attributable to the State.17    See Gerena v. P.R. Legal\n\nServs., Inc., 697 F.2d 447, 449 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"The mere fact of\n\ngovernment regulation does not convert the regulated entity into\n\nthe government . . . .\"). Accordingly, the district court properly\n\ngranted summary judgment for Verizon on these claims.\n\n\n\n\n     17\n      In fact, Destek fails to challenge any actions taken by\nVerizon and instead only contests the State Commission's decision\nto approve the Agreement between Verizon and the University of New\nHampshire, not Verizon's decision to contract with the University\nof New Hampshire. The implication is that Destek would like us to\nattribute the actions of the State to a private actor for the\npurposes of § 1983 liability. This situation requires us to step\nthrough a similar \"analytical looking glass\" as the Supreme Court\nstepped through in Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Tarkanian,\n488 U.S. 179, 192-93 (1988) (\"In the typical case raising a state-\naction issue, a private party has taken the decisive step that\ncaused the harm to the plaintiff, and the question is whether the\nState was sufficiently involved to treat that decisive conduct as\nstate action.\"). In Tarkanian, the Court concluded that a state\nuniversity's adoption of the National Collegiate Athletic\nAssociation's (\"NCAA\") disciplinary procedures did not turn the\nNCAA's promulgation of those procedures into state action. Id. at\n193-94.   Similarly, here, a state commission's approval of an\nagreement cannot turn a private individual's act of contracting\ninto state action for the purposes of § 1983.\n\n                              -17-\n\f                                        C.\n\nThird, the district court held that the State Commission and the\n\nCommissioners in their official capacities were immune from suit\n\nfor damages under § 1983.18       We agree.19\n\n               Destek   argues   that    the   State   Commission   and     the\n\nCommissioners waived their immunity by voluntarily participating in\n\nthe regulatory scheme established by the Telecommunications Act.\n\nWhether a state waives its sovereign immunity by participating in\n\nthe Act's regime is irrelevant to this issue because Destek seeks\n\nto impose liability pursuant to § 1983, not the Act.\n\n               \"It is well settled beyond peradventure . . . that\n\nneither a state agency nor a state official acting in his official\n\ncapacity may be sued for damages in a § 1983 action.\"           See Johnson\n\nv. Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 108 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Will v.\n\nMich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989)).                     Thus,\n\nDestek's claims against the State Commission and the Commissioners\n\nin their official capacity for damages are contrary to established\n\nlaw.\n\n                                         D.\n\n               Finally, the district court held that Destek's claims for\n\ndamages against the Commissioners in their individual capacities,\n\n\n       18\n       As mentioned above, Destek voluntarily stipulated to the\ndismissal with prejudice of its § 1983 claim for prospective\ninjunctive relief in order to appeal the district court's decision.\n       19\n            See supra note 16.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fpursuant to § 1983, were barred by the doctrine of \"quasi-judicial\"\n\nimmunity. We agree.20\n\n              This court must take a functional approach to determining\n\nwhether absolute immunity is appropriate for the Commissioners.\n\nSee Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 224 (1988); Bettencourt, 904\n\nF.2d at 782 (citing Scott v. Centr. Me. Power Co., 709 F. Supp.\n\n1176, 1187 (D. Me. 1989) (\"Even though by statute a state agency\n\nofficial at various times may perform legislative, executive and\n\njudicial functions, each of which may entitle the official to a\n\ndifferent level of immunity, the functional approach to immunity\n\nrequires that actions taken in the performance of a particular\n\nfunction are to be accorded the level of immunity appropriate to\n\nthat function.\" (emphasis in original))).                 Absolute immunity is\n\navailable      to   \"certain    'quasi    judicial'   agency     officials   who,\n\nirrespective of their title, perform functions essentially similar\n\nto those of judges . . . in a setting similar to that of a court.\"\n\nId.   (citing       Butz   v.   Economou,    438   U.S.   478,   511-17   (1977))\n\n(emphasis in original).          This is the doctrine of \"quasi-judicial\"\n\nimmunity for members of adjudicatory bodies.\n\n              Accordingly,       we   must      decide    here    whether     the\n\nCommissioners have shown that while executing the activities which\n\ngave rise to this claim, namely denying Destek's motions for a\n\nhearing in the course of the evaluation of a contract under N.H.\n\n\n      20\n           See supra note 16.\n\n                                         -19-\n\fRev. Stat. Ann. § 378:18, they were acting in an adjudicatory\n\ncapacity such that the Commissioners are entitled to absolute\n\nimmunity.     This court laid out a three-part test to determine\n\nwhether     \"quasi-judicial\"    immunity       should     attach    to    agency\n\nofficials:\n\n     First, [do the Commissioners], like . . . judge[s],\n     perform a traditional \"adjudicatory\" function, in that\n     [they] decide[] facts, appl[y] law, and otherwise\n     resolve[] disputes on the merits (free from direct\n     political influence)? Second, [do the Commissioners],\n     like . . . judge[s], decide cases sufficiently\n     controversial that, in the absence of absolute immunity,\n     [they] would be subject to numerous damages actions?\n     Third, [do the Commissioners], like . . . judge[s],\n     adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of multiple\n     safeguards designed to protect a [party's] constitutional\n     rights?\n\nBettencourt, 904 F.2d at 783.\n\n             First, in determining whether a contract constitutes a\n\nspecial contract, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 378:18, and\n\ndenying an intervenor's motion for a hearing, the Commissioners\n\nperform tasks functionally comparable to judges: they review and\n\ndecide facts, apply relevant law to those facts, resolve disputes,\n\nand issue written orders explaining their decisions.               Second, the\n\ndecisions whether to approve a special contract and whether to deny\n\na competitor the right to a hearing regarding that contract are\n\nsufficiently    controversial    that,    in    the     absence    of    absolute\n\nimmunity, the Commissioners would be subject to numerous damages\n\nactions.     Third, the rights of parties involved in approval of\n\nspecial    contracts   and   requests    for    hearings    regarding      those\n\n                                  -20-\n\fapprovals are sufficiently protected by the extensive procedures\n\nset out for State Commission decisions.   See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n§§ 365:1-35 (describing the State Commission's purpose, duties, and\n\nprocedures); see also N.H. Code Admin. R. PUC 201.01-205.10 (2002).\n\n          We, therefore, conclude that under these circumstances,\n\nthe Commissioners are entitled to absolute immunity in their\n\n\"quasi-judicial\" function and cannot be subjected to Destek's claim\n\nfor damages in their individual capacity.21\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n\n\n     21\n      This holding is limited to the Commissioners' role as\nadjudicators; to the extent that they perform legislative or\nexecutive functions, the level of immunity, if any, will vary.\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

In October 1999, The Destek Group, Inc. (\"Destek\"), Plaintiff-Appellant, initiated this action in the district court against the State of New Hampshire, Public Utilities Commission (the \"State Commission\"), Members of the Commission (the \"Commissioners\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and Verizon New England, Inc.

Ultimately, the district court granted summary judgment for the State Commission, the Commissioners, and Verizon on all claims, save the &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief against the Commissioners. The district court denied Destek's summary judgment motion. Destek stipulated to dismissal with prejudice of the &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief in order to proceed with this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 1999, Verizon executed an agreement (the \"Agreement\") with the University of New Hampshire in which Verizon contracted to provide asynchronous transfer mode (\"ATM\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> cell relay service to the University of New Hampshire within the State of New Hampshire at a uniform statewide rate of $655.75 per interface<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> per month, provided the University of New Hampshire purchase at least thirty interfaces. On June 4, 1999, Verizon submitted a petition with the State Commission seeking approval of the Agreement as a special contract pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 378:18 (2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Verizon claimed that the Agreement would enable the University of New Hampshire to provide \"distance learning\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> services to New Hampshire school students and libraries, as well as high speed internet access.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 1999, Destek<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> sought to intervene in the State Commission proceedings and opposed the approval of the Agreement. Destek maintained, <i>inter alia,</i> that special contracts pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 378:18, such as the Agreement at issue, are discriminatory and minimize competition. Additionally, Destek noted that the University of New Hampshire had not filed with the State Commission to become a telecommunications reseller or competitive local exchange carrier (\"CLEC\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By an order dated July 7, 1999, the State Commission approved the proposed special contract, subject to two conditions: (1) the State Commission required that Verizon file a tariff, within ninety days, making ATM services available statewide with the same terms, conditions, and at the same prices as in the Agreement; and (2) the State Commission required that Verizon resubmit the Agreement to the State Commission disclosing more details regarding the ATM circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Noting the special circumstances of this Agreement, the State Commission opined that the public interest strongly favored quick approval of the contract because any delay could deny school children the benefits of ATM services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Destek sought reconsideration of the State Commission's order,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> arguing that approval of the Agreement violated, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) the Telecommunications Act, and (2) the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, Destek argued that (1) Congress intended the Act to promote competition and thus, special contracts, as defined by N.H.Rev.Stat. &#167; 378:18, are preempted by the Act because they stifle competition; and (2) to the extent that special contracts are not preempted, the State Commission's approval of this special contract violates &#167; 251(b) and &#167; 253(a) of the Act. In an order dated November 22, 1999, the State Commission denied Destek's motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 18, 1999, Destek filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Destek's amended complaint sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages, raising three specific claims. First, Destek asserted a right to judicial review under &#167; 252(e)(6) of the Telecommunications Act, claiming that the Agreement was an interconnection agreement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and discriminatory and contrary to the public interest. Second, Destek sought injunctive relief and damages from the State Commission, the Commissioners, and Verizon, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, for alleged violations of Destek's rights under the Act, citing the State Commission's approval of the Agreement without considering the federal standards for approval of interconnection agreements. Third, Destek sought injunctive relief and damages, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, against the State Commission and the Commissioners for alleged violations of Destek's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by repeated denials of Destek's requests for a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All parties sought summary judgment based on the agency record developed before the State Commission. The district court (1) granted Verizon's motion for summary judgment in its entirety, (2) granted partial summary judgment for the State Commission and the Commissioners, and (3) denied Destek's motion for summary judgment. First, the district court found that Destek could not proceed under &#167; 252(e)(6) of the Act because the State Commission had not made a \"determination\" under that section, a prerequisite for federal district court review. Second, the district court held that Destek's failure to demonstrate that Verizon's conduct was fairly attributable to the State precluded Destek from asserting &#167; 1983 claims against Verizon, a private actor. Third, the district court held that the State Commission and Commissioners in their official capacities were immune from suit under &#167; 1983. Fourth, the district court found that Destek's claims for damages against the Commissioners in their individual capacities were barred by the doctrine of \"quasi-judicial\" immunity. Finally, the district court denied both the Commissioners' and Destek's motions for summary judgment with respect to Destek's &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief, finding a potentially viable claim for seeking to compel the Commissioners to comply with the Telecommunications Act, depending on the resolution of genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Agreement was subject to the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to allow this appeal to proceed to this court, Destek stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of claims not resolved against it by the district court's summary judgment decision, including the &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief.

Ultimately, the State Commission never made a determination for the purposes of &#167; 252(e)(6) and Destek never raised this issue before the State Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A principal purpose of the Telecommunications Act is to increase competition in the market for local telephone services. <i>See</i> Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub.L.

The statute imposes obligations on companies that control the existing telecommunications network in the local area, known as ILECs. <i>See</i> 47 U.S.C. &#167; 251; <i>P.R. Tel.

Under &#167; 252, the only \"determination\" that can be made by a state commission in the case of a voluntarily negotiated interconnection agreement is the determination of whether to approve or reject it. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fundamental principle of the structure of our democracy is that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. <i>E.g., Owen Equip. &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger,</i> 437 U.S. 365, 374, 98 S.Ct. 2396, 57 L.Ed.2d 274 (1978); <i>U.S.I. Props. Corp. v. M.D. Constr. Co.,</i> 230 F.3d 489, 499 (1st Cir.2000).

Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]n any case in which a State commission <i>makes a determination</i> under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6) (emphasis added). Thus, in order for a federal district court to have jurisdiction under this section, Congress required (1) a determination by the state commission under &#167; 252, approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement; and (2) a party aggrieved by that determination. Clearly, the dispositive jurisdictional inquiry under &#167; 252(e)(6) is whether there was a \"determination\" for the purposes of that section. We will assume, without deciding, for the purpose of this inquiry, that the Agreement is an interconnection agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verizon and the University of New Hampshire sought approval of their Agreement as a special contract, pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 378:18. Upon motion to intervene, Destek argued that such contracts were discriminatory and anticompetitive, never mentioning the Telecommunications Act. The State Commission conditionally approved the Agreement as a special contract. Destek sought reconsideration of the State Commission's approval, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Agreement violated &#167; 251(b) (describing the obligations of local exchange carriers not to impose discriminatory conditions on the resale of telecommunications)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and &#167; 253(a) (prohibiting state and local regulations from creating barriers to entry) of the Act. The State Commission denied the motion for reconsideration. Destek then sought review of this case in the district court, claiming that the State Commission had made a \"determination\" for the purposes of &#167; 252(e)(6). The district court correctly found this claim to be without merit. The record indicates that no determination approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement, pursuant to &#167; 252, was made by the State Commission. The State Commission reviewed and approved the Agreement solely under New Hampshire state law. Accordingly, &#167; 252(e)(6) cannot be the court's source of subject matter jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, \"orderly procedure and good administration require that objections to the proceedings of an administrative agency be made while it has opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts.\" <i>United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> 344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952); <i>see also Pepperell Assocs. v. EPA,</i> 246 F.3d 15, 27 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that a claim not timely raised before an administrative agency could not be subject to judicial review). The record indicates that Destek raised this issue for the first time before the district court. In other words, Destek failed to timely present this issue before the State Commission, and thus deprived the State Commission of the opportunity to address the issue. Subjecting the State Commission to federal court jurisdiction, in this case, would violate the State Commission's autonomy. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> (noting that \"this rule preserves judicial economy, agency autonomy, and accuracy of result by requiring full development of the issues in the administrative setting to obtain judicial review\" (quoting <i>N.

Second, the decisions whether to approve a special contract and whether to deny a competitor the right to a hearing regarding that contract are sufficiently controversial that, in the absence of absolute immunity, the Commissioners would be subject to numerous damages actions.

This court does not share Destek's concerns because we do not believe that &#167; 252(e)(6) is a mechanism to compel a state commission's application of the Telecommunications Act.

The implication is that Destek would like us to attribute the actions of the State to a private actor for the purposes of &#167; 1983 liability.

In October 1999, The Destek Group, Inc. (\"Destek\"), Plaintiff-Appellant, initiated this action in the district court against the State of New Hampshire, Public Utilities Commission (the \"State Commission\"), Members of the Commission (the \"Commissioners\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and Verizon New England, Inc. (\"Verizon\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Defendants-Appellees.

Ultimately, the district court granted summary judgment for the State Commission, the Commissioners, and Verizon on all claims, save the &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief against the Commissioners. The district court denied Destek's summary judgment motion. Destek stipulated to dismissal with prejudice of the &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief in order to proceed with this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 1999, Verizon executed an agreement (the \"Agreement\") with the University of New Hampshire in which Verizon contracted to provide asynchronous transfer mode (\"ATM\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> cell relay service to the University of New Hampshire within the State of New Hampshire at a uniform statewide rate of $655.75 per interface<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> per month, provided the University of New Hampshire purchase at least thirty interfaces. On June 4, 1999, Verizon submitted a petition with the State Commission seeking approval of the Agreement as a special contract pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 378:18 (2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Verizon claimed that the Agreement would enable the University of New Hampshire to provide \"distance learning\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> services to New Hampshire school students and libraries, as well as high speed internet access.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 25, 1999, Destek<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> sought to intervene in the State Commission proceedings and opposed the approval of the Agreement. Destek maintained, <i>inter alia,</i> that special contracts pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 378:18, such as the Agreement at issue, are discriminatory and minimize competition. Additionally, Destek noted that the University of New Hampshire had not filed with the State Commission to become a telecommunications reseller or competitive local exchange carrier (\"CLEC\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By an order dated July 7, 1999, the State Commission approved the proposed special contract, subject to two conditions: (1) the State Commission required that Verizon file a tariff, within ninety days, making ATM services available statewide with the same terms, conditions, and at the same prices as in the Agreement; and (2) the State Commission required that Verizon resubmit the Agreement to the State Commission disclosing more details regarding the ATM circuits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Noting the special circumstances of this Agreement, the State Commission opined that the public interest strongly favored quick approval of the contract because any delay could deny school children the benefits of ATM services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Destek sought reconsideration of the State Commission's order,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> arguing that approval of the Agreement violated, <i>inter alia,</i> (1) the Telecommunications Act, and (2) the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, Destek argued that (1) Congress intended the Act to promote competition and thus, special contracts, as defined by N.H.Rev.Stat. &#167; 378:18, are preempted by the Act because they stifle competition; and (2) to the extent that special contracts are not preempted, the State Commission's approval of this special contract violates &#167; 251(b) and &#167; 253(a) of the Act. In an order dated November 22, 1999, the State Commission denied Destek's motion for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 18, 1999, Destek filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Destek's amended complaint sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages, raising three specific claims. First, Destek asserted a right to judicial review under &#167; 252(e)(6) of the Telecommunications Act, claiming that the Agreement was an interconnection agreement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and discriminatory and contrary to the public interest. Second, Destek sought injunctive relief and damages from the State Commission, the Commissioners, and Verizon, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, for alleged violations of Destek's rights under the Act, citing the State Commission's approval of the Agreement without considering the federal standards for approval of interconnection agreements. Third, Destek sought injunctive relief and damages, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, against the State Commission and the Commissioners for alleged violations of Destek's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by repeated denials of Destek's requests for a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All parties sought summary judgment based on the agency record developed before the State Commission. The district court (1) granted Verizon's motion for summary judgment in its entirety, (2) granted partial summary judgment for the State Commission and the Commissioners, and (3) denied Destek's motion for summary judgment. First, the district court found that Destek could not proceed under &#167; 252(e)(6) of the Act because the State Commission had not made a \"determination\" under that section, a prerequisite for federal district court review. Second, the district court held that Destek's failure to demonstrate that Verizon's conduct was fairly attributable to the State precluded Destek from asserting &#167; 1983 claims against Verizon, a private actor. Third, the district court held that the State Commission and Commissioners in their official capacities were immune from suit under &#167; 1983. Fourth, the district court found that Destek's claims for damages against the Commissioners in their individual capacities were barred by the doctrine of \"quasi-judicial\" immunity. Finally, the district court denied both the Commissioners' and Destek's motions for summary judgment with respect to Destek's &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief, finding a potentially viable claim for seeking to compel the Commissioners to comply with the Telecommunications Act, depending on the resolution of genuine issues of material fact as to whether the Agreement was subject to the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to allow this appeal to proceed to this court, Destek stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of claims not resolved against it by the district court's summary judgment decision, including the &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief. On September 28, 2001, the district court entered final judgment based on the stipulation. This appeal follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Destek raises four main arguments on appeal: the district court erred in concluding that (1) the State Commission had not made a &#167; 252 \"determination\"; (2) Verizon was not liable under &#167; 1983; (3) the State Commission and Commissioners acting in their official capacity were immune from the &#167; 1983 claims; and (4) the Commissioners were immune from the &#167; 1983 claim in their individual capacities.

Thus, in order for a federal district court to have jurisdiction under this section, Congress required (1) a determination by the state commission under &#167; 252, approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement; and (2) a party aggrieved by that determination. Clearly, the dispositive jurisdictional inquiry under &#167; 252(e)(6) is whether there was a \"determination\" for the purposes of that section.

The State Commission conditionally approved the Agreement as a special contract. Destek sought reconsideration of the State Commission's approval, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Agreement violated &#167; 251(b) (describing the obligations of local exchange carriers not to impose discriminatory conditions on the resale of telecommunications)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and &#167; 253(a) (prohibiting state and local regulations from creating barriers to entry) of the Act. The State Commission denied the motion for reconsideration. Destek then sought review of this case in the district court, claiming that the State Commission had made a \"determination\" for the purposes of &#167; 252(e)(6). The district court correctly found this claim to be without merit. The record indicates that no determination approving or rejecting an interconnection agreement, pursuant to &#167; 252, was made by the State Commission. The State Commission reviewed and approved the Agreement solely under New Hampshire state law.

A claim that the State Commission violated federal law is distinct from a claim that the State Commission acted under federal-law authority, and only the latter claim is relevant to this case</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Because we hold that Destek's claims are barred on other grounds, we need not resolve whether Destek's allegations amount to a &#167; 1983 claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> In fact, Destek fails to challenge any actions taken by Verizon and instead only contests the State Commission's decision to approve the Agreement between Verizon and the University of New Hampshire, not Verizon's decision to contract with the University of New Hampshire. The implication is that Destek would like us to attribute the actions of the State to a private actor for the purposes of &#167; 1983 liability. This situation requires us to step through a similar \"analytical looking glass\" as the Supreme Court stepped through in<i>Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Tarkanian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112162\"><a href=\"/opinion/112162/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-tarkanian/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 192-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112162\"><a href=\"/opinion/112162/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-tarkanian/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Tarkanian,</i> the Court concluded that a state university's adoption of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (\"NCAA\") disciplinary procedures did not turn the NCAA's promulgation of those procedures into state action. <i>Id.</i> at 193-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112162\"><a href=\"/opinion/112162/national-collegiate-athletic-assn-v-tarkanian/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>. Similarly, here, a state commission's approval of an agreement cannot turn a private individual's act of contracting into state action for the purposes of &#167; 1983.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> As mentioned above, Destek voluntarily stipulated to the dismissal with prejudice of its &#167; 1983 claim for prospective injunctive relief in order to appeal the district court's decision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> <i>See supra</i> note 16.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> <i>See supra</i> note 16.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> This holding is limited to the Commissioners' role as adjudicators; to the extent that they perform legislative or executive functions, the level of immunity, if any, will vary</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
