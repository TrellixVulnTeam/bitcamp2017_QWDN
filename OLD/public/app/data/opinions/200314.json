Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Cynthia A.

Appellant Lorenzo Woods appeals from the\n\nsentence the district court imposed following his guilty plea\n\nto three cocaine base offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and\n\n§ 846 and 18 U.S.C. § 2.       On appeal, he asserts that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously applied United States Sentencing\n\nGuideline § 2D1.1 at sentencing.      In addition, he claims that\n\nthe district court misunderstood its departure authority under\n\nGuideline § 4A1.3 and thus failed to grant his motion for a\n\ndownward departure.\n\n            After careful review of the record, in particular the\n\nsentencing transcript, we conclude that the court properly\n\napplied the career offender guideline, § 4B1.1, at sentencing.\n\nTo that extent, we affirm the sentence.    We also agree with the\n\nUnited States that the district court denied the departure\n\nmotion in an exercise of its discretion and not based on any\n\nmisapprehension of authority.        Thus, we may not review its\n\ndecision.    See United States v.
