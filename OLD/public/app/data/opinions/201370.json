Like most states, Massachusetts\n\nregulates the relationship between motor vehicle manufacturers and\n\nmotor vehicle dealers in considerable detail.          See Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 93B, §§ 1-15.1    Relying on these rules, a multi-brand dealer\n\ndoing business as John Santilli's Center for Automobiles (Santilli)\n\nbrought suit against a manufacturer, General Motors Corporation\n\n(GM), alleging that the manufacturer had engaged in a number of\n\nunfair practices.     GM denied the material allegations of the\n\ncomplaint. Without resolving whether the manufacturer had violated\n\nthe statute, the district court entered summary judgment in its\n\nfavor on the ground that Santilli had not shown any actionable harm\n\nflowing from the challenged conduct.          Discerning no error in the\n\ndistrict court's thoughtful disposition, we affirm.\n\nI.   THE STATUTORY SCHEME\n\n           We begin by limning the purpose, text, and structure of\n\nthe statute.    Chapter 93B, familiarly known as the \"Dealers' Bill\n\nof Rights,\" has two central purposes.             One is to curb \"the\n\npotentially    oppressive   power   of    automobile   manufacturers   and\n\ndistributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.\"              Beard\n\nMotors, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc., 480 N.E.2d 303, 306\n\n(Mass. 1985).    The other is to regulate competition in the retail\n\n\n     1\n      The legislature amended chapter 93B in 2002. See 2002 Mass.\nLegis. Serv. ch. 222 (West).    The relevant events in this case\noccurred before the effective date of the amendment, so the pre-\namendment version of the statute controls.        Throughout this\nopinion, we cite to that version.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fautomobile industry for the benefit of the public at large.                Am.\n\nHonda Motor Co. v. Bernardi's, Inc., 735 N.E.2d 348, 354 (Mass.\n\n2000).\n\n             To effectuate these dual objectives, the statute places\n\noff limits certain \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or\n\ndeceptive acts or practices.\"           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3.     These\n\nmethods, acts, and practices are delineated in section 4.                 That\n\nsection generally proscribes conduct that is \"arbitrary, in bad\n\nfaith, or unconscionable.\"          Id. § 4(1).      It then describes, and\n\nspecifically prohibits, twenty-one discrete acts and practices.\n\nId. § 4(2)-(4).\n\n             The statutory scheme maps two remedial avenues.               One\n\ninvolves public enforcement:            the Attorney General may enforce the\n\nlaw.     Id. § 12.      The other involves private enforcement:            the\n\nstatute creates private rights of action for injunctive relief and\n\ndamages.     Id. § 12A.\n\n             This case turns on the meaning and operation of section\n\n12A.    In pertinent part, that section authorizes \"[a]ny franchisee\n\nor motor vehicle dealer who suffers any loss of money or property\n\n.   .   .   as   a   result   of   [a    violation   of   the   statute   by   a\n\nmanufacturer]\" to bring a civil action for equitable relief or\n\ndamages.    A dealer who has not suffered a loss of money or property\n\nas a result of an unfair act or practice may still bring an action\n\nfor equitable relief — but not for damages — if \"it can be shown\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthat the . . . unfair act or practice may have the effect of\n\ncausing such [a] loss of money or property\" in the future.         Id.\n\nII.   THE FACTS\n\n           Consistent   with   the    summary   judgment   standard,   we\n\nrehearse the facts in the light most favorable to Santilli.            See\n\nHoulton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           For many years, Santilli has operated an independent\n\nautomobile dealership in Brockton, Massachusetts.          It is, inter\n\nalia, licensed to sell the Cadillac line of vehicles (Cadillac is\n\na GM brand and all licensed Cadillac dealers are, therefore, GM\n\nfranchisees).     During the same time frame, Norwood Cadillac has\n\noperated a Cadillac dealership in Norwood, Massachusetts. By 1998,\n\nthe two dealerships had been in competition for several years. For\n\npurposes of this appeal, we assume — but do not decide — that\n\nNorwood Cadillac is within Santilli's relevant market area (RMA),\n\nas that term is defined in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 4(3)(k).2\n\n          In the late 1990s, GM inaugurated the multi-site project\n\n(MSP), a program designed to increase GM's presence in certain\n\ngeographic markets.     Under the aegis of the MSP, GM aspired to\n\n\n      2\n      GM argues that Santilli failed to produce competent evidence\nthat Norwood is in Santilli's RMA and urges us to affirm the entry\nof summary judgment on this alternative ground. See, e.g., Houlton\nCitizens' Coalition, 175 F.3d at 184 (explaining that the court of\nappeals may affirm an order for summary judgment \"on any ground\nrevealed by the record\"). Given the view that we take of the case,\nsee text infra, we need not resolve this issue.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcreate joint ventures with successful independent dealers so that\n\nthe latter could own multiple dealerships (thus achieving economies\n\nof scale and, not coincidentally, improving sales of GM vehicles in\n\nthe targeted markets).\n\n            In November of 1998, the MSP came to the greater Boston\n\narea when a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM partnered with Joseph\n\nLaham, the owner of Norwood Cadillac, to form Mass Bay Automotive,\n\nLLC (MassBay).      The original plan contemplated that MassBay, under\n\nLaham's hegemony, would own and operate both Norwood Cadillac and\n\nNorth     Shore    Buick-Pontiac-GMC     Truck   (a   dealership     that   GM\n\npreviously had acquired). GM contributed approximately $13,000,000\n\nin working capital and the assets of the North Shore dealership to\n\nMassBay    in     exchange   for   a   90%   ownership   interest.      Laham\n\ncontributed the fixed assets and leasehold improvements of Norwood\n\nCadillac, valued in excess of $1,400,000, in exchange for a 10%\n\nownership interest. He then sold the Norwood dealership, including\n\nits goodwill and inventories of used cars and parts, to MassBay for\n\napproximately $6,300,000.\n\n            MassBay proved to be a flop, and Laham sold his ownership\n\ninterest to GM in January of 2000.             At that point, GM was, in\n\neffect, the sole owner of Norwood Cadillac.           It then began seeking\n\na purchaser for the dealership, hoping to find a buyer who would\n\noperate Norwood as part of another MSP arrangement.                When this\n\ngambit failed, GM began pursuing a more traditional sale.             To this\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fend, it solicited bids for the dealership in mid-2001.       Santilli\n\nwas among the bidders, but GM accepted a better offer from a third\n\nparty.   The sale closed, and GM's de facto ownership of Norwood\n\nCadillac ceased, on October 30, 2001.\n\nIII.   THE LAWSUIT\n\n            Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a),\n\nSantilli sued GM in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts. Its complaint contained four statements\n\nof claim.    We describe them briefly.\n\n            Count 1 emanates from a provision of the Dealers' Bill of\n\nRights that renders it unlawful for an automobile manufacturer\n\n            to own and operate . . . a motor vehicle\n            dealership within the relevant market area of\n            a motor vehicle dealer of the same line make;\n            provided, however, that a manufacturer . . .\n            shall not be deemed to be in violation of this\n            paragraph when operating a dealership either\n            temporarily for a reasonable period in any\n            case not to exceed one year or in a bona fide\n            relationship [with] an independent person . .\n            . .\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 4(3)(k).        Santilli alleges that GM\n\nviolated this prohibition from and after November of 1999 (one year\n\nafter MassBay had assumed ownership of Norwood Cadillac).      In its\n\nview, Laham's relatively small equity interest in MassBay, combined\n\nwith the restrictive provisions of the MassBay operating agreement,\n\nprecluded MassBay from coming within the statutory safe harbor for\n\n\"bona fide relationship[s]\" between manufacturers and independent\n\npersons. See id.     As a fallback, Santilli alleges that GM violated\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe statutory prohibition from and after January of 2001 (one year\n\nafter it had assumed full ownership of MassBay and, by extension,\n\nof Norwood Cadillac).\n\n            Santilli premised count 2 on the catchall provision of\n\nthe Dealers' Bill of Rights.        That provision proscribes actions\n\nthat are \"arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable.\" Id. § 4(1).\n\nIn support of this claim, Santilli alleged that GM's ownership and\n\noperation of Norwood Cadillac after the one-year statutory grace\n\nperiod and its favorable treatment of Norwood Cadillac during the\n\nensuing period3 constituted arbitrary and unconscionable conduct.\n\n            Count   3   alleges   that    GM   acted   arbitrarily   in   its\n\nallocation of new vehicles, thus unfairly benefitting Norwood\n\nCadillac.    Inasmuch as Santilli quickly abandoned this claim, we\n\neschew any further comment on it.\n\n            Count 4 alleges that GM violated a statutory provision\n\nthat generally prohibits \"[u]nfair methods of competition and\n\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"            Id. 3(a).    This count\n\nessentially replicates the substantive claims set out in the\n\nprevious three counts.\n\n            At the close of discovery, Santilli moved for partial\n\nsummary judgment on the three counts then remaining, namely, counts\n\n\n     3\n      Santilli alleged, for example, that GM allowed Norwood\nCadillac and North Shore to share administrative personnel (a\npractice that GM normally forbids) and that Norwood Cadillac\nreceived financing rates from General Motors Acceptance Corporation\nthat were unavailable to independent dealers.\n\n                                    -7-\n\f1, 2, and 4.   GM cross-moved for summary judgment.          It advanced two\n\ngrounds:    (i) that Santilli had failed to introduce competent\n\nevidence that Norwood Cadillac is in Santilli's RMA, see supra note\n\n2; and (ii) that even if GM had violated the statute, Santilli\n\nnonetheless had failed to adduce any evidence that the violation(s)\n\nhad caused it a loss of money or property as required by section\n\n12A as a precondition of a suit for damages.\n\n           Santilli's proof concentrated heavily on GM's overlong\n\nownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac.                In an effort to\n\nsatisfy the injury requirement with respect to that violation,\n\nSantilli proffered expert evidence estimating the additional sales\n\nthat it would have garnered but for the continued presence of the\n\nNorwood dealership during the wrongful interval.             Santilli argued\n\nthat the statute forbade GM from owning and operating Norwood\n\nCadillac during that interval and, therefore, that GM should have\n\nclosed the doors once the one-year statutory grace period had\n\nexpired.    Based on this premise, Santilli claimed that it was\n\nentitled to    damages   equivalent   to    the    profits    it   would   have\n\nrealized   through   increased   sales     had    Norwood    Cadillac   ceased\n\noperations.\n\n           The district court rejected this theory of damages and\n\ngranted GM's summary judgment motion on the ground that Santilli\n\nhad failed to demonstrate that it had sustained any loss of money\n\nor property as a result of this putative violation. Citing section\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f12A of chapter 93B, the court reasoned that a plaintiff must show\n\nthat the violation itself caused the plaintiff harm. Applying that\n\nprinciple, the proper measure of damages under section 4(3)(k) is\n\nthe increase in profits that the aggrieved dealer would have\n\nrealized had it been competing, during the wrongful interval,\n\nagainst     an     independently      owned   dealership      instead     of     a\n\nmanufacturer-owned dealership.         Since Santilli failed to introduce\n\nany evidence that would support a finding of injury on this basis,\n\nthe court rebuffed count 1 of its complaint.\n\n            The court simultaneously granted summary judgment in GM's\n\nfavor on counts 2 and 4.        As to each of those counts, the court\n\nnoted    that    Santilli's   proof    sufficed   only   to    show     overlong\n\nownership.       It concluded that Santilli could not recover in a\n\nchapter 93B suit under a generic proscription when a more specific\n\nprovision, in this case section 4(3)(k), applies directly to the\n\nchallenged conduct.      This timely appeal followed.\n\nIV.     ANALYSIS\n\n             Our review of an order granting summary judgment is\n\nplenary.        Houlton Citizens' Coalition, 175 F.3d at 184.                  The\n\nprimary question presented in this appeal is whether the district\n\ncourt correctly apprehended the measure of damages under section\n\n4(3)(k).    To frame that question, we assume, for argument's sake,\n\nthat GM was in violation of section 4(3)(k), at least from January\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f3, 2001 forward (i.e., one year after it acquired full ownership of\n\nNorwood Cadillac).\n\n           In our view, the language of section 12A makes pellucid\n\nthat a plaintiff seeking damages under chapter 93B must show more\n\nthan that a defendant violated some substantive provision of the\n\nstatute.   Rather, the plaintiff must show both that a violation\n\noccurred and that the violation harmed the plaintiff.      Martha's\n\nVineyard Auto Vill., Inc. v. Newman, 569 N.E.2d 401, 405 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1991).   A necessary corollary of this injury requirement\n\nis that a non-injurious violation may occur and, if that is the\n\ncase, the plaintiff will not be able to recover damages.   See Coady\n\nCorp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc., 361 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (upholding the district court's denial of relief under\n\nchapter 93B when the evidence may have established a statutory\n\nbreach but the plaintiff failed to demonstrate any injury flowing\n\ntherefrom).\n\n           This brings us to the task of defining the injury needed\n\nto justify recovery of damages under section 4(3)(k). We must make\n\nthis determination with reference to the purposes of the statute.\n\nSee Am. Honda, 735 N.E.2d at 354 (interpreting chapter 93B with\n\nreference to statutory purpose).      The main object of section\n\n4(3)(k) is to forfend against unfair competition, that is, to\n\nprotect independent dealers from having to compete on unequal terms\n\nwith dealerships owned and operated by manufacturers.   The statute\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fdoes not attempt to safeguard dealers from competition with other\n\ndealers on a level playing field.        See id. (noting that chapter 93B\n\nstrives to strike a balance by controlling unfair trade practices\n\nwithout \"shielding dealers from all competition\").            Accordingly, a\n\nsection 4(3)(k) plaintiff must show that it has suffered harm by\n\nbeing forced into unfair competition with a manufacturer-owned\n\ndealership.\n\n            Santilli's evidence, taken in the light most favorable to\n\nit, establishes only that the continued existence of Norwood\n\nCadillac hampered its sales.         However, Santilli presented no\n\nevidence that GM's unlawful ownership and operation of Norwood\n\nCadillac made Norwood a more formidable competitor, thereby causing\n\nSantilli to lose sales or profits.           This is a fatal deficiency\n\nbecause section    4(3)(k)   did   not    require   GM   to   close   Norwood\n\nCadillac at the expiration of the one-year statutory grace period.\n\nGM had other lawful alternatives to a complete shut-down of Norwood\n\nCadillac, most notably, selling the dealership to an independent\n\noperator.\n\n            Placed in perspective, Santilli's proposed measure of\n\ndamages does not flow from GM's violation of the statute, but from\n\nGM's failure to take one possible route to statutory compliance.\n\nIn effect, then, Santilli urges us to hold that it is entitled to\n\ndamages because it was denied a windfall that it would have enjoyed\n\nhad GM shuttered the Norwood dealership while seeking a buyer. The\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fonly thing illegal about the existence of the Norwood dealership\n\nwas that it was owned and operated by GM.              If Santilli cannot show\n\nthat he suffered any loss of money or property as a result of that\n\nillegal ownership and operation, it is not authorized by section\n\n12A to bring suit for damages.                Santilli's approach ignores the\n\ninjury requirement limned in section 12A and, in the bargain,\n\nconverts section 4(3)(k), by judicial fiat, into a strict liability\n\nstatute.     Nor   is   this    unfortunate       result    accompanied    by   any\n\ncorresponding gain; Santilli's approach would not further the\n\nstatute's purpose and, indeed, would run counter to the statutory\n\ngoal of benefitting consumers.\n\n            Santilli loudly protests that we will eviscerate section\n\n4(3)(k) if we require plaintiffs to demonstrate that they have\n\nsuffered    special      injury      from       compelled    competition        with\n\nmanufacturer-owned dealerships.               Santilli complains that, as a\n\npractical matter, it will be impossible to prove that such a\n\ndisadvantage caused harm and, therefore, that the statutory remedy\n\n— an action for damages — will prove to be fool's gold.                         This\n\nanimadversion is misplaced for two reasons.\n\n            First,      we    see    nothing       insurmountable       (or     even\n\nparticularly difficult) in the requirement that a section 4(3)(k)\n\nplaintiff   show     injury    flowing     from    a   manufacturer's     unlawful\n\nownership    and     operation      of    a     competing   dealership.          The\n\nMassachusetts cases are clear that damages under unfair competition\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fstatutes need not be proved with mathematical certainty.                     See,\n\ne.g., Datacomm Interface, Inc. v. Computerworld, Inc., 489 N.E.2d\n\n185, 196 (Mass. 1986); Nat'l Merch. Corp. v. Leyden, 348 N.E.2d\n\n771, 774 (Mass. 1976); Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. v. Subaru of New\n\nEngl., Inc., 440 N.E.2d 29, 48 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982); cf. Veranda\n\nBeach Club Ltd. P'ship v. W. Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1385 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (noting that \"translating legal damage into money\n\ndamages is, virtually by definition, an imprecise affair\"). Should\n\nunfair acts or practices occur in, say, the allocation of vehicles\n\nor the setting of credit terms, there is no earthly reason why the\n\neffect of such favoritism cannot be satisfactorily quantified. The\n\ncase law under the counterpart federal statute, the Automobile\n\nDealers' Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1225, attests to the\n\nvalidity of this conclusion. See, e.g., Bob Willow Motors, Inc. v.\n\nGen. Motors Corp., 872 F.2d 788, 798-99 (7th Cir. 1989) (approving\n\nestimation    of     damages    resulting      from   discriminatory    vehicle\n\nallocation); Randy's Studebaker Sales, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp.,\n\n533   F.2d    510,     517-18   (10th     Cir.   1976)    (endorsing    damages\n\napproximation based on sales at other area dealers unaffected by\n\nthe manufacturer's discriminatory practices).\n\n             Second,    Santilli's      argument      totally    overlooks    the\n\navailability of injunctive relief.             Under the statute as written,\n\na   dealer   who     fears   unfair   competition     from   a   manufacturer's\n\noverlong ownership and operation of a competing dealership can seek\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\finjunctive relief without having to show actual damages (or even\n\nthreatened    irreparable     harm,   as     is   normally      required    for    an\n\ninjunction).      See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 12A.                  Rather, the\n\nplaintiff may obtain relief upon a showing that the defendant's\n\nviolation may cause the plaintiff injury.4             Id.      We are unable to\n\nthink of any sound reason why, in a situation such as this, the\n\nlegislature would not have considered that an adequate remedy — and\n\none that was preferable to providing a means for opportunistic\n\ndealers to make windfall gains without any showing that they were\n\nactually disadvantaged by a section 4(3)(k) transgression.\n\n             In   a   last-ditch   effort    to   blunt       the   force   of   this\n\nreasoning, Santilli points us to the decision of the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court in Ricky Smith Pontiac.                That case concerned a\n\nprovision    of   chapter   93B    that    prohibits      a    manufacturer      from\n\n\"arbitrarily . . . grant[ing] . . . a franchise . . . to . . . an\n\nadditional franchisee who intends . . . to conduct its dealership\n\noperations from a place of business situated within the relevant\n\nmarket area of an existing franchisee.\"             Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B,\n\n§ 4(3)(l).    The defendant had granted a franchise in violation of\n\nthis provision, and the court determined that the plaintiff's\n\ndamages should be measured by calculating the profits lost due to\n\nthe unlawful location of the competing franchise within its market\n\n\n\n     4\n      This remedial avenue was open to Santilli, but Santilli chose\nnot to explore it.\n\n                                      -14-\n\farea.   440 N.E.2d at 47.          Santilli attempts to draw a parallel,\n\nasseverating that just as Ricky Smith Pontiac was damaged by the\n\nunlawful insertion of competition into its market area, so Santilli\n\nhas been damaged by the unlawful operation of Norwood Cadillac.\n\n             The parallel is inexact and, ultimately, unconvincing.\n\nThe crucial distinction involves the divergence in the purposes of\n\nthe   two   statutory    provisions.         Section    4(3)(l)       is   aimed   at\n\ngeographic    protection,    shielding        dealers    from     the      arbitrary\n\ninterposition of any additional same-brand competition within their\n\nmarket areas.    Am. Honda, 735 N.E.2d at 354.               Had that statute not\n\nbeen breached, the offending dealership in Ricky Smith Pontiac\n\nwould not have existed at all.          Thus, the Ricky Smith measure of\n\ndamages was appropriate because it put the plaintiff in as good a\n\nposition as the plaintiff would have occupied had the transgression\n\nnot occurred.\n\n            By contrast, section 4(3)(k) is aimed only at protecting\n\ndealers from unfair competition, specifically, the kind of unfair\n\ncompetition     that    vertical    integration        can    bring     about   when\n\nmanufacturers own and operate dealerships.                    Applying the Ricky\n\nSmith measure of damages to claims brought under section 4(3)(k)\n\nwould mix apples with oranges, and result in granting plaintiffs\n\nmore protection than the legislature prescribed.                 At least in this\n\ninstance, this patchwork would put the complaining dealer in a\n\nbetter position that it would have occupied had the manufacturer\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\feschewed any involvement with the competing dealer.                Ricky Smith\n\nPontiac is, therefore, inapposite.\n\n             To sum up, we hold that a plaintiff seeking to recover\n\ndamages for a violation of section 4(3)(k) must show not only a\n\nviolation    of    the   statute   but   also   harm   resulting    from   that\n\nviolation.     The latter showing requires competent proof that the\n\nplaintiff sustained a loss of money or property attributable to the\n\nmanufacturer's unlawful ownership and operation of the competing\n\ndealership.       That measure of harm is consistent with the statute's\n\npurpose to shield dealers from the \"overweening economic power\n\nwielded by manufacturers.\"         Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter\n\nOlds., Inc., 381 N.E.2d 908, 912 (Mass. 1978).\n\n             Santilli's claims against GM under sections 3 and 4(1) of\n\nchapter 93B (counts 2 and 4) need not detain us.               As said, the\n\nlower court granted GM summary judgment on these counts, reasoning\n\nthat when a specific provision of chapter 93B applies, a plaintiff\n\nmay not also bring claims under the statute's generic provisions\n\nbased on the same facts.\n\n             As to the section 3 claim, that reasoning is flawless.\n\nThe statute makes it transparently clear that section 3 is only\n\nactionable insofar as there has been a violation of some subsection\n\nof section 4.       See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, § 3(a) (prohibiting\n\nunfair methods of competition as defined in section 4).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f              Unlike the section 3 claim, the section 4(1) claim is not\n\nobviously vulnerable.          Here, however, there is no need for us to\n\ntest    the   district   court's    rationale.     See    Houlton   Citizens'\n\nCoalition, 175 F.3d at 184 (explaining that the court of appeals\n\nmay affirm an order for summary judgment \"on any ground revealed by\n\nthe record\").       Even if Santilli could state an undisplaced claim\n\nfor damages under section 4(1), any such claim would be subject, on\n\nthese     facts,    to   the     injury   requirement     of   section   12A.\n\nAccordingly, it would be doomed by the same lack of evidence of\n\nviolation-induced harm that condemned count 1 (the claim under\n\nsection 4(3)(k)) to an early demise.\n\nV.     CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.         Insofar as money damages are\n\nconcerned, the Massachusetts legislature has incorporated into the\n\nDealers' Bill of Rights a principle of \"no harm, no foul.\"            It thus\n\nbecame Santilli's burden to demonstrate actual harm flowing from\n\nGM's ostensible violation of the statute.                The district court\n\ncorrectly concluded that Santilli failed to carry this burden.             It\n\nfollows inexorably, as night follows day, that GM was entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on counts 1, 2, and 4 of the complaint.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f",

Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167;&#167; 1-15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Relying on these rules, a multi-brand dealer doing business as John Santilli's Center for Automobiles (Santilli) brought suit against a manufacturer, General Motors Corporation (GM), alleging that the manufacturer had engaged in a number of unfair practices. GM denied the material allegations of the complaint. Without resolving whether the manufacturer had violated the statute, the district court entered summary judgment in its favor on the ground that Santilli had not shown any actionable harm flowing from the challenged conduct. Discerning no error in the district court's thoughtful disposition, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by limning the purpose, text, and structure of the statute. Chapter 93B, familiarly known as the \"Dealers' Bill of Rights,\" has two central purposes. One is to curb \"the potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.\" <i>Beard Motors, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> 395 Mass. 428, 480 N.E.2d 303, 306 (1985). The other is to regulate competition in the retail automobile industry for the benefit of the public at large. <i>Am. Honda Motor Co. v. Bernardi's, Inc.,</i> 432 Mass. 425, 735 N.E.2d 348, 354 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To effectuate these dual objectives, the statute places off limits certain \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 3. These methods, acts, and practices are delineated in section 4. That section generally proscribes conduct that is \"arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(1). It then describes, and specifically prohibits, twenty-one discrete acts and practices. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(2)-(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory scheme maps two remedial avenues. One involves public enforcement: the Attorney General may enforce the law. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12. The other involves private enforcement: the statute creates private rights of action for injunctive relief and damages. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on the meaning and operation of section 12A. In pertinent part, that section authorizes \"[a]ny franchisee or motor vehicle dealer who suffers any loss of money or property... as a result of [a violation of the statute by a manufacturer]\" to bring a civil action for equitable relief or damages. A dealer who has not suffered a loss of money or property as a result of an unfair act or practice may still bring an action for equitable relief &#8212; but not for damages &#8212; if \"it can be shown that the ... unfair act or practice may have the effect of causing such [a] loss of money or property\" in the future. <i>Id.</i> II. THE FACTS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the summary judgment standard, we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to Santilli. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years, Santilli has operated an independent automobile dealership in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is, inter alia, licensed to sell the Cadillac line of vehicles (Cadillac is a GM brand and all licensed Cadillac dealers are, therefore, GM franchisees). During the same time frame, Norwood Cadillac has operated a Cadillac dealership in Norwood, Massachusetts. By 1998, the two dealerships had been in competition for several years. For purposes of this appeal, we assume &#8212; but do not decide &#8212; that Norwood Cadillac is within Santilli's relevant market area (RMA), as that term is defined in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(k).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1990s, GM inaugurated the multi-site project (MSP), a program designed to increase GM's presence in certain geographic markets. Under the aegis of the MSP, GM aspired to create joint ventures with successful independent dealers so that the latter could own multiple dealerships (thus achieving economies of scale and, not coincidentally, improving sales of GM vehicles in the targeted markets).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1998, the MSP came to the greater Boston area when a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM partnered with Joseph Laham, the owner of Norwood Cadillac, to form Mass Bay Automotive, LLC (MassBay). The original plan contemplated that MassBay, under Laham's hegemony, would own and operate both Norwood Cadillac and North Shore Buick-Pontiac-GMC Truck (a dealership that GM previously had acquired). GM contributed approximately $13,000,000 in working capital and the assets of the North Shore dealership to MassBay in exchange for a 90% ownership interest. Laham contributed the fixed assets and leasehold improvements of Norwood Cadillac, valued in excess of $1,400,000, in exchange for a 10% ownership interest. He then sold the Norwood dealership, including its goodwill and inventories of used cars and parts, to MassBay for approximately $6,300,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassBay proved to be a flop, and Laham sold his ownership interest to GM in January of 2000. At that point, GM was, in effect, the sole owner of Norwood Cadillac. It then began seeking a purchaser for the dealership, hoping to find a buyer who would operate Norwood as part of another MSP arrangement. When this gambit failed, GM began pursuing a more traditional sale. To this end, it solicited bids for the dealership in mid-2001. Santilli was among the bidders, but GM accepted a better offer from a third party. The sale closed, and GM's de facto ownership of Norwood Cadillac ceased, on October 30, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE LAWSUIT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), Santilli sued GM in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Its complaint contained four statements of claim. We describe them briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 1 emanates from a provision of the Dealers' Bill of Rights that renders it unlawful for an automobile manufacturer</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to own and operate ... a motor vehicle dealership within the relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer of the same line make; provided, however, that a manufacturer ... shall not be deemed to be in violation of this paragraph when operating a dealership either temporarily for a reasonable period in any case not to exceed one year or in a bona fide relationship [with] an independent person....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(k). Santilli alleges that GM violated this prohibition from and after November of 1999 (one year after MassBay had assumed ownership of Norwood Cadillac). In its view, Laham's relatively small equity interest in MassBay, combined with the restrictive provisions of the MassBay operating agreement, precluded MassBay from coming within the statutory safe harbor for \"bona fide relationship[s]\" between manufacturers and independent persons. <i>See id.</i> As a fallback, Santilli alleges that GM violated the statutory prohibition from and after January of 2001 (one year after it had assumed full ownership of MassBay and, by extension, of Norwood Cadillac).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli premised count 2 on the catchall provision of the Dealers' Bill of Rights. That provision proscribes actions that are \"arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(1). In support of this claim, Santilli alleged that GM's ownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac after the one-year statutory grace period and its favorable treatment of Norwood Cadillac during the ensuing period<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> constituted arbitrary and unconscionable conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 3 alleges that GM acted arbitrarily in its allocation of new vehicles, thus unfairly benefitting Norwood Cadillac. Inasmuch as Santilli quickly abandoned this claim, we eschew any further comment on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 4 alleges that GM violated a statutory provision that generally prohibits \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" <i>Id.</i> 3(a). This count essentially replicates the substantive claims set out in the previous three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of discovery, Santilli moved for partial summary judgment on the three counts then remaining, namely, counts 1, 2, and 4. GM cross-moved for summary judgment. It advanced two grounds: (i) that Santilli had failed to introduce competent evidence that Norwood Cadillac is in Santilli's RMA, <i>see supra</i> note 2; and (ii) that even if GM had violated the statute, Santilli nonetheless had failed to adduce any evidence that the violation(s) had caused it a loss of money or property as required by section 12A as a precondition of a suit for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli's proof concentrated heavily on GM's overlong ownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac. In an effort to satisfy the injury requirement with respect to that violation, Santilli proffered expert evidence estimating the additional sales that it would have garnered but for the continued presence of the Norwood dealership during the wrongful interval. Santilli argued that the statute forbade GM from owning and operating Norwood Cadillac during that interval and, therefore, that GM should have closed the doors once the one-year statutory grace period had expired. Based on this premise, Santilli claimed that it was entitled to damages equivalent to the profits it would have realized through increased sales had Norwood Cadillac ceased operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this theory of damages and granted GM's summary judgment motion on the ground that Santilli had failed to demonstrate that it had sustained any loss of money or property as a result of this putative violation. Citing section 12A of chapter 93B, the court reasoned that a plaintiff must show that the violation itself caused the plaintiff harm. Applying that principle, the proper measure of damages under section 4(3)(k) is the increase in profits that the aggrieved dealer would have realized had it been competing, during the wrongful interval, against an independently owned dealership instead of a manufacturer-owned dealership. Since Santilli failed to introduce any evidence that would support a finding of injury on this basis, the court rebuffed count 1 of its complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court simultaneously granted summary judgment in GM's favor on counts 2 and 4. As to each of those counts, the court noted that Santilli's proof sufficed only to show overlong ownership. It concluded that Santilli could not recover in a chapter 93B suit under a generic proscription when a more specific provision, in this case section 4(3)(k), applies directly to the challenged conduct. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of an order granting summary judgment is plenary. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition,</i> 175 F.3d at 184. The primary question presented in this appeal is whether the district court correctly apprehended the measure of damages under section 4(3)(k). To frame that question, we assume, for argument's sake, that GM was in violation of section 4(3)(k), at least from January 3, 2001 forward (i.e., one year after it acquired full ownership of Norwood Cadillac).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the language of section 12A makes pellucid that a plaintiff seeking damages under chapter 93B must show more than that a defendant violated some substantive provision of the statute. Rather, the plaintiff must show both that a violation occurred and that the violation harmed the plaintiff. <i>Martha's Vineyard Auto Vill., Inc. v. Newman,</i> 30 Mass.App.Ct. 363, 569 N.E.2d 401, 405 (1991). A necessary corollary of this injury requirement is that a non-injurious violation may occur and, if that is the case, the plaintiff will not be able to recover damages. <i>See Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 50, 59 (1st Cir.2004) (upholding the district court's denial of relief under chapter 93B when the evidence may have established a statutory breach but the plaintiff failed to demonstrate any injury flowing therefrom).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the task of defining the injury needed to justify recovery of damages under section 4(3)(k). We must make this determination with reference to the purposes of the statute. <i>See Am. Honda,</i> 735 N.E.2d at 354 (interpreting chapter 93B with reference to statutory purpose). The main object of section 4(3)(k) is to forfend against unfair competition, that is, to protect independent dealers from having to compete on unequal terms with dealerships owned and operated by manufacturers. The statute does not attempt to safeguard dealers from competition with other dealers <i>on a level playing field. See id.</i> (noting that chapter 93B strives to strike a balance by controlling unfair trade practices without \"shielding dealers from all competition\"). Accordingly, a section 4(3)(k) plaintiff must show that it has suffered harm by being forced into unfair competition with a manufacturer-owned dealership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli's evidence, taken in the light most favorable to it, establishes only that the continued existence of Norwood Cadillac hampered its sales. However, Santilli presented no evidence that GM's unlawful ownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac made Norwood a more formidable competitor, thereby causing Santilli to lose sales or profits. This is a fatal deficiency because section 4(3)(k) did not require GM to close Norwood Cadillac at the expiration of the one-year statutory grace period. GM had other lawful alternatives to a complete shut-down of Norwood Cadillac, most notably, selling the dealership to an independent operator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placed in perspective, Santilli's proposed measure of damages does not flow from GM's violation of the statute, but from GM's failure to take one possible route to statutory compliance. In effect, then, Santilli urges us to hold that it is entitled to damages because it was denied a windfall that it would have enjoyed had GM shuttered the Norwood dealership while seeking a buyer. The only thing illegal about the existence of the Norwood dealership was that it was owned and operated by GM. If Santilli cannot show that he suffered any loss of money or property as a result of that illegal ownership and operation, it is not authorized by section 12A to bring suit for damages. Santilli's approach ignores the injury requirement limned in section 12A and, in the bargain, converts section 4(3)(k), by judicial fiat, into a strict liability statute. Nor is this unfortunate result accompanied by any corresponding gain; Santilli's approach would not further the statute's purpose and, indeed, would run counter to the statutory goal of benefitting consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli loudly protests that we will eviscerate section 4(3)(k) if we require plaintiffs to demonstrate that they have suffered special injury from compelled competition with manufacturer-owned dealerships. Santilli complains that, as a practical matter, it will be impossible to prove that such a disadvantage caused harm and, therefore, that the statutory remedy &#8212; an action for damages &#8212; will prove to be fool's gold. This animadversion is misplaced for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we see nothing insurmountable (or even particularly difficult) in the requirement that a section 4(3)(k) plaintiff show injury flowing from a manufacturer's unlawful ownership and operation of a competing dealership. The Massachusetts cases are clear that damages under unfair competition statutes need not be proved with mathematical certainty. <i>See, e.g., Datacomm Interface, Inc. v. Computerworld, Inc.,</i> 396 Mass. 760, 489 N.E.2d 185, 196 (1986); <i>Nat'l Merch. Corp. v. Leyden,</i> 370 Mass. 425, 348 N.E.2d 771, 774 (1976); <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. v. Subaru of New Engl., Inc.,</i> 14 Mass.App.Ct. 396, 440 N.E.2d 29, 48 (1982); <i>cf. Veranda Beach Club Ltd. P'ship v. W. Sur. Co.,</i> 936 F.2d 1364, 1385 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that \"translating legal damage into money damages is, virtually by definition, an imprecise affair\"). Should unfair acts or practices occur in, say, the allocation of vehicles or the setting of credit terms, there is no earthly reason why the effect of such favoritism cannot be satisfactorily quantified. The case law under the counterpart federal statute, the Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1221-1225, attests to the validity of this conclusion. <i>See, e.g., Bob Willow Motors, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 872 F.2d 788, 798-99 (7th Cir.1989) (approving estimation of damages resulting from discriminatory vehicle allocation); <i>Randy's Studebaker Sales, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp.,</i> 533 F.2d 510, 517-18 (10th Cir.1976) (endorsing damages approximation based on sales at other area dealers unaffected by the manufacturer's discriminatory practices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Santilli's argument totally overlooks the availability of injunctive relief. Under the statute as written, a dealer who fears unfair competition from a manufacturer's overlong ownership and operation of a competing dealership can seek injunctive relief without having to show actual damages (or even threatened irreparable harm, as is normally required for an injunction). <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 12A. Rather, the plaintiff may obtain relief upon a showing that the defendant's violation <i>may</i> cause the plaintiff injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> We are unable to think of any sound reason why, in a situation such as this, the legislature would not have considered that an adequate remedy &#8212; and one that was preferable to providing a means for opportunistic dealers to make windfall gains without any showing that they were actually disadvantaged by a section 4(3)(k) transgression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Santilli points us to the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court in <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac.</i> That case concerned a provision of chapter 93B that prohibits a manufacturer from \"arbitrarily ... grant[ing] ... a franchise ... to ... an additional franchisee who intends ... to conduct its dealership operations from a place of business situated within the relevant market area of an existing franchisee.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>). The defendant had granted a franchise in violation of this provision, and the court determined that the plaintiff's damages should be measured by calculating the profits lost due to the unlawful location of the competing franchise within its market area. 440 N.E.2d at 47. Santilli attempts to draw a parallel, asseverating that just as Ricky Smith Pontiac was damaged by the unlawful insertion of competition into its market area, so Santilli has been damaged by the unlawful operation of Norwood Cadillac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parallel is inexact and, ultimately, unconvincing. The crucial distinction involves the divergence in the purposes of the two statutory provisions. Section 4(3)(<i>l</i>) is aimed at <i>geographic</i> protection, shielding dealers from the arbitrary interposition of any additional same-brand competition within their market areas. <i>Am. Honda,</i> 735 N.E.2d at 354. Had that statute not been breached, the offending dealership in <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac</i> would not have existed at all. Thus, the <i>Ricky Smith</i> measure of damages was appropriate because it put the plaintiff in as good a position as the plaintiff would have occupied had the transgression not occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, section 4(3)(k) is aimed only at protecting dealers from unfair competition, specifically, the kind of unfair competition that vertical integration can bring about when manufacturers own and operate dealerships. Applying the <i>Ricky Smith</i> measure of damages to claims brought under section 4(3)(k) would mix apples with oranges, and result in granting plaintiffs more protection than the legislature prescribed. At least in this instance, this patchwork would put the complaining dealer in a <i>better</i> position that it would have occupied had the manufacturer eschewed any involvement with the competing dealer. <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac</i> is, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we hold that a plaintiff seeking to recover damages for a violation of section 4(3)(k) must show not only a violation of the statute but also harm resulting from that violation. The latter showing requires competent proof that the plaintiff sustained a loss of money or property attributable to the manufacturer's unlawful ownership and operation of the competing dealership. That measure of harm is consistent with the statute's purpose to shield dealers from the \"overweening economic power wielded by manufacturers.\" <i>Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter Olds., Inc.,</i> 376 Mass. 313, 381 N.E.2d 908, 912 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli's claims against GM under sections 3 and 4(1) of chapter 93B (counts 2 and 4) need not detain us. As said, the lower court granted GM summary judgment on these counts, reasoning that when a specific provision of chapter 93B applies, a plaintiff may not also bring claims under the statute's generic provisions based on the same facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the section 3 claim, that reasoning is flawless. The statute makes it transparently clear that section 3 is only actionable insofar as there has been a violation of some subsection of section 4. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 3(a) (prohibiting unfair methods of competition <i>as defined in section 4</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the section 3 claim, the section 4(1) claim is not obviously vulnerable. Here, however, there is no need for us to test the district court's rationale. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition,</i> 175 F.3d at 184 (explaining that the court of appeals may affirm an order for summary judgment \"on any ground revealed by the record\"). Even if Santilli could state an undisplaced claim for damages under section 4(1), any such claim would be subject, on these facts, to the injury requirement of section 12A. Accordingly, it would be doomed by the same lack of evidence of violation-induced harm that condemned count 1 (the claim under section 4(3)(k)) to an early demise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Insofar as money damages are concerned, the Massachusetts legislature has incorporated into the Dealers' Bill of Rights a principle of \"no harm, no foul.\" It thus became Santilli's burden to demonstrate actual harm flowing from GM's ostensible violation of the statute. The district court correctly concluded that Santilli failed to carry this burden. It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that GM was entitled to summary judgment on counts 1, 2, and 4 of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The legislature amended chapter 93B in 2002<i>See</i> 2002 Mass.

Laws ch. 93B, &#167;&#167; 1-15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Relying on these rules, a multi-brand dealer doing business as John Santilli's Center for Automobiles (Santilli) brought suit against a manufacturer, General Motors Corporation (GM), alleging that the manufacturer had engaged in a number of unfair practices. GM denied the material allegations of the complaint. Without resolving whether the manufacturer had violated the statute, the district court entered summary judgment in its favor on the ground that Santilli had not shown any actionable harm flowing from the challenged conduct. Discerning no error in the district court's thoughtful disposition, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE STATUTORY SCHEME</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by limning the purpose, text, and structure of the statute. Chapter 93B, familiarly known as the \"Dealers' Bill of Rights,\" has two central purposes. One is to curb \"the potentially oppressive power of automobile manufacturers and distributors in relation to their affiliated dealers.\" <i>Beard Motors, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146815\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146815/beard-motors-inc-v-toyota-motor-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146815\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146815/beard-motors-inc-v-toyota-motor-distributors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 306 (1985). The other is to regulate competition in the retail automobile industry for the benefit of the public at large. <i>Am. Honda Motor Co. v. Bernardi's, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span>, 354 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To effectuate these dual objectives, the statute places off limits certain \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 3. These methods, acts, and practices are delineated in section 4. That section generally proscribes conduct that is \"arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(1). It then describes, and specifically prohibits, twenty-one discrete acts and practices. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(2)-(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory scheme maps two remedial avenues. One involves public enforcement: the Attorney General may enforce the law. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12. The other involves private enforcement: the statute creates private rights of action for injunctive relief and damages. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on the meaning and operation of section 12A. In pertinent part, that section authorizes \"[a]ny franchisee or motor vehicle dealer who suffers any loss of money or property... as a result of [a violation of the statute by a manufacturer]\" to bring a civil action for equitable relief or damages. A dealer who has not suffered a loss of money or property as a result of an unfair act or practice may still bring an action for equitable relief &#8212; but not for damages &#8212; if \"it can be shown that the ... unfair act or practice may have the effect of causing such [a] loss of money or property\" in the future. <i>Id.</i> II. THE FACTS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with the summary judgment standard, we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to Santilli. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763565\"><a href=\"/opinion/763565/houlton-citizens-coalition-v-town-of-houlton/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 184 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years, Santilli has operated an independent automobile dealership in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is, inter alia, licensed to sell the Cadillac line of vehicles (Cadillac is a GM brand and all licensed Cadillac dealers are, therefore, GM franchisees). During the same time frame, Norwood Cadillac has operated a Cadillac dealership in Norwood, Massachusetts. By 1998, the two dealerships had been in competition for several years. For purposes of this appeal, we assume &#8212; but do not decide &#8212; that Norwood Cadillac is within Santilli's relevant market area (RMA), as that term is defined in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(k).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1990s, GM inaugurated the multi-site project (MSP), a program designed to increase GM's presence in certain geographic markets. Under the aegis of the MSP, GM aspired to create joint ventures with successful independent dealers so that the latter could own multiple dealerships (thus achieving economies of scale and, not coincidentally, improving sales of GM vehicles in the targeted markets).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1998, the MSP came to the greater Boston area when a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM partnered with Joseph Laham, the owner of Norwood Cadillac, to form Mass Bay Automotive, LLC (MassBay). The original plan contemplated that MassBay, under Laham's hegemony, would own and operate both Norwood Cadillac and North Shore Buick-Pontiac-GMC Truck (a dealership that GM previously had acquired). GM contributed approximately $13,000,000 in working capital and the assets of the North Shore dealership to MassBay in exchange for a 90% ownership interest. Laham contributed the fixed assets and leasehold improvements of Norwood Cadillac, valued in excess of $1,400,000, in exchange for a 10% ownership interest. He then sold the Norwood dealership, including its goodwill and inventories of used cars and parts, to MassBay for approximately $6,300,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MassBay proved to be a flop, and Laham sold his ownership interest to GM in January of 2000. At that point, GM was, in effect, the sole owner of Norwood Cadillac. It then began seeking a purchaser for the dealership, hoping to find a buyer who would operate Norwood as part of another MSP arrangement. When this gambit failed, GM began pursuing a more traditional sale. To this end, it solicited bids for the dealership in mid-2001. Santilli was among the bidders, but GM accepted a better offer from a third party. The sale closed, and GM's de facto ownership of Norwood Cadillac ceased, on October 30, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE LAWSUIT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), Santilli sued GM in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Its complaint contained four statements of claim. We describe them briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 1 emanates from a provision of the Dealers' Bill of Rights that renders it unlawful for an automobile manufacturer</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to own and operate ... a motor vehicle dealership within the relevant market area of a motor vehicle dealer of the same line make; provided, however, that a manufacturer ... shall not be deemed to be in violation of this paragraph when operating a dealership either temporarily for a reasonable period in any case not to exceed one year or in a bona fide relationship [with] an independent person....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(k). Santilli alleges that GM violated this prohibition from and after November of 1999 (one year after MassBay had assumed ownership of Norwood Cadillac). In its view, Laham's relatively small equity interest in MassBay, combined with the restrictive provisions of the MassBay operating agreement, precluded MassBay from coming within the statutory safe harbor for \"bona fide relationship[s]\" between manufacturers and independent persons. <i>See id.</i> As a fallback, Santilli alleges that GM violated the statutory prohibition from and after January of 2001 (one year after it had assumed full ownership of MassBay and, by extension, of Norwood Cadillac).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli premised count 2 on the catchall provision of the Dealers' Bill of Rights. That provision proscribes actions that are \"arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscionable.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4(1). In support of this claim, Santilli alleged that GM's ownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac after the one-year statutory grace period and its favorable treatment of Norwood Cadillac during the ensuing period<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> constituted arbitrary and unconscionable conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 3 alleges that GM acted arbitrarily in its allocation of new vehicles, thus unfairly benefitting Norwood Cadillac. Inasmuch as Santilli quickly abandoned this claim, we eschew any further comment on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count 4 alleges that GM violated a statutory provision that generally prohibits \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" <i>Id.</i> 3(a). This count essentially replicates the substantive claims set out in the previous three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of discovery, Santilli moved for partial summary judgment on the three counts then remaining, namely, counts 1, 2, and 4. GM cross-moved for summary judgment. It advanced two grounds: (i) that Santilli had failed to introduce competent evidence that Norwood Cadillac is in Santilli's RMA, <i>see supra</i> note 2; and (ii) that even if GM had violated the statute, Santilli nonetheless had failed to adduce any evidence that the violation(s) had caused it a loss of money or property as required by section 12A as a precondition of a suit for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli's proof concentrated heavily on GM's overlong ownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac. In an effort to satisfy the injury requirement with respect to that violation, Santilli proffered expert evidence estimating the additional sales that it would have garnered but for the continued presence of the Norwood dealership during the wrongful interval. Santilli argued that the statute forbade GM from owning and operating Norwood Cadillac during that interval and, therefore, that GM should have closed the doors once the one-year statutory grace period had expired. Based on this premise, Santilli claimed that it was entitled to damages equivalent to the profits it would have realized through increased sales had Norwood Cadillac ceased operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected this theory of damages and granted GM's summary judgment motion on the ground that Santilli had failed to demonstrate that it had sustained any loss of money or property as a result of this putative violation. Citing section 12A of chapter 93B, the court reasoned that a plaintiff must show that the violation itself caused the plaintiff harm. Applying that principle, the proper measure of damages under section 4(3)(k) is the increase in profits that the aggrieved dealer would have realized had it been competing, during the wrongful interval, against an independently owned dealership instead of a manufacturer-owned dealership. Since Santilli failed to introduce any evidence that would support a finding of injury on this basis, the court rebuffed count 1 of its complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court simultaneously granted summary judgment in GM's favor on counts 2 and 4. As to each of those counts, the court noted that Santilli's proof sufficed only to show overlong ownership. It concluded that Santilli could not recover in a chapter 93B suit under a generic proscription when a more specific provision, in this case section 4(3)(k), applies directly to the challenged conduct. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of an order granting summary judgment is plenary. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition,</i> 175 F.3d at 184. The primary question presented in this appeal is whether the district court correctly apprehended the measure of damages under section 4(3)(k). To frame that question, we assume, for argument's sake, that GM was in violation of section 4(3)(k), at least from January 3, 2001 forward (i.e., one year after it acquired full ownership of Norwood Cadillac).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the language of section 12A makes pellucid that a plaintiff seeking damages under chapter 93B must show more than that a defendant violated some substantive provision of the statute. Rather, the plaintiff must show both that a violation occurred and that the violation harmed the plaintiff. <i>Martha's Vineyard Auto Vill., Inc. v. Newman,</i> 30 Mass.App.Ct. 363, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2139636\"><a href=\"/opinion/2139636/marthas-vineyard-auto-village-inc-v-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 405 (1991). A necessary corollary of this injury requirement is that a non-injurious violation may occur and, if that is the case, the plaintiff will not be able to recover damages. <i>See Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200921\"><a href=\"/opinion/200921/coady-corp-v-toyota-motor-distrib/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2004) (upholding the district court's denial of relief under chapter 93B when the evidence may have established a statutory breach but the plaintiff failed to demonstrate any injury flowing therefrom).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the task of defining the injury needed to justify recovery of damages under section 4(3)(k). We must make this determination with reference to the purposes of the statute. <i>See Am. Honda,</i> 735 N.E.2d at 354 (interpreting chapter 93B with reference to statutory purpose). The main object of section 4(3)(k) is to forfend against unfair competition, that is, to protect independent dealers from having to compete on unequal terms with dealerships owned and operated by manufacturers. The statute does not attempt to safeguard dealers from competition with other dealers <i>on a level playing field. See id.</i> (noting that chapter 93B strives to strike a balance by controlling unfair trade practices without \"shielding dealers from all competition\"). Accordingly, a section 4(3)(k) plaintiff must show that it has suffered harm by being forced into unfair competition with a manufacturer-owned dealership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli's evidence, taken in the light most favorable to it, establishes only that the continued existence of Norwood Cadillac hampered its sales. However, Santilli presented no evidence that GM's unlawful ownership and operation of Norwood Cadillac made Norwood a more formidable competitor, thereby causing Santilli to lose sales or profits. This is a fatal deficiency because section 4(3)(k) did not require GM to close Norwood Cadillac at the expiration of the one-year statutory grace period. GM had other lawful alternatives to a complete shut-down of Norwood Cadillac, most notably, selling the dealership to an independent operator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placed in perspective, Santilli's proposed measure of damages does not flow from GM's violation of the statute, but from GM's failure to take one possible route to statutory compliance. In effect, then, Santilli urges us to hold that it is entitled to damages because it was denied a windfall that it would have enjoyed had GM shuttered the Norwood dealership while seeking a buyer. The only thing illegal about the existence of the Norwood dealership was that it was owned and operated by GM. If Santilli cannot show that he suffered any loss of money or property as a result of that illegal ownership and operation, it is not authorized by section 12A to bring suit for damages. Santilli's approach ignores the injury requirement limned in section 12A and, in the bargain, converts section 4(3)(k), by judicial fiat, into a strict liability statute. Nor is this unfortunate result accompanied by any corresponding gain; Santilli's approach would not further the statute's purpose and, indeed, would run counter to the statutory goal of benefitting consumers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli loudly protests that we will eviscerate section 4(3)(k) if we require plaintiffs to demonstrate that they have suffered special injury from compelled competition with manufacturer-owned dealerships. Santilli complains that, as a practical matter, it will be impossible to prove that such a disadvantage caused harm and, therefore, that the statutory remedy &#8212; an action for damages &#8212; will prove to be fool's gold. This animadversion is misplaced for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we see nothing insurmountable (or even particularly difficult) in the requirement that a section 4(3)(k) plaintiff show injury flowing from a manufacturer's unlawful ownership and operation of a competing dealership. The Massachusetts cases are clear that damages under unfair competition statutes need not be proved with mathematical certainty. <i>See, e.g., Datacomm Interface, Inc. v. Computerworld, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101271\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101271/datacomm-interface-v-computerworld-inc-adelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101271\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101271/datacomm-interface-v-computerworld-inc-adelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 196 (1986); <i>Nat'l Merch. Corp. v. Leyden,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2009254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2009254/national-merchandising-corp-v-leyden/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2009254\"><a href=\"/opinion/2009254/national-merchandising-corp-v-leyden/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span>, 774 (1976); <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. v. Subaru of New Engl., Inc.,</i> 14 Mass.App.Ct. 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237597\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237597/ricky-smith-pontiac-v-subaru-of-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 48 (1982); <i>cf. Veranda Beach Club Ltd. P'ship v. W. Sur. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563774\"><a href=\"/opinion/563774/veranda-beach-club-limited-partnership-v-western-surety-co-frg-ventures/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1385 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that \"translating legal damage into money damages is, virtually by definition, an imprecise affair\"). Should unfair acts or practices occur in, say, the allocation of vehicles or the setting of credit terms, there is no earthly reason why the effect of such favoritism cannot be satisfactorily quantified. The case law under the counterpart federal statute, the Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1221-1225, attests to the validity of this conclusion. <i>See, e.g., Bob Willow Motors, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521579\"><a href=\"/opinion/521579/bob-willow-motors-inc-a-wisconsin-corporation-cross-appellant-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 798-99 (7th Cir.1989) (approving estimation of damages resulting from discriminatory vehicle allocation); <i>Randy's Studebaker Sales, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334726\"><a href=\"/opinion/334726/randys-studebaker-sales-inc-dba-randys-datsun-sales-v-nissan-motor/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 517-18 (10th Cir.1976) (endorsing damages approximation based on sales at other area dealers unaffected by the manufacturer's discriminatory practices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Santilli's argument totally overlooks the availability of injunctive relief. Under the statute as written, a dealer who fears unfair competition from a manufacturer's overlong ownership and operation of a competing dealership can seek injunctive relief without having to show actual damages (or even threatened irreparable harm, as is normally required for an injunction). <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 12A. Rather, the plaintiff may obtain relief upon a showing that the defendant's violation <i>may</i> cause the plaintiff injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> We are unable to think of any sound reason why, in a situation such as this, the legislature would not have considered that an adequate remedy &#8212; and one that was preferable to providing a means for opportunistic dealers to make windfall gains without any showing that they were actually disadvantaged by a section 4(3)(k) transgression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Santilli points us to the decision of the Massachusetts Appeals Court in <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac.</i> That case concerned a provision of chapter 93B that prohibits a manufacturer from \"arbitrarily ... grant[ing] ... a franchise ... to ... an additional franchisee who intends ... to conduct its dealership operations from a place of business situated within the relevant market area of an existing franchisee.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(<i>l</i>). The defendant had granted a franchise in violation of this provision, and the court determined that the plaintiff's damages should be measured by calculating the profits lost due to the unlawful location of the competing franchise within its market area. 440 N.E.2d at 47. Santilli attempts to draw a parallel, asseverating that just as Ricky Smith Pontiac was damaged by the unlawful insertion of competition into its market area, so Santilli has been damaged by the unlawful operation of Norwood Cadillac.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parallel is inexact and, ultimately, unconvincing. The crucial distinction involves the divergence in the purposes of the two statutory provisions. Section 4(3)(<i>l</i>) is aimed at <i>geographic</i> protection, shielding dealers from the arbitrary interposition of any additional same-brand competition within their market areas. <i>Am. Honda,</i> 735 N.E.2d at 354. Had that statute not been breached, the offending dealership in <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac</i> would not have existed at all. Thus, the <i>Ricky Smith</i> measure of damages was appropriate because it put the plaintiff in as good a position as the plaintiff would have occupied had the transgression not occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, section 4(3)(k) is aimed only at protecting dealers from unfair competition, specifically, the kind of unfair competition that vertical integration can bring about when manufacturers own and operate dealerships. Applying the <i>Ricky Smith</i> measure of damages to claims brought under section 4(3)(k) would mix apples with oranges, and result in granting plaintiffs more protection than the legislature prescribed. At least in this instance, this patchwork would put the complaining dealer in a <i>better</i> position that it would have occupied had the manufacturer eschewed any involvement with the competing dealer. <i>Ricky Smith Pontiac</i> is, therefore, inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we hold that a plaintiff seeking to recover damages for a violation of section 4(3)(k) must show not only a violation of the statute but also harm resulting from that violation. The latter showing requires competent proof that the plaintiff sustained a loss of money or property attributable to the manufacturer's unlawful ownership and operation of the competing dealership. That measure of harm is consistent with the statute's purpose to shield dealers from the \"overweening economic power wielded by manufacturers.\" <i>Tober Foreign Motors, Inc. v. Reiter Olds., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006618/tober-foreign-motors-inc-v-reiter-oldsmobile-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2006618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2006618/tober-foreign-motors-inc-v-reiter-oldsmobile-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 912 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santilli's claims against GM under sections 3 and 4(1) of chapter 93B (counts 2 and 4) need not detain us. As said, the lower court granted GM summary judgment on these counts, reasoning that when a specific provision of chapter 93B applies, a plaintiff may not also bring claims under the statute's generic provisions based on the same facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the section 3 claim, that reasoning is flawless. The statute makes it transparently clear that section 3 is only actionable insofar as there has been a violation of some subsection of section 4. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B, &#167; 3(a) (prohibiting unfair methods of competition <i>as defined in section 4</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the section 3 claim, the section 4(1) claim is not obviously vulnerable. Here, however, there is no need for us to test the district court's rationale. <i>See Houlton Citizens' Coalition,</i> 175 F.3d at 184 (explaining that the court of appeals may affirm an order for summary judgment \"on any ground revealed by the record\"). Even if Santilli could state an undisplaced claim for damages under section 4(1), any such claim would be subject, on these facts, to the injury requirement of section 12A. Accordingly, it would be doomed by the same lack of evidence of violation-induced harm that condemned count 1 (the claim under section 4(3)(k)) to an early demise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Insofar as money damages are concerned, the Massachusetts legislature has incorporated into the Dealers' Bill of Rights a principle of \"no harm, no foul.\" It thus became Santilli's burden to demonstrate actual harm flowing from GM's ostensible violation of the statute. The district court correctly concluded that Santilli failed to carry this burden. It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that GM was entitled to summary judgment on counts 1, 2, and 4 of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The legislature amended chapter 93B in 2002<i>See</i> 2002 Mass.
