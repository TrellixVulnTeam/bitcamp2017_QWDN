George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n              Boudin, Selya, and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Zachary L. Heiden, with whom MCLU Foundation, Barbara L.\nGoodwin, and Murray, Plumb & Murray were on brief, for appellant.\n     Edward R. Benjamin, Jr., with whom Thompson & Bowie, LLP was\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          January 7, 2009\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge. In this case, a prostitution sting\n\nbackfired, spawning a series of events that culminated in a civil\n\nsuit.   That suit, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, included\n\nclaims of unlawful detention and use of excessive force.                The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant\n\n(a police officer).      See Morelli v. Webster, 554 F. Supp. 2d 46 (D.\n\nMe. 2008).      We affirm as to the unlawful detention claims, but\n\nreverse as to the excessive force claims.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n              Because this is an appeal from the entry of summary\n\njudgment, we take the facts in the light most flattering to the\n\nnonmovant (here, the plaintiff).           See Cordi-Allen v. Conlon, 494\n\nF.3d 245, 248 (1st Cir. 2007).         This means that where, as here,\n\nthere is a wide divergence between the parties' first-hand accounts\n\nof the relevant events, we must adopt the nonmovant's version.\n\nScott v. Harris, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 1774-75 (2007).           Our narrative\n\ndraws heavily upon the plaintiff's filings under D. Me. R. 7.\n\n              Plaintiff-appellant Rosanna Morelli, an exotic dancer,\n\nhired   out     for   private   parties.      Though   self-employed,   she\n\noccasionally accepted engagements through Serena's Heaven on Earth,\n\na purveyor of adult entertainment services in Portland, Maine.\n\n              On March 3, 2006, the plaintiff, using the nom de guerre\n\n\"Vanessa,\" responded to a call placed to a number advertised by\n\nSerena's.     She and the caller agreed on a price for an exotic dance\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fto be performed in room 203 of the Best Western hotel in South\n\nPortland.        Unbeknownst         to    the    plaintiff,     the    caller      was    an\n\nundercover police officer named McVane, and the call was part of a\n\nprostitution           sting        operation          orchestrated     by    the       local\n\nconstabulary.\n\n             The site of the proposed performance — room 203 — had\n\nbeen outfitted with audio and video surveillance equipment. The\n\noutput     was    to    be     transmitted        surreptitiously       to   a     so-called\n\n\"observation room\" next door.                      A local prosecutor and several\n\npolice officers had congregated in the observation room (among\n\nthem, defendant-appellee Steven Webster).\n\n             McVane met the plaintiff at the door to room 203.                            Upon\n\nentering the room, the plaintiff hugged McVane. At that point, one\n\nof   the    policemen          in    the    observation       room    (Officer      Farris)\n\nrecognized       the    plaintiff         and    exclaimed    that     she   was    a   known\n\nprostitute.\n\n             Because McVane was nervous and acting strangely, the\n\nplaintiff soon began to suspect that something was amiss.                                  She\n\nnonetheless placed her heavy coat on the bed and requested the\n\nagreed fee.         McVane placed several bills on a counter but the\n\nplaintiff did not touch them.\n\n             In    response          to    McVane's      repeated     urgings      that    she\n\ndisrobe, the plaintiff informed him that she was only there to\n\ndance.     When McVane persisted, she sarcastically suggested that he\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fremove his clothes.       Finally she started to shed her jeans.            At\n\nabout that time, however, she became convinced that McVane was not\n\na bona fide customer, was probably associated with law enforcement,\n\nand was wasting her time.          She pulled up her jeans, told McVane\n\nthat she was leaving, and informed him that she was taking $20 to\n\ncover transportation and wasted time.          She grabbed a bill in that\n\ndenomination from the pile of currency on the counter and took her\n\nleave.\n\n             In   the   corridor    the   plaintiff   encountered      several\n\nofficers, including Webster.           When one of them accused her of\n\nhaving stolen money; she surrendered the $20 bill.               She then moved\n\ntoward the exit, looking straight ahead and proceeding slowly. Her\n\ncoat was draped over her right arm, and she kept that arm stiff.\n\n             Webster stands about a foot taller than the plaintiff —\n\nhe is 6'2\" and in good physical shape — and substantially outweighs\n\nher.   Although clad in civilian clothing, he prominently displayed\n\na badge on his belt.\n\n             Among the cohort of policemen, only Webster attempted to\n\nstop   the   plaintiff    from     leaving   the   hotel.   He    deliberately\n\npositioned himself to block her path.          As the plaintiff tells it,\n\nshe tried to walk around him and brushed against him as she passed.\n\nWebster reacted angrily, grabbing her wrist, yanking her around,\n\nslamming her against the hallway wall, pinning her there by her\n\nforearms, and saying \"look missy, you're not going anywhere, you\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fneed to go back into the room.\"   Webster held the plaintiff against\n\nthe wall for a full three or four minutes before guiding her back\n\nto room 203.\n\n          Once there, Webster told the plaintiff that he could not\n\narrest her.    Nevertheless, he forced her to remain in the room\n\nwhile he questioned her.   Two other officers were present during\n\nthis interrogation.   The plaintiff complained that she was in pain\n\nand, after several minutes, Webster told the plaintiff that she\n\ncould leave as long as she did so \"respectfully.\"     The plaintiff\n\nfound this admonition \"condescendingly odd.\"\n\n          The plaintiff returned home.   She immediately called the\n\npolice department to report the incident.    Later, she visited the\n\nemergency room of a local hospital.      She was told that she had\n\nsustained contusions and a first-degree shoulder separation.     An\n\northopedic surgeon treated her for some time and, eventually, more\n\nsophisticated testing revealed evidence of a rotator cuff tear.\n\nShe continues to experience pain in her shoulder, arm, and lower\n\nback.\n\n          Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiff sued Webster in\n\nMaine's federal district court. She claimed that Webster's actions\n\nconstituted an unreasonable seizure of her person because they\n\namounted to a detention without adequate justification, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 70-71 (1st Cir. 2004), and\n\nbecause he effected that detention through the use of excessive\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fforce, see, e.g., Calvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d 422, 428 (1st Cir.\n\n2006). The plaintiff's complaint also included supplemental claims\n\nunder Maine law, which mirrored her federal claims.\n\n            Upon the completion of discovery, Webster moved for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts justified the\n\ndetention and made pellucid that the force he had applied was not\n\nexcessive.      In the alternative, he argued that he was entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n            The district court granted this motion, holding that the\n\nundisputed       facts   established       that   Webster       had     adequate\n\njustification to seize the plaintiff regardless of whether that\n\nseizure amounted to an investigatory stop or a de facto arrest.\n\nMorelli, 554 F. Supp. 2d at 53.           In explaining this holding, the\n\ncourt employed the pooled knowledge doctrine to credit Webster with\n\nknowledge possessed by his compatriots and determined that the\n\nseizure amounted to a temporary detention, prompted by reasonable\n\nsuspicion.      Id. at 52-53.   The court added that even if the seizure\n\namounted to a de facto arrest, it was justified by probable cause.\n\nSee id. (citing Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A)).               In all\n\nevents,   the    court   posited   that    Webster     would   be   entitled   to\n\nqualified    immunity    because   \"a     reasonable    official      would   have\n\nbelieved that criminal activity, prostitution, was afoot, that\n\nMaine law permitted him to arrest Plaintiff and that he had\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fprobable cause to believe that Plaintiff had committed or was in\n\nthe process of committing a crime.\"                 Id. at 53 n.9.\n\n                 With respect to the excessive force claim, the lower\n\ncourt relied entirely on qualified immunity.                   It concluded that a\n\nreasonable officer in Webster's situation could well have believed\n\nthat       the    plaintiff    had    committed       theft,   was     connected   to\n\nprostitution, posed a threat to those around her, and was actively\n\nevading detention.         Id. at 56-57.          Thus, the force used by Webster\n\nwas of a degree that a reasonable officer could have believed was\n\nappropriate under the circumstances.                 Id.\n\n                 Along   the   way,   the    district      court    noted   that   the\n\nresolution of the federal claims would dictate the outcome of the\n\nmirror-image supplemental claims.                 Id. at 51.       The latter claims\n\nhad been asserted under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5 § 4682, a\n\nstatute patterned on 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Jenness v. Nickerson,\n\n637 A.2d 1152, 1158 (Me. 1994).                   Thus, there was no need for a\n\nseparate analysis.1            With this reasoning in mind, the district\n\ncourt entered an adverse judgment on all of the plaintiff's claims.\n\nThis timely appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       We adhere to this approach. Although we analyze the issues\nin terms of the federal claims, our reasoning applies with\nundiminished force to the supplemental claims.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fII.   THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\n\n            Before addressing the assignments of error, we pause to\n\ndiscuss three sets of legal principles, each of which to some\n\nextent informs our analysis.\n\n                            A.   Pooled Knowledge.\n\n            The pooled knowledge doctrine, sometimes known as the\n\ncollective      knowledge   doctrine,     is    a   mechanism   that    in    some\n\ncircumstances allows a court to \"impute\" facts known by one police\n\nofficer to another police officer engaged in a joint mission. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nThe doctrine derives from a felt sense that officers acting in\n\nconcert actually do, and are entitled to, assume that fellow\n\nofficers   are    acting    in   a   manner    consistent   with   their     legal\n\nresponsibilities. See Whitely v. Warden, Wyo. State Pen., 401 U.S.\n\n560, 568 (1971); see generally Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure\n\n§ 3.5 (2004).     Thus, for example, when an officer who has probable\n\ncause \"directs an officer who lacks that knowledge to make the\n\narrest,    we    'impute'   to   the    arresting    officer    the    directing\n\nofficer's knowledge.\" Meade, 110 F.3d at 193; see United States v.\n\nCook, 277 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 2002); Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d\n\n233, 236 n.7 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            In the case at hand, the district court invoked the\n\npooled knowledge doctrine on two different points.                    First, the\n\ncourt used it to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by a\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\ffellow officer, Farris, to the effect that the plaintiff was a\n\nknown prostitute.    Morelli, 554 F. Supp. 2d at 48 n.2.      Second, the\n\ncourt used it to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by McVane\n\nto the effect that the plaintiff had taken a $20 bill from the\n\ncounter in room 203.    Id. at 52-53.\n\n           The plaintiff argues with considerable force that these\n\nare improper applications of the pooled knowledge doctrine.           For\n\nthe reasons explained below, we need not enter this thicket.\n\n           The plaintiff's version of events places Webster in the\n\nobservation room when she arrived in room 203. Under that version,\n\nWebster must have heard Farris announce that he believed the\n\nplaintiff to be a known prostitute.        Thus, the pooled knowledge\n\ndoctrine   added    nothing    to   Webster's   store   of   reputational\n\ninformation.\n\n           As to the theft, the plaintiff herself admits that she\n\ntook the $20 bill.   And on her account, Webster watched her actions\n\nfrom the observation room and did not enter the hallway until after\n\nshe left room 203.   It follows that Webster must have seen her take\n\nthe money and, accordingly, the pooled knowledge doctrine is of no\n\nconsequence on this point.\n\n                       B.     Standard of Review.\n\n           We afford de novo review to a district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment.      See Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La\n\nDiofusión Pública, 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).                Summary\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fjudgment is appropriate only when the record reflects no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and indicates that the moving party\n\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.              See id.; see also Fed.\n\nR.    Civ.   P.   56(c).        In   a   case   in   which   the   parties   offer\n\ndiametrically opposite versions of the facts, each founded on\n\nfirst-hand knowledge, we must ask whether the account propounded by\n\nthe nonmovant suffices to thwart the swing of the summary judgment\n\nax.    See, e.g., Scott, 126 S. Ct. at 1775.\n\n                           C.    Qualified Immunity.\n\n             This case differs from a garden-variety summary judgment\n\ncase because it involves the doctrine of qualified immunity.\n\nQualified immunity is a judicial gloss designed to allow public\n\nofficials to perform discretionary tasks without the constant\n\nthreat of legal liability.           See Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d 16, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).      As the Supreme Court has explained, the doctrine\n\nis intended to protect \"all but the plainly incompetent [and] those\n\nwho knowingly violate the law.\"             Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335,\n\n341 (1986).\n\n             Determining the applicability of the qualified immunity\n\ndoctrine in a given case requires a three-step inquiry.                Operating\n\nwithin that framework, an inquiring court must consider (i) whether\n\nthe plaintiff's proffered version of the facts, if true, makes out\n\na violation of a constitutionally protected right; (ii) if so,\n\nwhether that right was clearly established at the time of the\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fputative violation; and (iii) if the answers to the preceding two\n\nqueries are affirmative, whether a reasonable public official,\n\nsituated similarly to the defendant, should have understood the\n\nchallenged act or omission to violate the discerned right.                       See\n\nPagán, 448 F.3d at 31; Limone v. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           The     doctrinal        intersection    of     qualified     immunity\n\nprinciples and summary judgment principles is not well mapped.\n\nPlotting that intersection can present thorny analytic problems —\n\nproblems that are magnified because of the desire to resolve claims\n\nof   qualified    immunity     at    the     earliest    practicable     stage   of\n\nlitigation.      See Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The    difficulty        arises    because    the   summary   judgment\n\nstandard requires absolute deference to the nonmovant's factual\n\nassertions (as long as those assertions are put forward on personal\n\nknowledge or otherwise documented by materials of evidentiary\n\nquality, see, e.g., Greenburg v. P.R. Marit. Shipping Auth., 835\n\nF.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1987)), whereas qualified immunity, when\n\nraised on summary judgment, demands deference to the reasonable, if\n\nmistaken, actions of the movant, see, e.g., Cox, 391 F.3d at 31.\n\nIn order to ease this inherent tension, we think it wise for courts\n\nto cabin these standards and keep them logically distinct, first\n\nidentifying the version of events that best comports with the\n\nsummary judgment standard and then asking whether, given that set\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fof facts, a reasonable officer should have known that his actions\n\nwere unlawful.        See Wilson v. City of Boston, 421 F.3d 45, 53 n.10\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (noting that genuine disputes anent material facts\n\nmust be resolved at trial even though qualified immunity is a\n\nquestion of law for the judge); Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that disputes as to material facts\n\nsometimes      will   preclude      summary    judgment      based   on   qualified\n\nimmunity).       We proceed in that vein.2\n\nIII.       UNLAWFUL DETENTION\n\n               We   begin     our    journey      through      the    plaintiff's\n\nasseverational        array   with    her     claim   that    Webster's    actions\n\nconstituted an unlawful detention.             The background principles are\n\nfamiliar.\n\n               A detention at the hands of a police officer constitutes\n\na seizure of the detainee's person and, thus, must be adequately\n\njustified under the Fourth Amendment.             Romain, 393 F.3d at 70-71.\n\nThe case law recognizes two classes of seizures falling along this\n\ncontinuum: arrests (whether actual or de facto) and temporary\n\ndetentions (such as investigatory stops). The justification needed\n\n\n       2\n      We previously noted that the Supreme Court has never clearly\nindicated whether the judge or the jury is the proper factfinder\nwhen a case is actually tried and a factual dispute underlies a\nproffered qualified immunity defense. Kelley, 288 F.3d at 7 n.2.\nWe have, however, expressed some doubt that \"the Supreme Court\nintended this [factual] dispute to be resolved from the bench by\nfiat.\" Id.; see Jennings v. Jones, 499 F.3d 2, 10 (1st Cir. 2007)\n(requiring, on particular facts, that a judge's post-verdict\nqualified immunity ruling be consistent with the jury verdict).\n\n                                       -12-\n\ffor these two types of seizures is qualitatively different: an\n\narrest must be grounded on a showing of probable cause, see, e.g.,\n\nCarroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 156 (1925), whereas a\n\ntemporary detention may be grounded on a lesser showing equivalent\n\nto reasonable suspicion, see, e.g., United States v. Zapata, 18\n\nF.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            In this case, the district court declined to locate\n\nWebster's actions along this continuum.         Rather, it declared those\n\nactions justified under either scenario. See Morelli, 554 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 53.    We examine this conclusion.\n\n            The   line   between    temporary   detentions       and    de    facto\n\narrests is often blurred.          To complicate matters, that line can\n\nshift in the course of a single encounter so that what starts out\n\nas an investigatory stop may morph into a de facto arrest.                     See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir. 2003).                     It\n\nfollows that an inquiring court must determine whether a police\n\nofficer's   initial      action    was   justified   and,   if    so,    whether\n\nsubsequent (more coercive) actions undertaken by the officer were\n\njustified by developing circumstances.               See United States v.\n\nSowers, 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            In this instance, we can say with assurance that the\n\nfacts known to Webster warranted an investigatory stop.                      Such a\n\ntemporary detention, known colloquially as a Terry stop, see Terry\n\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968), requires only articulable facts\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fgiving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a suspect may be\n\ninvolved in criminal activity.                    United States v. Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d\n\n25, 28 (1st Cir. 2008).                     It is undisputed that the facts known to\n\nWebster at the inception of the encounter included, among other\n\nthings, that the plaintiff had taken money from McVane before\n\nleaving room 203.3                That fact gave rise to a reasonable suspicion\n\nthat the plaintiff had committed an act of theft.                                See Me. Rev.\n\nStat.     Ann.       tit.    17-A       §    353(1)(A).        In   turn,    that     suspicion\n\njustified        a    temporary         detention       in    order   to    investigate     the\n\npossible commission of that crime.                        See Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 28;\n\nZapata, 18 F.3d at 975.\n\n             But giving credence to the plaintiff's version of events\n\n(as   the   summary          judgment         standard       requires),     it   is   at   least\n\narguable that the character of the stop changed in mid-stream.\n\nAlthough     there          are    no       scientifically      precise      benchmarks      for\n\ndistinguishing between temporary detentions and de facto arrests,\n\nthe standard mode of inquiry is to assess the totality of the\n\n\n\n      3\n       One might argue that Webster should have understood that the\nplaintiff's statement that she was entitled to the money, coupled\nwith the absence of an immediate protest by McVane, indicated\nacquiescence. But apart from the fact that the plaintiff has not\npressed this point, the circumstances simply are not clear-cut\nenough either to compel a conclusion that silence equalled\nacquiescence or to preclude a reasonable belief that a crime was\nbeing committed. See generally New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325,\n346 (1985) (explaining that \"the requirement of reasonable\nsuspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty: sufficient\nprobability, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                                 -14-\n\fcircumstances and ask whether a reasonable person in the suspect's\n\nshoes    would    understand       herself   to     be    subject    to   restraints\n\ncomparable to those associated with an arrest.                      See Berkemer v.\n\nMcCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984); Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.                       The\n\n\"ultimate inquiry\" is whether there was a \"restraint on freedom of\n\nmovement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\"                      United\n\nStates v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79, 93 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting\n\nThompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 112 (1995)).\n\n            Hallmark factors such as physical restraint or a show of\n\nforce may be suggestive, but in certain circumstances such factors\n\nmay be perfectly consistent with an investigatory stop. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Taylor, 162 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir. 1998); United\n\nStates v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir. 1987); see also United\n\nStates v. Kapperman, 764 F.2d 786, 790 n.4 (11th Cir. 1985)\n\n(stating   that     \"neither      handcuffing      nor    other     restraints   will\n\nautomatically convert a Terry stop into a de facto arrest\"). There\n\nis no per-se rule.\n\n            For    present       purposes,   we    must    take     the   plaintiff's\n\naccount as true.       On that version, Webster restrained her by the\n\nuse of main force (forcibly halting her progress and pinning her\n\nagainst a wall for a period of three to four minutes).                    He told her\n\nthat she was not going anywhere.                 He then escorted her from the\n\npublic   hallway     into    a    hotel    room    where    other    officers    were\n\nassembled.       He proceeded to interrogate her.\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f           None of these actions, in isolation, necessarily would\n\nhave converted the initial Terry stop into a de facto arrest.         See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Campa, 234 F.3d 733, 738-39 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(directing suspects to move from hallway to kitchen did not convert\n\na Terry stop into a de facto arrest); Zapata, 18 F.3d at 976-77\n\n(holding that physical touching did not work such a conversion);\n\nUnited States v. Perdue, 8 F.3d 1455, 1463 (10th Cir. 1993)\n\n(holding that immobilization does not automatically work such a\n\nconversion).   Moreover, there are other indicators that counsel\n\nagainst a finding that a de facto arrest occurred.         For example,\n\nthe plaintiff admits that, once they had repaired to room 203,\n\nWebster stated that he was not arresting her.\n\n           Yet, at this stage of the litigation, we must take the\n\nevidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiff.      Cordi-Allen, 494 F.3d at 248.        From\n\nthat coign of vantage, we think that a rational jury could conclude\n\nthat the combination of events that transpired — the aggressive\n\nphysical   touching,   the   relatively   lengthy   immobilization,    the\n\nremoval of the plaintiff from a public hallway to a private room,\n\nthe command not to leave, and the ensuing interrogation in a small\n\nroom populated by multiple police officers — would have sufficed to\n\nlead a reasonable person in the plaintiff's place and stead to\n\nbelieve that Webster had imposed restraints on her freedom of\n\nmovement tantamount to those implicated in a formal arrest.            See\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fZapata, 18 F.3d at 975; see also United States v. Acosta-Colón, 157\n\nF.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir. 1998) (stopping, handcuffing, and moving\n\nsuspect to detention room constitute a de facto arrest).\n\n           This brings us to the issue of justification.          Because a\n\nreasonable jury could find a de facto arrest, Webster's actions\n\nwould be justified only if he acted on probable cause.\n\n           Proof of probable cause is not to be confused with the\n\nmore onerous standard of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee United States v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 555-56 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   Rather, probable cause exists when an officer, acting upon\n\napparently trustworthy information, reasonably can conclude that a\n\ncrime has been or is about to be committed and that the suspect is\n\nimplicated in its commission. See United States v. Brown, 500 F.3d\n\n48, 56 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020,\n\n1023 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           The district court discerned probable cause based on the\n\nplaintiff's \"connections to prostitution, theft of the police\n\ndepartment's money, and [disobedience of] a police command to stop\n\nin the public corridor of a hotel.\"       Morelli, 554 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n53.   In this regard, the court seems to have been impressed that\n\nthe plaintiff \"admitted to making physical contact\" with Webster as\n\nshe tried to bypass him in the hallway.         Id.\n\n           We   are   hesitant   to   endorse    the   district    court's\n\nassessment as a whole.     For one thing, while a belief that the\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fplaintiff was connected to prostitution might have added marginally\n\nto the justification for a Terry stop, that belief had no bearing\n\non any crime that conceivably could have been committed on the day\n\nin question.     It cannot, therefore, undergird a probable cause\n\ndetermination.   See Brown, 500 F.3d at 56.\n\n           By the same token, the plaintiff's attempt to walk past\n\nWebster might have given Webster the right to use a modicum of\n\nforce to effectuate a stop.      See, e.g., Isom v. Town of Warwick,\n\n360 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2004).       But the plaintiff consistently\n\nhas described the initial contact between her and Webster as\n\namounting to \"brushing against him\" as they passed in the hallway.\n\nAs described, that conduct was neither a crime nor evidence of a\n\ncrime.   See, e.g., State v. Worrey, 322 A.2d 73, 80 (Me. 1974)\n\n(defining criminal assault).\n\n           We nonetheless agree with the district court's bottom-\n\nline   conclusion.   On   the   undisputed   facts,   Webster   did   have\n\nknowledge of a likely crime — the apparent theft of $20 in police\n\nmoney.    Webster had been in the observation room during the\n\nplaintiff's interaction with McVane and knew that she had taken a\n\n$20 bill from the pile of police money.          As the district court\n\ncorrectly explained, theft is a crime under Maine law, for which an\n\nobserving officer is empowered to make a warrantless arrest.          See\n\nMorelli, 554 F. Supp. 2d at 53 (citing Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-\n\nA §§ 15(2), 353(1)(A)).\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f               The    plaintiff       strives      to   blunt        the    force       of   this\n\nconclusion in two ways.           We examine each of these initiatives.\n\n               First, the plaintiff posits that Webster knew she had\n\nreturned the money before he detained her.                             Building on this\n\nfoundation, she contends that, by returning the money, she never\n\npossessed       unauthorized      control         of    it     and,    in       the    bargain,\n\nmanifested that she lacked the requisite intent for the crime of\n\ntheft.\n\n               This    gambit    is    unavailing.            Even     if       the    plaintiff\n\nreturned the funds, she did not wipe the slate clean.                             Theft under\n\nMaine    law    comprises       two    elements:        (i)    obtaining         unauthorized\n\ncontrol over another's property (ii) with intent to deprive that\n\nperson of it.          See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A).\n\nHere,    the    putative     crime         was   completed       (or       so    the    officer\n\nreasonably could have thought) as soon as the plaintiff took the\n\nmoney.    It could not be erased by its perpetrator's subsequent\n\nreturn   of     the    funds.         It   is,    after       all,    hornbook         law   that\n\nunauthorized control can be evinced by moving property even a\n\nslight distance in the presence of the owner.                        See Wayne R. LaFave,\n\nSubstantive Criminal Law § 19.3(b) (2003).                            By like token, an\n\nintent to deprive only need exist at the moment of taking.                               See id.\n\n§   19.5(f).          Whatever    a    jury      ultimately      might          find    under   a\n\nreasonable doubt instruction, Webster had probable cause to think\n\nthat the requisite intent existed.                  See supra note 3.\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\f           The plaintiff's second argument is no more robust.    She\n\nmaintains that after returning her to room 203 Webster stated: \"I'm\n\nnot arresting you, I can't arrest you.\"    Even were we to read this\n\ncomment favorably to the plaintiff, as an admission by Webster that\n\nhe felt that he lacked probable cause, our inquiry would not end.\n\nThe test for the existence vel non of probable cause \"is objective\n\nin nature.\"    Cox, 391 F.3d at 31; see Whren v. United States, 517\n\nU.S. 806, 812 (1996).   Webster's subjective belief is, therefore,\n\nnot determinative of the probable cause issue.\n\n           That ends this aspect of the matter.     For the reasons\n\ndiscussed, we conclude that the district court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment on the unlawful detention claim (and,\n\nthus, on the mirror-image supplemental claim as well).\n\nIV.   EXCESSIVE FORCE\n\n           We turn next to the excessive force claim.   The district\n\ncourt analyzed this claim under the rubric of qualified immunity.\n\nIt concluded that the plaintiff had made out a colorable claim of\n\na violation of a clearly defined constitutional right, but that a\n\nreasonable public official in Webster's position reasonably could\n\nhave believed that the force used to detain the plaintiff was\n\nappropriate.   Morelli, 554 F. Supp. 2d at 56-57.   We disagree with\n\nthe last step in this progression.\n\n           We begin with bedrock.      As we already have said, see\n\nsupra Part II(C), the qualified immunity inquiry is threefold.    An\n\n\n                                -20-\n\finquiring court must determine (i) whether the plaintiff has\n\nasserted a cognizable violation of a constitutional right; (ii)\n\nwhether that right was clearly established at the relevant time;\n\nand (iii) whether a reasonable public official in the defendant's\n\nposition should have understood that his actions infringed that\n\nright.   See Pagán, 448 F.3d at 31; Limone, 372 F.3d at 44.                           We\n\napply this template to the facts at hand and, because the case was\n\nterminated at the summary judgment stage, we take as true the\n\nplaintiff's account of the relevant events.\n\n           The first branch of the qualified immunity test is\n\nsatisfied here.      To establish a Fourth Amendment excessive force\n\nclaim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant employed force that\n\nwas unreasonable under all the circumstances.                      See Graham v.\n\nConnor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989); Asociación de Periodistas de P.R.\n\nv. Mueller, 529 F.3d 52, 59 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           In   addressing       this   question,      we   do   not    write    on    a\n\npristine page.    The Supreme Court has furnished a non-exclusive\n\nlist of criteria for determining the objective reasonableness of a\n\npolice   officer's    use   of    force.       These    criteria       include   \"the\n\nseverity of the crime at issue,\" the extent (if any) to which \"the\n\nsuspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or\n\nothers;\" and whether the suspect \"is actively resisting arrest or\n\nattempting to evade arrest by flight.\" Graham, 490 U.S. at 396.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f          When the facts in this case are marshaled in the light\n\nmost hospitable to the plaintiff, these criteria cut sharply in her\n\ndirection.   If a crime was committed at all, it was a Class E crime\n\n(the lowest level of criminality recognized under Maine law).   See\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A); see also id. §§ 4, 4-A.\n\nDespite the district court's contrary assertion, Morelli, 554 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 56-57, there is no evidence cognizable under the\n\nsummary judgment standard indicating that the plaintiff posed a\n\nthreat to the safety of the officers or others.4   And, finally, on\n\nthe plaintiff's account, there is no evidence of any meaningful\n\ndegree of resistance.   A jury might also choose to infer that the\n\ndefendant, frustrated at the looming failure of the sting operation\n\nand the prospect of the plaintiff avoiding arrest, lost his temper\n\nand intentionally used more force than the situation warranted.\n\n          To say more about this element of the test would be to\n\npaint the lily.    We conclude, without serious question, that a\n\nrational jury could find that the force used by Webster to detain\n\nan unresisting woman who, at worst, was suspected of being a petty\n\nthief, was so disproportionate as to offend the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSee Alexis v. McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 353\n\n\n     4\n       Of course, there was evidence that the plaintiff was holding\nher right arm stiffly, but she plausibly attributed this gesture to\nthe need to provide support for the heavy coat that was draped over\nit. We do not think that this is sufficient, standing alone, to\njustify the use of a significant level of force. Cf. Parker v.\nGerrish, 547 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding de minimis\nresistance to arrest insufficient to justify force used).\n\n                                -22-\n\f(1st Cir. 1995) (collecting cases in which force used to arrest was\n\nunreasonable in light of minor nature of crime).\n\n            The second branch of the test is also satisfied.              A\n\nclearly established right is one sufficiently defined at a level of\n\nspecificity that would put a state actor (such as a police officer)\n\non fair notice that his specific actions offended the Constitution.\n\nSee Limone, 372 F.3d at 46.      Our case law supplies a crystal clear\n\narticulation of the right, grounded in the Fourth Amendment, to be\n\nfree from the use of excessive force by an arresting officer.          See,\n\ne.g., Alexis, 67 F.3d at 353-54 (concluding excessive force claim\n\ntriable when officer seized and dragged plaintiff to effectuate\n\narrest for crime of trespassing in a public restaurant).              Given\n\nthis well-settled jurisprudence, there is no legitimate doubt that\n\nthe right asserted here was clearly established. Thus, Webster was\n\non notice that a police officer's use of excessive force would be\n\noffensive to the Constitution.\n\n            The question, then, reduces to whether Webster's use of\n\nexcessive force constituted the type and kind of erroneous judgment\n\nthat   a   reasonable   police   officer   under   the   same   or   similar\n\ncircumstances might have made.       See Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151\n\nF.3d 1, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1998).      We think not.\n\n            This inquiry is a complicated one.            By definition,\n\nexcessive force is unreasonable force.         See Graham, 490 U.S. at\n\n394.   But reasonable people sometimes make mistaken judgments, and\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fa reasonable officer sometimes may use unreasonable force. In that\n\nevent, qualified immunity gives an officer the benefit of a margin\n\nof error.     See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 205-06 (2001)\n\n(explaining that qualified immunity operates in excessive force\n\ncases to \"protect officers from the sometimes hazy border between\n\nexcessive    and    acceptable      force\"       (internal       quotation     marks\n\nomitted)); Jennings v. Jones, 499 F.3d 2, 18 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(observing that, in effect, \"officers receive protection if they\n\nacted   reasonably      in    exercising   unreasonable      force.\").         Thus,\n\ndefeating a qualified immunity defense requires a showing of an\n\nincremental degree of error — an incommensurate use of force beyond\n\nthat needed to establish a garden-variety excessive force claim\n\nand, further, beyond the \"hazy border\" noted by the Saucier Court,\n\n533 U.S. at 206.\n\n            Looked at another way, qualified immunity is appropriate\n\nin an excessive force case when an officer \"correctly perceive[s]\n\nall of the relevant facts but [has] a mistaken understanding\" as to\n\nthe   legality     of   his    chosen    level    of    force.      Id.   at    205.\n\nConversely, qualified immunity protection would not be available\n\nwhen the level of force chosen by the officer cannot in any way,\n\nshape, or form be justified under those facts.\n\n            These principles necessitate a case-specific approach.\n\nMany cases will defy easy classification.              This case, however, does\n\nnot present a borderline situation; and we think that the plaintiff\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\fhas made a sufficient showing to avert the entry of summary judgment\n\npredicated on qualified immunity.\n\n            As will almost always be true, this determination is\n\nbased on a matter of degree.      Here, the facts, seen through the\n\nprism of the plaintiff's account, simply do not justify yanking the\n\narm of an unarmed and non-violent person, suspected only of the\n\ntheft of $20, and pinning her against a wall for three to four\n\nminutes with sufficient force to tear her rotator cuff.       That is\n\nparticularly so in view of the marked disparity in height and weight\n\nbetween the officer and the suspect, the absence of any evidence of\n\neither dangerousness or attempted flight, and the presence of a\n\ncadre of other officers at the scene.        In short, the plaintiff's\n\nversion of the relevant facts places Webster's actions outside the\n\nuniverse of protected mistakes.    See, e.g., Vondrak v. City of Las\n\nCruces, 535 F.3d 1198, 1209-10 (10th Cir. 2008); Jones v. Parmley,\n\n465 F.3d 46, 63 (2d Cir. 2006); Smoak v. Hall, 460 F.3d 768, 784\n\n(6th Cir. 2006); Kukla v. Hulm, 310 F.3d 1046, 1050 (8th Cir. 2002);\n\nDeGraff v. Dist. of Columbia, 120 F.3d 298, 302 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n            The district court stressed that a reasonable officer,\n\nbelieving that the plaintiff committed a theft, would have thought\n\nit lawful to use some force to detain her.       Morelli, 554 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 57.   That is true as far as it goes.    Cf. Graham, 490 U.S. at\n\n396 (noting that the right to make an arrest carries with it the\n\nright to use some force).       But    the   district court's further\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fconclusion    that   the   plaintiff's    actions   justified   Webster   in\n\nbelieving that a significant degree of force could be used, see\n\nMorelli, 554 F. Supp. 2d at 56-57, cannot be squared with the\n\nsummary judgment standard.       While the officers' accounts of the\n\nfacts may justify the district court's appraisal, the court was\n\nbound to ask not whether those accounts were plausible but, rather,\n\nwhether under the plaintiff's version of the facts a reasonable\n\nofficer should have known that the degree of force used was plainly\n\nexcessive.    See Griffith v. Coburn, 473 F.3d 650, 656-57 (6th Cir.\n\n2007) (\"Because determining reasonableness in [the excessive force]\n\ncontext is such a fact-intensive endeavor summary judgment is\n\nimproper if the legal question of immunity turns on which version\n\nof the facts is accepted.\"); see also Dávila, 498 F.3d at 12.\n\n             To be sure, incidental contact — say, a \"gratuitously\n\nviolent shove\" — may be within the realm of conduct protected by\n\nqualified immunity.        Saucier, 533 U.S. at 208.       Here, however,\n\nWebster's conduct, as described by the plaintiff, eclipsed the\n\nbounds of reasonableness.       Given the importance of reasonableness\n\nto the qualified immunity calculus in excessive force cases, the\n\nexistence of such immunity frequently will hinge on the resolution\n\nof disputed facts.     See, e.g., Jennings, 499 F.3d at 18-20.       So it\n\nis here.\n\n             In sum, we conclude that the plaintiff not only has made\n\nout a trialworthy issue as to whether Webster's use of a significant\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fdegree of force transgressed her Fourth Amendment right to be free\n\nfrom excessive force but also that she has made a showing adequate\n\nto thwart a qualified immunity defense.            See Kelley, 288 F.3d at 7.\n\nBecause a rational jury could find, on this scumbled record, facts\n\nestablishing    that    Webster's     use    of   force    was   so   objectively\n\nunreasonable    and    so   plainly   misguided     that    he   should   not   be\n\nprotected by the shield of qualified immunity, the district court\n\nerred in resolving this claim in advance of trial. See id.; Alexis,\n\n67 F.3d at 352-53.\n\n             Let us be perfectly clear.             We understand that the\n\nplaintiff's version of the relevant events is hotly contested, and\n\nwe make no judgment as to where the truth lies.                       See, e.g.,\n\nGreenburg, 835 F.2d at 936 (discussing operation of summary judgment\n\nstandard).\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the grant of summary judgment on the unlawful detention\n\nclaim and the mirror-image supplemental claim, reverse the grant of\n\nsummary judgment on the excessive force claim and the mirror-image\n\nsupplemental claim, and remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nAffirmed in part, reversed part, and remanded.               No costs.\n\n\n\n                      - Concurring Opinion Follows -\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\f             STAHL, Circuit Judge, concurring.   With respect, I write\n\nseparately in this case.    While I concur in the majority's decision\n\nthat the grant of summary judgment on the excessive force claim\n\nshould be reversed, I also have serious doubt about the basis on\n\nwhich the majority decides the first question, whether the stop was\n\nsupported by reasonable suspicion and probable cause.\n\n             The basic facts of this case are that a woman, who one\n\nofficer identified as a known prostitute, did not engage in an act\n\nof prostitution.     The sting failed because either, on the most\n\nfriendly view, she didn't intend to engage in prostitution, or on\n\na less friendly view, she smelled a rat and chose not to continue\n\nwith the proposed encounter.\n\n             When the plaintiff took the $20, she explained to the\n\nofficer in the room that she was taking it as compensation for her\n\nexpenditure of time and gas.     The evidence is uncontroverted that\n\nthe officer did not protest, a fact apparently          known to the\n\ndefendant.    The parties do not agree as to where the defendant was\n\nwhen the money was returned, but at summary judgment we must accept\n\nthe plaintiff's claim that the defendant was one of the first\n\nofficers in the hallway.    Thus it would be reasonable to infer that\n\nhe was aware that the plaintiff had returned the money.\n\n             The plaintiff was a fifty-three-year-old woman, small in\n\nstature, about 5' 3\" tall and weighing 120 pounds, while the\n\ndefendant was physically fit and stood nearly a foot taller.      The\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\ffacts around the stop are in dispute and a jury could well find that\n\nthe real reason for the stop was that the defendant officer was\n\nupset that the sting had failed.   While the fact of the taking of\n\nthe $20 was perhaps sufficient for a brief Terry stop, in my view\n\neverything that occurred thereafter was improper. It is interesting\n\nto note that no other law enforcement person present took part in\n\nthe events that led to this lawsuit.   A reasonable jury might well\n\ndecide that the defendant officer's actions, which caused serious\n\ninjury to the plaintiff, were not animated by the taking of the $20\n\nfrom the bureau but rather were an overblown reaction to the failed\n\nsting.\n\n\n\n\n                               -29-\n\f",

Benjamin, Jr., with whom Thompson &amp; Bowie, LLP was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, SELYA, and STAHL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this case, a prostitution sting backfired, spawning a series of events that culminated in a civil suit. That suit, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, included claims of unlawful detention and use of excessive force. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant (a police officer). <i>See </i><i>Morelli v. Webster,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d 46 (D.Me.2008). We affirm as to the unlawful detention claims, but reverse as to the excessive force claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Because this is an appeal from the entry of summary judgment, we take the facts in the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, the plaintiff). <i>See </i><i>Cordi-Allen v. Conlon,</i> 494 F.3d 245, 248 (1st Cir.2007). This means that where, as here, there is a wide divergence between the parties' first-hand accounts of the relevant events, we must adopt the nonmovant's version. <i>Scott v. Harris,</i> 550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1774-75, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). Our narrative draws heavily upon the plaintiff's filings under D. Me. R. 7.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant Rosanna Morelli, an exotic dancer, hired out for private parties. Though self-employed, she occasionally accepted engagements through Serena's Heaven on Earth, a purveyor of adult entertainment services in Portland, Maine.</p>\n<p>On March 3, 2006, the plaintiff, using the nom de guerre \"Vanessa,\" responded to a call placed to a number advertised by Serena's. She and the caller agreed on a price for an exotic dance to be performed in room 203 of the Best Western hotel in South Portland. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, the caller was an undercover police officer named McVane, and the call was part of a prostitution sting operation orchestrated by the local constabulary.</p>\n<p>The site of the proposed performance  room 203  had been outfitted with audio and video surveillance equipment. The output was to be transmitted surreptitiously to a so-called \"observation room\" next door. A local prosecutor and several police officers had congregated in the observation room (among them, defendant-appellee Steven Webster).</p>\n<p>McVane met the plaintiff at the door to room 203. Upon entering the room, the plaintiff hugged McVane. At that point, one of the policemen in the observation room (Officer Farris) recognized the plaintiff and exclaimed that she was a known prostitute.</p>\n<p>Because McVane was nervous and acting strangely, the plaintiff soon began to suspect that something was amiss. She nonetheless placed her heavy coat on the bed and requested the agreed fee. McVane placed several bills on a counter but the plaintiff did not touch them.</p>\n<p>In response to McVane's repeated urgings that she disrobe, the plaintiff informed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> him that she was only there to dance. When McVane persisted, she sarcastically suggested that he remove his clothes. Finally she started to shed her jeans. At about that time, however, she became convinced that McVane was not a bona fide customer, was probably associated with law enforcement, and was wasting her time. She pulled up her jeans, told McVane that she was leaving, and informed him that she was taking $20 to cover transportation and wasted time. She grabbed a bill in that denomination from the pile of currency on the counter and took her leave.</p>\n<p>In the corridor the plaintiff encountered several officers, including Webster. When one of them accused her of having stolen money; she surrendered the $20 bill. She then moved toward the exit, looking straight ahead and proceeding slowly. Her coat was draped over her right arm, and she kept that arm stiff.</p>\n<p>Webster stands about a foot taller than the plaintiff  he is 6'2\" and in good physical shape  and substantially outweighs her. Although clad in civilian clothing, he prominently displayed a badge on his belt.</p>\n<p>Among the cohort of policemen, only Webster attempted to stop the plaintiff from leaving the hotel. He deliberately positioned himself to block her path. As the plaintiff tells it, she tried to walk around him and brushed against him as she passed. Webster reacted angrily, grabbing her wrist, yanking her around, slamming her against the hallway wall, pinning her there by her forearms, and saying \"look missy, you're not going anywhere, you need to go back into the room.\" Webster held the plaintiff against the wall for a full three or four minutes before guiding her back to room 203.</p>\n<p>Once there, Webster told the plaintiff that he could not arrest her. Nevertheless, he forced her to remain in the room while he questioned her. Two other officers were present during this interrogation. The plaintiff complained that she was in pain and, after several minutes, Webster told the plaintiff that she could leave as long as she did so \"respectfully.\" The plaintiff found this admonition \"condescendingly odd.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff returned home. She immediately called the police department to report the incident. Later, she visited the emergency room of a local hospital. She was told that she had sustained contusions and a first-degree shoulder separation. An orthopedic surgeon treated her for some time and, eventually, more sophisticated testing revealed evidence of a rotator cuff tear. She continues to experience pain in her shoulder, arm, and lower back.</p>\n<p>Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiff sued Webster in Maine's federal district court. She claimed that Webster's actions constituted an unreasonable seizure of her person because they amounted to a detention without adequate justification, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 70-71 (1st Cir.2004), and because he effected that detention through the use of excessive force, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Calvi v. Knox County,</i> 470 F.3d 422, 428 (1st Cir.2006). The plaintiff's complaint also included supplemental claims under Maine law, which mirrored her federal claims.</p>\n<p>Upon the completion of discovery, Webster moved for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts justified the detention and made pellucid that the force he had applied was not excessive. In the alternative, he argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>The district court granted this motion, holding that the undisputed facts established that Webster had adequate justification to seize the plaintiff regardless of whether that seizure amounted to an investigatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> stop or a de facto arrest. <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53. In explaining this holding, the court employed the pooled knowledge doctrine to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by his compatriots and determined that the seizure amounted to a temporary detention, prompted by reasonable suspicion. <i>Id.</i> at 52-53. The court added that even if the seizure amounted to a de facto arrest, it was justified by probable cause. <i>See id.</i> (citing Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A)). In all events, the court posited that Webster would be entitled to qualified immunity because \"a reasonable official would have believed that criminal activity, prostitution, was afoot, that Maine law permitted him to arrest Plaintiff and that he had probable cause to believe that Plaintiff had committed or was in the process of committing a crime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 53 n. 9.</p>\n<p>With respect to the excessive force claim, the lower court relied entirely on qualified immunity. It concluded that a reasonable officer in Webster's situation could well have believed that the plaintiff had committed theft, was connected to prostitution, posed a threat to those around her, and was actively evading detention. <i>Id.</i> at 56-57. Thus, the force used by Webster was of a degree that a reasonable officer could have believed was appropriate under the circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Along the way, the district court noted that the resolution of the federal claims would dictate the outcome of the mirrorimage supplemental claims. <i>Id.</i> at 51. The latter claims had been asserted under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5 § 4682, a statute patterned on 42 U.S.C. § 1983. <i>See </i><i>Jenness v. Nickerson,</i> 637 A.2d 1152, 1158 (Me.1994). Thus, there was no need for a separate analysis.<sup>[1]</sup> With this reasoning in mind, the district court entered an adverse judgment on all of the plaintiff's claims. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</h2>\n<p>Before addressing the assignments of error, we pause to discuss three sets of legal principles, each of which to some extent informs our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Pooled Knowledge.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The pooled knowledge doctrine, sometimes known as the collective knowledge doctrine, is a mechanism that in some circumstances allows a court to \"impute\" facts known by one police officer to another police officer engaged in a joint mission. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Meade,</i> 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir.1997). The doctrine derives from a felt sense that officers acting in concert actually do, and are entitled to, assume that fellow officers are acting in a manner consistent with their legal responsibilities. <i>See </i><i>Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Pen.,</i> 401 U.S. 560, 568, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971); <i>see generally</i> Wayne R. LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure</i> § 3.5 (2004). Thus, for example, when an officer who has probable cause \"directs an officer who lacks that knowledge to make the arrest, we `impute' to the arresting officer the directing officer's knowledge.\" <i>Meade,</i> 110 F.3d at 193; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Cook,</i> 277 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Burns v. Loranger,</i> 907 F.2d 233, 236 n. 7 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court invoked the pooled knowledge doctrine on two different points. First, the court used it to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by a fellow officer, Farris, to the effect that the plaintiff was a known prostitute. <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 48 n. 2. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Second, the court used it to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by McVane to the effect that the plaintiff had taken a $20 bill from the counter in room 203. <i>Id.</i> at 52-53.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues with considerable force that these are improper applications of the pooled knowledge doctrine. For the reasons explained below, we need not enter this thicket.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's version of events places Webster in the observation room when she arrived in room 203. Under that version, Webster must have heard Farris announce that he believed the plaintiff to be a known prostitute. Thus, the pooled knowledge doctrine added nothing to Webster's store of reputational information.</p>\n<p>As to the theft, the plaintiff herself admits that she took the $20 bill. And on her account, Webster watched her actions from the observation room and did not enter the hallway until after she left room 203. It follows that Webster must have seen her take the money and, accordingly, the pooled knowledge doctrine is of no consequence on this point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Standard of Review.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We afford de novo review to a district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La Diofusión Pública,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record reflects no genuine issue as to any material fact and indicates that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In a case in which the parties offer diametrically opposite versions of the facts, each founded on first-hand knowledge, we must ask whether the account propounded by the nonmovant suffices to thwart the swing of the summary judgment ax. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Scott,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1775.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Qualified Immunity.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This case differs from a garden-variety summary judgment case because it involves the doctrine of qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is a judicial gloss designed to allow public officials to perform discretionary tasks without the constant threat of legal liability. <i>See </i><i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> 448 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir.2006). As the Supreme Court has explained, the doctrine is intended to protect \"all but the plainly incompetent [and] those who knowingly violate the law.\" <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n<p>Determining the applicability of the qualified immunity doctrine in a given case requires a three-step inquiry. Operating within that framework, an inquiring court must consider (i) whether the plaintiff's proffered version of the facts, if true, makes out a violation of a constitutionally protected right; (ii) if so, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the putative violation; and (iii) if the answers to the preceding two queries are affirmative, whether a reasonable public official, situated similarly to the defendant, should have understood the challenged act or omission to violate the discerned right. <i>See </i><i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 31; <i>Limone v. Condon,</i> 372 F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The doctrinal intersection of qualified immunity principles and summary judgment principles is not well mapped. Plotting that intersection can present thorny analytic problems  problems that are magnified because of the desire to resolve claims of qualified immunity at the earliest practicable stage of litigation. <i>See </i><i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The difficulty arises because the summary judgment standard requires absolute deference to the nonmovant's factual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> assertions (as long as those assertions are put forward on personal knowledge or otherwise documented by materials of evidentiary quality, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Greenburg v. P.R. Marit. Shipping Auth.,</i> 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir.1987)), whereas qualified immunity, when raised on summary judgment, demands deference to the reasonable, if mistaken, actions of the movant, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31. In order to ease this inherent tension, we think it wise for courts to cabin these standards and keep them logically distinct, first identifying the version of events that best comports with the summary judgment standard and then asking whether, given that set of facts, a reasonable officer should have known that his actions were unlawful. <i>See </i><i>Wilson v. City of Boston,</i> 421 F.3d 45, 53 n. 10 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that genuine disputes anent material facts must be resolved at trial even though qualified immunity is a question of law for the judge); <i>Kelley v. LaForce,</i> 288 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that disputes as to material facts sometimes will preclude summary judgment based on qualified immunity). We proceed in that vein.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. UNLAWFUL DETENTION</h2>\n<p>We begin our journey through the plaintiff's asseverational array with her claim that Webster's actions constituted an unlawful detention. The background principles are familiar.</p>\n<p>A detention at the hands of a police officer constitutes a seizure of the detainee's person and, thus, must be adequately justified under the Fourth Amendment. <i>Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 70-71. The case law recognizes two classes of seizures falling along this continuum: arrests (whether actual or de facto) and temporary detentions (such as investigatory stops). The justification needed for these two types of seizures is qualitatively different: an arrest must be grounded on a showing of probable cause, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Carroll v. United States,</i> 267 U.S. 132, 156, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), whereas a temporary detention may be grounded on a lesser showing equivalent to reasonable suspicion, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court declined to locate Webster's actions along this continuum. Rather, it declared those actions justified under either scenario. <i>See </i><i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53. We examine this conclusion.</p>\n<p>The line between temporary detentions and de facto arrests is often blurred. To complicate matters, that line can shift in the course of a single encounter so that what starts out as an investigatory stop may morph into a de facto arrest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir.2003). It follows that an inquiring court must determine whether a police officer's initial action was justified and, if so, whether subsequent (more coercive) actions undertaken by the officer were justified by developing circumstances. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sowers,</i> 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>In this instance, we can say with assurance that the facts known to Webster warranted an investigatory stop. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> Such a temporary detention, known colloquially as a <i>Terry</i> stop, <i>see </i><i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), requires only articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a suspect may be involved in criminal activity. <i>United States v. Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.2008). It is undisputed that the facts known to Webster at the inception of the encounter included, among other things, that the plaintiff had taken money from McVane before leaving room 203.<sup>[3]</sup> That fact gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff had committed an act of theft. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A). In turn, that suspicion justified a temporary detention in order to investigate the possible commission of that crime. <i>See </i><i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 28; <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975.</p>\n<p>But giving credence to the plaintiff's version of events (as the summary judgment standard requires), it is at least arguable that the character of the stop changed in mid-stream. Although there are no scientifically precise benchmarks for distinguishing between temporary detentions and de facto arrests, the standard mode of inquiry is to assess the totality of the circumstances and ask whether a reasonable person in the suspect's shoes would understand herself to be subject to restraints comparable to those associated with an arrest. <i>See </i><i>Berkemer v. McCarty,</i> 468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975. The \"ultimate inquiry\" is whether there was a \"restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\" <i>United States v. Trueber,</i> 238 F.3d 79, 93 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Thompson v. Keohane,</i> 516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995)).</p>\n<p>Hallmark factors such as physical restraint or a show of force may be suggestive, but in certain circumstances such factors may be perfectly consistent with an investigatory stop. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Quinn,</i> 815 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Kapperman,</i> 764 F.2d 786, 790 n. 4 (11th Cir.1985) (stating that \"neither handcuffing nor other restraints will <i>automatically</i> convert a <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest\"). There is no per-se rule.</p>\n<p>For present purposes, we must take the plaintiff's account as true. On that version, Webster restrained her by the use of main force (forcibly halting her progress and pinning her against a wall for a period of three to four minutes). He told her that she was not going anywhere. He then escorted her from the public hallway into a hotel room where other officers were assembled. He proceeded to interrogate her.</p>\n<p>None of these actions, in isolation, necessarily would have converted the initial <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Campa,</i> 234 F.3d 733, 738-39 (1st Cir.2000) (directing suspects to move from hallway to kitchen did not convert a <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 976-77 (holding that physical touching did not work such a conversion); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> <i>United States v. Perdue,</i> 8 F.3d 1455, 1463 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that immobilization does not automatically work such a conversion). Moreover, there are other indicators that counsel against a finding that a de facto arrest occurred. For example, the plaintiff admits that, once they had repaired to room 203, Webster stated that he was not arresting her.</p>\n<p>Yet, at this stage of the litigation, we must take the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <i>Cordi-Allen,</i> 494 F.3d at 248. From that coign of vantage, we think that a rational jury could conclude that the combination of events that transpired  the aggressive physical touching, the relatively lengthy immobilization, the removal of the plaintiff from a public hallway to a private room, the command not to leave, and the ensuing interrogation in a small room populated by multiple police officers  would have sufficed to lead a reasonable person in the plaintiff's place and stead to believe that Webster had imposed restraints on her freedom of movement tantamount to those implicated in a formal arrest. <i>See </i><i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Acosta-Colón,</i> 157 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir.1998) (stopping, handcuffing, and moving suspect to detention room constitute a de facto arrest).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the issue of justification. Because a reasonable jury could find a de facto arrest, Webster's actions would be justified only if he acted on probable cause.</p>\n<p>Proof of probable cause is not to be confused with the more onerous standard of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d 548, 555-56 (1st Cir.1999). Rather, probable cause exists when an officer, acting upon apparently trustworthy information, reasonably can conclude that a crime has been or is about to be committed and that the suspect is implicated in its commission. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 500 F.3d 48, 56 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Figueroa,</i> 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>The district court discerned probable cause based on the plaintiff's \"connections to prostitution, theft of the police department's money, and [disobedience of] a police command to stop in the public corridor of a hotel.\" <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53. In this regard, the court seems to have been impressed that the plaintiff \"admitted to making physical contact\" with Webster as she tried to bypass him in the hallway. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We are hesitant to endorse the district court's assessment as a whole. For one thing, while a belief that the plaintiff was connected to prostitution might have added marginally to the justification for a <i>Terry</i> stop, that belief had no bearing on any crime that conceivably could have been committed on the day in question. It cannot, therefore, undergird a probable cause determination. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 500 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p>By the same token, the plaintiff's attempt to walk past Webster might have given Webster the right to use a modicum of force to effectuate a stop. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Isom v. Town of Warren,</i> 360 F.3d 7, 10-11 (1st Cir.2004). But the plaintiff consistently has described the initial contact between her and Webster as amounting to \"brushing against him\" as they passed in the hallway. As described, that conduct was neither a crime nor evidence of a crime. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>State v. Worrey,</i> 322 A.2d 73, 80 (Me. 1974) (defining criminal assault).</p>\n<p>We nonetheless agree with the district court's bottom-line conclusion. On the undisputed facts, Webster did have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> knowledge of a likely crime  the apparent theft of $20 in police money. Webster had been in the observation room during the plaintiff's interaction with McVane and knew that she had taken a $20 bill from the pile of police money. As the district court correctly explained, theft is a crime under Maine law, for which an observing officer is empowered to make a warrantless arrest. <i>See </i><i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53 (citing Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A §§ 15(2), 353(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>The plaintiff strives to blunt the force of this conclusion in two ways. We examine each of these initiatives.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiff posits that Webster knew she had returned the money before he detained her. Building on this foundation, she contends that, by returning the money, she never possessed unauthorized control of it and, in the bargain, manifested that she lacked the requisite intent for the crime of theft.</p>\n<p>This gambit is unavailing. Even if the plaintiff returned the funds, she did not wipe the slate clean. Theft under Maine law comprises two elements: (i) obtaining unauthorized control over another's property (ii) with intent to deprive that person of it. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A). Here, the putative crime was completed (or so the officer reasonably could have thought) as soon as the plaintiff took the money. It could not be erased by its perpetrator's subsequent return of the funds. It is, after all, hornbook law that unauthorized control can be evinced by moving property even a slight distance in the presence of the owner. <i>See</i> Wayne R. LaFave, <i>Substantive Criminal Law</i> § 19.3(b) (2003). By like token, an intent to deprive only need exist at the moment of taking. <i>See id.</i> § 19.5(f). Whatever a jury ultimately might find under a reasonable doubt instruction, Webster had probable cause to think that the requisite intent existed. <i>See supra</i> note 3.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's second argument is no more robust. She maintains that after returning her to room 203 Webster stated: \"I'm not arresting you, I can't arrest you.\" Even were we to read this comment favorably to the plaintiff, as an admission by Webster that he felt that he lacked probable cause, our inquiry would not end. The test for the existence vel non of probable cause \"is objective in nature.\" <i>Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31; <i>see </i><i>Whren v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 806, 812, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Webster's subjective belief is, therefore, not determinative of the probable cause issue.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. For the reasons discussed, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the unlawful detention claim (and, thus, on the mirror-image supplemental claim as well).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. EXCESSIVE FORCE</h2>\n<p>We turn next to the excessive force claim. The district court analyzed this claim under the rubric of qualified immunity. It concluded that the plaintiff had made out a colorable claim of a violation of a clearly defined constitutional right, but that a reasonable public official in Webster's position reasonably could have believed that the force used to detain the plaintiff was appropriate. <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 56-57. We disagree with the last step in this progression.</p>\n<p>We begin with bedrock. As we already have said, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), the qualified immunity inquiry is threefold. An inquiring court must determine (i) whether the plaintiff has asserted a cognizable violation of a constitutional right; (ii) whether that right was clearly established at the relevant time; and (iii) whether a reasonable public official in the defendant's position <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> should have understood that his actions infringed that right. <i>See </i><i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 31; <i>Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 44. We apply this template to the facts at hand and, because the case was terminated at the summary judgment stage, we take as true the plaintiff's account of the relevant events.</p>\n<p>The first branch of the qualified immunity test is satisfied here. To establish a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant employed force that was unreasonable under all the circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989); <i>Asociación de Periodistas de P.R. v. Mueller,</i> 529 F.3d 52, 59 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In addressing this question, we do not write on a pristine page. The Supreme Court has furnished a non-exclusive list of criteria for determining the objective reasonableness of a police officer's use of force. These criteria include \"the severity of the crime at issue,\" the extent (if any) to which \"the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others;\" and whether the suspect \"is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865.</p>\n<p>When the facts in this case are marshaled in the light most hospitable to the plaintiff, these criteria cut sharply in her direction. If a crime was committed at all, it was a Class E crime (the lowest level of criminality recognized under Maine law). <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A); <i>see also id.</i> §§ 4, 4-A. Despite the district court's contrary assertion, <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 56-57, there is no evidence cognizable under the summary judgment standard indicating that the plaintiff posed a threat to the safety of the officers or others.<sup>[4]</sup> And, finally, on the plaintiff's account, there is no evidence of any meaningful degree of resistance. A jury might also choose to infer that the defendant, frustrated at the looming failure of the sting operation and the prospect of the plaintiff avoiding arrest, lost his temper and intentionally used more force than the situation warranted.</p>\n<p>To say more about this element of the test would be to paint the lily. We conclude, without serious question, that a rational jury could find that the force used by Webster to detain an unresisting woman who, at worst, was suspected of being a petty thief, was so disproportionate as to offend the Fourth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Alexis v. McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc.,</i> 67 F.3d 341, 353 (1st Cir.1995) (collecting cases in which force used to arrest was unreasonable in light of minor nature of crime).</p>\n<p>The second branch of the test is also satisfied. A clearly established right is one sufficiently defined at a level of specificity that would put a state actor (such as a police officer) on fair notice that his specific actions offended the Constitution. <i>See </i><i>Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 46. Our case law supplies a crystal clear articulation of the right, grounded in the Fourth Amendment, to be free from the use of excessive force by an arresting officer. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Alexis,</i> 67 F.3d at 353-54 (concluding excessive force claim triable when officer seized and dragged plaintiff to effectuate arrest for crime of trespassing in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> a public restaurant). Given this well-settled jurisprudence, there is no legitimate doubt that the right asserted here was clearly established. Thus, Webster was on notice that a police officer's use of excessive force would be offensive to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The question, then, reduces to whether Webster's use of excessive force constituted the type and kind of erroneous judgment that a reasonable police officer under the same or similar circumstances might have made. <i>See </i><i>Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,</i> 151 F.3d 1, 14-15 (1st Cir.1998). We think not.</p>\n<p>This inquiry is a complicated one. By definition, excessive force is unreasonable force. <i>See </i><i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 394, 109 S.Ct. 1865. But reasonable people sometimes make mistaken judgments, and a reasonable officer sometimes may use unreasonable force. In that event, qualified immunity gives an officer the benefit of a margin of error. <i>See </i><i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 205-06, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (explaining that qualified immunity operates in excessive force cases to \"protect officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> 499 F.3d 2, 18 (1st Cir.2007) (observing that, in effect, \"officers receive protection if they acted reasonably in exercising unreasonable force.\"). Thus, defeating a qualified immunity defense requires a showing of an incremental degree of error  an incommensurate use of force beyond that needed to establish a garden-variety excessive force claim and, further, beyond the \"hazy border\" noted by the <i>Saucier</i> Court, 533 U.S. at 206, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p>Looked at another way, qualified immunity is appropriate in an excessive force case when an officer \"correctly perceive[s] all of the relevant facts but [has] a mistaken understanding\" as to the legality of his chosen level of force. <i>Id.</i> at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Conversely, qualified immunity protection would not be available when the level of force chosen by the officer cannot in any way, shape, or form be justified under those facts.</p>\n<p>These principles necessitate a case-specific approach. Many cases will defy easy classification. This case, however, does not present a borderline situation; and we think that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to avert the entry of summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>As will almost always be true, this determination is based on a matter of degree. Here, the facts, seen through the prism of the plaintiff's account, simply do not justify yanking the arm of an unarmed and non-violent person, suspected only of the theft of $20, and pinning her against a wall for three to four minutes with sufficient force to tear her rotator cuff. That is particularly so in view of the marked disparity in height and weight between the officer and the suspect, the absence of any evidence of either dangerousness or attempted flight, and the presence of a cadre of other officers at the scene. In short, the plaintiff's version of the relevant facts places Webster's actions outside the universe of protected mistakes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vondrak v. City of Las Cruces,</i> 535 F.3d 1198, 1209-10 (10th Cir.2008); <i>Jones v. Parmley,</i> 465 F.3d 46, 63 (2d Cir.2006); <i>Smoak v. Hall,</i> 460 F.3d 768, 784 (6th Cir.2006); <i>Kukla v. Hulm,</i> 310 F.3d 1046, 1050 (8th Cir.2002); <i>DeGraff v. Dist. of Columbia,</i> 120 F.3d 298, 302 (D.C.Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p>The district court stressed that a reasonable officer, believing that the plaintiff committed a theft, would have thought it lawful to use some force to detain her. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 57. That is true as far as it goes. <i>Cf. </i><i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (noting that the right to make an arrest carries with it the right to use some force). But the district court's further conclusion that the plaintiff's actions justified Webster in believing that a significant degree of force could be used, <i>see </i><i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 56-57, cannot be squared with the summary judgment standard. While the officers' accounts of the facts may justify the district court's appraisal, the court was bound to ask not whether those accounts were plausible but, rather, whether under the plaintiff's version of the facts a reasonable officer should have known that the degree of force used was plainly excessive. <i>See </i><i>Griffith v. Coburn,</i> 473 F.3d 650, 656-57 (6th Cir.2007) (\"Because determining reasonableness in [the excessive force] context is such a fact-intensive endeavor summary judgment is improper if the legal question of immunity turns on which version of the facts is accepted.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 12.</p>\n<p>To be sure, incidental contact  say, a \"gratuitously violent shove\"  may be within the realm of conduct protected by qualified immunity. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 208, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Here, however, Webster's conduct, as described by the plaintiff, eclipsed the bounds of reasonableness. Given the importance of reasonableness to the qualified immunity calculus in excessive force cases, the existence of such immunity frequently will hinge on the resolution of disputed facts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jennings,</i> 499 F.3d at 18-20. So it is here.</p>\n<p>In sum, we conclude that the plaintiff not only has made out a trialworthy issue as to whether Webster's use of a significant degree of force transgressed her Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force but also that she has made a showing adequate to thwart a qualified immunity defense. <i>See </i><i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 7. Because a rational jury could find, on this scumbled record, facts establishing that Webster's use of force was so objectively unreasonable and so plainly misguided that he should not be protected by the shield of qualified immunity, the district court erred in resolving this claim in advance of trial. <i>See id.; </i><i>Alexis,</i> 67 F.3d at 352-53.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. We understand that the plaintiff's version of the relevant events is hotly contested, and we make no judgment as to where the truth lies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Greenburg,</i> 835 F.2d at 936 (discussing operation of summary judgment standard).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the unlawful detention claim and the mirror-image supplemental claim, reverse the grant of summary judgment on the excessive force claim and the mirror-image supplemental claim, and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, reversed part, and remanded. No costs.</i></p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>With respect, I write separately in this case. While I concur in the majority's decision that the grant of summary judgment on the excessive force claim should be reversed, I also have serious doubt about the basis on which the majority decides the first question, whether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion and probable cause.</p>\n<p>The basic facts of this case are that a woman, who one officer identified as a known prostitute, did not engage in an act <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> of prostitution. The sting failed because either, on the most friendly view, she didn't intend to engage in prostitution, or on a less friendly view, she smelled a rat and chose not to continue with the proposed encounter.</p>\n<p>When the plaintiff took the $20, she explained to the officer in the room that she was taking it as compensation for her expenditure of time and gas. The evidence is uncontroverted that the officer did not protest, a fact apparently known to the defendant. The parties do not agree as to where the defendant was when the money was returned, but at summary judgment we must accept the plaintiff's claim that the defendant was one of the first officers in the hallway. Thus it would be reasonable to infer that he was aware that the plaintiff had returned the money.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff was a fifty-three-year-old woman, small in stature, about 5' 3\" tall and weighing 120 pounds, while the defendant was physically fit and stood nearly a foot taller. The facts around the stop are in dispute and a jury could well find that the real reason for the stop was that the defendant officer was upset that the sting had failed. While the fact of the taking of the $20 was perhaps sufficient for a brief Terry stop, in my view everything that occurred thereafter was improper. It is interesting to note that no other law enforcement person present took part in the events that led to this lawsuit. A reasonable jury might well decide that the defendant officer's actions, which caused serious injury to the plaintiff, were not animated by the taking of the $20 from the bureau but rather were an overblown reaction to the failed sting.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We adhere to this approach. Although we analyze the issues in terms of the federal claims, our reasoning applies with undiminished force to the supplemental claims.</p>\n<p>[2]  We previously noted that the Supreme Court has never clearly indicated whether the judge or the jury is the proper factfinder when a case is actually tried and a factual dispute underlies a proffered qualified immunity defense. <i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 7 n. 2. We have, however, expressed some doubt that \"the Supreme Court intended this [factual] dispute to be resolved from the bench by fiat.\" <i>Id.; see </i><i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> 499 F.3d 2, 10 (1st Cir.2007) (requiring, on particular facts, that a judge's post-verdict qualified immunity ruling be consistent with the jury verdict).</p>\n<p>[3]  One might argue that Webster should have understood that the plaintiff's statement that she was entitled to the money, coupled with the absence of an immediate protest by McVane, indicated acquiescence. But apart from the fact that the plaintiff has not pressed this point, the circumstances simply are not clear-cut enough either to compel a conclusion that silence equalled acquiescence or to preclude a reasonable belief that a crime was being committed. <i>See generally </i><i>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</i> 469 U.S. 325, 346, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (explaining that \"the requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a requirement of absolute certainty: sufficient probability, not certainty, is the touchstone of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[4]  Of course, there was evidence that the plaintiff was holding her right arm stiffly, but she plausibly attributed this gesture to the need to provide support for the heavy coat that was draped over it. We do not think that this is sufficient, standing alone, to justify the use of a significant level of force. <i>Cf. </i><i>Parker v. Gerrish,</i> 547 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2008) (finding de minimis resistance to arrest insufficient to justify force used).</p>\n\n</div>",

That suit, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, included claims of unlawful detention and use of excessive force. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant (a police officer). <i>See </i><i>Morelli v.

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Because this is an appeal from the entry of summary judgment, we take the facts in the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, the plaintiff). <i>See </i><i>Cordi-Allen v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (2007). Our narrative draws heavily upon the plaintiff's filings under D. Me. R. 7.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-appellant Rosanna Morelli, an exotic dancer, hired out for private parties. Though self-employed, she occasionally accepted engagements through Serena's Heaven on Earth, a purveyor of adult entertainment services in Portland, Maine.</p>\n<p>On March 3, 2006, the plaintiff, using the nom de guerre \"Vanessa,\" responded to a call placed to a number advertised by Serena's. She and the caller agreed on a price for an exotic dance to be performed in room 203 of the Best Western hotel in South Portland. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, the caller was an undercover police officer named McVane, and the call was part of a prostitution sting operation orchestrated by the local constabulary.</p>\n<p>The site of the proposed performance  room 203  had been outfitted with audio and video surveillance equipment. The output was to be transmitted surreptitiously to a so-called \"observation room\" next door. A local prosecutor and several police officers had congregated in the observation room (among them, defendant-appellee Steven Webster).</p>\n<p>McVane met the plaintiff at the door to room 203. Upon entering the room, the plaintiff hugged McVane. At that point, one of the policemen in the observation room (Officer Farris) recognized the plaintiff and exclaimed that she was a known prostitute.</p>\n<p>Because McVane was nervous and acting strangely, the plaintiff soon began to suspect that something was amiss. She nonetheless placed her heavy coat on the bed and requested the agreed fee. McVane placed several bills on a counter but the plaintiff did not touch them.</p>\n<p>In response to McVane's repeated urgings that she disrobe, the plaintiff informed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> him that she was only there to dance. When McVane persisted, she sarcastically suggested that he remove his clothes. Finally she started to shed her jeans. At about that time, however, she became convinced that McVane was not a bona fide customer, was probably associated with law enforcement, and was wasting her time. She pulled up her jeans, told McVane that she was leaving, and informed him that she was taking $20 to cover transportation and wasted time. She grabbed a bill in that denomination from the pile of currency on the counter and took her leave.</p>\n<p>In the corridor the plaintiff encountered several officers, including Webster. When one of them accused her of having stolen money; she surrendered the $20 bill. She then moved toward the exit, looking straight ahead and proceeding slowly. Her coat was draped over her right arm, and she kept that arm stiff.</p>\n<p>Webster stands about a foot taller than the plaintiff  he is 6'2\" and in good physical shape  and substantially outweighs her. Although clad in civilian clothing, he prominently displayed a badge on his belt.</p>\n<p>Among the cohort of policemen, only Webster attempted to stop the plaintiff from leaving the hotel. He deliberately positioned himself to block her path. As the plaintiff tells it, she tried to walk around him and brushed against him as she passed. Webster reacted angrily, grabbing her wrist, yanking her around, slamming her against the hallway wall, pinning her there by her forearms, and saying \"look missy, you're not going anywhere, you need to go back into the room.\" Webster held the plaintiff against the wall for a full three or four minutes before guiding her back to room 203.</p>\n<p>Once there, Webster told the plaintiff that he could not arrest her. Nevertheless, he forced her to remain in the room while he questioned her. Two other officers were present during this interrogation. The plaintiff complained that she was in pain and, after several minutes, Webster told the plaintiff that she could leave as long as she did so \"respectfully.\" The plaintiff found this admonition \"condescendingly odd.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff returned home. She immediately called the police department to report the incident. Later, she visited the emergency room of a local hospital. She was told that she had sustained contusions and a first-degree shoulder separation. An orthopedic surgeon treated her for some time and, eventually, more sophisticated testing revealed evidence of a rotator cuff tear. She continues to experience pain in her shoulder, arm, and lower back.</p>\n<p>Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiff sued Webster in Maine's federal district court. She claimed that Webster's actions constituted an unreasonable seizure of her person because they amounted to a detention without adequate justification, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Romain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201394\"><a href=\"/opinion/201394/united-states-v-romain/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 70-71 (1st Cir.2004), and because he effected that detention through the use of excessive force, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Calvi v. Knox County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202546\"><a href=\"/opinion/202546/calvi-v-knox-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 428 (1st Cir.2006). The plaintiff's complaint also included supplemental claims under Maine law, which mirrored her federal claims.</p>\n<p>Upon the completion of discovery, Webster moved for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts justified the detention and made pellucid that the force he had applied was not excessive. In the alternative, he argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>The district court granted this motion, holding that the undisputed facts established that Webster had adequate justification to seize the plaintiff regardless of whether that seizure amounted to an investigatory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> stop or a de facto arrest. <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53. In explaining this holding, the court employed the pooled knowledge doctrine to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by his compatriots and determined that the seizure amounted to a temporary detention, prompted by reasonable suspicion. <i>Id.</i> at 52-53. The court added that even if the seizure amounted to a de facto arrest, it was justified by probable cause. <i>See id.</i> (citing Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A)). In all events, the court posited that Webster would be entitled to qualified immunity because \"a reasonable official would have believed that criminal activity, prostitution, was afoot, that Maine law permitted him to arrest Plaintiff and that he had probable cause to believe that Plaintiff had committed or was in the process of committing a crime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 53 n. 9.</p>\n<p>With respect to the excessive force claim, the lower court relied entirely on qualified immunity. It concluded that a reasonable officer in Webster's situation could well have believed that the plaintiff had committed theft, was connected to prostitution, posed a threat to those around her, and was actively evading detention. <i>Id.</i> at 56-57. Thus, the force used by Webster was of a degree that a reasonable officer could have believed was appropriate under the circumstances. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Along the way, the district court noted that the resolution of the federal claims would dictate the outcome of the mirrorimage supplemental claims. <i>Id.</i> at 51. The latter claims had been asserted under Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5 § 4682, a statute patterned on 42 U.S.C. § 1983. <i>See </i><i>Jenness v. Nickerson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></span>, 1158 (Me.1994). Thus, there was no need for a separate analysis.<sup>[1]</sup> With this reasoning in mind, the district court entered an adverse judgment on all of the plaintiff's claims. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</h2>\n<p>Before addressing the assignments of error, we pause to discuss three sets of legal principles, each of which to some extent informs our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Pooled Knowledge.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The pooled knowledge doctrine, sometimes known as the collective knowledge doctrine, is a mechanism that in some circumstances allows a court to \"impute\" facts known by one police officer to another police officer engaged in a joint mission. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Meade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 193 (1st Cir.1997). The doctrine derives from a felt sense that officers acting in concert actually do, and are entitled to, assume that fellow officers are acting in a manner consistent with their legal responsibilities. <i>See </i><i>Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Pen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108297\"><a href=\"/opinion/108297/whiteley-v-warden-wyo-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108297\"><a href=\"/opinion/108297/whiteley-v-warden-wyo-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108297\"><a href=\"/opinion/108297/whiteley-v-warden-wyo-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span> (1971); <i>see generally</i> Wayne R. LaFave, <i>Search and Seizure</i> § 3.5 (2004). Thus, for example, when an officer who has probable cause \"directs an officer who lacks that knowledge to make the arrest, we `impute' to the arresting officer the directing officer's knowledge.\" <i>Meade,</i> 110 F.3d at 193; <i>see </i><i>United States v. Cook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776186\"><a href=\"/opinion/776186/united-states-v-donald-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Burns v. Loranger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544226\"><a href=\"/opinion/544226/karen-burns-v-david-loranger/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 236 n. 7 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the district court invoked the pooled knowledge doctrine on two different points. First, the court used it to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by a fellow officer, Farris, to the effect that the plaintiff was a known prostitute. <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 48 n. 2. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> Second, the court used it to credit Webster with knowledge possessed by McVane to the effect that the plaintiff had taken a $20 bill from the counter in room 203. <i>Id.</i> at 52-53.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff argues with considerable force that these are improper applications of the pooled knowledge doctrine. For the reasons explained below, we need not enter this thicket.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's version of events places Webster in the observation room when she arrived in room 203. Under that version, Webster must have heard Farris announce that he believed the plaintiff to be a known prostitute. Thus, the pooled knowledge doctrine added nothing to Webster's store of reputational information.</p>\n<p>As to the theft, the plaintiff herself admits that she took the $20 bill. And on her account, Webster watched her actions from the observation room and did not enter the hallway until after she left room 203. It follows that Webster must have seen her take the money and, accordingly, the pooled knowledge doctrine is of no consequence on this point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Standard of Review.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We afford de novo review to a district court's grant of summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. Para La Diofusión Pública,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202880\"><a href=\"/opinion/202880/davila-v-corporacion-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record reflects no genuine issue as to any material fact and indicates that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See id.; see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In a case in which the parties offer diametrically opposite versions of the facts, each founded on first-hand knowledge, we must ask whether the account propounded by the nonmovant suffices to thwart the swing of the summary judgment ax. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Scott,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1775.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Qualified Immunity.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>This case differs from a garden-variety summary judgment case because it involves the doctrine of qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is a judicial gloss designed to allow public officials to perform discretionary tasks without the constant threat of legal liability. <i>See </i><i>Pagán v. Calderón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202216\"><a href=\"/opinion/202216/pagan-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2006). As the Supreme Court has explained, the doctrine is intended to protect \"all but the plainly incompetent [and] those who knowingly violate the law.\" <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 341, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (1986).</p>\n<p>Determining the applicability of the qualified immunity doctrine in a given case requires a three-step inquiry. Operating within that framework, an inquiring court must consider (i) whether the plaintiff's proffered version of the facts, if true, makes out a violation of a constitutionally protected right; (ii) if so, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the putative violation; and (iii) if the answers to the preceding two queries are affirmative, whether a reasonable public official, situated similarly to the defendant, should have understood the challenged act or omission to violate the discerned right. <i>See </i><i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 31; <i>Limone v. Condon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201063\"><a href=\"/opinion/201063/limone-v-condon/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The doctrinal intersection of qualified immunity principles and summary judgment principles is not well mapped. Plotting that intersection can present thorny analytic problems  problems that are magnified because of the desire to resolve claims of qualified immunity at the earliest practicable stage of litigation. <i>See </i><i>Cox v. Hainey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201366\"><a href=\"/opinion/201366/cox-v-maine-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The difficulty arises because the summary judgment standard requires absolute deference to the nonmovant's factual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> assertions (as long as those assertions are put forward on personal knowledge or otherwise documented by materials of evidentiary quality, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Greenburg v. P.R. Marit. Shipping Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499045\"><a href=\"/opinion/499045/laurence-b-greenburg-etc-v-puerto-rico-maritime-shipping-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 936 (1st Cir.1987)), whereas qualified immunity, when raised on summary judgment, demands deference to the reasonable, if mistaken, actions of the movant, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31. In order to ease this inherent tension, we think it wise for courts to cabin these standards and keep them logically distinct, first identifying the version of events that best comports with the summary judgment standard and then asking whether, given that set of facts, a reasonable officer should have known that his actions were unlawful. <i>See </i><i>Wilson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201791\"><a href=\"/opinion/201791/wilson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 53 n. 10 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that genuine disputes anent material facts must be resolved at trial even though qualified immunity is a question of law for the judge); <i>Kelley v. LaForce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777426\"><a href=\"/opinion/777426/michael-k-kelley-and-lenore-t-kelley-v-joseph-w-laforce-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that disputes as to material facts sometimes will preclude summary judgment based on qualified immunity). We proceed in that vein.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. UNLAWFUL DETENTION</h2>\n<p>We begin our journey through the plaintiff's asseverational array with her claim that Webster's actions constituted an unlawful detention. The background principles are familiar.</p>\n<p>A detention at the hands of a police officer constitutes a seizure of the detainee's person and, thus, must be adequately justified under the Fourth Amendment. <i>Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 70-71. The case law recognizes two classes of seizures falling along this continuum: arrests (whether actual or de facto) and temporary detentions (such as investigatory stops). The justification needed for these two types of seizures is qualitatively different: an arrest must be grounded on a showing of probable cause, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Carroll v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403438/carroll-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span>, 156, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></span> (1925), whereas a temporary detention may be grounded on a lesser showing equivalent to reasonable suspicion, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Zapata,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>In this case, the district court declined to locate Webster's actions along this continuum. Rather, it declared those actions justified under either scenario. <i>See </i><i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53. We examine this conclusion.</p>\n<p>The line between temporary detentions and de facto arrests is often blurred. To complicate matters, that line can shift in the course of a single encounter so that what starts out as an investigatory stop may morph into a de facto arrest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200295\"><a href=\"/opinion/200295/united-states-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2003). It follows that an inquiring court must determine whether a police officer's initial action was justified and, if so, whether subsequent (more coercive) actions undertaken by the officer were justified by developing circumstances. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sowers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197788\"><a href=\"/opinion/197788/united-states-v-sowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>In this instance, we can say with assurance that the facts known to Webster warranted an investigatory stop. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> Such a temporary detention, known colloquially as a <i>Terry</i> stop, <i>see </i><i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1868</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span> (1968), requires only articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a suspect may be involved in criminal activity. <i>United States v. Ruidíaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203330\"><a href=\"/opinion/203330/united-states-v-ruidiaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2008). It is undisputed that the facts known to Webster at the inception of the encounter included, among other things, that the plaintiff had taken money from McVane before leaving room 203.<sup>[3]</sup> That fact gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff had committed an act of theft. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A). In turn, that suspicion justified a temporary detention in order to investigate the possible commission of that crime. <i>See </i><i>Ruidíaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 28; <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975.</p>\n<p>But giving credence to the plaintiff's version of events (as the summary judgment standard requires), it is at least arguable that the character of the stop changed in mid-stream. Although there are no scientifically precise benchmarks for distinguishing between temporary detentions and de facto arrests, the standard mode of inquiry is to assess the totality of the circumstances and ask whether a reasonable person in the suspect's shoes would understand herself to be subject to restraints comparable to those associated with an arrest. <i>See </i><i>Berkemer v. McCarty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111249\"><a href=\"/opinion/111249/berkemer-v-mccarty/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span> (1984); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975. The \"ultimate inquiry\" is whether there was a \"restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\" <i>United States v. Trueber,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199253\"><a href=\"/opinion/199253/united-states-v-trueber/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>Thompson v.

Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198228\"><a href=\"/opinion/198228/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v.

There is no per-se rule.</p>\n<p>For present purposes, we must take the plaintiff's account as true. On that version, Webster restrained her by the use of main force (forcibly halting her progress and pinning her against a wall for a period of three to four minutes). He told her that she was not going anywhere. He then escorted her from the public hallway into a hotel room where other officers were assembled. He proceeded to interrogate her.</p>\n<p>None of these actions, in isolation, necessarily would have converted the initial <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Campa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199185\"><a href=\"/opinion/199185/united-states-v-campa/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 738-39 (1st Cir.2000) (directing suspects to move from hallway to kitchen did not convert a <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 976-77 (holding that physical touching did not work such a conversion); <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> <i>United States v.

Moreover, there are other indicators that counsel against a finding that a de facto arrest occurred. For example, the plaintiff admits that, once they had repaired to room 203, Webster stated that he was not arresting her.</p>\n<p>Yet, at this stage of the litigation, we must take the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <i>Cordi-Allen,</i> 494 F.3d at 248. From that coign of vantage, we think that a rational jury could conclude that the combination of events that transpired  the aggressive physical touching, the relatively lengthy immobilization, the removal of the plaintiff from a public hallway to a private room, the command not to leave, and the ensuing interrogation in a small room populated by multiple police officers  would have sufficed to lead a reasonable person in the plaintiff's place and stead to believe that Webster had imposed restraints on her freedom of movement tantamount to those implicated in a formal arrest. <i>See </i><i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Acosta-Colón,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198134\"><a href=\"/opinion/198134/united-states-v-acosta-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1998) (stopping, handcuffing, and moving suspect to detention room constitute a de facto arrest).</p>\n<p>This brings us to the issue of justification. Because a reasonable jury could find a de facto arrest, Webster's actions would be justified only if he acted on probable cause.</p>\n<p>Proof of probable cause is not to be confused with the more onerous standard of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Winchenbach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198727\"><a href=\"/opinion/198727/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 555-56 (1st Cir.1999). Rather, probable cause exists when an officer, acting upon apparently trustworthy information, reasonably can conclude that a crime has been or is about to be committed and that the suspect is implicated in its commission. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202905\"><a href=\"/opinion/202905/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Figueroa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488520\"><a href=\"/opinion/488520/united-states-v-raul-casiano-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1023 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n<p>The district court discerned probable cause based on the plaintiff's \"connections to prostitution, theft of the police department's money, and [disobedience of] a police command to stop in the public corridor of a hotel.\" <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53. In this regard, the court seems to have been impressed that the plaintiff \"admitted to making physical contact\" with Webster as she tried to bypass him in the hallway. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We are hesitant to endorse the district court's assessment as a whole. For one thing, while a belief that the plaintiff was connected to prostitution might have added marginally to the justification for a <i>Terry</i> stop, that belief had no bearing on any crime that conceivably could have been committed on the day in question. It cannot, therefore, undergird a probable cause determination. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 500 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p>By the same token, the plaintiff's attempt to walk past Webster might have given Webster the right to use a modicum of force to effectuate a stop. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Isom v. Town of Warren,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200876\"><a href=\"/opinion/200876/isom-v-town-of-warren/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10-11 (1st Cir.2004). But the plaintiff consistently has described the initial contact between her and Webster as amounting to \"brushing against him\" as they passed in the hallway. As described, that conduct was neither a crime nor evidence of a crime. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>State v. Worrey,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span>, 80 (Me. 1974) (defining criminal assault).</p>\n<p>We nonetheless agree with the district court's bottom-line conclusion. On the undisputed facts, Webster did have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> knowledge of a likely crime  the apparent theft of $20 in police money. Webster had been in the observation room during the plaintiff's interaction with McVane and knew that she had taken a $20 bill from the pile of police money. As the district court correctly explained, theft is a crime under Maine law, for which an observing officer is empowered to make a warrantless arrest. <i>See </i><i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 53 (citing Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A §§ 15(2), 353(1)(A)).</p>\n<p>The plaintiff strives to blunt the force of this conclusion in two ways. We examine each of these initiatives.</p>\n<p>First, the plaintiff posits that Webster knew she had returned the money before he detained her. Building on this foundation, she contends that, by returning the money, she never possessed unauthorized control of it and, in the bargain, manifested that she lacked the requisite intent for the crime of theft.</p>\n<p>This gambit is unavailing. Even if the plaintiff returned the funds, she did not wipe the slate clean. Theft under Maine law comprises two elements: (i) obtaining unauthorized control over another's property (ii) with intent to deprive that person of it. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A). Here, the putative crime was completed (or so the officer reasonably could have thought) as soon as the plaintiff took the money. It could not be erased by its perpetrator's subsequent return of the funds. It is, after all, hornbook law that unauthorized control can be evinced by moving property even a slight distance in the presence of the owner. <i>See</i> Wayne R. LaFave, <i>Substantive Criminal Law</i> § 19.3(b) (2003). By like token, an intent to deprive only need exist at the moment of taking. <i>See id.</i> § 19.5(f). Whatever a jury ultimately might find under a reasonable doubt instruction, Webster had probable cause to think that the requisite intent existed. <i>See supra</i> note 3.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff's second argument is no more robust. She maintains that after returning her to room 203 Webster stated: \"I'm not arresting you, I can't arrest you.\" Even were we to read this comment favorably to the plaintiff, as an admission by Webster that he felt that he lacked probable cause, our inquiry would not end. The test for the existence vel non of probable cause \"is objective in nature.\" <i>Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31; <i>see </i><i>Whren v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 812, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118036\"><a href=\"/opinion/118036/whren-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (1996). Webster's subjective belief is, therefore, not determinative of the probable cause issue.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. For the reasons discussed, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the unlawful detention claim (and, thus, on the mirror-image supplemental claim as well).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. EXCESSIVE FORCE</h2>\n<p>We turn next to the excessive force claim. The district court analyzed this claim under the rubric of qualified immunity. It concluded that the plaintiff had made out a colorable claim of a violation of a clearly defined constitutional right, but that a reasonable public official in Webster's position reasonably could have believed that the force used to detain the plaintiff was appropriate. <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 56-57. We disagree with the last step in this progression.</p>\n<p>We begin with bedrock. As we already have said, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), the qualified immunity inquiry is threefold. An inquiring court must determine (i) whether the plaintiff has asserted a cognizable violation of a constitutional right; (ii) whether that right was clearly established at the relevant time; and (iii) whether a reasonable public official in the defendant's position <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> should have understood that his actions infringed that right. <i>See </i><i>Pagán,</i> 448 F.3d at 31; <i>Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 44. We apply this template to the facts at hand and, because the case was terminated at the summary judgment stage, we take as true the plaintiff's account of the relevant events.</p>\n<p>The first branch of the qualified immunity test is satisfied here. To establish a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant employed force that was unreasonable under all the circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Graham v. Connor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1865</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span> (1989); <i>Asociación de Periodistas de P.R. v. Mueller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203339\"><a href=\"/opinion/203339/asociacion-de-periodistas-de-pr-v-mueller/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>In addressing this question, we do not write on a pristine page. The Supreme Court has furnished a non-exclusive list of criteria for determining the objective reasonableness of a police officer's use of force. These criteria include \"the severity of the crime at issue,\" the extent (if any) to which \"the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others;\" and whether the suspect \"is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\" <i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1865</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>When the facts in this case are marshaled in the light most hospitable to the plaintiff, these criteria cut sharply in her direction. If a crime was committed at all, it was a Class E crime (the lowest level of criminality recognized under Maine law). <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A § 353(1)(A); <i>see also id.</i> §§ 4, 4-A. Despite the district court's contrary assertion, <i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 56-57, there is no evidence cognizable under the summary judgment standard indicating that the plaintiff posed a threat to the safety of the officers or others.<sup>[4]</sup> And, finally, on the plaintiff's account, there is no evidence of any meaningful degree of resistance. A jury might also choose to infer that the defendant, frustrated at the looming failure of the sting operation and the prospect of the plaintiff avoiding arrest, lost his temper and intentionally used more force than the situation warranted.</p>\n<p>To say more about this element of the test would be to paint the lily. We conclude, without serious question, that a rational jury could find that the force used by Webster to detain an unresisting woman who, at worst, was suspected of being a petty thief, was so disproportionate as to offend the Fourth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Alexis v. McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196337\"><a href=\"/opinion/196337/alexis-v-mcdonalds-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 353 (1st Cir.1995) (collecting cases in which force used to arrest was unreasonable in light of minor nature of crime).</p>\n<p>The second branch of the test is also satisfied. A clearly established right is one sufficiently defined at a level of specificity that would put a state actor (such as a police officer) on fair notice that his specific actions offended the Constitution. <i>See </i><i>Limone,</i> 372 F.3d at 46. Our case law supplies a crystal clear articulation of the right, grounded in the Fourth Amendment, to be free from the use of excessive force by an arresting officer. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Alexis,</i> 67 F.3d at 353-54 (concluding excessive force claim triable when officer seized and dragged plaintiff to effectuate arrest for crime of trespassing in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> a public restaurant). Given this well-settled jurisprudence, there is no legitimate doubt that the right asserted here was clearly established. Thus, Webster was on notice that a police officer's use of excessive force would be offensive to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The question, then, reduces to whether Webster's use of excessive force constituted the type and kind of erroneous judgment that a reasonable police officer under the same or similar circumstances might have made. <i>See </i><i>Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756655\"><a href=\"/opinion/756655/grancid-camilo-robles-v-dr-guillermo-hoyos-and-dr-hector-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14-15 (1st Cir.1998). We think not.</p>\n<p>This inquiry is a complicated one. By definition, excessive force is unreasonable force. <i>See </i><i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 394, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1865</span></a></span>. But reasonable people sometimes make mistaken judgments, and a reasonable officer sometimes may use unreasonable force. In that event, qualified immunity gives an officer the benefit of a margin of error. <i>See </i><i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 205-06, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span> (2001) (explaining that qualified immunity operates in excessive force cases to \"protect officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2007) (observing that, in effect, \"officers receive protection if they acted reasonably in exercising unreasonable force.\"). Thus, defeating a qualified immunity defense requires a showing of an incremental degree of error  an incommensurate use of force beyond that needed to establish a garden-variety excessive force claim and, further, beyond the \"hazy border\" noted by the <i>Saucier</i> Court, 533 U.S. at 206, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>.</p>\n<p>Looked at another way, qualified immunity is appropriate in an excessive force case when an officer \"correctly perceive[s] all of the relevant facts but [has] a mistaken understanding\" as to the legality of his chosen level of force. <i>Id.</i> at 205, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>. Conversely, qualified immunity protection would not be available when the level of force chosen by the officer cannot in any way, shape, or form be justified under those facts.</p>\n<p>These principles necessitate a case-specific approach. Many cases will defy easy classification. This case, however, does not present a borderline situation; and we think that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to avert the entry of summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>As will almost always be true, this determination is based on a matter of degree. Here, the facts, seen through the prism of the plaintiff's account, simply do not justify yanking the arm of an unarmed and non-violent person, suspected only of the theft of $20, and pinning her against a wall for three to four minutes with sufficient force to tear her rotator cuff. That is particularly so in view of the marked disparity in height and weight between the officer and the suspect, the absence of any evidence of either dangerousness or attempted flight, and the presence of a cadre of other officers at the scene. In short, the plaintiff's version of the relevant facts places Webster's actions outside the universe of protected mistakes. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Vondrak v. City of Las Cruces,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171070\"><a href=\"/opinion/171070/vondrak-v-city-of-las-cruces/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1209-10 (10th Cir.2008); <i>Jones v.

That is true as far as it goes. <i>Cf. </i><i>Graham,</i> 490 U.S. at 396, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1865</span></a></span> (noting that the right to make an arrest carries with it the right to use some force). But the district court's further conclusion that the plaintiff's actions justified Webster in believing that a significant degree of force could be used, <i>see </i><i>Morelli,</i> 554 F.Supp.2d at 56-57, cannot be squared with the summary judgment standard. While the officers' accounts of the facts may justify the district court's appraisal, the court was bound to ask not whether those accounts were plausible but, rather, whether under the plaintiff's version of the facts a reasonable officer should have known that the degree of force used was plainly excessive. <i>See </i><i>Griffith v. Coburn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796462\"><a href=\"/opinion/796462/liler-razor-griffith-personal-representative-of-the-estate-of-arthur-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span>, 656-57 (6th Cir.2007) (\"Because determining reasonableness in [the excessive force] context is such a fact-intensive endeavor summary judgment is improper if the legal question of immunity turns on which version of the facts is accepted.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Dávila,</i> 498 F.3d at 12.</p>\n<p>To be sure, incidental contact  say, a \"gratuitously violent shove\"  may be within the realm of conduct protected by qualified immunity. <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 208, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>. Here, however, Webster's conduct, as described by the plaintiff, eclipsed the bounds of reasonableness. Given the importance of reasonableness to the qualified immunity calculus in excessive force cases, the existence of such immunity frequently will hinge on the resolution of disputed facts. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Jennings,</i> 499 F.3d at 18-20. So it is here.</p>\n<p>In sum, we conclude that the plaintiff not only has made out a trialworthy issue as to whether Webster's use of a significant degree of force transgressed her Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force but also that she has made a showing adequate to thwart a qualified immunity defense. <i>See </i><i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 7. Because a rational jury could find, on this scumbled record, facts establishing that Webster's use of force was so objectively unreasonable and so plainly misguided that he should not be protected by the shield of qualified immunity, the district court erred in resolving this claim in advance of trial. <i>See id.; </i><i>Alexis,</i> 67 F.3d at 352-53.</p>\n<p>Let us be perfectly clear. We understand that the plaintiff's version of the relevant events is hotly contested, and we make no judgment as to where the truth lies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Greenburg,</i> 835 F.2d at 936 (discussing operation of summary judgment standard).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the unlawful detention claim and the mirror-image supplemental claim, reverse the grant of summary judgment on the excessive force claim and the mirror-image supplemental claim, and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, reversed part, and remanded. No costs.</i></p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>With respect, I write separately in this case. While I concur in the majority's decision that the grant of summary judgment on the excessive force claim should be reversed, I also have serious doubt about the basis on which the majority decides the first question, whether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion and probable cause.</p>\n<p>The basic facts of this case are that a woman, who one officer identified as a known prostitute, did not engage in an act <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> of prostitution. The sting failed because either, on the most friendly view, she didn't intend to engage in prostitution, or on a less friendly view, she smelled a rat and chose not to continue with the proposed encounter.</p>\n<p>When the plaintiff took the $20, she explained to the officer in the room that she was taking it as compensation for her expenditure of time and gas. The evidence is uncontroverted that the officer did not protest, a fact apparently known to the defendant. The parties do not agree as to where the defendant was when the money was returned, but at summary judgment we must accept the plaintiff's claim that the defendant was one of the first officers in the hallway. Thus it would be reasonable to infer that he was aware that the plaintiff had returned the money.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff was a fifty-three-year-old woman, small in stature, about 5' 3\" tall and weighing 120 pounds, while the defendant was physically fit and stood nearly a foot taller. The facts around the stop are in dispute and a jury could well find that the real reason for the stop was that the defendant officer was upset that the sting had failed. While the fact of the taking of the $20 was perhaps sufficient for a brief Terry stop, in my view everything that occurred thereafter was improper. It is interesting to note that no other law enforcement person present took part in the events that led to this lawsuit. A reasonable jury might well decide that the defendant officer's actions, which caused serious injury to the plaintiff, were not animated by the taking of the $20 from the bureau but rather were an overblown reaction to the failed sting.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We adhere to this approach. Although we analyze the issues in terms of the federal claims, our reasoning applies with undiminished force to the supplemental claims.</p>\n<p>[2]  We previously noted that the Supreme Court has never clearly indicated whether the judge or the jury is the proper factfinder when a case is actually tried and a factual dispute underlies a proffered qualified immunity defense. <i>Kelley,</i> 288 F.3d at 7 n. 2. We have, however, expressed some doubt that \"the Supreme Court intended this [factual] dispute to be resolved from the bench by fiat.\" <i>Id.; see </i><i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2007) (requiring, on particular facts, that a judge's post-verdict qualified immunity ruling be consistent with the jury verdict).</p>\n<p>[3]  One might argue that Webster should have understood that the plaintiff's statement that she was entitled to the money, coupled with the absence of an immediate protest by McVane, indicated acquiescence. But apart from the fact that the plaintiff has not pressed this point, the circumstances simply are not clear-cut enough either to compel a conclusion that silence equalled acquiescence or to preclude a reasonable belief that a crime was being committed. <i>See generally </i><i>New Jersey v. T.L.O.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111301\"><a href=\"/opinion/111301/new-jersey-v-tlo/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 346, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111301\"><a href=\"/opinion/111301/new-jersey-v-tlo/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
