Cornell and Nixon\nPeabody LLP were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            October 20, 2006\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      Of the     Northern    District   of    California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        This appeal, involving issues of\n\nindemnification and duress, arises out of easily described events.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Robert Happ served as a director of Galileo\n\n(later   renamed     NetOptix),    a   company   that       has   now     become   a\n\nsubsidiary of Corning, Inc. During his service as a director, Happ\n\nwas   covered   by    provisions,      common    in    modern       corporations,\n\nproviding indemnification for Happ for liability he might incur on\n\naccount of directorship.\n\n            Using the language of Delaware law,             Del. Code Ann. tit.\n\n8, § 145(a) (2006), the company provided (through by-law and\n\ncontract) for indemnification so long as Happ \"acted in good faith\n\nand in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to\n\nthe best interests of the Company . . . .\"            The company also agreed\n\nto advance upon request expenses for any covered lawsuit, provided\n\nthat the director execute an undertaking to repay the advances \"if\n\nit shall ultimately be determined that [the employee] is not\n\nentitled to be indemnified against such expenses . . . .\"\n\n            On April 20, 1998, Galileo held a board meeting with\n\nHapp--chair of the board's audit committee and a financial expert--\n\nparticipating   by    telephone.       The   board    was    told    of   business\n\nproblems whose impact on second quarter earnings was small but\n\nwhich could cause a greater impact in the third quarter if not\n\nresolved.    By late June, the company was having difficulties and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe chief executive officer, William Hanley, decided to seek Happ's\n\nadvice.\n\n            According to his later testimony, Hanley left two voice-\n\nmail messages for Happ--one on Thursday, June 25, 1998, and the\n\nother on the Sunday following; each message stated that the company\n\nwas having \"some difficulties\" with its third quarter and requested\n\na meeting with Happ early the following week.           On Monday, Happ\n\ncalled Hanley's assistant to schedule a meeting; the same day, Happ\n\nsold all of his 4,000 shares of the company's stock for about\n\n$47,000.\n\n            In late July 1998, the company revealed that its third\n\nquarter difficulties had produced a net loss of $3.3 million\n\ninstead of the forecast profit of $160,000.       The stock price fell\n\nfrom $8.25 to $3 per share (and Happ then purchased 5,000 shares).\n\nAfter an investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission in\n\nOctober 2000 filed a civil complaint against Happ charging that he\n\nhad traded on material, nonpublic information when he sold his\n\n4,000 shares in June 1998.       15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), 78j(b) (1994).\n\n            At the time that Happ sought advances to cover the cost\n\nof his defense, the company had become a subsidiary of Corning,\n\nrenamed    Corning   NetOptix.    Corning   required   Happ   to   sign   an\n\nundertaking in which he agreed to repay Corning for defense costs\n\nif it were \"finally determined\" that he \"wrongfully used material\n\nnon-public information of Galileo Corp. . . . for personal gain,\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\feither with intent or recklessly, in selling shares of Galileo\n\nstock.\"\n\n             This arrangement was agreed to between Corning and Happ's\n\ncounsel, but only after unfriendly negotiations that lasted until\n\nMarch 2001.     Happ says that Corning refused to provide him with\n\npertinent documents and denied any obligation to advance funds in\n\nthis case.     Happ also asserts that he was under financial pressure\n\ndue to ongoing and foreseeable defense costs.           Corning eventually\n\npaid $878,877.92 to cover much of Happ's counsel fees.\n\n             In July 2003, Happ sued Corning and Corning NetOptix,\n\nprimarily over how much Corning should advance for counsel fees.\n\nIn the midst of this private lawsuit, the SEC enforcement action\n\nconcluded when, on October 9, 2003, a jury found that Happ was\n\nliable for insider trading.        He was ultimately ordered to pay\n\n$34,758   as   disgorgement,   a   penalty   in   the   same   amount,   and\n\nsubstantial interest.     SEC v. Happ, 295 F. Supp. 2d 189 (D. Mass.\n\n2003), aff'd, 392 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             Following the final decision in the SEC case, Corning and\n\nCorning NetOptix filed a counterclaim in Happ's district court\n\naction against them, seeking repayment of Corning's advances to\n\nHapp.   The district court thereafter held on summary judgment that\n\nthe undertaking required the repayment and had not been secured by\n\nduress (as Happ claimed).      Corning was awarded repayment in the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\famount of $878,877.92.           Happ v. Corning Inc., No. 03-11258-GAO,\n\n2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39554 (D. Mass. Nov. 28, 2005).\n\n            Happ      now   appeals,   arguing    that     duress    vitiated    the\n\nundertaking or at least was an issue for the jury.                  Alternatively,\n\nhe says that the undertaking, if valid, should be read in light of\n\nthe indemnification agreement and, so read, does not require\n\nrepayment because there is at least a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether Happ had acted in good faith and not adversely\n\nto the company.       The grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,\n\ndrawing inferences in favor of Happ.             Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co.,\n\n183 F.3d 38, 47 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1161\n\n(2000).\n\n            Both defendant companies are incorporated in Delaware and\n\nthe parties assume without discussion that the Delaware statutory\n\nstandard in section 145--the good faith/not adverse to language\n\nquoted    above--governs       indemnification      unless    narrowed      by   the\n\nundertaking. The parties also agree that Massachusetts law governs\n\nthe duress claim and the construction of the undertaking, although\n\nthey add that Delaware law on              duress is similar to that of\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n            A   contract      signed   under     duress,    including      economic\n\nduress,   is    not    binding   under    Massachusetts      law,    but   a   party\n\nclaiming to have entered into a contract under duress has the\n\nburden of showing that (1) he has been the victim of some unlawful\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\for wrongful act or threat; (2) the act or threat deprived him of\n\nhis free or unfettered will; and (3) due to the first two factors,\n\nhe was compelled to make a disproportionate exchange of values.1\n\n           Happ's claim of duress fails at the first of these\n\nhurdles.      Physical duress is almost always wrongful but much\n\ncommercial    bargaining    involves     economic    pressure;   \"absent   an\n\nimproper threat, the driving of a hard bargain is not duress.\"             7\n\nJ. Perillo, Corbin on Contracts § 28.3, at 47 (rev'd ed. 2002).\n\nWhether or not pressure existed, Corning's insistence on the\n\nundertaking was not unlawful or wrongful within the meaning of the\n\nduress doctrine.\n\n           True enough, Happ already had a bargain--his by-law and\n\ncontract-based right of indemnification--as well as an advance\n\nconditioned    on   a   promise   to   repay   if   indemnification   proved\n\nunwarranted. Yet the contract and the by-law did not say precisely\n\nhow the undertaking should be phrased or whether the company had a\n\nright to insist on spelling out the circumstances in which Happ\n\nwould not be entitled to indemnification.\n\n           Happ's legal position--that the undertaking should have\n\nbeen phrased solely in terms of Delaware law--was plausible and\n\nperhaps right; but Corning had some basis for its own position.\n\n\n     1\n      Int'l Underwater Contractors, Inc. v. New Eng. Tel. & Tel.\nCo., 393 N.E.2d 968, 970 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979) (quoting 13 W.\nJaeger, Williston on Contracts § 1617, at 704 (3d ed. 1970));\naccord Ismert & Assocs., Inc. v. New Eng. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 801\nF.2d 536, 544 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n                                       -6-\n\fThis is so because Delaware law is unclear as to whether Happ could\n\never        be   indemnified   if   he    lost   an   insider-trading   suit   and,\n\nfurther, because the company had even more reason to assert that he\n\nwould not be entitled to be indemnified under Delaware law if he\n\nlost this suit.\n\n                 We put to one side the argument that federal law--\n\nalthough only by implication--forbids indemnification for federal\n\nregulatory violations like insider trading.                 This is a view taken\n\nby some circuits for reasons explained in those decisions;2 but our\n\ncircuit has not ruled on the issue and arguments can be made both\n\nways.        Neither side has even adverted to the federal issue and we\n\nneed not pursue it.\n\n                 Yet even under Delaware law, it is debatable whether an\n\ninsider-trading violation can ever be \"not opposed to\" the best\n\ninterests of the company.                There is respectable commentary that\n\nDelaware law permits indemnification for at least some violations\n\nof this type;3 but one could also argue that insider trading\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      E.g., First Golden Bancorporation v. Weiszmann, 942 F.2d 726,\n728-29 (10th Cir. 1991); Globus v. Law Research Serv., Inc., 418\nF.2d 1276, 1288-89 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 913\n(1970); see also Raychem Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 853 F. Supp. 1170,\n1176-77 (N.D. Cal. 1994).\n        3\n      See Joseph Warren Bishop, Jr., The Law of Corporate Officers\nand Directors: Indemnification and Insurance § 6:7 (2005); Joseph\nF. Johnston, Jr., Corporate Indemnification and Liability Insurance\nfor Directors and Officers, 33 Bus. Law. 1993, 1996-98 (1978).\n\n                                           -7-\n\finherently damages a company by poisoning relations with current\n\nand prospective shareholders who supply the capital.\n\n            Thus,   Corning's    insistence     on     its   phrasing    of   the\n\nundertaking was not unreasonable, although this position might not\n\nhave prevailed in court.          Further, if Happ disputed Corning's\n\nposition--as he certainly could--and insisted on an undertaking\n\nphrased   solely    in   terms   of   the   Delaware    standard,   he    had   a\n\nstraightforward remedy. He could have sued Corning immediately for\n\ndeclaratory judgment in his favor on his claim for an advance\n\nqualified only by section 145's language, and moved for summary\n\njudgment.    See, e.g., Ismert, 801 F.2d at 549.\n\n            Whatever financial pressure Happ faced, there is no\n\nevidence that bankruptcy imminently threatened.              Indeed, his full\n\nliability if he lost the SEC suit appears to have been pretty\n\nmodest; his main problem was legal bills that would be incurred\n\nover a period of several years.         Neither his immediate risks, nor\n\nlonger term consequences of losing the SEC suit, prevented him from\n\nseeking a declaratory ruling as to the advance.\n\n            Happ says that the question of how much pressure he was\n\nunder presented a factual issue that should have been presented to\n\nthe jury rather than resolved on summary judgment.              This argument\n\nis debatable: Happ's affidavit says that he was in financial peril\n\nand inferences were to be drawn in his favor; yet the affidavit is\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fquite vague as to the details of the threat.           Either way, Happ had\n\nthe option of suing rather than signing.\n\n           So   even   if   a   jury    could   find   that Happ was under\n\nfinancial pressure, Corning had a plausible, if debatable, position\n\nthat the undertaking it sought was within its rights; and Happ had\n\na legal remedy if he disputed this position.                Until a court\n\nclarified its obligation, Corning no more abused its position by\n\nrefusing to advance funds without the requested undertaking than\n\ndid Happ by insisting on payment without the undertaking sought for\n\nCorning.\n\n           The case law is consistent with our view.          A few courts\n\nmay confine \"wrongfulness\" in the duress doctrine to conduct\n\nactually illegal, but most extend the term to blameworthy conduct\n\nin a larger sense.4    However, it is clear enough from the case law\n\nthat an act is not wrongful in this sense if there is a good faith\n\nbelief by the \"pressuring\" party that its position represents a\n\nplausible one to take under a governing contract.5              The result\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Grace M. Giesel, A Realistic Proposal for the Contract Duress\nDoctrine, 107 W. Va. L. Rev. 443, 488-90 (2005). Compare Quigley\nv. KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP, 749 A.2d 405, 411-12 (N.J. Super. Ct.\n2000), with Hurd v. Wildman, Harrold, Allen & Dixon, 707 N.E.2d\n609, 614-15 (Ill. Ct. App. 1999).\n     5\n      See Rumsfeld v. Freedom NY, Inc., 329 F.3d 1320, 1331 (Fed.\nCir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 987 (2004); Agroindustrias Vezel\nv. H.P. Schmid, Inc., 15 F.3d 1082, 1994 WL 12342, at *3-4 (9th\nCir. 1994) (unpublished opinion).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fwould be otherwise if Corning's legal position were absurd or\n\notherwise evidently taken in bad faith.6\n\n            Thus, the duress claim was properly rejected on summary\n\njudgment;   and   Happ's   obligation    to   repay   is   governed   by   the\n\nundertaking. The undertaking said Happ had to repay the advance if\n\nit was \"finally determined\" that he \"wrongfully used material non-\n\npublic information of Galileo Corp. . . . for personal gain, either\n\nwith intent or recklessly, in selling shares of Galileo stock.\"\n\nThe jury in the SEC suit returned a special verdict saying just\n\nthis.\n\n            The jury found, inter alia, that Happ was an insider who\n\npossessed and used nonpublic information regarding Galileo when he\n\nsold his stock in that company; that he engaged in an act which\n\noperated or would by a reasonable person have been expected to\n\noperate as a fraud or deceit upon some person; that he violated a\n\nduty of trust and confidence that he owed to Galileo and its\n\nstockholders; and that he acted with intent.          SEC v. Happ, 295 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 195.\n\n            Happ nevertheless argues that the undertaking should be\n\nread broadly as adopting the test of Delaware law.            He says first\n\nthat related documents (here, the by-law/contract provisions and\n\n\n\n        6\n      Totem Marine Tug & Barge, Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Service\nCo., 584 P.2d 15, 22 (Alaska 1978); Rich & Whillock, Inc. v. Ashton\nDev., Inc., 204 Cal. Rptr. 86, 89-90 (Ct. App. 1984); Int'l\nUnderwater Contractors, 393 N.E.2d at 971.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe undertaking) should be read harmoniously.        Such a doctrine\n\nexists, is well settled as to provisions in the same agreement,\n\ne.g., Kinek v. Paramount Communications, Inc., 22 F.3d 503, 509 (2d\n\nCir. 1994) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 202(2)\n\n(1981)), and can also play a role in the reading of distinct but\n\nrelated documents that concern the same transaction, see 11 R.\n\nLord, Williston on Contracts § 30:26, at 239-53 (4th ed. 1999), but\n\nthe doctrine applies primarily in cases of uncertainty and cannot\n\nundo plain language which makes perfect sense in context.\n\n           Even in the case of contemporaneous documents, the notion\n\nthat instruments should be read together is not mechanical. See 11\n\nLord, Williston on Contracts, at 247-48. Here, the undertaking was\n\nmade at a later date than the contract and by-law provisions; and\n\nthe   circumstances--including   Corning's   insistence   and   Happ's\n\nprotests--confirm what is evident from language alone: that the\n\nvery purpose of the undertaking was to supply a restrictive gloss\n\nthat Corning would have favored and Happ would have opposed.\n\n           Happ also says that one of the purposes for the \"not\n\ninconsistent with\" language in the Delaware law was to permit\n\nindemnification in insider-trading cases. See note 3, above. That\n\nmay be so but this works against Happ's own claim that the\n\nundertaking replicates the statute.     The arguable gap between what\n\nDelaware law might permit and what Corning was willing to do\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fexplains why Corning sought an undertaking more restrictive than\n\nthe wording of the by-law and contract obligations.\n\n          As it happens, Happ's claim to indemnification would\n\nprobably fail even if the undertaking were phrased solely in the\n\nlanguage of section 145.     This is so because, given the jury\n\nverdict in the enforcement action, Happ could not easily meet\n\neither of the two requirements of Delaware law--namely, that the\n\nconduct to be indemnified have been (1) in good faith and (2) not\n\nopposed to the best interests of the company.\n\n          It is hard to see how the good faith test could be\n\nsatisfied if Happ knowingly violated a federal regulatory statute\n\naimed at protecting the public.     Happ does not claim to have been\n\nignorant of insider-trading restrictions; rather, he argued in the\n\nenforcement case that his sale of shares was not prompted by inside\n\nknowledge but rather by a need for cash.     It is apparent from the\n\njury's verdict that it did not agree.\n\n          Similarly, even if an act of insider trading might occur\n\nwithout being adverse to the interests of the company, that would\n\nnot appear to help Happ:   the jury's special verdict in this case\n\nfound that Happ had violated a duty of trust and confidence owed to\n\nthe company and its stockholders.    Either a finding of bad faith or\n\nof opposition to company interests would bar Happ's claim under\n\nDelaware law.   Here the jury appears to have made both.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f          We do not rely upon the apparent bar of Delaware law.\n\nWhether Happ is bound by the jury findings has not been litigated\n\non this appeal, and perhaps the surface reading of the findings in\n\nthe SEC enforcement action could be disputed.   Still, despite the\n\narguments Happ has ably presented, the SEC verdict may well have\n\ndoomed Happ's claim at the start.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\f",

This appeal, involving issues of\n\nindemnification and duress, arises out of easily described events.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Robert Happ served as a director of Galileo\n\n(later   renamed     NetOptix),    a   company   that       has   now     become   a\n\nsubsidiary of Corning, Inc. During his service as a director, Happ\n\nwas   covered   by    provisions,      common    in    modern       corporations,\n\nproviding indemnification for Happ for liability he might incur on\n\naccount of directorship.\n\n            Using the language of Delaware law,             Del. Code Ann. tit.\n\n8, § 145(a) (2006), the company provided (through by-law and\n\ncontract) for indemnification so long as Happ \"acted in good faith\n\nand in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to\n\nthe best interests of the Company . . . .\"            The company also agreed\n\nto advance upon request expenses for any covered lawsuit, provided\n\nthat the director execute an undertaking to repay the advances \"if\n\nit shall ultimately be determined that [the employee] is not\n\nentitled to be indemnified against such expenses . . . .\"\n\n            On April 20, 1998, Galileo held a board meeting with\n\nHapp--chair of the board's audit committee and a financial expert--\n\nparticipating   by    telephone.       The   board    was    told    of   business\n\nproblems whose impact on second quarter earnings was small but\n\nwhich could cause a greater impact in the third quarter if not\n\nresolved.    By late June, the company was having difficulties and\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe chief executive officer, William Hanley, decided to seek Happ's\n\nadvice.\n\n            According to his later testimony, Hanley left two voice-\n\nmail messages for Happ--one on Thursday, June 25, 1998, and the\n\nother on the Sunday following; each message stated that the company\n\nwas having \"some difficulties\" with its third quarter and requested\n\na meeting with Happ early the following week.           On Monday, Happ\n\ncalled Hanley's assistant to schedule a meeting; the same day, Happ\n\nsold all of his 4,000 shares of the company's stock for about\n\n$47,000.\n\n            In late July 1998, the company revealed that its third\n\nquarter difficulties had produced a net loss of $3.3 million\n\ninstead of the forecast profit of $160,000.       The stock price fell\n\nfrom $8.25 to $3 per share (and Happ then purchased 5,000 shares).\n\nAfter an investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission in\n\nOctober 2000 filed a civil complaint against Happ charging that he\n\nhad traded on material, nonpublic information when he sold his\n\n4,000 shares in June 1998.       15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), 78j(b) (1994).\n\n            At the time that Happ sought advances to cover the cost\n\nof his defense, the company had become a subsidiary of Corning,\n\nrenamed    Corning   NetOptix.    Corning   required   Happ   to   sign   an\n\nundertaking in which he agreed to repay Corning for defense costs\n\nif it were \"finally determined\" that he \"wrongfully used material\n\nnon-public information of Galileo Corp. . . . for personal gain,\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\feither with intent or recklessly, in selling shares of Galileo\n\nstock.\"\n\n             This arrangement was agreed to between Corning and Happ's\n\ncounsel, but only after unfriendly negotiations that lasted until\n\nMarch 2001.     Happ says that Corning refused to provide him with\n\npertinent documents and denied any obligation to advance funds in\n\nthis case.     Happ also asserts that he was under financial pressure\n\ndue to ongoing and foreseeable defense costs.           Corning eventually\n\npaid $878,877.92 to cover much of Happ's counsel fees.\n\n             In July 2003, Happ sued Corning and Corning NetOptix,\n\nprimarily over how much Corning should advance for counsel fees.\n\nIn the midst of this private lawsuit, the SEC enforcement action\n\nconcluded when, on October 9, 2003, a jury found that Happ was\n\nliable for insider trading.        He was ultimately ordered to pay\n\n$34,758   as   disgorgement,   a   penalty   in   the   same   amount,   and\n\nsubstantial interest.     SEC v.

The parties also agree that Massachusetts law governs\n\nthe duress claim and the construction of the undertaking, although\n\nthey add that Delaware law on              duress is similar to that of\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n            A   contract      signed   under     duress,    including      economic\n\nduress,   is    not    binding   under    Massachusetts      law,    but   a   party\n\nclaiming to have entered into a contract under duress has the\n\nburden of showing that (1) he has been the victim of some unlawful\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\for wrongful act or threat; (2) the act or threat deprived him of\n\nhis free or unfettered will; and (3) due to the first two factors,\n\nhe was compelled to make a disproportionate exchange of values.1\n\n           Happ's claim of duress fails at the first of these\n\nhurdles.      Physical duress is almost always wrongful but much\n\ncommercial    bargaining    involves     economic    pressure;   \"absent   an\n\nimproper threat, the driving of a hard bargain is not duress.\"             7\n\nJ. Perillo, Corbin on Contracts § 28.3, at 47 (rev'd ed. 2002).\n\nWhether or not pressure existed, Corning's insistence on the\n\nundertaking was not unlawful or wrongful within the meaning of the\n\nduress doctrine.\n\n           True enough, Happ already had a bargain--his by-law and\n\ncontract-based right of indemnification--as well as an advance\n\nconditioned    on   a   promise   to   repay   if   indemnification   proved\n\nunwarranted. Yet the contract and the by-law did not say precisely\n\nhow the undertaking should be phrased or whether the company had a\n\nright to insist on spelling out the circumstances in which Happ\n\nwould not be entitled to indemnification.\n\n           Happ's legal position--that the undertaking should have\n\nbeen phrased solely in terms of Delaware law--was plausible and\n\nperhaps right; but Corning had some basis for its own position.\n\n\n     1\n      Int'l Underwater Contractors, Inc. v.

Further, if Happ disputed Corning's\n\nposition--as he certainly could--and insisted on an undertaking\n\nphrased   solely    in   terms   of   the   Delaware    standard,   he    had   a\n\nstraightforward remedy. He could have sued Corning immediately for\n\ndeclaratory judgment in his favor on his claim for an advance\n\nqualified only by section 145's language, and moved for summary\n\njudgment.    See, e.g., Ismert, 801 F.2d at 549.\n\n            Whatever financial pressure Happ faced, there is no\n\nevidence that bankruptcy imminently threatened.              Indeed, his full\n\nliability if he lost the SEC suit appears to have been pretty\n\nmodest; his main problem was legal bills that would be incurred\n\nover a period of several years.         Neither his immediate risks, nor\n\nlonger term consequences of losing the SEC suit, prevented him from\n\nseeking a declaratory ruling as to the advance.\n\n            Happ says that the question of how much pressure he was\n\nunder presented a factual issue that should have been presented to\n\nthe jury rather than resolved on summary judgment.              This argument\n\nis debatable: Happ's affidavit says that he was in financial peril\n\nand inferences were to be drawn in his favor; yet the affidavit is\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fquite vague as to the details of the threat.           Either way, Happ had\n\nthe option of suing rather than signing.\n\n           So   even   if   a   jury    could   find   that Happ was under\n\nfinancial pressure, Corning had a plausible, if debatable, position\n\nthat the undertaking it sought was within its rights; and Happ had\n\na legal remedy if he disputed this position.                Until a court\n\nclarified its obligation, Corning no more abused its position by\n\nrefusing to advance funds without the requested undertaking than\n\ndid Happ by insisting on payment without the undertaking sought for\n\nCorning.\n\n           The case law is consistent with our view.          A few courts\n\nmay confine \"wrongfulness\" in the duress doctrine to conduct\n\nactually illegal, but most extend the term to blameworthy conduct\n\nin a larger sense.4    However, it is clear enough from the case law\n\nthat an act is not wrongful in this sense if there is a good faith\n\nbelief by the \"pressuring\" party that its position represents a\n\nplausible one to take under a governing contract.5              The result\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Grace M.

See 11\n\nLord, Williston on Contracts, at 247-48. Here, the undertaking was\n\nmade at a later date than the contract and by-law provisions; and\n\nthe   circumstances--including   Corning's   insistence   and   Happ's\n\nprotests--confirm what is evident from language alone: that the\n\nvery purpose of the undertaking was to supply a restrictive gloss\n\nthat Corning would have favored and Happ would have opposed.\n\n           Happ also says that one of the purposes for the \"not\n\ninconsistent with\" language in the Delaware law was to permit\n\nindemnification in insider-trading cases. See note 3, above. That\n\nmay be so but this works against Happ's own claim that the\n\nundertaking replicates the statute.     The arguable gap between what\n\nDelaware law might permit and what Corning was willing to do\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fexplains why Corning sought an undertaking more restrictive than\n\nthe wording of the by-law and contract obligations.\n\n          As it happens, Happ's claim to indemnification would\n\nprobably fail even if the undertaking were phrased solely in the\n\nlanguage of section 145.     This is so because, given the jury\n\nverdict in the enforcement action, Happ could not easily meet\n\neither of the two requirements of Delaware law--namely, that the\n\nconduct to be indemnified have been (1) in good faith and (2) not\n\nopposed to the best interests of the company.\n\n          It is hard to see how the good faith test could be\n\nsatisfied if Happ knowingly violated a federal regulatory statute\n\naimed at protecting the public.     Happ does not claim to have been\n\nignorant of insider-trading restrictions; rather, he argued in the\n\nenforcement case that his sale of shares was not prompted by inside\n\nknowledge but rather by a need for cash.     It is apparent from the\n\njury's verdict that it did not agree.\n\n          Similarly, even if an act of insider trading might occur\n\nwithout being adverse to the interests of the company, that would\n\nnot appear to help Happ:   the jury's special verdict in this case\n\nfound that Happ had violated a duty of trust and confidence owed to\n\nthe company and its stockholders.    Either a finding of bad faith or\n\nof opposition to company interests would bar Happ's claim under\n\nDelaware law.   Here the jury appears to have made both.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f          We do not rely upon the apparent bar of Delaware law.\n\nWhether Happ is bound by the jury findings has not been litigated\n\non this appeal, and perhaps the surface reading of the findings in\n\nthe SEC enforcement action could be disputed.   Still, despite the\n\narguments Happ has ably presented, the SEC verdict may well have\n\ndoomed Happ's claim at the start.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\f</pre>",
