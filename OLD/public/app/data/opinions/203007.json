George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                    Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Nicholas J.K. Mahoney for appellants.\n     Frederick J. Badger, Jr. with whom Richardson, Whitman, Large\nand Badger was on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                           November 2, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the    Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        This case concerns dealings by\n\nAgway Inc., an agricultural cooperative, with Vaughn and Mary\n\nSleeper.     The Sleepers grew seed potatoes on their farm (Sleeper\n\nFarms) in Sherman Mills, Maine, and claim that Agway owes them\n\nmoney for potatoes harvested between 1998 and 2001.            The parties\n\nhave now litigated before a bankruptcy court, an arbitrator, and\n\nthe federal district court twice; Agway has gone bankrupt; the\n\nSleepers are no longer growing potatoes.\n\n           Between 1998 and 2001 (three growing seasons), Agway\n\npurchased seed potatoes from Sleeper Farms; Agway would then re-\n\nsell the crop to other farmers for new plantings.         In June 2000,\n\nAgway withheld some $51,000 of payment, saying that the Sleepers\n\nhad mixed genetically altered potatoes with unaltered potatoes in\n\na shipment.     The parties corresponded about the withheld sum but\n\nreached no agreement; the Sleepers threatened to sue; Agway then\n\nfiled a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration\n\nAssociation (\"AAA\"), which the AAA accepted.\n\n           On February 21, 2002, the Sleepers filed a complaint in\n\nthe federal district court in Maine against Agway and several\n\nindividuals associated with that company.        The complaint included\n\nmultiple common law causes of action and also alleged violations of\n\nvarious state and federal statutes; it challenged, in addition to\n\nthe earlier withholding, other alleged unfair practices by Agway--\n\nunilateral    cutting   of   prices,   refusal   to   accept    quantities\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpreviously ordered, and so on.    The Sleepers moved to enjoin the\n\narbitration, and Agway moved to dismiss or stay court proceedings\n\npending arbitration.   See 9 U.S.C. ยง 3 (2000).\n\n          The district court held an evidentiary hearing on May 15,\n\n2002, after which it denied the motion to enjoin arbitration and\n\ninstead ordered a stay of judicial proceedings pending arbitration.\n\nThe court determined that Sleeper Farms assented to a series of\n\npurchase orders, which incorporated by reference Agway's standard\n\nsales contract, which in turn included an arbitration clause. None\n\nof the Sleepers' objections to arbitrability was accepted.\n\n          The district judge did not reach the question of scope,\n\ni.e. which of the Sleepers' claims fell within the arbitration\n\nclause; that is generally a question for the judge to decide, AT&T\n\nTechs., Inc. v. Commc'n Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643, 650-51\n\n(1986), but here he found a \"clear and unmistakable\" delegation of\n\nthat power to the arbitrator1 and told the arbitrator to decide the\n\nscope of the clause and the merits of the claims that were within\n\nthe scope.   We do not have jurisdiction over interlocutory orders\n\nthat stay proceedings pending arbitration, 9 U.S.C. ยง 16(b)(1), and\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The arbitration clause referenced the AAA's procedural rules,\none of which permits the arbitrator to rule on such questions of\nscope. The Sleepers do not challenge this finding by the district\njudge, and so we need not consider whether such a reference meets\nthe \"clear and unmistakable\" standard. See Green Tree Fin. Corp.\nv. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe Sleepers voluntarily dismissed without prejudice the appeal\n\nthat they filed after the order was issued.\n\n           Shortly after the district court's order, Agway filed for\n\nbankruptcy and proceedings slowed; but eventually the bankruptcy\n\ncourt permitted the arbitration to go ahead.                In May 2005, the\n\nparties signed an additional stipulation, filed with the AAA, that\n\n\"all issues of liability and damages contained within Sleeper\n\nFarm's Complaint . . . shall be determined through arbitration in\n\nthis forum.\"   The implications of this stipulation are disputed.\n\n           On the merits, in an award issued on December 16, 2005,\n\nthe arbitrator awarded some $82,000 (plus costs) to Sleeper Farms.\n\nHe found that Agway's withholding of payment in June 2000 had been\n\nimproper, but rejected most of the Sleepers' other claims.                  Not\n\nsatisfied with this limited victory, the Sleepers returned to the\n\ndistrict court and moved to vacate the award.2                Agway moved to\n\nconfirm it.    Finding neither fraud nor manifest disregard of law,\n\nthe court upheld the arbitrator's award.\n\n           On appeal, the Sleepers challenge both of the district\n\njudge's   orders:   the   2002   order    referring   the    dispute   to   the\n\narbitrator, and the 2006 order confirming the arbitrator's award.\n\nThe former was not appealable on an interlocutory basis, but as\n\n\n     2\n      There was some debate over whether the bankruptcy court or\nthe district court was the proper forum for the post-arbitration\nmotions, but the bankruptcy court noted that the district court\nproceedings had only been stayed, not dismissed, and therefore\ndirected the parties to return there.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwith non-final orders generally, it can be challenged along with\n\nthe final judgment.           Tejidos de Coamo, Inc. v. Int'l Ladies'\n\nGarment Workers' Union, 22 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1994).                      We first\n\nconsider the challenges to the initial order.\n\n              As    a   threshold   matter,     Agway     points    out    that   the\n\nstipulation stated that the Sleepers agreed to have \"all issues of\n\nliability and damages\" resolved through arbitration.                       It argues\n\nthat none of the objections to the July 2002 order matter anymore,\n\nclaiming      the    stipulation    signed     by   the   parties    provided      an\n\nindependent basis for the arbitrator's authority. Indeed, as Agway\n\nreads   the    stipulation,      the   Sleepers     abandoned      their    original\n\nobjection to the reference.\n\n              Agway's position is arguable, but we think that the more\n\nreasonable reading of the stipulation favors the Sleepers.                    At the\n\narbitration, the parties could have continued to argue about which\n\nof the numerous claims made by the Sleepers fell within the\n\narbitration        clause--the   scope   question       having   been     explicitly\n\nreferred to the arbitrator by the district court.                  But the claims\n\nwere intertwined and overlapping and it was efficient for the\n\nparties to agree to treat the whole group as within the scope.\n\n              The Sleepers' objections to sending the case to the\n\narbitrator and the manner of its sending were of a different order.\n\nThose objections involved not the scope of the clause but whether\n\nAgway could invoke the arbitration clause at all and whether the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\freference by the district court properly allowed the arbitrator to\n\nconsider other, non-scope objections.     The Sleepers had reason to\n\npreserve such claims for eventual appeal and no obvious motive for\n\nabandoning them.\n\n          Although the stipulation would have been clearer with an\n\nexpress reservation as to these non-scope objections, the Sleepers\n\ndid not waive them. We therefore consider the claims, the district\n\ncourt's legal conclusions being open to de novo review.      Marie v.\n\nAllied Home Mortgage Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2005).      As it\n\nturns out, our interpretation of the stipulation does not affect\n\nthe result: the district court rightly sent the case to the\n\narbitrator and the terms of the reference did not foreclose any of\n\nthe Sleepers' legitimate objections.\n\n          In the district court the Sleepers objected to any\n\nreference--saying that they had never agreed to arbitrate and, in\n\nthe alternative, that the arbitration clause was unenforceable on\n\nvarious grounds.     Claims of the former class--for example, that\n\nthey had never agreed to any arbitration clause--were for the\n\ndistrict court.    AT&T Techs., 475 U.S. at 648-49.   But the district\n\ncourt resolved claims of this type against the Sleepers and they\n\nare not pursued on this appeal.\n\n          By contrast, various claims of unenforceability were made\n\nbut on appeal the Sleepers press only two: that the contracts were\n\nillegal (or \"void ab initio\" as they put it) and that Agway waived\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fits right to arbitrate.       Correctly, the Sleepers assume that such\n\nclaims were properly for the arbitrator; their objection here is\n\nthat   the   wording   of    the   district   court's   reference   to   the\n\narbitrator did not allow the arbitrator to address those claims.\n\n             Indeed, the reference did not refer such claims to the\n\narbitrator as objections to arbitration.         The district judge told\n\nthe arbitrator to determine (i) the scope of the arbitration clause\n\nand (ii) the merits of whichever of the Sleepers' federal claims\n\nfell within the clause's scope. But the district court was correct\n\nin thus framing the issues.         The illegality and waiver arguments\n\npresent different problems and we address them in that order.\n\n             The Sleepers' \"void ab initio\" argument goes to the\n\nvalidity of the substantive provisions of the contract, not to\n\narbitrability.     Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S.\n\n440, 445-446 (2006).        As a matter of federal law, the arbitration\n\nclause is unaffected even if the substance of the contract is\n\notherwise void or voidable.        Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin\n\nMfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 403-04 (1967).           Without this rule, the\n\nmerits of a contractual dispute would often have to be adjudicated\n\nin court in order to determine whether the dispute is arbitrable.\n\n             If the contract was illegal or if Agway's alleged breach\n\nexcused promised performance by the Sleepers, the Sleepers might\n\nthen win the arbitration on the merits.         But illegality or breach\n\nare simply merits issues that affect what performance is due from\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\feach side and what remedies should be ordered.             Here, the void ab\n\ninitio claim was referred to the arbitrator when the court directed\n\nthat the arbitrator rule on \"the merits of the issues\"; and the\n\narbitrator did consider the validity of the contracts under Maine\n\nlaw.\n\n             By   contrast,    a   claim    of   waiver   may     be   a   genuine\n\nchallenge to arbitrability.        See Menorah Ins. Co. v. INX Reins.\n\nCorp., 72 F.3d 218, 221-22 (1st Cir. 1995).                But where a party\n\nchallenges   only      \"procedural\"   arbitrability,        the    court    under\n\nrecently consolidated Supreme Court doctrine is to defer to the\n\narbitrator--for example, as to whether contractual time limits have\n\nbeen adhered to, Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79,\n\n84-85   (2002),   or    prerequisites       (such   as    internal     grievance\n\nprocedures) have been met, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston,\n\n376 U.S. 543, 557 (1964), or laches or estoppel have barred the\n\ninvocation of arbitral rights, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v.\n\nMercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983).\n\n           Waiver claims fall into this category of threshold issues\n\nfor the arbitrator, Howsam, 537 U.S. at 84; cf. Marie, 402 F.3d at\n\n14 (exception for waiver claims based on litigation activity), and\n\nthe Sleepers are correct that the district court did not instruct\n\nthe arbitrator to make that threshold determination.               But a closer\n\nexamination of their original \"waiver\" argument before the district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcourt       reveals   that,   even   if   sufficiently   presented   to   avoid\n\nforfeiture,3 it did not state a genuine challenge to arbitrability.\n\n               Essentially, the waiver claim reflects the Sleepers'\n\nposition that Agway unilaterally withheld payment due by contract;\n\nthat such withholding constituted a breach of contract; further,\n\nthat Agway breached the arbitration clause by taking that self-help\n\nmeasure rather than immediately invoking arbitration to resolve the\n\ndispute; and that the breach or the self-help or both constituted\n\nimplicit waivers of Agway's right to arbitrate now.\n\n               But, as already noted, breach of the substantive contract\n\nis not a permitted objection to arbitrability; it is a merits\n\nquestion, one that the arbitrator considered and based on which\n\neven awarded damages to the Sleepers.           Cf. Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at\n\n404.       To the extent that the Sleepers claim that Agway breached the\n\narbitration clause by resorting to self-help, that is (at least in\n\nform) a procedural arbitrability argument--but one that is utterly\n\nempty: nothing in the agreement or incorporated AAA arbitration\n\n\n\n       3\n      The Sleepers' response to Agway's motion to stay the\nproceedings did make a waiver argument, but it was hidden within a\nsubsection that purports to argue that \"Agway's Own Conduct Reveals\nThat The Parties Never Intended To Make the 'Agway Sales Contract'\nA Basis of their Bargain.\"      The two arguments were conflated\nthroughout, likely contributing to the confusion surrounding the\nargument and who was to decide it.      In their reply brief, the\nSleepers now characterize their argument as an \"issue of Laches or\nEstoppel,\" but the Sleepers did not argue laches or estoppel to the\ndistrict judge or even in their opening brief in this court, which\nalone forfeits that claim. Keeler v. Putnam Fiduciary Trust Co.,\n238 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                          -9-\n\frules       suggests   that   engaging    in    self-help   waives   arbitration\n\nrights.4\n\n               The Sleepers might still insist that because this version\n\nof their waiver claim was in form a procedural arbitrability\n\nobjection (albeit one that lacked merit), they were entitled to\n\nhave the arbitrator rule on it in the first instance.                Arguably, a\n\nclaim so lacking in merit might not need to be referred to\n\narbitration, cf. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-83 (1946); but in\n\nany event this waiver claim was not clearly preserved (note 3,\n\nabove); and, if it had been referred, the arbitrator would have had\n\nto reject it on the merits.\n\n               We turn now to the Sleepers' second group of arguments,\n\ndirected to whether the arbitration award should be vacated.                Our\n\nreview is \"exceedingly narrow,\" In re Vital Basics Inc., 472 F.3d\n\n12, 16 (1st Cir. 2006), and \"tightly circumscribed.\"                 Cytyc Corp.\n\nv. DEKA Prods. Ltd. P'ship, 439 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2006).                  A\n\ndistrict court may set aside an award only on limited grounds.5               We\n\n\n        4\n      Indeed, before the Supreme Court clarified that procedural\narbitrability objections should go to the arbitrator, Howsam, 537\nU.S. at 84-85, courts routinely rejected \"waiver\" arguments of this\nsort.   See Local Union No. 721, United Packinghouse v. Needham\nPacking Co., 376 U.S. 247, 251-53 (1964); Welborn Clinic v.\nMedquist, Inc., 301 F.3d 634, 637 (7th Cir. 2002); Morrie Mages &\nShirlee Mages Found. v. Thrifty Corp., 916 F.2d 402, 404 (7th Cir.\n1990); Southwest Indus. Imp. & Exp., Inc. v. Wilmod Co., 524 F.2d\n468, 469-70 (5th Cir. 1975).\n     5\n      The Federal Arbitration Act enumerates specific grounds for\nwhich an award can be vacated by the district court, 9 U.S.C. ยง\n10(a), and there are limited extra-statutory grounds that could\n\n                                         -10-\n\freview the district court for clear error on factual findings and\n\nde novo as to legal conclusions.   First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.\n\nKaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 947-49 (1995).\n\n          Of the two grounds put forward by the Sleepers for\n\nvacating the award, we need only consider one.      In their brief,\n\nthey assert that the arbitrator acted \"in manifest disregard of the\n\nlaw,\" cf. Prudential-Bache Secs., Inc. v. Tanner, 72 F.3d 234, 240\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), but do not actually make any arguments to support\n\nthat claim.   Instead, they purport to \"incorporate[] by reference\"\n\ntheir motion before the district court.    That is not   acceptable:\n\nthis court will only consider arguments made before this court;\n\neverything else is deemed forfeited. United States v. Beltran, ---\n\nF.3d ---, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 22054, at *4 (1st Cir. Sep. 14\n\n2007).\n\n          Next, the Sleepers attempt to tar the arbitral award as\n\ncontrary to public policy--particularly, the policy reflected in\n\nthe Maine Potato Licensing Act, 7 M.R.S.A. ยง 1022 (2007).      Since\n\nthe statute is designed (they say) to \"protect the potato farmer\n\nfrom the placing of oral planting orders,\" the Sleepers argue that\n\nthe arbitrator should not have invoked the statute of frauds to bar\n\nany of their claims.\n\n\n\n\nalso merit vacatur.    Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st\nCir. 1990).\n\n                                -11-\n\f          Their theory seems to be that if (as they allege) oral\n\ncontracts were made despite the statutory requirement of a detailed\n\nwritten record, those contracts should be enforced against the\n\npurchasers   as    a   form   of   penalty   notwithstanding   the   general\n\ndoctrine that voids such agreements.           But a contract can only be\n\nenforced if it exists--and the arbitrator found that there were no\n\nsuch oral contracts between Agway and the Sleepers; he invoked the\n\nstatute of frauds only as an alternative ground of decision.\n\n          Even if the Sleepers' argument rested on a sound premise,\n\nlegal mistakes by the arbitrator are not automatically subject to\n\ncorrection on judicial review,        United Paperworkers Int'l Union v.\n\nMisco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987), even when they are alleged to\n\ntouch on public policy.       W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, Int'l\n\nUnion of United Rubber, 461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983) (describing\n\nexceptions).      Since the premise fails, we need not fine tune the\n\nlimits on reviewability.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

This case concerns dealings by\n\nAgway Inc., an agricultural cooperative, with Vaughn and Mary\n\nSleeper.     The Sleepers grew seed potatoes on their farm (Sleeper\n\nFarms) in Sherman Mills, Maine, and claim that Agway owes them\n\nmoney for potatoes harvested between 1998 and 2001.            The parties\n\nhave now litigated before a bankruptcy court, an arbitrator, and\n\nthe federal district court twice; Agway has gone bankrupt; the\n\nSleepers are no longer growing potatoes.\n\n           Between 1998 and 2001 (three growing seasons), Agway\n\npurchased seed potatoes from Sleeper Farms; Agway would then re-\n\nsell the crop to other farmers for new plantings.         In June 2000,\n\nAgway withheld some $51,000 of payment, saying that the Sleepers\n\nhad mixed genetically altered potatoes with unaltered potatoes in\n\na shipment.     The parties corresponded about the withheld sum but\n\nreached no agreement; the Sleepers threatened to sue; Agway then\n\nfiled a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration\n\nAssociation (\"AAA\"), which the AAA accepted.\n\n           On February 21, 2002, the Sleepers filed a complaint in\n\nthe federal district court in Maine against Agway and several\n\nindividuals associated with that company.        The complaint included\n\nmultiple common law causes of action and also alleged violations of\n\nvarious state and federal statutes; it challenged, in addition to\n\nthe earlier withholding, other alleged unfair practices by Agway--\n\nunilateral    cutting   of   prices,   refusal   to   accept    quantities\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpreviously ordered, and so on.    The Sleepers moved to enjoin the\n\narbitration, and Agway moved to dismiss or stay court proceedings\n\npending arbitration.   See 9 U.S.C. ยง 3 (2000).\n\n          The district court held an evidentiary hearing on May 15,\n\n2002, after which it denied the motion to enjoin arbitration and\n\ninstead ordered a stay of judicial proceedings pending arbitration.\n\nThe court determined that Sleeper Farms assented to a series of\n\npurchase orders, which incorporated by reference Agway's standard\n\nsales contract, which in turn included an arbitration clause. None\n\nof the Sleepers' objections to arbitrability was accepted.\n\n          The district judge did not reach the question of scope,\n\ni.e. which of the Sleepers' claims fell within the arbitration\n\nclause; that is generally a question for the judge to decide, AT&T\n\nTechs., Inc. v.

In May 2005, the\n\nparties signed an additional stipulation, filed with the AAA, that\n\n\"all issues of liability and damages contained within Sleeper\n\nFarm's Complaint . . . shall be determined through arbitration in\n\nthis forum.\"   The implications of this stipulation are disputed.\n\n           On the merits, in an award issued on December 16, 2005,\n\nthe arbitrator awarded some $82,000 (plus costs) to Sleeper Farms.\n\nHe found that Agway's withholding of payment in June 2000 had been\n\nimproper, but rejected most of the Sleepers' other claims.                  Not\n\nsatisfied with this limited victory, the Sleepers returned to the\n\ndistrict court and moved to vacate the award.2                Agway moved to\n\nconfirm it.    Finding neither fraud nor manifest disregard of law,\n\nthe court upheld the arbitrator's award.\n\n           On appeal, the Sleepers challenge both of the district\n\njudge's   orders:   the   2002   order    referring   the    dispute   to   the\n\narbitrator, and the 2006 order confirming the arbitrator's award.\n\nThe former was not appealable on an interlocutory basis, but as\n\n\n     2\n      There was some debate over whether the bankruptcy court or\nthe district court was the proper forum for the post-arbitration\nmotions, but the bankruptcy court noted that the district court\nproceedings had only been stayed, not dismissed, and therefore\ndirected the parties to return there.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fwith non-final orders generally, it can be challenged along with\n\nthe final judgment.

We first\n\nconsider the challenges to the initial order.\n\n              As    a   threshold   matter,     Agway     points    out    that   the\n\nstipulation stated that the Sleepers agreed to have \"all issues of\n\nliability and damages\" resolved through arbitration.                       It argues\n\nthat none of the objections to the July 2002 order matter anymore,\n\nclaiming      the    stipulation    signed     by   the   parties    provided      an\n\nindependent basis for the arbitrator's authority. Indeed, as Agway\n\nreads   the    stipulation,      the   Sleepers     abandoned      their    original\n\nobjection to the reference.\n\n              Agway's position is arguable, but we think that the more\n\nreasonable reading of the stipulation favors the Sleepers.                    At the\n\narbitration, the parties could have continued to argue about which\n\nof the numerous claims made by the Sleepers fell within the\n\narbitration        clause--the   scope   question       having   been     explicitly\n\nreferred to the arbitrator by the district court.                  But the claims\n\nwere intertwined and overlapping and it was efficient for the\n\nparties to agree to treat the whole group as within the scope.\n\n              The Sleepers' objections to sending the case to the\n\narbitrator and the manner of its sending were of a different order.\n\nThose objections involved not the scope of the clause but whether\n\nAgway could invoke the arbitration clause at all and whether the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\freference by the district court properly allowed the arbitrator to\n\nconsider other, non-scope objections.     The Sleepers had reason to\n\npreserve such claims for eventual appeal and no obvious motive for\n\nabandoning them.\n\n          Although the stipulation would have been clearer with an\n\nexpress reservation as to these non-scope objections, the Sleepers\n\ndid not waive them. We therefore consider the claims, the district\n\ncourt's legal conclusions being open to de novo review.

As it\n\nturns out, our interpretation of the stipulation does not affect\n\nthe result: the district court rightly sent the case to the\n\narbitrator and the terms of the reference did not foreclose any of\n\nthe Sleepers' legitimate objections.\n\n          In the district court the Sleepers objected to any\n\nreference--saying that they had never agreed to arbitrate and, in\n\nthe alternative, that the arbitration clause was unenforceable on\n\nvarious grounds.     Claims of the former class--for example, that\n\nthey had never agreed to any arbitration clause--were for the\n\ndistrict court.    AT&T Techs., 475 U.S. at 648-49.   But the district\n\ncourt resolved claims of this type against the Sleepers and they\n\nare not pursued on this appeal.\n\n          By contrast, various claims of unenforceability were made\n\nbut on appeal the Sleepers press only two: that the contracts were\n\nillegal (or \"void ab initio\" as they put it) and that Agway waived\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fits right to arbitrate.       Correctly, the Sleepers assume that such\n\nclaims were properly for the arbitrator; their objection here is\n\nthat   the   wording   of    the   district   court's   reference   to   the\n\narbitrator did not allow the arbitrator to address those claims.\n\n             Indeed, the reference did not refer such claims to the\n\narbitrator as objections to arbitration.         The district judge told\n\nthe arbitrator to determine (i) the scope of the arbitration clause\n\nand (ii) the merits of whichever of the Sleepers' federal claims\n\nfell within the clause's scope. But the district court was correct\n\nin thus framing the issues.         The illegality and waiver arguments\n\npresent different problems and we address them in that order.\n\n             The Sleepers' \"void ab initio\" argument goes to the\n\nvalidity of the substantive provisions of the contract, not to\n\narbitrability.

Without this rule, the\n\nmerits of a contractual dispute would often have to be adjudicated\n\nin court in order to determine whether the dispute is arbitrable.\n\n             If the contract was illegal or if Agway's alleged breach\n\nexcused promised performance by the Sleepers, the Sleepers might\n\nthen win the arbitration on the merits.         But illegality or breach\n\nare simply merits issues that affect what performance is due from\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\feach side and what remedies should be ordered.             Here, the void ab\n\ninitio claim was referred to the arbitrator when the court directed\n\nthat the arbitrator rule on \"the merits of the issues\"; and the\n\narbitrator did consider the validity of the contracts under Maine\n\nlaw.\n\n             By   contrast,    a   claim    of   waiver   may     be   a   genuine\n\nchallenge to arbitrability.

Marie, 402 F.3d at\n\n14 (exception for waiver claims based on litigation activity), and\n\nthe Sleepers are correct that the district court did not instruct\n\nthe arbitrator to make that threshold determination.               But a closer\n\nexamination of their original \"waiver\" argument before the district\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcourt       reveals   that,   even   if   sufficiently   presented   to   avoid\n\nforfeiture,3 it did not state a genuine challenge to arbitrability.\n\n               Essentially, the waiver claim reflects the Sleepers'\n\nposition that Agway unilaterally withheld payment due by contract;\n\nthat such withholding constituted a breach of contract; further,\n\nthat Agway breached the arbitration clause by taking that self-help\n\nmeasure rather than immediately invoking arbitration to resolve the\n\ndispute; and that the breach or the self-help or both constituted\n\nimplicit waivers of Agway's right to arbitrate now.\n\n               But, as already noted, breach of the substantive contract\n\nis not a permitted objection to arbitrability; it is a merits\n\nquestion, one that the arbitrator considered and based on which\n\neven awarded damages to the Sleepers.           Cf. Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at\n\n404.       To the extent that the Sleepers claim that Agway breached the\n\narbitration clause by resorting to self-help, that is (at least in\n\nform) a procedural arbitrability argument--but one that is utterly\n\nempty: nothing in the agreement or incorporated AAA arbitration\n\n\n\n       3\n      The Sleepers' response to Agway's motion to stay the\nproceedings did make a waiver argument, but it was hidden within a\nsubsection that purports to argue that \"Agway's Own Conduct Reveals\nThat The Parties Never Intended To Make the 'Agway Sales Contract'\nA Basis of their Bargain.\"      The two arguments were conflated\nthroughout, likely contributing to the confusion surrounding the\nargument and who was to decide it.      In their reply brief, the\nSleepers now characterize their argument as an \"issue of Laches or\nEstoppel,\" but the Sleepers did not argue laches or estoppel to the\ndistrict judge or even in their opening brief in this court, which\nalone forfeits that claim.
