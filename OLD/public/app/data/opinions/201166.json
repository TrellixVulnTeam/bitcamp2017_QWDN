Goad, Attorney, Civil Division, with whom Peter D.\nKeisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Linda S.\nWendtland,   Assistant  Director,   Office   of  Immigration   and\nLitigation, were on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          August 2, 2004\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    Yusufu Billy Settenda and Maria\n\nRhita Nabawanga, natives and citizens of Uganda, seek review of the\n\ndecision by a single member of the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) to deny their applications for asylum under the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act (INA) § 208(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a), withholding\n\nof removal under INA § 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and relief\n\nunder Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT).1   We deny the petition.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           Settenda and Nabawanga traveled separately from Uganda to\n\nthe United States on business visas in 1999.    The following year,\n\nthe INS charged them both as being removable from the United States\n\nunder INA § 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who\n\nremained beyond the time authorized.     Petitioners conceded that\n\nthey were removable as charged and applied for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and protection under CAT.        During several merits\n\nhearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ), Settenda claimed that\n\nhe was a member of the Ugandan Internal Security Organization\n\n(ISO), and, in that capacity, had been assigned to investigate the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (2000)).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdeath of Ugandan Prince Charles Happy Kiganangoma.2                        Settenda\n\ntestified that his investigation implicated certain high-level\n\ngovernment officials in the Prince's death, including his immediate\n\nsuperior at ISO.       Settenda claimed that he was threatened and that\n\ntwo   attempts     were     made   on    his    life    as   a    result       of   his\n\ninvestigation.         Further, Settenda attested that because of the\n\ninformation he possessed about governmental involvement in Prince\n\nKiganangoma's      death,    he    feared      persecution       and    torture      by\n\ngovernment officials should he return to Uganda.\n\n              After the merits hearings, the IJ found that Settenda's\n\ntestimony lacked credibility, was inconsistent and implausible on\n\nkey points, and was not supported by the submitted documentary\n\nevidence.      After citing several portions of Settenda's testimony\n\nand   their    deficiencies,       the   IJ    stated   that     she    \"believe[d]\n\n[Settenda] is afraid to return to Uganda but the true reasons for\n\nhis fear and the exact nature of the harm he fears had not been\n\npresented to this Court in a straightforward or truthful manner.\"\n\nThe IJ found that Settenda \"provided information and evidence which\n\nis not correct or truthful concerning his investigation into a\n\nhighly    publicized      political      murder.\"       Finally,       again    citing\n\nspecifically      to    portions    of    Settenda's     testimony       that       were\n\ninconsistent, implausible, or both, the IJ stated that \"[b]ased on\n\n\n\n      2\n      Nabawanga's asylum claim is derivative of Settenda's\napplication, and so we treat Settenda as the lead petitioner.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fall the evidence before me, . . . [Settenda] has not provided what\n\nto this Court is credible, complete and truthful information\n\nconcerning his activities with the ISO, his reasons for leaving\n\nUganda and what exactly he fears would happen if he comes back.\"\n\nAccordingly, the IJ denied the relief sought but nevertheless\n\ngranted petitioners voluntary departure under INA § 240B, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229C.\n\n            On appeal to the BIA, a single member of the Board\n\nrejected    petitioners'    claims,     specifically      relying    upon    and\n\naffirming     the   IJ's   findings     that      the   \"testimony    was    not\n\nsufficiently credible and the evidence presented was not adequate\n\nto support the [petitioners’] burden of proof.\"                The BIA also\n\nstated that\n\n            [o]verall, we agree with the Immigration Judge\n            that the testimony, of limited credibility and\n            lacking   in   detail,   combined   with   the\n            inadequate   documentary   support,   provides\n            insufficient evidence to meet the overall\n            burden of proof. On this same basis, we agree\n            that the record does not provide prima facie\n            evidence that it would be more likely than not\n            that the [petitioners] would face torture if\n            returned to their native country.          We,\n            therefore, agree they are ineligible for\n            relief under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n            In his petition to this court, Settenda makes three\n\narguments: first, that his testimony was credible and establishes\n\nhis eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal; second, that\n\nthe IJ and BIA failed to analyze his CAT claim under the proper\n\nlegal   standard;    and   third,   that    the    single-member     BIA    order\n\n                                      -4-\n\fviolated the applicable regulations and his rights under the Fifth\n\nAmendment's Due Process Clause.             After describing the standards of\n\nreview, we analyze these arguments seriatim.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            \"Ordinarily, Courts of Appeals review decisions of the\n\n[BIA], and not those of an IJ.              When the BIA does not render its\n\nown opinion, however, and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion\n\nof the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the\n\nIJ.\"   Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting\n\nGao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002)).               We will uphold\n\ndecisions    of    the    IJ   and    BIA     \"if   supported   by    reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). This standard applies both to asylum and\n\nwithholding claims as well as to claims brought under CAT.                     See,\n\ne.g., Pieterson v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2004).                    We\n\nwill reverse only if the petitioner's evidence would compel a\n\nreasonable   factfinder        to    conclude   that   relief   was    warranted.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84 (codified at INA § 242(b)(4)(B),\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B) (\"the administrative findings of fact are\n\nconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nconclude    to    the    contrary\")).        Appellate   courts      review   legal\n\nconclusions de novo, Manzoor v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 254 F.3d\n\n342, 346 (1st Cir. 2001), including alleged errors related to due\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fprocess claims,      Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 129 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n                A.    Asylum and Withholding of Removal\n\n            Settenda bore the burden of establishing his eligibility\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal.       8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a).     To\n\nbe eligible for asylum, Settenda had to prove that he was a refugee\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1), meaning that he was \"unable or\n\nunwilling to return to . . . [Uganda] because of persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining \"refugee\").            A\n\npetitioner who is unable to establish eligibility for asylum a\n\nfortiori    fails    to   establish   eligibility   for   withholding   of\n\ndeportation.    Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nsee also, Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 261 n.2 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"Because a failure to prove eligibility for asylum under INA §\n\n208, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, necessarily means a failure to meet the\n\nrequirements for withholding of deportation, we only discuss the\n\nformer.\" ).    An applicant must support his claim through credible\n\ntestimony at all stages of the proceedings, and if the testimony is\n\ncredible, it \"may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof\n\nwithout corroboration.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a).\n\n            The IJ's well documented finding that Settenda failed to\n\nsupport his application for asylum and withholding with credible\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ftestimony dooms his claim on appeal.                   \"[T]he IJ must, if he or she\n\nchooses     to     reject   [the        petitioner's]       testimony      as   lacking\n\ncredibility,       offer    a    specific,       cogent    reason    for   [the      IJ's]\n\ndisbelief.\"        Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                        Here, the IJ\n\ndetailed     the    reasons       for    her     conclusions,       drawing     on    her\n\nobservations of Settenda while testifying as well as analyzing the\n\ninconsistencies in and improbability of portions of the testimony.\n\nSimilarly, the BIA identified the portions of the IJ's findings--\n\nnamely, the general lack of credibility of Settenda's testimony and\n\nthe   inadequate      documentary         support--which       it    relied     on     and\n\naffirmed.    See Salazar v. Ashcroft 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing Chen v. INS, 87 F.3d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1996), for the\n\nproposition that \"if the Board's view is that the IJ 'got it\n\nright,' the law does not demand that the Board go through the idle\n\nmotions of dressing the IJ's findings in its own prose\" and that\n\nthe BIA \"may simply state that it affirms the IJ's decision for the\n\nreasons set forth in that decision\").                       The IJ made detailed\n\nfindings    about     the       deficiencies      in    Settenda's    testimony       and\n\ndocumentary evidence and why she found his testimony not to be\n\ncredible; the BIA specifically affirmed and adopted those findings.\n\nOur review reveals that far from compelling a conclusion contrary\n\nto that reached by the IJ and BIA, see Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f483-84, the    findings       of   the   IJ    are   supported   by   substantial\n\nevidence.     On this record, we find no error.\n\n         B.    Relief Under the Convention Against Torture\n\n            An applicant seeking protection under CAT must establish\n\n\"that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured if removed\"\n\nto the proposed country of removal.              Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, 329\n\nF.3d 191, 196 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2)).\n\n\"For an act to constitute torture it must be: (1) an act causing\n\nsevere physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally\n\ninflicted;    (3)   for   a    proscribed       purpose;   (4)   by   or   at   the\n\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5)\n\nnot arising from lawful sanctions.\"              Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d\n\n392, 398 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 291,\n\n297 (BIA 2002)).     See also 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).\n\n            Settenda claims that the IJ and BIA failed to apply the\n\ncorrect legal standard in denying his request for relief under CAT\n\nbecause the undisputed portions of his testimony, along with the\n\nU.S. State Department's 2001 Ugandan country conditions report,\n\nestablish that he will be tortured if he returns to Uganda.\n\nSpecifically, Settenda argues (1) that his testimony showed that he\n\nwould be tried and convicted for desertion, and possibly treason,\n\nin a Ugandan military court, and (2) the State Department country\n\nconditions report, along with an Amnesty International report,\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\festablish that prison conditions in Uganda meet the definition of\n\ntorture under CAT.     In reply, the government seems to urge that the\n\nIJ's credibility determinations alone foreclose Settenda's claim\n\nfor relief under CAT and that the CAT claim should be denied\n\nbecause the asylum and withholding claims were properly denied.\n\n            While we have not addressed the precise contours of the\n\ndifferent standards petitioners must meet to support a claim for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal as compared to relief under CAT,\n\nwe   have   observed   that   a   CAT    claim,   which   requires   that   the\n\npetitioner show that it is more likely than not he would be\n\ntortured upon return to his country, establishes a higher burden of\n\nproof than an asylum claim, which requires that the petitioner show\n\na well founded fear of persecution.           El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331\n\nF.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir. 2003).3          This distinction has prompted one\n\ncourt to observe that CAT's \"reach is both broader and narrower\n\nthan that of a claim for asylum or withholding of deportation:\n\ncoverage is broader because a petitioner need not show that he or\n\nshe would be tortured 'on account of' a protected ground; it is\n\nnarrower, however, because the petitioner must show that it is\n\n'more likely than not' that he or she will be tortured, and not\n\nsimply persecuted upon removal to a given country.\"             Kamalthas v.\n\nINS, 251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n\n      3\n      We have also observed that while aggravated felons                    are\nstatutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding, they                     are\neligible for relief under CAT. Saint Fort, 329 F.3d at 195.\n\n                                        -9-\n\f            Additionally, unlike some of our sister circuits, we have\n\nnot addressed whether an adverse credibility finding that defeats\n\na request for asylum a fortiori defeats a claim for relief under\n\nCAT.   See Mansour v. INS, 230 F.3d 902, 906-09 (7th Cir. 2000)\n\n(holding that the BIA failed to properly consider petitioner's CAT\n\nclaim when it denied the motion to reopen because of an adverse\n\ncredibility finding regarding the petitioner's request for asylum).\n\nWe think a per se rule that an adverse credibility determination on\n\nasylum automatically defeats an application under CAT would be\n\nerroneous.    Each case will vary with the facts.             While an adverse\n\ncredibility determination on asylum would doom some CAT claims, it\n\nwould not doom others.\n\n            Here, Settenda argues that the IJ's adverse credibility\n\nfindings    were   not   applicable    to    at   least   a    portion   of   his\n\ntestimony, citing the IJ's statement that \"[i]n the testimony of\n\nboth [Settenda] and his wife, threats have been made that he would\n\nbe [brought] to justice if he returns to Uganda.              He may, according\n\nto the way justice works in Uganda, have reasons to believe that he\n\ncould be harmed through an extrajudicial trial or other treatment\n\n. . . .    Most clearly, this respondent has indicated that he fears\n\nharm because he abandoned his duties.\"            Settenda claims that this\n\nfinding, coupled with country condition reports, substantiates his\n\nCAT claim even though his asylum and withholding claims were\n\nrejected.    Even if these statements by the IJ could be read as\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcrediting Settenda's testimony that he will be subjected to a\n\nmilitary trial and subsequently imprisoned -- a matter on which we\n\ntake no view -- Settenda's CAT claim still founders as a matter of\n\nlaw.   In light of relevant precedent, it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe BIA to conclude that the documentary evidence does not support\n\nthe    legal     conclusion   that     the        trial   and   prison     conditions\n\nconstitute torture.\n\n               Settenda    cites     the    following       portion   of the State\n\nDepartment country conditions report for Uganda to substantiate his\n\nclaim that he will be tortured if returned to his home country.\n\n               The military court system does not assure the\n               right to a fair trial. Although the accused\n               has the right to retain legal counsel,\n               military defense attorneys often are untrained\n               and may be assigned by the military command,\n               which also appoints the prosecutor and the\n               adjudicating officer. The sentence passed by\n               the military court, which can include the\n               death penalty, may be appealed to the high\n               command but not to the High or Supreme Courts.\n\nAdditionally, Settenda draws attention to the State Department's\n\nconclusion       that    \"[p]rison    conditions          remain   harsh    and   life\n\nthreatening. . . .         Both civilian and military prisons have high\n\nmortality rates from overcrowding, malnutrition, diseases spread by\n\nunsanitary conditions, and HIV/AIDS.\"                 The report goes on to say\n\nthat    the     Uganda    Human    Rights     Commission        \"reported    severely\n\ninadequate medical services, seriously unhygienic conditions, and\n\na situation of 'semi-starvation' among prisoners in many prisons.\"\n\nSimilarly, Amnesty International's 2000 Uganda report found that\n\n                                           -11-\n\f\"[p]rison conditions were harsh, with severe overcrowding, and\n\ndisease was rife.\"\n\n            The BIA rejected a similar claim by a Haitian citizen who\n\nasserted that he would be tortured if returned to Haiti because, as\n\na    repatriated   convict,     he   would     be   subjected    to   indefinite\n\ndetention and imprisonment in the Haitian prison system.                 See    In\n\nre J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 291 (BIA 2002) (relied upon by Elien v.\n\nAshcroft,   364    F.3d   392   (1st    Cir.   2004)).     There,     the    State\n\nDepartment report on Haiti indicated that \"prison facilities are\n\novercrowded and inadequate.            Haitian prisoners are deprived of\n\nadequate food, water, medical care, sanitation, and exercise. Many\n\nprisoners are malnourished.\"           Id. at 293.     Notwithstanding these\n\ngross inadequacies, the BIA concluded that the indefinite detention\n\nand severely substandard prison conditions did not constitute\n\ntorture under CAT, even though they might very well be considered\n\n\"cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment.\"                     Id. at\n\n301, 304.\n\n            Additionally, the petitioner in In re J-E- established\n\nthat isolated acts of torture occurred in Haitian prisons, such as\n\nburning with cigarettes and use of electric shock.                However, the\n\nBIA found that he \"failed to establish that it was more likely than\n\nnot that [he] will be subject to torture if he is removed to Haiti.\n\nFor example, there is no evidence that deliberately inflicted acts\n\nof    torture   are   pervasive      and   widespread;    that    the    Haitian\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fauthorities use torture as a matter of policy; or that meaningful\n\ninternational oversight or intervention is lacking.\"          Id. at 303.\n\n           Settenda's case is on all fours with In re J-E- and\n\nElien.   It was not unreasonable for the BIA to conclude that as\n\nalarming as the prison conditions in Uganda may be, they do not\n\nconstitute torture under CAT. Unchallenged INS regulations provide\n\nthat \"[i]n order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically\n\nintended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.18.     There is no evidence of that here.     In fact, as\n\nin In re J-E-, the State Department report indicates that \"[t]he\n\nharsh conditions largely resulted from the Government's seriously\n\ninadequate funding of prison facilities.\"        Also mirroring In re J-\n\nE-, the State Department found that \"[t]he central prison system\n\ncontinued to work with [non-governmental organizations] and the\n\ndonor community to improve prison buildings, water and sanitation\n\nsystems, food, and uniforms.\" While \"[p]rogress has been minimal,\"\n\nthe report also found that \"Government agencies have sponsored or\n\nparticipated in numerous conferences on the justice system and\n\nprison   conditions,    and   worked   closely   with   international   and\n\ndomestic human rights organizations on prison reform efforts.\n\nThere were reports that mortality rates decreased following these\n\nactivities.\" Finally, as in In re J-E-, the State Department noted\n\nthat the International Committee of the Red Cross and several local\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fnon-governmental organizations were permitted access to the prison\n\nsystem.\n\n           To the extent that the State Department's report on\n\nUganda mentions isolated incidents of torture within the prison\n\nsystem, Settenda, like the petitioner in In re J-E-, brought forth\n\nno evidence that those incidents of torture are so prevalent in\n\nUgandan prisons that, more likely than not, he would be tortured\n\nthere. Accordingly, we leave undisturbed the denial of relief under\n\nCAT.\n\n          C.   Violation of BIA Regulations and Due Process\n\n           Citing to 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(1), (d)(3), and (e),\n\nSettenda claims that the BIA's single-member decision in this case\n\ncontravened its own regulations and violated his due process\n\nrights.   The relevant regulations were part of procedural reforms\n\nto   improve   case   management    and    were   issued   to   improve   the\n\nefficiency of the BIA and to allow one-member resolutions of a\n\ngreater   variety     of   cases.   Id.      Specifically,      8   C.F.R.   §\n\n1003.1(e)(5) provides that\n\n           [i]f the Board member to whom an appeal is\n           assigned determines, upon consideration of the\n           merits, that the decision is not appropriate\n           for affirmance without opinion, the Board\n           member shall issue a brief order affirming,\n           modifying, or remanding the decision under\n           review, unless the Board member designates the\n           case for decision by a three-member panel under\n           paragraph (e)(6) of this section under the\n           standards of the case management plan.\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fId.    Petitioners argue that § 1003.1(e)(5)'s provision for a brief\n\norder by a single member conflicts with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(a)(7),\n\nwhich provides that \"[i]f the Board Member determines that the\n\ndecision is not appropriate for affirmance without opinion, the\n\ncase will be assigned to a three-member panel for review and\n\ndecision.\"      Settenda argues that § 1003.1(a)(7) compels the Board\n\nto either issue a single member affirmance without opinion, or to\n\nsend    the   case   to   a   three-member    panel.      This   argument   is\n\nunavailing.\n\n              While these two provisions might seem to conflict on\n\ntheir face, the comments regarding the new provision, under the\n\nheading \"Expanded Single Member Review,\" explain that\n\n              [o]ne of the primary components of the case\n              management system is expanded single-member\n              review. The current streamlining process\n              permits a single Board member to affirm the\n              decision of the immigration judge without\n              opinion. 8 CFR 3.1(a)(7) [now moved to 8\n              C.F.R. § 1003.1(a)(7)]. The final rule retains\n              this current practice intact, but expands upon\n              this authority to permit a single Board member\n              to affirm, modify, or remand the immigration\n              judge's decision with a short explanation.\n\n67 Fed. Reg. 54878, *54885 (citation omitted).             The government's\n\nbrief suggests that these comments indicate that § 1003.1(a)(7) was\n\nnot deleted from the regulations due to a clerical error.                  This\n\nargument is supported by the comprehensive § 1003.1(e) \"case\n\nmanagement     system\"    that   contains    provisions   for    initial   case\n\nscreening (§ 1003.1(e)(1)); dispositions of motions and procedural\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\for ministerial issues (§ 1003.1(e)(2)); triage of cases receiving\n\na merits review (§ 1003.1(e)(3)); affirmance without opinion by a\n\nsingle Board member (§ 1003.1(e)(4)); brief orders by a single\n\nBoard member (§ 1003.1(e)(5)); and three-member panel decisions (§\n\n1003.1(e)(6)).       It is particularly notable that § 1003.1(e)(4)\n\nprovides that a single member of the Board may issue an affirmance\n\nwithout   opinion,    as   does   §   1003.1(a)(7),   which   is   cited   by\n\nSettenda.\n\n            The Board member to whom a case is assigned\n            shall affirm the decision of the Service or\n            the immigration judge, without opinion, if the\n            Board member determines that the result\n            reached in the decision under review was\n            correct; that any errors in the decision under\n            review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that\n            (A) The issues on appeal are squarely\n            controlled by existing Board or federal court\n            precedent and do not involve the application\n            of precedent to a novel factual situation; or\n            (B) The factual and legal issues raised on\n            appeal are not so substantial that the case\n            warrants the issuance of a written opinion in\n            the case.\n\nId. § 1003.1(e)(4).     The duplication of provisions providing for a\n\nsingle member affirmance without opinion supports the government's\n\ncontention that a clerical error led to the continued inclusion of\n\nthe now duplicative § 1003.1(a)(7).          In any event, the comments to\n\nthe final rule make clear that the agency intended to expand the\n\npurview of single members to go beyond issuing an affirmance\n\nwithout opinion and include the ability to issue a brief order\n\ndisposing of the case.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f            Finally, even if 1003(e)(5), which was adopted in 2002,\n\nconflicts with § 1003(a)(7), which was adopted earlier, we note\n\nthat the more recent, specific enactment supercedes the older, more\n\ngeneral one.    Cf. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA,\n\n824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir. 1987)(\"Using familiar statutory\n\ninterpretation, when there is such a conflict, the most recent and\n\nmore specific congressional pronouncement will prevail over a\n\nprior, more generalized statute.\"). See also Batalova v. Ashcroft,\n\n355 F.3d 1246, 1252 (10th Cir. 2004)(upholding 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(e)(5)\n\nwhich was recodified and renumbered as § 1003(e)(5)).        In light of\n\nthe explicit language allowing a single Board member to \"issue a\n\nbrief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the decision under\n\nreview,\" § 1003.1(e)(5), which is part of a recently enacted\n\ncomprehensive case management scheme, we find that the BIA's use of\n\nthis procedure did not contravene its own regulations.\n\n            Finally, we briefly address Settenda's due process claim.\n\nWe have already ruled that the BIA's streamlined procedures do not\n\nviolate petitioners' due process rights. See, e.g., Albathani, 318\n\nF.3d at 375-78 (holding that the BIA's \"affirmance without opinion\"\n\nprocedure    does   not   violate   due    process).   If   due   process\n\nrequirements are met when the BIA affirms the IJ's finding without\n\nissuing any opinion, the due process requirements are certainly met\n\nwhen the BIA affirms the IJ's finding with a brief explanatory\n\norder. Similarly, we reject Settenda's claim that the BIA violated\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fhis due process rights by allegedly failing to provide a clear\n\nadministrative finding         or adequately review and establish the\n\nrecord of the case.     Again, while the BIA \"is obliged to weigh all\n\nthe pertinent factors . . ., to exhibit due consideration for the\n\nuniverse    of   weighted   factors    when    tallying   the    equities,   to\n\nexercise independent judgment, and to state plainly its reasons for\n\ngranting or denying relief,\" Chen v. INS, 87 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1996), it is well established that the \"BIA can adopt, without\n\nfurther explication, the IJ's opinion.\" Albathani, 318 F.3d at 377.\n\nSee also Chen, 87 F.3d at 8 (\"[W]e join eight of our sister\n\ncircuits in ruling that the Board need not write at length merely\n\nto repeat the IJ's findings of fact and his reasons for denying the\n\nrequested    relief,    but,    rather,      having   given     individualized\n\nconsideration to a particular case, may simply state that it\n\naffirms the IJ's decision for the reasons set forth in that\n\ndecision.\") (listing cases).       Here, the BIA opinion indicates that\n\nit gave individualized attention to Settenda's case, reviewed the\n\nrecord, and exercised independent judgment. Furthermore, it stated\n\nplainly its reasons for affirming the IJ's decision. Therefore, on\n\nthis record, we find no deprivation of Settenda's due process\n\nrights.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f",

The following year, the INS charged them both as being removable from the United States under INA &#167; 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who remained beyond the time authorized. Petitioners conceded that they were removable as charged and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. During several merits hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ), Settenda claimed that he was a member of the Ugandan Internal Security Organization (ISO), and, in that capacity, had been assigned to investigate the death of Ugandan Prince Charles Happy Kiganangoma.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Settenda testified that his investigation implicated certain high-level government officials in the Prince's death, including his immediate superior at ISO. Settenda claimed that he was threatened and that two attempts were made on his life as a result of his investigation. Further, Settenda attested that because of the information he possessed about governmental involvement in Prince Kiganangoma's death, he feared persecution and torture by government officials should he return to Uganda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the merits hearings, the IJ found that Settenda's testimony lacked credibility, was inconsistent and implausible on key points, and was not supported by the submitted documentary evidence. After citing several portions of Settenda's testimony and their deficiencies, the IJ stated that she \"believe [d] [Settenda] is afraid to return to Uganda but the true reasons for his fear and the exact nature of the harm he fears had not been presented to this Court in a straightforward or truthful manner.\" The IJ found that Settenda \"provided information and evidence which is not correct or truthful concerning his investigation into a highly publicized political murder.\" Finally, again citing specifically to portions of Settenda's testimony that were inconsistent, implausible, or both, the IJ stated that \"[b]ased on all the evidence before me, ... [Settenda] has not provided what to this Court is credible, complete and truthful information concerning his activities with the ISO, his reasons for leaving Uganda and what exactly he fears would happen if he comes back.\" Accordingly, the IJ denied the relief sought but nevertheless granted petitioners voluntary departure under INA &#167; 240B, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the BIA, a single member of the Board rejected petitioners' claims, specifically relying upon and affirming the IJ's findings that the \"testimony was not sufficiently credible and the evidence presented was not adequate to support the [petitioners'] burden of proof.\" The BIA also stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]verall, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the testimony, of limited credibility and lacking in detail, combined with the inadequate documentary support, provides insufficient evidence to meet the overall burden of proof.

Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settenda bore the burden of establishing his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(a). To be eligible for asylum, Settenda had to prove that he was a refugee under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1), meaning that he was \"unable or unwilling to return to ... [Uganda] because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining \"refugee\"). A petitioner who is unable to establish eligibility for asylum <i>a fortiori</i> fails to establish eligibility for withholding of deportation. <i>Khem v.

An applicant must support his claim through credible testimony at all stages of the proceedings, and if the testimony is credible, it \"may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's well documented finding that Settenda failed to support his application for asylum and withholding with credible testimony dooms his claim on appeal. \"[T]he IJ must, if he or she chooses to reject [the petitioner's] testimony as lacking credibility, offer a specific, cogent reason for [the IJ's] disbelief.\" <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 47 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the IJ detailed the reasons for her conclusions, drawing on her observations of Settenda while testifying as well as analyzing the inconsistencies in and improbability of portions of the testimony. Similarly, the BIA identified the portions of the IJ's findings &#8212; namely, the general lack of credibility of Settenda's testimony and the inadequate documentary support &#8212; which it relied on and affirmed. <i>See Salazar v. Ashcroft 359 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir.2004)</i> (citing <i>Chen v. INS,</i> 87 F.3d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir.1996), for the proposition that \"if the Board's view is that the IJ `got it right,' the law does not demand that the Board go through the idle motions of dressing the IJ's findings in its own prose\" and that the BIA \"may simply state that it affirms the IJ's decision for the reasons set forth in that decision\"). The IJ made detailed findings about the deficiencies in Settenda's testimony and documentary evidence and why she found his testimony not to be credible; the BIA specifically affirmed and adopted those findings. Our review reveals that far from compelling a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ and BIA, <i>see Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,</i> the findings of the IJ are supported by substantial evidence.

Specifically, Settenda argues (1) that his testimony showed that he would be tried and convicted for desertion, and possibly treason, in a Ugandan military court, and (2) the State Department country conditions report, along with an Amnesty International report, establish that prison conditions in Uganda meet the definition of torture under CAT. In reply, the government seems to urge that the IJ's credibility determinations alone foreclose Settenda's claim for relief under CAT and that the CAT claim should be denied because the asylum and withholding claims were properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have not addressed the precise contours of the different standards petitioners must meet to support a claim for asylum and withholding of removal as compared to relief under CAT, we have observed that a CAT claim, which requires that the petitioner show that it is more likely than not he would be tortured upon return to his country, establishes a higher burden of proof than an asylum claim, which requires that the petitioner show a well founded fear of persecution. <i>El Moraghy v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.3d 195, 205 (1st Cir.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This distinction has prompted one court to observe that CAT's \"reach is both broader and narrower than that of a claim for asylum or withholding of deportation: coverage is broader because a petitioner need not show that he or she would be tortured `on account of' a protected ground; it is narrower, however, because the petitioner must show that it is `more likely than not' that he or she will be tortured, and not simply persecuted upon removal to a given country.\" <i>Kamalthas v. INS,</i> 251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, unlike some of our sister circuits, we have not addressed whether an adverse credibility finding that defeats a request for asylum <i>a fortiori</i> defeats a claim for relief under CAT. <i>See Mansour v. INS, 230 F.3d 902, 906-09 (7th Cir.2000)</i> (holding that the BIA failed to properly consider petitioner's CAT claim when it denied the motion to reopen because of an adverse credibility finding regarding the petitioner's request for asylum). We think a <i>per se</i> rule that an adverse credibility determination on asylum automatically defeats an application under CAT would be erroneous. Each case will vary with the facts. While an adverse credibility determination on asylum would doom some CAT claims, it would not doom others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Settenda argues that the IJ's adverse credibility findings were not applicable to at least a portion of his testimony, citing the IJ's statement that \"[i]n the testimony of both [Settenda] and his wife, threats have been made that he would be [brought] to justice if he returns to Uganda. He may, according to the way justice works in Uganda, have reasons to believe that he could be harmed through an extrajudicial trial or other treatment.... Most clearly, this respondent has indicated that he fears harm because he abandoned his duties.\" Settenda claims that this finding, coupled with country condition reports, substantiates his CAT claim even though his asylum and withholding claims were rejected. Even if these statements by the IJ could be read as crediting Settenda's testimony that he will be subjected to a military trial and subsequently imprisoned &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Settenda's CAT claim still founders as a matter of law. In light of relevant precedent, it was not unreasonable for the BIA to conclude that the documentary evidence does not support the legal conclusion that the trial and prison conditions constitute torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settenda cites the following portion of the State Department country conditions report for Uganda to substantiate his claim that he will be tortured if returned to his home country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The military court system does not assure the right to a fair trial. Although the accused has the right to retain legal counsel, military defense attorneys often are untrained and may be assigned by the military command, which also appoints the prosecutor and the adjudicating officer. The sentence passed by the military court, which can include the death penalty, may be appealed to the high command but not to the High or Supreme Courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Settenda draws attention to the State Department's conclusion that \"[p]rison conditions remain harsh and life threatening.... Both civilian and military prisons have high mortality rates from overcrowding, malnutrition, diseases spread by unsanitary conditions, and HIV/AIDS.\" The report goes on to say that the Uganda Human Rights Commission \"reported severely inadequate medical services, seriously unhygienic conditions, and a situation of `semi-starvation' among prisoners in many prisons.\" Similarly, Amnesty International's 2000 Uganda report found that \"[p]rison conditions were harsh, with severe overcrowding, and disease was rife.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA rejected a similar claim by a Haitian citizen who asserted that he would be tortured if returned to Haiti because, as a repatriated convict, he would be subjected to indefinite detention and imprisonment in the Haitian prison system. <i>See In re J-E-, 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291, 2002 WL 481156 (BIA 2002)</i> (relied upon by <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 392 (1st Cir.2004)). There, the State Department report on Haiti indicated that \"prison facilities are overcrowded and inadequate. Haitian prisoners are deprived of adequate food, water, medical care, sanitation, and exercise. Many prisoners are malnourished.\" <i>Id.</i> at 293. Notwithstanding these gross inadequacies, the BIA concluded that the indefinite detention and severely substandard prison conditions did not constitute torture under CAT, even though they might very well be considered \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 301, 304.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the petitioner in <i>In re J-E-</i> established that isolated acts of torture occurred in Haitian prisons, such as burning with cigarettes and use of electric shock. However, the BIA found that he \"failed to establish that it was more likely than not that [he] will be subject to torture if he is removed to Haiti. For example, there is no evidence that deliberately inflicted acts of torture are pervasive and widespread; that the Haitian authorities use torture as a matter of policy; or that meaningful international oversight or intervention is lacking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settenda's case is on all fours with <i>In re J-E-</i> and <i>Elien.</i> It was not unreasonable for the BIA to conclude that as alarming as the prison conditions in Uganda may be, they do not constitute torture under CAT. Unchallenged INS regulations provide that \"[i]n order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18. There is no evidence of that here. In fact, as in <i>In re J-E-,</i> the State Department report indicates that \"[t]he harsh conditions largely resulted from the Government's seriously inadequate funding of prison facilities.\" Also mirroring <i>In re J-E-,</i> the State Department found that \"[t]he central prison system continued to work with [non-governmental organizations] and the donor community to improve prison buildings, water and sanitation systems, food, and uniforms.\" While \"[p]rogress has been minimal,\" the report also found that \"Government agencies have sponsored or participated in numerous conferences on the justice system and prison conditions, and worked closely with international and domestic human rights organizations on prison reform efforts. There were reports that mortality rates decreased following these activities.\" Finally, as in <i>In re J-E-,</i> the State Department noted that the International Committee of the Red Cross and several local non-governmental organizations were permitted access to the prison system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the State Department's report on Uganda mentions isolated incidents of torture within the prison system, Settenda, like the petitioner in <i>In re J-E-,</i> brought forth no evidence that those incidents of torture are so prevalent in Ugandan prisons that, more likely than not, he would be tortured there. Accordingly, we leave undisturbed the denial of relief under CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>C. Violation of BIA Regulations and Due Process</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing to 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1003.1(d)(1), (d)(3), and (e), Settenda claims that the BIA's single-member decision in this case contravened its own regulations and violated his due process rights. The relevant regulations were part of procedural reforms to improve case management and were issued to improve the efficiency of the BIA and to allow one-member resolutions of a greater variety of cases. <i>Id.</i> Specifically, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(5) provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]f the Board member to whom an appeal is assigned determines, upon consideration of the merits, that the decision is not appropriate for affirmance without opinion, the Board member shall issue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the decision under review, unless the Board member designates the case for decision by a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6) of this section under the standards of the case management plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Petitioners argue that &#167; 1003.1(e)(5)'s provision for a brief order by a single member conflicts with 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7), which provides that \"[i]f the Board Member determines that the decision is not appropriate for affirmance without opinion, the case will be assigned to a three-member panel for review and decision.\" Settenda argues that &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) compels the Board to either issue a single member affirmance without opinion, or to send the case to a three-member panel. This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these two provisions might seem to conflict on their face, the comments regarding the new provision, under the heading \"Expanded Single Member Review,\" explain that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]ne of the primary components of the case management system is expanded single-member review. The current streamlining process permits a single Board member to affirm the decision of the immigration judge without opinion. 8 CFR 3.1(a)(7) [now moved to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7)]. The final rule retains this current practice intact, but expands upon this authority to permit a single Board member to affirm, modify, or remand the immigration judge's decision with a short explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">67 Fed.Reg. 54878, *54885 (citation omitted). The government's brief suggests that these comments indicate that &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) was not deleted from the regulations due to a clerical error. This argument is supported by the comprehensive &#167; 1003.1(e) \"case management system\" that contains provisions for initial case screening (&#167; 1003.1(e)(1)); dispositions of motions and procedural or ministerial issues (&#167; 1003.1(e)(2)); triage of cases receiving a merits review (&#167; 1003.1(e)(3)); affirmance without opinion by a single Board member (&#167; 1003.1(e)(4)); brief orders by a single Board member (&#167; 1003.1(e)(5)); and three-member panel decisions (&#167; 1003.1(e)(6)). It is particularly notable that &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) provides that a single member of the Board may issue an affirmance without opinion, as does &#167; 1003.1(a)(7), which is cited by Settenda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board member to whom a case is assigned shall affirm the decision of the Service or the immigration judge, without opinion, if the Board member determines that the result reached in the decision under review was correct; that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that (A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation; or (B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 1003.1(e)(4). The duplication of provisions providing for a single member affirmance without opinion supports the government's contention that a clerical error led to the continued inclusion of the now duplicative &#167; 1003.1(a)(7). In any event, the comments to the final rule make clear that the agency intended to expand the purview of single members to go beyond issuing an affirmance without opinion and include the ability to issue a brief order disposing of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even if 1003(e)(5), which was adopted in 2002, conflicts with &#167; 1003(a)(7), which was adopted earlier, we note that the more recent, specific enactment supercedes the older, more general one. <i>Cf. Natural Resources Defense</i> <i>Council, Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir.1987)</i>(\"Using familiar statutory interpretation, when there is such a conflict, the most recent and more specific congressional pronouncement will prevail over a prior, more generalized statute.\"). <i>See also Batalova v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1246, 1252 (10th Cir.2004)</i>(upholding 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(e)(5) which was recodified and renumbered as &#167; 1003(e)(5)). In light of the explicit language allowing a single Board member to \"issue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the decision under review,\" &#167; 1003.1(e)(5), which is part of a recently enacted comprehensive case management scheme, we find that the BIA's use of this procedure did not contravene its own regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we briefly address Settenda's due process claim. We have already ruled that the BIA's streamlined procedures do not violate petitioners' due process rights. <i>See, e.g., Albathani, 318 F.3d at 375-78</i> (holding that the BIA's \"affirmance without opinion\" procedure does not violate due process). If due process requirements are met when the BIA affirms the IJ's finding without issuing any opinion, the due process requirements are certainly met when the BIA affirms the IJ's finding with a brief explanatory order. Similarly, we reject Settenda's claim that the BIA violated his due process rights by allegedly failing to provide a clear administrative finding or adequately review and establish the record of the case. Again, while the BIA \"is obliged to weigh all the pertinent factors ..., to exhibit due consideration for the universe of weighted factors when tallying the equities, to exercise independent judgment, and to state plainly its reasons for granting or denying relief,\" <i>Chen v. INS,</i> 87 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1996), it is well established that the \"BIA can adopt, without further explication, the IJ's opinion.\" <i>Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 377. <i>See also Chen, 87 F.3d at 8</i> (\"[W]e join eight of our sister circuits in ruling that the Board need not write at length merely to repeat the IJ's findings of fact and his reasons for denying the requested relief, but, rather, having given individualized consideration to a particular case, may simply state that it affirms the IJ's decision for the reasons set forth in that decision.\") (listing cases). Here, the BIA opinion indicates that it gave individualized attention to Settenda's case, reviewed the record, and exercised independent judgment. Furthermore, it stated plainly its reasons for affirming the IJ's decision. Therefore, on this record, we find no deprivation of Settenda's due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, was implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.L.

The following year, the INS charged them both as being removable from the United States under INA &#167; 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who remained beyond the time authorized. Petitioners conceded that they were removable as charged and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. During several merits hearings before the Immigration Judge (IJ), Settenda claimed that he was a member of the Ugandan Internal Security Organization (ISO), and, in that capacity, had been assigned to investigate the death of Ugandan Prince Charles Happy Kiganangoma.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Settenda testified that his investigation implicated certain high-level government officials in the Prince's death, including his immediate superior at ISO. Settenda claimed that he was threatened and that two attempts were made on his life as a result of his investigation. Further, Settenda attested that because of the information he possessed about governmental involvement in Prince Kiganangoma's death, he feared persecution and torture by government officials should he return to Uganda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the merits hearings, the IJ found that Settenda's testimony lacked credibility, was inconsistent and implausible on key points, and was not supported by the submitted documentary evidence. After citing several portions of Settenda's testimony and their deficiencies, the IJ stated that she \"believe [d] [Settenda] is afraid to return to Uganda but the true reasons for his fear and the exact nature of the harm he fears had not been presented to this Court in a straightforward or truthful manner.\" The IJ found that Settenda \"provided information and evidence which is not correct or truthful concerning his investigation into a highly publicized political murder.\" Finally, again citing specifically to portions of Settenda's testimony that were inconsistent, implausible, or both, the IJ stated that \"[b]ased on all the evidence before me, ... [Settenda] has not provided what to this Court is credible, complete and truthful information concerning his activities with the ISO, his reasons for leaving Uganda and what exactly he fears would happen if he comes back.\" Accordingly, the IJ denied the relief sought but nevertheless granted petitioners voluntary departure under INA &#167; 240B, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the BIA, a single member of the Board rejected petitioners' claims, specifically relying upon and affirming the IJ's findings that the \"testimony was not sufficiently credible and the evidence presented was not adequate to support the [petitioners'] burden of proof.\" The BIA also stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]verall, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the testimony, of limited credibility and lacking in detail, combined with the inadequate documentary support, provides insufficient evidence to meet the overall burden of proof.

Specifically, Settenda argues (1) that his testimony showed that he would be tried and convicted for desertion, and possibly treason, in a Ugandan military court, and (2) the State Department country conditions report, along with an Amnesty International report, establish that prison conditions in Uganda meet the definition of torture under CAT. In reply, the government seems to urge that the IJ's credibility determinations alone foreclose Settenda's claim for relief under CAT and that the CAT claim should be denied because the asylum and withholding claims were properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have not addressed the precise contours of the different standards petitioners must meet to support a claim for asylum and withholding of removal as compared to relief under CAT, we have observed that a CAT claim, which requires that the petitioner show that it is more likely than not he would be tortured upon return to his country, establishes a higher burden of proof than an asylum claim, which requires that the petitioner show a well founded fear of persecution. <i>El Moraghy v.

We think a <i>per se</i> rule that an adverse credibility determination on asylum automatically defeats an application under CAT would be erroneous. Each case will vary with the facts.

He may, according to the way justice works in Uganda, have reasons to believe that he could be harmed through an extrajudicial trial or other treatment.... Most clearly, this respondent has indicated that he fears harm because he abandoned his duties.\" Settenda claims that this finding, coupled with country condition reports, substantiates his CAT claim even though his asylum and withholding claims were rejected. Even if these statements by the IJ could be read as crediting Settenda's testimony that he will be subjected to a military trial and subsequently imprisoned &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Settenda's CAT claim still founders as a matter of law. In light of relevant precedent, it was not unreasonable for the BIA to conclude that the documentary evidence does not support the legal conclusion that the trial and prison conditions constitute torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settenda cites the following portion of the State Department country conditions report for Uganda to substantiate his claim that he will be tortured if returned to his home country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The military court system does not assure the right to a fair trial. Although the accused has the right to retain legal counsel, military defense attorneys often are untrained and may be assigned by the military command, which also appoints the prosecutor and the adjudicating officer. The sentence passed by the military court, which can include the death penalty, may be appealed to the high command but not to the High or Supreme Courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Settenda draws attention to the State Department's conclusion that \"[p]rison conditions remain harsh and life threatening.... Both civilian and military prisons have high mortality rates from overcrowding, malnutrition, diseases spread by unsanitary conditions, and HIV/AIDS.\" The report goes on to say that the Uganda Human Rights Commission \"reported severely inadequate medical services, seriously unhygienic conditions, and a situation of `semi-starvation' among prisoners in many prisons.\" Similarly, Amnesty International's 2000 Uganda report found that \"[p]rison conditions were harsh, with severe overcrowding, and disease was rife.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA rejected a similar claim by a Haitian citizen who asserted that he would be tortured if returned to Haiti because, as a repatriated convict, he would be subjected to indefinite detention and imprisonment in the Haitian prison system. <i>See In re J-E-, 23 I. &amp; N.

There, the State Department report on Haiti indicated that \"prison facilities are overcrowded and inadequate. Haitian prisoners are deprived of adequate food, water, medical care, sanitation, and exercise. Many prisoners are malnourished.\" <i>Id.</i> at 293. Notwithstanding these gross inadequacies, the BIA concluded that the indefinite detention and severely substandard prison conditions did not constitute torture under CAT, even though they might very well be considered \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 301, 304.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the petitioner in <i>In re J-E-</i> established that isolated acts of torture occurred in Haitian prisons, such as burning with cigarettes and use of electric shock. However, the BIA found that he \"failed to establish that it was more likely than not that [he] will be subject to torture if he is removed to Haiti. For example, there is no evidence that deliberately inflicted acts of torture are pervasive and widespread; that the Haitian authorities use torture as a matter of policy; or that meaningful international oversight or intervention is lacking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Settenda's case is on all fours with <i>In re J-E-</i> and <i>Elien.</i> It was not unreasonable for the BIA to conclude that as alarming as the prison conditions in Uganda may be, they do not constitute torture under CAT. Unchallenged INS regulations provide that \"[i]n order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18. There is no evidence of that here. In fact, as in <i>In re J-E-,</i> the State Department report indicates that \"[t]he harsh conditions largely resulted from the Government's seriously inadequate funding of prison facilities.\" Also mirroring <i>In re J-E-,</i> the State Department found that \"[t]he central prison system continued to work with [non-governmental organizations] and the donor community to improve prison buildings, water and sanitation systems, food, and uniforms.\" While \"[p]rogress has been minimal,\" the report also found that \"Government agencies have sponsored or participated in numerous conferences on the justice system and prison conditions, and worked closely with international and domestic human rights organizations on prison reform efforts. There were reports that mortality rates decreased following these activities.\" Finally, as in <i>In re J-E-,</i> the State Department noted that the International Committee of the Red Cross and several local non-governmental organizations were permitted access to the prison system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the State Department's report on Uganda mentions isolated incidents of torture within the prison system, Settenda, like the petitioner in <i>In re J-E-,</i> brought forth no evidence that those incidents of torture are so prevalent in Ugandan prisons that, more likely than not, he would be tortured there.

The relevant regulations were part of procedural reforms to improve case management and were issued to improve the efficiency of the BIA and to allow one-member resolutions of a greater variety of cases. <i>Id.</i> Specifically, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(5) provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]f the Board member to whom an appeal is assigned determines, upon consideration of the merits, that the decision is not appropriate for affirmance without opinion, the Board member shall issue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the decision under review, unless the Board member designates the case for decision by a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6) of this section under the standards of the case management plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Petitioners argue that &#167; 1003.1(e)(5)'s provision for a brief order by a single member conflicts with 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7), which provides that \"[i]f the Board Member determines that the decision is not appropriate for affirmance without opinion, the case will be assigned to a three-member panel for review and decision.\" Settenda argues that &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) compels the Board to either issue a single member affirmance without opinion, or to send the case to a three-member panel.

The government's brief suggests that these comments indicate that &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) was not deleted from the regulations due to a clerical error. This argument is supported by the comprehensive &#167; 1003.1(e) \"case management system\" that contains provisions for initial case screening (&#167; 1003.1(e)(1)); dispositions of motions and procedural or ministerial issues (&#167; 1003.1(e)(2)); triage of cases receiving a merits review (&#167; 1003.1(e)(3)); affirmance without opinion by a single Board member (&#167; 1003.1(e)(4)); brief orders by a single Board member (&#167; 1003.1(e)(5)); and three-member panel decisions (&#167; 1003.1(e)(6)). It is particularly notable that &#167; 1003.1(e)(4) provides that a single member of the Board may issue an affirmance without opinion, as does &#167; 1003.1(a)(7), which is cited by Settenda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board member to whom a case is assigned shall affirm the decision of the Service or the immigration judge, without opinion, if the Board member determines that the result reached in the decision under review was correct; that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial; and that (A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation; or (B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 1003.1(e)(4).

In light of the explicit language allowing a single Board member to \"issue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the decision under review,\" &#167; 1003.1(e)(5), which is part of a recently enacted comprehensive case management scheme, we find that the BIA's use of this procedure did not contravene its own regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we briefly address Settenda's due process claim. We have already ruled that the BIA's streamlined procedures do not violate petitioners' due process rights. <i>See, e.g., Albathani, 318 F.3d at 375-78</i> (holding that the BIA's \"affirmance without opinion\" procedure does not violate due process). If due process requirements are met when the BIA affirms the IJ's finding without issuing any opinion, the due process requirements are certainly met when the BIA affirms the IJ's finding with a brief explanatory order. Similarly, we reject Settenda's claim that the BIA violated his due process rights by allegedly failing to provide a clear administrative finding or adequately review and establish the record of the case. Again, while the BIA \"is obliged to weigh all the pertinent factors ..., to exhibit due consideration for the universe of weighted factors when tallying the equities, to exercise independent judgment, and to state plainly its reasons for granting or denying relief,\" <i>Chen v.
