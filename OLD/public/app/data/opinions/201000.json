These two cases involve claims\n\nagainst the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 2671 et seq., arising out of alleged wrongful actions\n\nof FBI agents.\n\n          On September 15, 1999, a diligent federal trial judge\n\nsitting in     an    organized   crime   case   issued   a   lengthy   opinion\n\noutlining a possible pattern of corruption involving at least two\n\nFBI agents, John Connolly and his supervisor John Morris, and two\n\nnotorious Boston criminals, James \"Whitey\" Bulger and Stephen \"the\n\nRifleman\" Flemmi.      See United States v. Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141\n\n(D. Mass. 1999).       Such corruption had been rumored but had been\n\ndenied by the FBI.\n\n          The 1999 opinion by Judge Wolf revealed that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi, who were leaders of the Winter Hill Gang, a crime syndicate\n\ninvolved in murder, bribery, extortion, loansharking, and gambling\n\noperations, had been high-level FBI informants since the 1970s,\n\naiding the agency in its investigation of La Cosa Nostra, a rival\n\ncrime syndicate.       The opinion raised the prospect that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi had received numerous benefits from the FBI in return,\n\nincluding protection from prosecution, and at times, access to the\n\nnames of informants who were themselves providing information to\n\nthe FBI about the criminal activities of Bulger and Flemmi.             Id. at\n\n148-63, 322.        Some of the informants may have been killed as a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fresult, and the murderous activities of Bulger and Flemmi covered\n\nup.   Id. at 208-13.\n\n           The opinion speculated that Agent Connolly may have\n\ndisclosed to Bulger and Flemmi the identity of an individual, John\n\nMcIntyre, who was an informant for the local Quincy police and was\n\ndebriefed by the FBI, United States Customs Service, and the Drug\n\nEnforcement   Administration   (DEA).   Id.   at   213-15.   McIntyre\n\ndisappeared roughly six weeks after an October 17, 1984 interview\n\nwith FBI Agent Roderick Kennedy, in which McIntyre had linked\n\nBulger to gun-running and drug-smuggling operations. Id. His body\n\nwas found fifteen years later, on January 14, 2000, in a makeshift\n\ngrave near Boston.     But the opinion, published in September 1999,\n\nultimately concluded that it could not be determined whether FBI\n\nAgent Kennedy had, in fact, shared this information about McIntyre\n\nwith Connolly and whether Connolly, in turn, had told Bulger.     Id.\n\nat 214-15.    That was because, as the court said later, \"important\n\nFBI documents concerning John McIntyre were . . . improperly\n\nwithheld by agents of the Boston FBI until it was too late to\n\nquestion relevant witnesses concerning them.\"        United States v.\n\nFlemmi, 195 F. Supp. 2d 243, 249-50 (D. Mass. 2001).\n\n           The opinion also indicated the likelihood that Agent\n\nConnolly had disclosed to Bulger the name of another informant as\n\nto Bulger's crimes, Brian Halloran. In January 1982, Halloran told\n\ntwo FBI agents that Bulger and Flemmi had caused the 1981 murder of\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fa Tulsa businessman, Roger Wheeler. Connolly learned of Halloran's\n\ncooperation and disclosed it to Bulger.           Halloran was murdered in\n\nMay 1982.         Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 208-210.              Agent Morris\n\ntestified to this sequence of events in hearings before Judge Wolf\n\nin April 1998.\n\n             Agent Connolly was indicted on October 11, 2000 and\n\ncharged with numerous crimes, including \"alert[ing] Bulger and\n\nFlemmi to the identity of confidential law enforcement informants\n\nin   order   to     protect    Bulger's   and   Flemmi's    ongoing      criminal\n\nactivities\" and taking other steps to protect Bulger and Flemmi.\n\nConnolly was charged with inducing Agent Morris to do the same, in\n\nviolation    of     Morris's   legal   obligations.        Among   the    several\n\nracketeering acts charged was that Connolly had told Bulger and\n\nFlemmi of Halloran's statements that Bulger and Flemmi had caused\n\nWheeler's murder.        In turn, the indictment charged, Bulger caused\n\nHalloran     to    be   murdered.      Connolly   was   convicted,       and   his\n\nconviction was affirmed on appeal.           United States v. Connolly, 341\n\nF.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             On May 25, 2000, the estate of John McIntyre, through its\n\nadministrator       (McIntyre's     mother,     Emily   McIntyre)        and   co-\n\nadministrator (McIntyre's brother, Christopher McIntyre), filed an\n\nadministrative claim against the United States under the FTCA.1\n\nThe essence of the theory behind the claim was that the FBI had (i)\n\n\n      1\n             We refer to the plaintiff in this case as McIntyre.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdirectly caused the death of John McIntyre, when Agent Connolly\n\ninformed Bulger and Flemmi that McIntyre was cooperating with\n\ncertain authorities investigating Bulger and Flemmi, thus signing\n\nMcIntyre's death warrant, and (ii) indirectly caused McIntyre's\n\ndeath through the protection the FBI afforded Bulger and Flemmi,\n\nwhich encouraged and enabled them to commit murders, including that\n\nof McIntyre.2    A second administrative complaint was filed on June\n\n8, 2000.\n\n           On   May    11,   2001,   the      estate   of   Roger   Wheeler,   the\n\nmurdered Tulsa businessman, filed an administrative claim under the\n\nFTCA against the United States.            The theory of the claim was that\n\nthe FBI's illicit protection of Bulger and Flemmi had facilitated\n\nthe murder of Roger Wheeler.3        This legal theory differed from that\n\narticulated     in    the    McIntyre    case,    as    there   was   no   direct\n\nrelationship between the FBI and Wheeler.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Specifically, the estate asserted legal theories of (a)\nconspiracy to protect Bulger and Flemmi from arrest and prosecution\nas a proximate cause of McIntyre's kidnaping, torture and execution\nin violation of McIntyre's First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment\nrights; (b) violation of those same Fourth and Fifth Amendment\nrights, stated as claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents,\n403 U.S. 388 (1971); and (c) wrongful death, in violation of Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 229, ยงยง 2, 6.\n     3\n          Both the Wheeler and McIntyre administrative claims also\nincluded claims that FBI agents had obstructed and impeded the\ninvestigation of the respective murders. But in their suits in\nfederal court, both sets of plaintiffs raised cover-up claims only\nagainst individual FBI agents, not against the United States\nitself.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f          The United States failed to act on either claim within\n\nthe required six-month period, thus giving both estates the option,\n\nwhich they took, of treating those claims as having been denied.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. ยง 2675(a).    In due course, both filed suit against\n\nthe United States as well as various FBI agents in the Boston\n\noffice, Bulger, Flemmi, and other members of the Winter Hill Gang.\n\n          McIntyre's claims against the United States consisted of\n\n(1) three counts under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229, ยง 2 for civil\n\nconspiracy,   negligence,   and    supervisory   liability,   causing\n\nMcIntyre's death and (2) three counts under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n229, ยง 6, corresponding to the three counts under ยง 2, for\n\nnegligently causing McIntyre's conscious suffering while he was\n\nkidnapped, tortured and killed.\n\n          The claims of the Wheeler estate were joined by Roger\n\nWheeler's widow and four of his five children, suing individually.4\n\nThe Wheelers' claims against the United States sought to hold it\n\ndirectly and vicariously liable for (1) two counts of tortious\n\nconduct causing Wheeler's death under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229, ยง 2;\n\n(2) two counts of causing Roger Wheeler's conscious suffering the\n\nmoments immediately before his murder under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n229, ยง 6; and (3) one count of causing emotional distress to\n\nWheeler and his family.\n\n\n\n     4\n          We refer to the estate and individual plaintiffs in this\ncase as the Wheelers.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          The United States moved to dismiss in both suits on the\n\nground that neither set of plaintiffs filed their administrative\n\nclaims within the required two-year period from the accrual of the\n\ncause of action.      See 28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).   The district court\n\nagreed in both cases.    McIntyre v. United States, 254 F. Supp. 2d\n\n183, 193 (D. Mass. 2003); Wheeler v. United States, No. 02-10464-\n\nRCL (D. Mass. March 31, 2003).     This consolidated appeal is from\n\nthe dismissals of the FTCA claims against the United States and\n\nreviews the single issue, on two sets of facts, of when the claims\n\n\"accrued\" for FTCA purposes. To be timely, the McIntyre claims had\n\nto accrue on or after May 25, 1998, and the Wheeler claims on or\n\nafter May 11, 1999.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The following facts are presented in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs.     See Muniz-Rivera v. United States,\n\n326 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).    The facts are drawn from the two\n\ncomplaints and the materials submitted to the district court on the\n\nrespective motions to dismiss. Gonzalez v. United States, 284 F.3d\n\n281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002) (on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), the court may look to supplemental materials\n\nin addition to pleadings).    We also draw on facts found in United\n\nStates v. Salemme, supra.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fA.     Factual and Procedural Background Relevant to McIntyre\n\n            In mid-October 1984, John McIntyre began cooperating with\n\nRichard Bergeron of the Quincy Police Department.                 Salemme, 91 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 213.       McIntyre told Bergeron that he was an engineer on\n\na ship named the Valhalla that had been used in an unsuccessful\n\nattempt to deliver guns and ammunition from Massachusetts to the\n\nIrish Republican Army (IRA) in Ireland.            He said that he worked for\n\nJoseph Murray, who secretly owned the Valhalla and was closely\n\nconnected to Bulger, and that Bulger was involved in the attempted\n\narms shipment through his associates Kevin Weeks and Patrick Nee.\n\nMcIntyre also mentioned Flemmi.          Id.    Bergeron told Agent Roderick\n\nKennedy, an FBI liaison officer, that McIntyre was cooperating and\n\nthat McIntyre had linked Bulger and his associates to the Valhalla.\n\nBergeron arranged for agents from the DEA and United States Customs\n\nService, along with Agent Kennedy, to participate in McIntyre's\n\ndebriefing.       Kennedy and a Customs agent interviewed McIntyre on\n\nOctober 17, 1984.         McIntyre told them that Bulger's associate\n\nPatrick Nee had traveled to Ireland to meet the Valhalla.                  Id. at\n\n214.     McIntyre also told them that Murray was partners in a\n\nseparate drug smuggling operation with \"an individual named Whitey\n\nwho    operates    a   liquor   store   in     South   Boston,\"    whom   Kennedy\n\nunderstood to be Bulger.        Id.     Around November 30, 1984, McIntyre\n\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f              Christopher McIntyre, John's brother, stated by affidavit\n\nthat he and Emily McIntyre, John's mother, filed multiple missing\n\npersons reports with the Quincy police.            Christopher said that the\n\ngovernment told him on one occasion that the \"mob\" had murdered\n\nJohn, but later told him that John was \"alive, a fugitive from\n\njustice and would be prosecuted if caught.\"            Emily also stated by\n\naffidavit that she had made \"repeated requests\" to the government\n\nfor information or help in finding her son but received none.\n\nInstead, she said, government agents told her that \"John was a\n\nfugitive.\"      In a 2000 Boston Herald interview, both Emily and\n\nChristopher said that they had suspected Bulger's hand in John's\n\ndisappearance in 1984 but said nothing out of fear.\n\n              On April 15, 1986, although McIntyre was still missing,\n\na grand jury indicted him along with Murray, Nee, and four others\n\nfor their roles in the Valhalla operation and drug smuggling.\n\nBulger and      Flemmi   were   not   named   as   defendants     or   otherwise\n\nmentioned in the indictment. The grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment on May 8, 1986, which again did not name Bulger or\n\nFlemmi   as    defendants.      The   court   then   issued   a   warrant    for\n\nMcIntyre's arrest.       On September 6, 1995, a note appeared in the\n\ndocket of the Valhalla prosecution: \"Case reopened as to John\n\nCrawley, John McIntyre, Michael Nigro.               NOTE: Case previously\n\nclosed in error. Defendants Crawley, McIntyre and Nigro remain\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffugitives.\"   The case remained open until March 20, 2000, when\n\nMcIntyre's death had been confirmed.\n\n          Meanwhile, on April 16, 1986, shortly after the first\n\nindictment, attorney John Loftus, acting on behalf of Emily, Chris,\n\nand Patricia McIntyre, John's sister, sent a letter to the Attorney\n\nGeneral, United States Customs Service, DEA, State Department, and\n\nUnited States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.       The FBI\n\nwas not one of the addressees on the letter.        The letter, whose\n\nsubject line was \"Re: Wrongful Death of John L. McIntyre,\" alleged\n\nthat John McIntyre was a government informant concerning IRA gun-\n\nrunning in Boston, that federal authorities leaked his informant\n\nstatus to the British government, and that the British government\n\ntold the IRA, resulting in McIntyre's abduction and murder.\n\n          On June 2, 1986, Emily McIntyre asked the Veterans\n\nAdministration (VA) to erect a headstone marker for her son at the\n\nMassachusetts National Cemetery.\n\n          On September 20, 1988, the Boston Globe ran a report\n\ndescribing Bulger as an FBI informant and raising the possibility\n\nthat Bulger \"has been able to exploit his cachet with the FBI\" to\n\nevade investigation and apprehension by the state police and the\n\nDEA. The article suggested that the FBI may have tipped Bulger off\n\nto recording devices in his home and car and to the timing of sting\n\noperations.   But it did not raise the possibility that the FBI\n\nleaked   information   to   Bulger   about   informants   in   his   own\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\forganization or shielded him from prosecution for crimes like\n\nmurder.    Nor did the article mention McIntyre.                The article\n\nreported that\n\n          State Police officials . . . asked the FBI to\n     conduct an internal inquiry. The FBI cleared two agents,\n     and the FBI leadership remains outraged at the suggestion\n     that any of its own would engage in that kind of\n     treachery.\n          James F. Ahearn, special agent in charge of the FBI\n     in Boston, was unequivocal when asked last month if\n     Bulger has had relations with the FBI that have left him\n     free of its scrutiny.\n          \"That is absolutely untrue,\" said Ahearn. \"We have\n     not had evidence that would warrant it and if we do\n     develop anything of an evidentiary nature, we will pursue\n     it. We specifically deny that there has been special\n     treatment of this individual.\" He declined to make any\n     further comment on the matter and instructed Connolly not\n     to speak on the subject.\n\n           In 1989, Emily McIntyre and Loftus published Valhalla's\n\nWake: The IRA, MI6, and the Assassination of a Young American\n\n(Atlantic Monthly Press).       In the book, they indicated awareness\n\nthat John had ties to the IRA and the \"Mob\" and that he faced\n\npossible   \"Mob[]    retribution\"     for   his   cooperation       with   the\n\ngovernment.     They stated that John's blue pickup truck had been\n\nspotted at Murray's place of business and that it was later found\n\nunder a bridge with his uncashed VA check inside.                   But they\n\nultimately theorized that British intelligence was responsible for\n\nJohn's murder.      Based on the McIntyre family's own investigation\n\ninto John's death, which involved interviews with \"an IRA courier\"\n\nand a \"source\" within British intelligence, the book speculated\n\nthat British     intelligence   had   its   own   mole   in   the   Valhalla,\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdiscovered from United States Customs agents that McIntyre was an\n\ninformant on a related drug-smuggling operation, falsely told the\n\nIRA that McIntyre was an informant on the Valhalla operation to\n\ndivert attention from the British mole, and then murdered McIntyre\n\nto prevent him from refuting the story.\n\n            In October 1991, Emily McIntyre applied to the VA for\n\ndeath benefits under her son's policy.\n\n            In the early to mid-1990s, the Boston Globe published a\n\nseries of articles on McIntyre's disappearance.                 One of those\n\narticles,   appearing    on   December    24,   1992,    stated       that   Sean\n\nO'Callaghan, a former IRA operative, had tipped off the Irish\n\npolice to the 1984 Valhalla shipment and that the IRA may have\n\nmistakenly suspected McIntyre of being the leak and murdered him.\n\nThe   story,    which   quoted   Emily    McIntyre,     said    that    \"[m]ost\n\nauthorities believe McIntyre was done in by his associates, . . .\n\nmost of whom were in the now-defunct Winter Hill Gang\" headed by\n\nBulger. The article noted that when Bulger heard that the Valhalla\n\nhad been seized, he said, in a conversation secretly recorded by\n\nDEA bugs in his apartment, \"That's our stuff,\" and that McIntyre\n\nwas last seen with Patrick Nee, a Bulger associate.             But the story\n\nmade no connection between the FBI and McIntyre's death.                In fact,\n\nin response to Emily McIntyre's theory that her son had been killed\n\nby    British   intelligence,    the     article   noted       that    \"federal\n\ninvestigators familiar with the Valhalla case say there is no\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fevidence that McIntyre was fingered by any agent of the US, Irish,\n\nor British governments\" (emphasis added).\n\n           On January 29, 1995, a second article in the Boston Globe\n\nreported   that   \"authorities   in   the   United   States\"   had   called\n\n\"ludicrous\" any claim that \"the US government negligently allowed\n\n[McIntyre] to be killed.\"        The story indicated that government\n\nofficials were not the only ones who might have known that McIntyre\n\nwas an informant, stating that \"[r]umors that [John] McIntyre was\n\ntalking [to the federal government] were rampant\" and citing Emily\n\nMcIntyre as saying that Customs agents had \"openly tailed [her\n\nson], and were parked outside her home the last night she saw her\n\nson.\"\n\n           Then, on December 11, 1996 and June 14, 1997, the Boston\n\nGlobe published two more articles reporting that law enforcement\n\nofficials believed McIntyre had been killed by the Winter Hill\n\nGang. The December 11 article, which quoted Emily McIntyre, stated\n\nthat \"[f]ederal agents believe McIntyre was killed by Boston\n\ngangsters who suspected him of informing against them.\"          The June\n\n14 article was more specific.            It theorized that Bulger had\n\ncompromised the Valhalla operation, after taking a hefty profit\n\nfrom it, by tipping off the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nRelying on witness statements and other evidence, the article\n\nsuggested that, afterwards, Bulger and Flemmi nonetheless tortured\n\nMcIntyre to find out what he had told authorities about the gun-\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\frunning and marijuana smuggling operations, and then killed him,\n\ndisposing of his body at sea.          Neither article made any mention of\n\nFBI involvement.\n\n            At around the time of the second article, in 1997, more\n\ndetails of the relationship between Bulger and Flemmi and their FBI\n\nhandlers came to light through the prosecution of Flemmi in the\n\ncase of United States v. Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141 (D. Mass.\n\n1999).     In Salemme, on January 10, 1995, a grand jury indicted\n\nBulger and Flemmi, along with five others who were members of\n\neither La Cosa Nostra or the Winter Hill Gang, of RICO conspiracy\n\nand various other federal crimes.                Id. at 301.       Three more\n\nsuperseding indictments were obtained, with the last coming on July\n\n2, 1996.   Id. at 306.    None of the indictments mentioned McIntyre's\n\ndisappearance, although several referred to murders committed by\n\nBulger and Flemmi.\n\n            In    April   1997,   in    the    process   of   addressing   the\n\ndefendants'      motion   to   suppress       some   electronic   surveillance\n\nevidence, Judge Wolf, who was presiding over the Salemme case,\n\ndiscovered earlier filings in the case before a magistrate judge\n\nthat suggested that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI informants.              Id. at\n\n308.   This information raised questions about, inter alia, whether\n\nthe FBI had given Bulger and Flemmi immunity from prosecution for\n\ntheir ongoing criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f              In a June 6, 1997 order, over the FBI's objections, Judge\n\nWolf revealed that the FBI had, in response to a court order,\n\nconfirmed in a closed hearing that Bulger was an informant. United\n\nStates v. Salemme, 978 F. Supp. 364, 365 (D. Mass. 1997).                       The\n\norder also revealed that Flemmi was an informant.                Id. at 373.     In\n\na June 25, 1997 affidavit, Flemmi stated that Agent Morris had\n\nassured him that he and Bulger could be involved in any criminal\n\nactivities short of murder and would be protected by the FBI.\n\nSalemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 310.            Flemmi's affidavit was not sealed\n\nand an account of his statements was published the next day in the\n\nBoston Globe.      Several months later, on September 3, 1997, Flemmi\n\nsubmitted under seal a motion to dismiss, claiming, inter alia,\n\nthat the FBI had promised him immunity.              Id. at 311.       The motion\n\nwas unsealed, over government objections, on September 10.                    Id.\n\n              Several months later, on December 5, 1997, the Boston\n\nHerald made public that the Department of Justice had conducted its\n\nown   probe    into   Bulger    and   Flemmi's      relationship       with   their\n\nhandlers.      The article reported that Judge Wolf had said at a\n\nhearing     the   previous     day    that    the   Office      of   Professional\n\nResponsibility     had   launched     an     internal   probe    and    found   \"no\n\nevidence of continuing criminal conduct within the statute of\n\nlimitations\" by Agents Morris and Connolly.              Some details of this\n\ninvestigation were later revealed in Judge Wolf's opinion in\n\nSalemme, issued on September 15, 1999:\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f     In late June 1997, the Attorney General established a\n     task force of Department of Justice and FBI personnel to\n     investigate the allegations of misconduct raised by\n     Flemmi and the motions to suppress.      That task force\n     conducted its investigation in July and early August\n     1997, and issued a confidential report to the Attorney\n     General. With the agreement of the government, the court\n     reviewed the Executive Summary of that report and some of\n     the documents that the investigation generated in order\n     to decide certain issues concerning discovery . . . .\n\n91 F. Supp. 2d at 310.       Nothing in the record indicates that the\n\nunderlying facts of the Office of Professional Responsibility\n\ninvestigation were otherwise made public at the time. But from our\n\nreview of the docket in the Salemme case, it is clear that the\n\ngovernment repeatedly sought, at around this time, to keep Flemmi's\n\nallegations of government misconduct and the government's response\n\nto them under seal.\n\n            Judge Wolf held a series of evidentiary hearings from\n\nJanuary to October 1998 on the subject of Flemmi's claim of\n\nimmunity.    Id. at 312.     These hearings were open to the public.\n\nEmily McIntyre attended part of a hearing on April 15, 1998.                  In an\n\narticle the next day, the Boston Herald reported that at that\n\nhearing, Robert      Stutman,    the    former   local   chief    of    the   DEA,\n\ntestified   that   \"agents      in   his   office   'swore'      that   the    FBI\n\ncompromised their Flemmi-Bulger probe to the point where the pair's\n\nbureau   'handler'    was   unwelcome      at    DEA's   offices.\"       Stutman\n\nadmitted, however, that he had no proof of FBI wrongdoing and that\n\nhe \"d[id]n't know now\" if \"the FBI [had] burn[ed] us on [the]\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\finvestigation.\"       Nothing in the record indicates that Stutman ever\n\nmentioned McIntyre in his testimony.\n\n           One week later, on April 22, Morris testified, under a\n\ngrant of immunity, that he had told Connolly in early 1982 that\n\nanother FBI informant, Brian Halloran, had said that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi asked him to murder Roger Wheeler.               Id. at 209.       Morris\n\ntestified that Connolly told him that he had passed the information\n\non to Bulger and Flemmi.        Halloran was murdered shortly thereafter\n\non May 11, 1982.         The Boston Herald ran a story on April 23\n\nsummarizing Morris's testimony. As with Stutman, nothing indicates\n\nthat Morris ever mentioned McIntyre in his testimony.\n\n           On May 20, 1998, another DEA agent, Albert G. Reilly,\n\ntestified about the Valhalla. The Boston Globe summarized Reilly's\n\ntestimony the next day with the headline \"DEA unable to link Bulger\n\nto IRA guns.\"    The story recounted that \"authorities now believed\n\nthat   Bulger   had    tipped   off   authorities     to   the    gun-smuggling\n\noperation and that he and Flemmi tortured a Quincy man, John\n\nMcIntyre, who was suspected of cooperating with the authorities\"\n\n(emphasis added).      The story did not say, however, that the FBI had\n\ntipped off Bulger as to McIntyre's identity as an informant.                  The\n\narticle also    stated     that   Reilly     had   testified     that   he,   like\n\nStutman, believed the DEA's investigation of Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nbeen compromised by the FBI but had no way to prove it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f           In early June 1998, after the May 25, 1998 critical date\n\nfor accrual of the McIntyre claims had passed, Richard Bergeron of\n\nthe Quincy Police Department testified about McIntyre's cooperation\n\nand   disappearance.     Id. at 213.       As best we can tell, Bergeron's\n\ntestimony was the first piece of evidence presented in the Salemme\n\nproceedings   that     provided   direct    information     about   McIntyre's\n\ndisappearance. Bergeron testified that McIntyre was \"petrified\" of\n\nthe people he was implicating and that McIntyre was not the type of\n\npotential witness whose cooperation could be publicly disclosed.\n\nBergeron then said that he told FBI Agent Kennedy that McIntyre had\n\nimplicated Bulger and his associates in the Valhalla operation. He\n\ntestified that he had arranged for Kennedy and a Customs agent to\n\ninterview McIntyre. Id. at 214. Kennedy had testified earlier, on\n\nApril 14, 1998, that he and Connolly often exchanged information.\n\nOther evidence also indicated that Kennedy had participated in\n\nprotecting    Bulger    and    Flemmi    from    investigation    on   previous\n\noccasions.     Id.      But,   because     the   government,     apparently   in\n\nviolation of discovery orders, did not produce Kennedy's reports of\n\nhis interview of McIntyre until after Kennedy had testified,\n\nKennedy was never questioned about whether he had passed on the\n\ninformation about McIntyre to Connolly and, if so, whether Connolly\n\nhad told Bulger and Flemmi.             Kennedy was not recalled to the\n\nwitness stand to provide this information.            Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f             During   Bergeron's    cross-examination,   the   prosecution\n\nasked him what individuals, to his knowledge, knew that McIntyre\n\nwas cooperating with authorities and might have passed on that\n\ninformation. When defense counsel objected, the prosecution stated\n\nthat its line of questioning was in response to the implication\n\nthat \"it was the FBI who may have leaked this [information to\n\nBulger and Flemmi] when there's literally a dozen people\" other\n\nthan the FBI who could have done so (emphasis added).                   The\n\nprosecution was explicit that the evidence was so speculative that\n\nthe court \"shouldn't infer that there was some leak from the FBI\n\nthat led to Mr. McIntyre's disappearance\" (emphasis added).             The\n\nprosecution then went on to establish that, in addition to the FBI,\n\nthe Quincy police, the Customs Service, and the DEA all knew of\n\nMcIntyre's cooperation.        The prosecution also established that\n\nMcIntyre had spoken to authorities about a number of \"notorious\n\ncriminals,\" as well as the IRA, \"[a]ll of whom would have had a\n\nmotive to make him disappear.\"\n\n             Judge    Wolf   published    a   260-page   opinion   in   the\n\nSalemme case on September 15, 1999, well after the cut-off date for\n\naccrual of McIntyre's claims.        As to McIntyre's disappearance, he\n\nconcluded,\n\n     [T]here is circumstantial evidence to suggest that\n     Kennedy may have told Connolly about McIntyre's\n     cooperation and claims and, in view [of] the Halloran\n     matter, reason to be concerned that Connolly may have\n     told Bulger and Flemmi. These issues cannot, however, be\n     resolved on the present record.\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fId. at 214-15.\n\n            McIntyre's body was recovered on January 14, 2000. Kevin\n\nWeeks, a Bulger associate, led law enforcement to McIntyre's\n\nmakeshift grave.      Flemmi, 195 F. Supp. 2d at 251 n.45.\n\n            On May 25, 2000, McIntyre's estate filed a notice of tort\n\nclaim with the FBI.\n\n            On    September      27,     2000,    a   grand    jury    returned    a\n\nsuperseding indictment of Bulger and Flemmi that alleged that in\n\nOctober    or    November   of   1984,     Bulger     and   Flemmi    learned   that\n\nMcIntyre was cooperating with the FBI and Customs Service regarding\n\nBulger's    involvement     in    both    the     Valhalla    operation   and     the\n\nimportation of marijuana by boat into Boston, and, as a result,\n\nkidnapped and murdered McIntyre.                The indictment did not say how\n\nBulger and Flemmi discovered McIntyre's cooperation.                    On October\n\n11, 2000, Connolly was indicted for his role in various murders\n\ncommitted by Bulger and Flemmi, but not for any role in McIntyre's\n\nmurder.\n\n            On March 8, 2001, McIntyre's estate filed suit in federal\n\ndistrict court.       McIntyre's claim was the first administrative\n\nclaim and first federal action to be filed arising from the FBI's\n\nrelationship with Bulger and Flemmi.                  On October 15, 2001, the\n\nUnited States moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)\n\non the ground that McIntyre's estate had failed to present its\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fadministrative claims within two years of accrual, as required by\n\nthe FTCA, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).\n\n          On March 31, 2002, the district court granted the motion,\n\nfinding that the claims had accrued before April 1998.     The court\n\nreasoned that, prior to April 1998, the McIntyres clearly believed\n\nJohn McIntyre to be dead and had sufficient facts to support a\n\nreasonable inference that Bulger and Flemmi had killed him, based\n\non local press reports that McIntyre was last seen with Nee, a\n\nBulger associate, and that Bulger ran the Valhalla operation.    The\n\ncourt also determined that the McIntyres had enough information to\n\nform the theory that \"the FBI was at least negligent in [its]\n\nhandling of Bulger and Flemmi.\"     The court relied principally on\n\n(1) the FBI's acknowledgment in 1997 that Bulger and Flemmi were\n\ninformants and (2) the April 15, 1998 hearing, attended in part by\n\nEmily McIntyre, in which DEA Agent Stutman testified about his\n\nsuspicions that the FBI had compromised a DEA investigation of\n\nBulger and Flemmi.     Final judgment was entered on motion of\n\nMcIntyre's estate.   The estate timely appealed.\n\nB.   Factual and Procedural Background Relevant to Wheeler\n\n          Roger Wheeler, a Tulsa businessman, owned World Jai Alai\n\n(WJA), which operated facilities where spectators could bet on Jai\n\nAlai matches.   Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 208.    John Callahan, who\n\nhad ties to the Winter Hill Gang, was president of WJA.          Id.\n\nWheeler suspected that Callahan was skimming money from WJA for\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fmembers of the Winter Hill Gang, including Bulger and Flemmi.\n\nWheeler fired Callahan and began an audit of WJA's financial\n\noperations.    Id. at 209.    Before the audit was completed, on May\n\n27, 1981, Wheeler was shot to death while sitting in his car in the\n\nparking lot of a Tulsa country club.       Id. at 207-08.\n\n            The Wheeler murder remained unsolved for many years.      In\n\nthe spring of 1995, David and Lawrence Wheeler, two sons of Roger\n\nWheeler, visited the FBI's office in Tulsa to deliver some of their\n\nfather's records requested by the office.       They stated that they\n\nwere unhappy with the lack of progress in the investigation.\n\nAccording to David Wheeler's affidavit, FBI Agent Jack Hawkins\n\nreplied, \"[I]f we do that, we will have to go wherever the evidence\n\nmight lead us . . . and you know, it might actually take us to some\n\ninvolvement on the part of your mother.        Are you willing to see\n\nyour mother go to jail?\"        David Wheeler interpreted this as a\n\nthreat intended to deter future complaints about the FBI's lack of\n\nprogress.\n\n            The Tulsa World and the Daily Oklahoman published at\n\nleast twelve articles on Wheeler's murder between 1995 and 1999.\n\nAt   the   time,   Patricia   (Wheeler's   widow),   Pamela   (Wheeler's\n\ndaughter), and Lawrence (one of Wheeler's sons) were living in\n\nTulsa.     David, along with another of Wheeler's sons, Mark, was\n\nliving in Texas.    Patricia and David stated by affidavit that they\n\nrecalled reading some of the Oklahoma press coverage. Lawrence and\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fMark recalled reading one or two articles, and Pamela said she did\n\nnot read any of them.\n\n          On January 19, 1995, the Tulsa World published a story\n\nstating that Brian Halloran had told the FBI that John Callahan\n\noffered him a contract to kill Wheeler, but that Halloran refused\n\nthe offer.   The article noted that Halloran was murdered shortly\n\nthereafter in 1982.     On July 11, 1997, as proceedings in the\n\nSalemme trial were developing, the Tulsa World reported that Bulger\n\nand Flemmi were \"potential suspects\" in Wheeler's murder and that\n\nFlemmi had executed an affidavit stating that he and Bulger were\n\ninformants and \"were given free reign from an FBI supervisor to\n\ncommit any crime as long as they did not 'clip anyone.'\"        On\n\nNovember 9, 1997, a Tulsa television station reported that the\n\nWheeler investigation \"ha[d] been held up by the FBI's attempts to\n\nbring down the Mafia in Boston\" and that \"the FBI did not share\n\ninformation it had about the death of Roger Wheeler Senior.\"   The\n\nnext day, the Tulsa World reported that \"[i]nvestigators said that\n\nthe prime suspects in Wheeler's killing turned out to be two highly\n\nplaced mob informants, working with the Boston FBI\" and that the\n\n\"Boston FBI protected their informants, James 'Whitey' Bulger and\n\nSteven [sic] 'The Rifleman' Flemmi.\"\n\n          On May 10, 1998, David Wheeler was interviewed by Ed\n\nBradley on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" program.   The following exchange was\n\ntelevised:\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f     Bradley: David Wheeler, Roger Wheeler's son, says he had\n     trouble understanding why his father's murder had\n     remained unsolved for so long. Until he found out Bulger\n     and Flemmi were FBI informants.\n\n     Wheeler: We've discovered that all along the FBI has been\n     in bed with the prime suspects in my father's murder.\n\n     Bradley: So you believe that the FBI protected your\n     father's killers and tried to prevent the truth from\n     coming out?\n\n     Wheeler: They not only protected my father's killers,\n     they to this day are protecting my father's killers and\n     they are to this day withholding information from the\n     police. This is eighteen years of covering up the crime.\n     This is eighteen years of being an accessory to murder.\n\nAt the close of the segment, David Wheeler also said, \"In the end,\n\nthere's one group, one group of people, that were supposed to help\n\nus, and that was the FBI, and those are the very people that\n\nbetrayed us, those are the very people that continue to betray us\n\nto this day.\"\n\n          During the segment, Bradley said that the \"extraordinary\n\nrelationship between the FBI and two organized crime bosses,\"\n\nnamely Bulger and Flemmi, \"may have allowed the FBI informants to\n\nget away with murder.\"    The segment also contained an interview of\n\nHomicide Sergeant Michael Huff of the Tulsa police department, who\n\nsaid that the Boston FBI had failed to share Halloran's information\n\nwith local and federal investigators in Tulsa working on the\n\nWheeler   investigation    and   that   this   failure   constituted\n\n\"obstruction of justice.\" Bradley also interviewed five detectives\n\nfrom Oklahoma, Florida, and Connecticut.       He stated that these\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fdetectives believed the Wheeler murder remained unsolved \"because\n\nBulger and Flemmi were protected by the FBI while they were\n\nproviding information on the Italian Mafia in New England.\"    One\n\ndetective, David Green, said that the FBI gave Bulger and Flemmi a\n\n\"license to steal\" and that \"apparently that license got a little\n\nbroader and covered a homicide.\"\n\n            David Wheeler said, by affidavit, that when he accused\n\nthe FBI of a cover-up on \"60 Minutes,\" he meant only that he had\n\npreviously been unaware of Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants\n\nand that he \"felt as though the FBI should have shared this\n\ninformation with [him] . . . long before this time.\"   He said that\n\nhe did not believe at that time that the FBI was responsible in any\n\nway for his father's death and that he had no facts to support such\n\na belief.\n\n            Patricia and Lawrence said by affidavit that they saw\n\nDavid on \"60 Minutes.\"    Pamela and Mark said, also by affidavit,\n\nthey did not see David on \"60 Minutes\" and did not discuss the show\n\nwith David or anyone else.   Mark said that he was aware that David\n\nappeared on the show, but Pamela said that she could not remember\n\nif she had been aware of that fact at the time.   The Wheelers said\n\nin their respective affidavits that tensions had arisen in the\n\nfamily since Roger's murder and that they communicated very little\n\namong themselves, particularly concerning the painful subject of\n\nthe murder.\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f           Following the \"60 Minutes\" interview, David Wheeler also\n\ngave interviews to the Boston press.         On May 12, 1998, The Boston\n\nHerald reported   that   David     Wheeler   said    that   he    \"has   always\n\nbelieved that [former FBI Agent Paul] Rico facilitated his father's\n\ndelivery into oblivion\" but that he only recently \"discovered that\n\noblivion may well have had names like Whitey and Stevey.\"                   The\n\narticle noted that David Wheeler said his father thought Rico might\n\nbe trying to kill him.   The article described Rico as Flemmi's \"FBI\n\nmentor\" and noted that Rico had recruited Flemmi as an informant.\n\nOn July 22, 1998, the Boston Globe interviewed David Wheeler and\n\ndescribed him as \"now believ[ing] the FBI has obstructed the\n\ninvestigation   into   his     father's   murder.\"        The    article   also\n\nsummarized the testimony of John Morris at the Salemme hearings in\n\nApril 1998, noting that Morris had testified that he told Connolly\n\nthat Halloran had implicated Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler\n\nmurder   investigation   and    that   Connolly     may   have    passed   this\n\ninformation on to Bulger and Flemmi.         On September 29, 1998, the\n\nBoston Globe reported John Martorano, a member of the Winter Hill\n\ngang, was negotiating a plea agreement with federal prosecutors.\n\nDescribing David Wheeler as \"the son of one of Martorano's alleged\n\nvictims,\" the article quoted him as stating that he would approve\n\nof a plea agreement for Martorano because \"[t]he people he's giving\n\nup are the people who have enjoyed the protection of the FBI for\n\nmany years while committing heinous crimes.\"\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f           By affidavit, David Wheeler said that he had \"probably\"\n\nread these articles, but Patricia, Pamela, and Lawrence said that\n\nthey had not, and Mark said that he did not recall whether he read\n\nthem.\n\n           At around the same time, in the summer of 1998, there was\n\nTulsa press coverage of developments in the Wheeler murder. On May\n\n17, 1998, the Tulsa World published an article with the headline:\n\n\"When G-men, Mobsters Are Friends/FBI Ignored Tip-Off on Tulsa\n\nMurder.\"   The article summarized Morris's testimony in April 1998,\n\nreporting that Morris had admitted to receiving cash and gifts from\n\nBulger and Flemmi, and to working with other agents to \"shield[]\n\nBulger and Flemmi from prosecution for 20 years because they were\n\nthe most prized secret FBI informants in New England history.\"    A\n\nsummary of Morris's testimony was again reported in a July 20, 1998\n\nTulsa World article about the Wheeler murder.      The article also\n\nreported that John Martorano had agreed to cooperate with federal\n\nprosecutors and to testify against Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler\n\nmurder case.\n\n           On September 9, 1999, after the Wheelers' May 11, 1999\n\ncut-off date for accrual had passed, Judge Wolf unsealed John\n\nMartorano's plea agreement, in which Martorano admitted that he had\n\nmurdered Roger Wheeler.   Judge Wolf's September 15, 1999 decision\n\nin Salemme described a series of specific incidents in the early\n\n1980s, before Wheeler's murder, in which FBI agents shielded Bulger\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fand Flemmi from investigation.        91 F. Supp. 2d at 202-06.     As to\n\nWheeler's    murder,   Judge   Wolf   found   that   partly   because   of\n\nirregularities in the FBI's handling of the files relating to\n\nWheeler's murder, \"questions remain regarding the role, if any,\n\nplayed by Flemmi and Bulger in the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan\n\nmurders, and the full degree to which the FBI in Boston has, from\n\n1981 until recently, attempted to keep any such role from being\n\ndiscerned and demonstrated.\"     Id. at 213.    He noted that a pattern\n\nof false statements in Flemmi's informant file diverted attention\n\nfrom Flemmi's crimes and FBI misconduct, that reports containing\n\nHalloran's allegations against Bulger and Flemmi were not indexed\n\naccording to usual FBI policy and hence could not be discovered\n\nthrough a standard search of FBI indices, and that the FBI had\n\ndisobeyed discovery orders by its late disclosure of relevant\n\ndocuments.   Id. at 154 n.3.\n\n            On December 22, 1999, John Connolly was indicted for\n\nracketeering. A superseding indictment was returned on October 11,\n\n2000.   It charged that Connolly had alerted Bulger and Flemmi to\n\nthe identity of confidential law enforcement informants, tipped\n\nthem off to various law enforcement initiatives, and failed to\n\nreport information relating to them that was material to the\n\ninvestigation of criminal activity in the Boston area.            It also\n\ncharged that Connolly had obstructed a grand jury investigation\n\n\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\finto Wheeler's murder and tipped Bulger and Flemmi to Halloran's\n\ncooperation.\n\n           On September 27, 2000, a federal grand jury returned an\n\nindictment charging Bulger and Flemmi with racketeering; two of the\n\npredicate acts for the racketeering charge were the murder of Roger\n\nWheeler and the conspiracy to commit that murder.\n\n           The Wheelers filed a notice of tort claim with the FBI on\n\nMay 11, 2001.   After the FBI failed to respond, the Wheelers filed\n\nsuit in federal court on March 14, 2002.         As in the McIntyre case,\n\nthe United States moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(1) on the ground that the Wheelers had failed to present\n\ntheir   administrative   claims   within   two    years   of   accrual,   as\n\nrequired by the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).         On March 31, 2003, the\n\ndistrict court granted the motion, finding that the Wheelers' claim\n\naccrued no later than May 10, 1998, when David Wheeler appeared on\n\n\"60 Minutes.\"   The court reasoned that David Wheeler's statements\n\nshowed that he knew that Bulger and Flemmi were suspected in his\n\nfather's murder and that they may have escaped investigation and\n\nprosecution for the crime with the assistance of the FBI.                 The\n\ncourt then went on to say that \"[i]t does not matter that not all\n\nthe plaintiffs in this case were as informed as David Wheeler\"\n\nbecause they were in possession of sufficient facts to place them\n\non inquiry notice.    Final judgment was entered on motion of the\n\nWheelers, who then timely appealed.\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f                                 II.\n\nA.   The FTCA Accrual Standard\n\n          The FTCA provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] tort claim\n\nagainst the United States shall be forever barred unless it is\n\npresented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two\n\nyears after such claim accrues.\"   28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).   Because the\n\nFTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity, it is strictly construed.\n\nSkwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Normally, a tort claim accrues at the time of injury.\n\nGonzalez, 284 F.3d at 288.   In United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S.\n\n111 (1979), the Supreme Court created a \"discovery rule\" exception\n\nfor FTCA claims involving medical malpractice. The Court held that\n\nsuch claims accrue when a plaintiff knows of both the existence and\n\nthe cause of his injury.       See id. at 119-202.         The Court\n\ndetermined that accrual does not await the point at which a\n\nplaintiff also knows that the acts inflicting the injury may\n\nconstitute medical malpractice.         Id. at 122.   Distinguishing\n\nbetween ignorance of the facts (of injury or its cause) and\n\nignorance of legal rights, the Court reasoned that a claimant, once\n\narmed with knowledge of the fact of injury and the identity of the\n\nparties that caused the injury, is no longer at the mercy of the\n\ngovernment.    At that point, claimants can go to others, such as\n\ndoctors or lawyers, who will tell them if they are victims of\n\nmalpractice.   Id.   The same is not necessarily true of plaintiffs\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fwho are ignorant of the facts, particularly when the government may\n\nbe in possession or control of the necessary information.\n\n             This court has extended this discovery rule to FTCA\n\nclaims outside the medical malpractice context.                   Skwira, 344 F.3d\n\nat 74; Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 780 (1st Cir.\n\n1992). Most circuits also apply a discovery rule to wrongful death\n\nactions.     See Skwira, 344 F.3d at 74 (collecting cases).\n\n             Under the discovery rule, \"a claim accrues when the\n\nplaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence\n\nshould have discovered, the factual basis for the cause of action.\"\n\nGonzalez, 284 F.3d at 288. The test for whether a plaintiff should\n\nhave discovered necessary facts is an objective one.                   Id. at 288-\n\n89.    We look first to whether sufficient facts were available to\n\nprovoke a reasonable person in the plaintiff's circumstances to\n\ninquire or investigate further.              \"A claim does not accrue when a\n\nperson has a mere hunch, hint, suspicion, or rumor of a claim, but\n\nsuch suspicions do give rise to a duty to inquire into the possible\n\nexistence     of     a    claim   in   the    exercise      of   due   diligence.\"\n\nKronisch v. United States, 150 F.3d 112, 121 (2d Cir. 1998)\n\n(citation omitted and emphasis added).             Once a duty to inquire is\n\nestablished, the plaintiff is charged with the knowledge of what he\n\nor    she   would    have    uncovered       through    a   reasonably     diligent\n\ninvestigation.           Skwira, 344 F.3d at 77.            The next question is\n\nwhether     the     plaintiff,    if   armed     with    the     results   of   that\n\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\finvestigation, would know enough to permit a reasonable person to\n\nbelieve that she had been injured and that there is a causal\n\nconnection between the government and her injury.             Id. at 78.\n\nDefinitive knowledge is not necessary. Id. This inquiry is highly\n\nfact- and case-specific, as are the pertinent questions to ask.\n\n           In Attallah, for example, the plaintiffs learned in\n\nSeptember 1982 that the decomposed body of their courier, who had\n\nbeen transporting almost $700,000 of their money to Puerto Rico,\n\nhad been found.       955 F.2d at 778.      Over four years later, two\n\nCustoms agents were indicted for the robbery and murder of the\n\ncourier.     Id.    The court found that the plaintiffs had filed a\n\ntimely administrative claim against the United States because their\n\nclaim accrued when the Customs agents were indicted, not when the\n\ncourier's body was found.     Id. at 780.     The court focused on the\n\nfact that aside from the indictment, the only information that the\n\nplaintiffs had available about the whereabouts of their courier was\n\na Customs Service document showing that their courier had been\n\nprocessed at the airport customs office and then left the premises.\n\nId.   The court reasoned that if it took the police until 1987 to\n\ndiscover   sufficient    information   to   bring   charges   against   the\n\nCustoms agents, the plaintiffs could not be expected to be more\n\nefficient.    Id.\n\n           Another example is the Skwira case, in which a divided\n\ncourt, in three opinions, found that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\ffile a timely administrative claim.           Skwira, 344 F.3d at 83-86.\n\nThere, the claim was that a VA nurse had murdered Edward Skwira, a\n\npatient at the Northampton VA hospital, by injecting him with the\n\nstimulant epinephrine. The facts convincing to the majority on the\n\nissue of accrual were as follows.             Skwira was admitted to a\n\nsubstance abuse treatment facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, in\n\nearly February 1996 for the treatment of chronic alcoholism and on\n\nFebruary 15 was transferred to Ward C of the VA hospital, where the\n\nmurderess was working.         Id. at 69.     Despite the absence of any\n\nreason to anticipate heart problems, he suffered a catastrophic\n\ncardiac event later that day and died on February 18, with heart\n\nailments listed as the immediate cause of death.                Id.    By the\n\nsummer of 1996, articles began appearing in the Northampton local\n\npress describing an ongoing criminal investigation into the high\n\nnumber of suspicious deaths in Ward C, and the administrator was\n\nquoted as not ruling out foul play.          Id. at 68, 80.     By September\n\nor October of 1996, investigators contacted the families of some of\n\nthe   victims,   including     Skwira's,    to   voice   the    government's\n\n\"suspicions\" about the deaths and obtained permission to exhume and\n\nautopsy the bodies.     Id. at 68.     Skwira's autopsy showed that the\n\ndeath certificate had misstated the cause of death.              Id.   As the\n\nconcurring opinion stated, at that point \"a reasonable person would\n\nhave believed    that   some    kind   of   negligence   or    misconduct   by\n\ngovernment employees at the hospital might well underlie Edward\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fSkwira's death.\"    Id. at 85 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).               Had the\n\nplaintiffs sought out independent legal and medical advice at that\n\npoint, they should have been able to determine in the two-year\n\nperiod whether to file an administrative claim.              See Skwira, 344\n\nF.3d at 81.     The court observed that two other victims' families\n\ndid file timely claims, whereas the Skwiras waited three years\n\nafter the autopsy report before filing.             Id. at 82 n.19.\n\n           Skwira is instructive in the ways in which it is both\n\nlike and unlike the two cases at bar.          The differences are obvious.\n\nUnlike the victims in the cases at bar, Skwira was in the sole\n\ncustody and care of a government hospital and, overwhelmingly, the\n\nmost   likely   malefactor   was   one    of    a   very   limited    group   of\n\ngovernment employees at that hospital.          All of the deaths occurred\n\nin the same place with the same small cast of characters.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Gilbert, 229 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 2000) (the\n\ndeaths in Ward C of the VA hospital occurred over a six-month\n\nperiod).   There was also certainty the patients were dead, unlike\n\nin McIntyre's situation.\n\n           The chief similarity between the two cases at bar and\n\nSkwira is that there was a government investigation into possible\n\nwrongdoing in all three cases.            But the circumstances of the\n\ninvestigation here were different than in Skwira.                    There, the\n\ngovernment came to the family with its suspicions of wrongdoing at\n\nthe hospital and explained the factual basis for those suspicions.\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\f344 F.3d at 68.   The government then helped develop the evidence of\n\nwrongdoing, informing the family that the cause of death reported\n\nwas different than that found in Skwira's autopsy.         Id.   By\n\ncontrast, in the two cases at bar, the government did not inform\n\nthe plaintiffs of any investigation, appears to have held the facts\n\nrevealed in its investigation confidential, and ultimately claimed\n\nto have cleared its agents of wrongdoing before the critical dates\n\nfor accrual purposes.5\n\nB.   Application to McIntyre's Claims\n\n          The claims made by the estate of McIntyre are based on\n\ntwo interrelated theories of how the FBI caused McIntyre's death:\n\n(1) by leaking his confidential informant status to Bulger and\n\nFlemmi, in violation of a special duty of non-disclosure owed to\n\nhim by the government, and (2) by protecting Bulger and Flemmi from\n\ninvestigation and prosecution, thus enabling and emboldening them\n\nto murder him.    As we understand the second theory, it is meant to\n\nbuttress the first theory; it is perhaps also meant to serve as an\n\nindependent basis for liability.6       The first theory, which we\n\nunderstand to be the predominant one, arises out of a special duty\n\n\n     5\n          The plaintiffs here do not argue that the pendency of a\ngovernment investigation should automatically toll accrual of their\nclaims.   That argument was rejected in Skwira, which found no\nstatutory basis for such tolling. See 344 F.3d at 85-86 (Boudin,\nC.J., concurring).\n     6\n          To the extent that the plaintiff does intend the second\ntheory as an independent basis for liability, the United States is\nfree to challenge the availability of that theory on remand.\n\n                                -35-\n\fthat the government has to confidential informants who would be\n\nendangered if their informant status were revealed to others,\n\nparticularly     those     whose   activities     are    the    subject   of    the\n\ninformant's     disclosures.       The   FBI    Manual    requires    agents     to\n\nexercise constant care to ensure that an informant's identity is\n\nnot disclosed, whether intentionally or inadvertently. Salemme, 91\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 150; see also Leonhard v. United States, 633 F.2d\n\n599, 614 (2d Cir. 1980) (\"The procurement of testimony against\n\nalleged    members    of     organized    crime    will        normally   require\n\nappropriate protection of both the informant and his family.\");\n\nSocialist Workers Party v. Attorney Gen. of United States, 458 F.\n\nSupp. 895, 907 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (\"[T]he FBI asserted that it owed\n\nthe duty of confidentiality to the informants to protect them from\n\nembarrassment and harm.\"), vacated on other grounds, In re Attorney\n\nGen. of United States, 596 F.2d 58 (2d Cir. 1979).               Because we find\n\nthat the    plaintiff      could   not   reasonably      be    expected   to   have\n\ndiscovered the facts supporting the first theory until after May\n\n25, 1998, we find that the case was not properly dismissed and\n\ntherefore reverse.\n\n           The    plaintiff's      predominant     theory       depends   on    the\n\nfollowing reasoning:\n\n           1.        McIntyre was cooperating with the government in\n\n                     its investigation of Bulger and Flemmi, which\n\n                     imposed a duty on the FBI;\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f            2.     McIntyre was murdered;\n\n            3.     Bulger    and   Flemmi   were   responsible   for   the\n\n                   murder;\n\n            4.     McIntyre was murdered because Bulger and Flemmi\n\n                   learned he was informing on them to government\n\n                   authorities;\n\n            5.     It was agents of the FBI, Connolly and/or Morris,\n\n                   who told Bulger and Flemmi that McIntyre was\n\n                   cooperating with the FBI.\n\nThe district court focused on the first three parts of this\n\nsequence only.   This did not go far enough.       The key missing links\n\nare the fourth and fifth points.      We focus on the fifth: whether a\n\nreasonable person in the McIntyres' position, after conducting a\n\ndiligent investigation, would have uncovered a sufficient factual\n\nbasis to believe, before May 25, 1998, that the FBI was the source\n\nof the leak to Bulger and Flemmi.     We conclude that he or she would\n\nnot have.\n\n            Certainly before May of 1998, the McIntyre family knew of\n\nfacts that would permit a reasonable person to believe that Bulger\n\nand Flemmi were responsible for the killing of John McIntyre in\n\n1984 and that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI informants.        In our view,\n\nthat was not enough to trigger accrual, in light of the nature of\n\nMcIntyre's claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\f            A June 1997 Boston Globe article, described in our review\n\nof the facts, reported that witness statements and other evidence\n\nsupported the conclusion that Bulger and Flemmi had McIntyre\n\nkidnapped,    tortured   him   to   find   out   what    he   had    told   the\n\nauthorities, and then murdered him.          Implicit in this report was\n\nthat Bulger and Flemmi had somehow found out McIntyre was an\n\ninformant.     But the article never even mentioned the possibility\n\nthat the FBI had disclosed this information to Bulger and Flemmi or\n\nhad otherwise given its imprimatur to the murder.\n\n            Furthermore, the McIntyres were also faced with the\n\ngovernment's    affirmative    denials     of    any    wrongdoing    in    the\n\nrelationship between Bulger and Flemmi and FBI agents Morris and\n\nConnolly.     The government repeatedly denied wrongdoing in Boston\n\nGlobe articles from 1988 through 1995, and one article reported\n\nthat an internal FBI investigation had cleared the two agents.\n\nThen, a December 5, 1997 Boston Herald article stated that the\n\nDepartment of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility had\n\ninvestigated and \"cleared the FBI handlers [Morris and Connolly] of\n\n[wrongdoing    involving]   informant      gangsters    Whitey   Bulger     and\n\nStephen Flemmi.\"      Faced with a denial of wrongdoing by the FBI\n\nitself, and lacking any basis to controvert the denial other than\n\nrumor, the McIntyres did not have a reasoned basis to believe that\n\nit was the FBI that had leaked McIntyre's identity as an informant\n\nto Bulger and Flemmi.\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\f          We   turn   to   the   question   whether   there   was   later\n\ninformation between the December 5, 1997 denial of wrongdoing by\n\nthe FBI and May 25, 1998 that provided notice of that missing link.\n\nThe district court found such an event based on testimony by Agent\n\nStutman, the former local chief of the DEA, in the Salemme hearings\n\non April 15, 1998.    Because Emily McIntyre attended part of those\n\nhearings, the court attributed to her knowledge of Stutman's\n\nstatements that he and agents in his office suspected that the FBI\n\nhad compromised their investigation of Bulger and Flemmi but had no\n\nfacts to confirm their suspicions.       Even assuming that statement\n\nprovided a reasoned basis to believe that the FBI had compromised\n\nthe DEA's investigation, perhaps by tipping Bulger and Flemmi to\n\nlistening devices or warning them of raids, it does not provide a\n\nreasoned basis to believe that the FBI leaked McIntyre's informant\n\nstatus to Bulger and Flemmi.\n\n          The government points to a different event: an April 23,\n\n1998 Boston Herald story reporting that the previous day, Morris\n\nhad testified that in 1982, he told Connolly, who in turn told\n\nBulger and Flemmi, the identity of FBI informant Brian Halloran,\n\nwho had informed authorities that Bulger and Flemmi tried to hire\n\nhim to kill Roger Wheeler.         The government argues that this\n\ninformation -- that the FBI had leaked to Bulger and Flemmi the\n\nidentity of a different informant, as to a different crime, at a\n\ndifferent time -- provided sufficient facts for a reasonable person\n\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\fto believe that the same thing had happened to McIntyre.                          The\n\ngovernment argues that if there was evidence Bulger and Flemmi\n\nkilled   Halloran      because     the    FBI   told    them   Halloran     was    an\n\ninformant, then a reasonable person could have inferred that Bulger\n\nand Flemmi also killed John McIntyre based on a similar FBI leak.\n\nThe government's analogy overreaches both as a matter of logic and\n\nas a matter of fact.\n\n            Even assuming arguendo that the Boston Herald article was\n\nenough to lead the McIntyres to suspect that the FBI leaked\n\nMcIntyre's identity, and thus to trigger a duty to inquire, a\n\nreasonably diligent investigation would still not have revealed the\n\nnecessary factual predicate for their claim before the accrual\n\ndate.    Most     avenues    of    investigation        were    cut   off   by    the\n\npossibility of criminal liability for any FBI agents and others\n\ninvolved.    Attempts to gain information through depositions would\n\nlikely have been thwarted by invocations of the Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination.                And other information --\n\nsuch as testimony before the grand jury or facts discovered in the\n\ngovernment investigation -- was hidden behind a veil of secrecy.\n\nIn this sense, the McIntyres had even less access to critical\n\ninformation than most FTCA plaintiffs.                 See Kubrick, 444 U.S. at\n\n122 (adopting a discovery rule in part because \"the facts about\n\ncausation   may   be    in   the    control     of     the   putative   defendant,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\funavailable    to   the      plaintiff    or     at    least    very    difficult        to\n\nobtain\").\n\n            Without more specific information than provided in the\n\nBoston Herald article, a reasonable person could not have had a\n\nbasis to claim that the FBI betrayed McIntyre's cooperation to\n\nBulger and Flemmi.         Bulger and Flemmi apparently murdered people\n\nfor many reasons.         Some of those people were informants.                      But,\n\nwithout   more,     one    cannot     reasonably       deduce    from        a   victim's\n\ninformant status (1) that Bulger and Flemmi knew the victim to be\n\nan informant, (2) that, if Bulger and Flemmi knew the victim to be\n\nan informant, they murdered the victim for that reason, and (3)\n\nmost importantly, that even if Bulger and Flemmi murdered the\n\nvictim for being an informant, the source of their information as\n\nto the victim's informant status was the FBI.                          One could not\n\nreasonably infer, for purposes of FTCA accrual, from Morris's\n\ntestimony about Halloran that the FBI told Bulger and Flemmi about\n\nevery informant in their organization or that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nkilled every person that they knew to be informing against them,\n\nregardless of the circumstances.\n\n            Drawing a direct parallel between the murders of Halloran\n\nand McIntyre is particularly difficult because the situations were\n\nso   different.        The    cases     involved       different       and       unrelated\n\nunderlying    crimes      that   took    place    at    different      times       and   in\n\ndifferent places: the Wheeler murder was in 1981 in Oklahoma and\n\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\fwas related to control of a Jai Alai empire, whereas the Valhalla\n\ngun-running operation was in 1984 in Boston for the IRA. Moreover,\n\nHalloran arguably posed a greater threat to Bulger and Flemmi as an\n\ninformant than McIntyre did.       As Bergeron noted, and as Bulger and\n\nFlemmi might well have been aware, McIntyre was \"petrified\" of the\n\ntwo and was unlikely to come forward publicly or, by implication,\n\nto testify.      McIntyre was a low-level operative in a gun-running\n\noperation, whereas Halloran was a hit man with the power to\n\nimplicate Bulger and Flemmi for murder. Another factual difference\n\nis that there was some indication, as the prosecution itself argued\n\nin Salemme, that McIntyre's cooperation was known to those outside\n\nthe   government,    and   thus   that    Bulger     and    Flemmi   could   have\n\ndiscovered this information from some source other than the FBI.\n\nA January 29, 1995 Boston Globe article reported that \"[r]umors\n\nthat McIntyre was talking [to the federal government] were rampant\"\n\nat the time.\n\n           The    government's    own    behavior     further   undercuts     its\n\nargument here that there were sufficient facts before May 25, 1998\n\nto reasonably infer that FBI had betrayed McIntyre. In response to\n\na defense objection during the cross-examination of Bergeron in the\n\nSalemme hearings     on    June   4,   1998,   the    prosecution     said   that\n\n\"there's literally a dozen people\" outside the FBI who knew of\n\nMcIntyre's cooperation and could have passed the information to\n\nBulger   and   Flemmi.      The   prosecutor       argued    that    Judge   Wolf\n\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\f\"shouldn't infer that there was some leak from the FBI that led to\n\nMr.   McIntyre's     disappearance\"        because    the    evidence   was     too\n\nspeculative. That, of course, is directly contrary to the position\n\nof the United States as stated in the case at bar: that before May\n\nof 1998, the McIntyres not only should have drawn exactly that\n\ninference but should have acted on it by seeking legal and other\n\nexpert advice about filing an FTCA claim.\n\n            In the June 1998 Salemme hearings, after the critical\n\ndate for accrual purposes had passed, the prosecution also sought\n\nto establish in its questioning of Bergeron that McIntyre had\n\nspoken to authorities about a number of notorious individuals, as\n\nwell as the IRA, \"[a]ll of whom would have had a motive to make him\n\ndisappear.\"       This casts further doubt on whether Bulger or Flemmi\n\nhad caused McIntyre's disappearance, making even more remote the\n\ninference   that     the   FBI   had    leaked   McIntyre's     identity   as    an\n\ninformant and caused his murder.\n\n            This government position in June of 1998 is significant\n\nfor several reasons.         It shows that there was a real basis to\n\nquestion whether it was at all reasonable to infer that Connolly\n\nhad disclosed McIntyre's dual role to Bulger.               We have no reason to\n\nthink the federal prosecutor's position in Salemme was taken in bad\n\nfaith.      The    prosecution,        which   had   access    to   confidential\n\ninformation and was in possession of far more facts than members of\n\nthe public, argued to the court that it could not reasonably make\n\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fsuch an inference.    The McIntyres, who were in a far worse position\n\nto access or evaluate information, should not be required here to\n\ndraw such an inference.    See Attallah, 955 F.2d at 780 (\"The police\n\ndid not have sufficient information to bring charges against the\n\n[relevant    government    officials]      until   1987.        We    believe\n\n[plaintiffs] could not have been more efficient.\").\n\n            Equally importantly, the prosecutor's position in June of\n\n1998 was yet another expression by the United States in a public\n\nforum that Connolly had not leaked McIntyre's identity and no\n\nwrongdoing had occurred.\n\n            Our decision in Skwira hurts rather than helps the\n\ngovernment's position.      The United States in Skwira told the\n\nplaintiff that there was cause to investigate suspicious deaths of\n\npatients who were within the sole custody of a VA hospital when\n\nthey died and did not deny wrongdoing.        344 F.3d at 80.        Here, the\n\ngovernment   kept    confidential    its   investigation   of    claims    of\n\nmisconduct by Connolly and Morris and ultimately reported in 1997\n\nthat it found no wrongdoing.    Even Judge Wolf had great difficulty\n\nin prying loose coherent information about McIntyre's death by the\n\ndate of his opinion on September 15, 1999.          Judge Wolf commented\n\nthat the question of whether the FBI disclosed McIntyre's identity\n\ncould not \"be resolved on the present record\" because of the\n\ngovernment's delayed disclosure of documents and its desire to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\favoid bringing to light the circumstances surrounding McIntyre's\n\ndeath.   Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 215.\n\n              We reverse the dismissal of the claims by McIntyre's\n\nestate and remand.\n\nC.    Application to the Wheeler Case\n\n              The cut-off date for the accrual of the Wheelers' claim,\n\nfiled on May 11, 2001, is May 11, 1999.              The district court\n\nconcluded that their claim accrued on or before May 10, 1998 when\n\nRoger Wheeler appeared on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n              The Wheeler case is based on a fundamentally different\n\nlegal theory than the McIntyre case.          Unlike the McIntyre case,\n\nwhich is based on duties arising from the government/informant\n\nrelationship, the Wheelers' claim is not based on any direct\n\nrelationship between Roger Wheeler and the FBI.             The theory of\n\nliability is, as a result, much more indirect than that in the\n\nMcIntyre case.\n\n              The Wheelers have styled their Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 229,\n\nยงยง 2 and 6 wrongful death claims against the United States as based\n\non both direct and vicarious liability. They assert that the United\n\nStates is vicariously liable for the actions of Connolly, Morris,\n\nand   other    agents,   which   provided   Bulger   and   Flemmi   with   a\n\n\"protective shield\" against prosecution and investigation that gave\n\nthe two criminals the opportunity to commit crimes and emboldened\n\nthem to do so, proximately causing Wheeler's murder.         The Wheelers\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\falso assert that the United States is directly liable for failing\n\nto prevent Wheeler's murder, in light of the foreseeable risk that\n\nBulger and Flemmi would continue to engage in violent criminal\n\nactivity.    In addition, the Wheelers assert a generalized count\n\nagainst the United States for intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress based on Wheeler's murder.\n\n            For the Wheelers' claims to accrue, there had to be facts\n\navailable that would permit a reasonable person to conclude (1) that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were instrumental in the murder of Roger Wheeler;\n\n(2) that Bulger and Flemmi were informants for the FBI; and (3) that\n\nthe FBI had a special relationship with Bulger and Flemmi that\n\nprotected and encouraged them in their criminal activity, including\n\nWheeler's murder.\n\n            The Wheelers clearly had sufficient notice of the first\n\ntwo sets of facts before the May 11, 1999 accrual date.     On April\n\n22, 1998, Morris testified that Bulger and Flemmi were valuable FBI\n\ninformants and that he was afraid he had sent Halloran to his death\n\nby telling Connolly that Halloran was alleging that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi had tried to hire him to kill Wheeler.      Morris's testimony\n\non this point received national press attention.    It was summarized\n\nin two Tulsa World articles on May 17, 1998 and July 20, 1998 and\n\nin a July 22, 1998 Boston Globe article that quoted David Wheeler.\n\nIn addition, a July 20, 1998 Tulsa World article and a September 29,\n\n1998 Boston Globe article, which quoted David Wheeler, both reported\n\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\fthat John Martorano was negotiating a plea agreement with federal\n\nprosecutors and had implicated Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler\n\nmurder.    In addition, as the district court fairly pointed out,\n\nDavid Wheeler stated on the May 10, 1998 \"60 Minutes\" show that\n\nBulger and Flemmi had caused his father to be murdered, that the two\n\nwere FBI informants, and that the FBI was \"in bed\" with the two.\n\n            What proves fatal to the Wheelers' claim is that they were\n\nalso on notice of the third set of facts.           We sidestep the dispute\n\nabout whether David Wheeler meant his statements on \"60 Minutes\" to\n\nindicate    that    the   FBI   had   protected    Bulger   and   Flemmi   from\n\nprosecution and thus enabled and emboldened them to murder his\n\nfather.    Other statements on the \"60 Minutes\" show should have made\n\nclear the special relationship between the FBI and Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.    Ed Bradley reported that the \"extraordinary relationship\"\n\nbetween the FBI and Bulger and Flemmi \"may have allowed [them] to\n\nget away with murder.\"       A detective interviewed for the segment was\n\neven more explicit, describing Bulger and Flemmi as having a\n\n\"license\" from the FBI to commit crimes that \"covered a homicide.\"\n\n            In addition, separate from the \"60 Minutes\" show, there\n\nwas national and local news coverage before the critical date\n\ndescribing    the    FBI's      shielding    of   Bulger    and   Flemmi   from\n\nprosecution. At least some of those articles should have caught the\n\nWheelers' attention, because they specifically referenced Roger\n\n\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fWheeler's murder and even, in several instances, quoted David\n\nWheeler.\n\n           Two Tulsa World articles on July 11, 1997 and January 9,\n\n1998, both of which specifically mentioned the Wheeler murder,\n\nreported that Flemmi was claiming in the Salemme proceedings that\n\nthe FBI gave him and Bulger immunity from prosecution for their\n\nongoing criminal activities in exchange for information about\n\norganized crime activities.      The July 11 article specifically noted\n\nthat Flemmi had executed an affidavit stating that he and Bulger had\n\nbeen given \"free reign from an FBI supervisor to commit any crime\"\n\nshort of murder.        On May 10, 1998, the same night that the \"60\n\nMinutes\" segment ran, a local Tulsa news station, KOTV, reported\n\nthat the FBI had tipped Bulger and Flemmi to Halloran's cooperation\n\nin the Wheeler murder investigation and that Boston FBI agents may\n\nhave taken bribes from Bulger and Flemmi.\n\n           In the summer of 1998, two Tulsa World articles and one\n\nBoston Globe article that quoted David Wheeler reported that Morris\n\nadmitted   that   the    FBI   had   shielded   Bulger    and   Flemmi   from\n\nprosecution for twenty years because they were prized informants.\n\nThe Tulsa World article was entitled \"When G-men, Mobsters Are\n\nFriends/FBI Ignored Tip-Off on Tulsa Murder.\"            All three articles\n\nspecifically mentioned the Wheeler murder.        Morris's testimony was\n\nalso picked up by the national press, with coverage in May and June\n\nof 1998 from the Associated Press, the Salt Lake Tribune, the\n\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fCharleston Gazette & Daily Mail, the L.A. Times, and the Seattle\n\nTimes.\n\n            In the summer and fall of 1998, following the \"60 Minutes\"\n\nsegment, David Wheeler himself drew the connection between his\n\nfather's murder and the FBI's special relationship with Bulger and\n\nFlemmi in his comments to the Boston press.             In a May 12, 1998\n\narticle headlined \"Dad's execution mystery no more to anxious son,\"\n\nthe Boston Herald described David Wheeler as saying in an interview\n\nthat   he   \"always   believed\"   that   former   FBI    agent   Paul   Rico\n\n\"facilitated\" his father's murder at the hands of Bulger and Flemmi.\n\nWheeler also told the Boston Globe on September 29, 1998 that John\n\nMartorano's cooperation would expose \"people who have enjoyed the\n\nprotection of the FBI for many years while committing heinous\n\ncrimes.\"\n\n            The   Oklahoma   press   and   television      coverage,    the\n\ninformation revealed on \"60 Minutes,\" and David Wheeler's interviews\n\nwith the Boston press are sufficient to establish that David Wheeler\n\nwas clearly on notice before the May 11, 1999 critical date.\n\n            The issue is whether the other family members, in their\n\ndifferent positions, could reasonably be expected to be aware of\n\nthis information.     The district court focused on David Wheeler and\n\nattributed his knowledge to all. We disagree with that methodology:\n\nthe \"knew or reasonably should have known\" question must be asked\n\nindividually, as to the information available to someone in each\n\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fplaintiff's situation.       There is a difference between \"knew\" and\n\n\"should have known.\"     A plaintiff could, at least in theory, have\n\nactual knowledge of critical facts even though he or she would not\n\notherwise be reasonably expected to know them.         As to whether a\n\nplaintiff \"reasonably should have known\" critical facts, the inquiry\n\nis an objective one: whether a reasonable person similarly situated\n\nto the plaintiff would have known the necessary facts.       See Skwira,\n\n344 F.3d at 80 (the \"degree of knowledge of injury and cause that\n\nwould prompt a reasonable person to take . . .         protective steps\n\nwill vary with the circumstances of the case\"); cf. Rodriguez\n\nNarvaez v. Nazario, 895 F.2d 38, 41 n.5 (1st Cir. 1990) (describing\n\na similar constructive knowledge test, used to determine accrual of\n\nfederal civil rights claims, as whether \"a reasonably prudent person\n\nsimilarly situated\" should have known the necessary facts).\n\n            Where there are several plaintiffs and they do not live\n\nin the same geographical area, and public notice of the underlying\n\nfacts is restricted to certain areas, geography is a factor to be\n\nconsidered.    Geography may be particularly relevant where, as here,\n\nnotice is based on local television and press coverage.       Similarly,\n\nwhere, as here, some members of the family have actual notice but\n\nothers do not, the issue of how strong the family's ties are and how\n\nfrequently they communicate can be relevant.        A plaintiff who is\n\nestranged     from   other   more   knowledgeable   family   members   is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\fdifferently situated than one who speaks with his or her family\n\nevery day.\n\n          Despite this leeway, the record here establishes that each\n\nof the Wheelers had available sufficient facts to raise suspicions\n\nprovoking a reasonable person to inquire further.         See Phillips\n\nExeter Academy v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st\n\nCir. 1999) (this court \"may affirm the judgment for any independent\n\nreason made manifest in the record\").       Had the Wheelers inquired\n\nfurther, the requisite facts were present in the Boston and Oklahoma\n\ntelevision and press coverage to allow a reasonable person to infer\n\na causal connection between the FBI's actions and Roger Wheeler's\n\nmurder.\n\n             Patricia Wheeler (Roger's widow) saw the \"60 Minutes\"\n\nprogram in May 1998 and some of the Oklahoma press articles; they\n\nwere sufficient at least to trigger a duty to inquire before the May\n\n11, 1999 critical date, painful as the subject was to her. The same\n\nis essentially true of Lawrence Wheeler, one of Roger's sons.\n\n             Pamela Wheeler Norberg (Roger's only daughter) did not see\n\nthe \"60 Minutes\" segment.     She has stated by affidavit that she did\n\nnot read any of the press coverage in the record on the painful\n\nsubject of her father's murder, and that she is estranged from her\n\nbrothers and communicates with them only infrequently.       While her\n\nclaim presents a closer case, we find that she had a duty to inquire\n\nbased on local and national press coverage. \"[W]here events receive\n\n\n\n                                  -51-\n\f. . . widespread publicity, plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge\n\nof their occurrence.\"   United Klans of Am. v. McGovern, 621 F.2d\n\n152, 154 (5th Cir. 1980) (national news coverage over networks,\n\nwire, and newspapers reported that defendant held press conference\n\nadmitting facts supporting the claim); see also Hughes v. Vanderbilt\n\nUniv., 215 F.3d 543, 548 (6th Cir. 2000) (front-page stories in two\n\nlocal newspapers and a major television network gave rise to\n\nconstructive knowledge, even though plaintiff said she did not see\n\nthe coverage).   Although we recognize that the question of whether\n\na reasonable person in Pamela's position would have read news\n\ncoverage is a fact-intensive inquiry and can sometimes be difficult\n\nto resolve on a motion to dismiss,7 we find that, on the facts of\n\nthis case, the record is sufficient to establish notice. Local news\n\ncoverage in Tulsa, where Pamela lived, was extensive and mentioned\n\nRoger Wheeler specifically by name, often in the lead paragraph of\n\nthe story. Furthermore, nothing in the record shows that Pamela was\n\nestranged from her mother, who did watch the \"60 Minutes\" show and\n\nread at least some press coverage.

He stated by affidavit that he read only\n\none   or   two   of   the   articles   in     the   Tulsa   press   and   that   he\n\ncommunicates only infrequently with his family because of tensions\n\narising from his father's murder.             He presents an even closer case\n\nthan Pamela because he lived in Texas and the television and press\n\ncoverage in the record appeared mostly in either Boston or Tulsa\n\nsources.    But we find that he too had a duty to inquire, which if\n\npursued, would have led him to file his claim earlier. He was aware\n\nof the \"60 Minutes\" show and, by implication, of national news\n\ncoverage of his father's murder.            He had access to Tulsa news, as\n\ndemonstrated by his reading of at least one or two articles in the\n\nTulsa newspapers on the subject of his father's death, so if he had\n\ninquired further, he could have learned the necessary facts through\n\nthat medium.\n\n            The claim of equitable tolling of the two-year limit\n\nfails, to the extent that such a claim is cognizable against the\n\ngovernment at all.8         It is true that the FBI had a long history of\n\n      8\n          Compare Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89,\n94 (1990) (stating that equitable tolling applies in Title VII\nsuits against the government on the same terms as it would against\na private employer), with United States v. Beggerly, 524 U.S. 38,\n49-50 (1998) (holding that equitable tolling does not apply to\nactions under the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2409a, for reasons\n\n                                       -53-\n\fdenying that Bulger and Flemmi were informants, that there was any\n\n\"special\" relationship between the FBI and the two, and then that\n\nany impropriety resulted from the relationship.     For purposes of\n\nequitable tolling, however, the government's denials were superseded\n\nwhen Morris testified in April 1998 in the Salemme hearings that he\n\nand Connolly shielded Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution and that\n\nthey may have been responsible for Halloran's death.\n\n                               III.\n\n          The dismissal of the claim against the United States in\n\nthe McIntyre case is reversed and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.     The dismissal in the\n\nWheeler case is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nthat could also apply to the FTCA).\n\n                               -54-\n\f",

See United States v. Salemme, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510809\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510809/united-states-v-salemme/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Such corruption had been rumored but had been\n\ndenied by the FBI.\n\n          The 1999 opinion by Judge Wolf revealed that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi, who were leaders of the Winter Hill Gang, a crime syndicate\n\ninvolved in murder, bribery, extortion, loansharking, and gambling\n\noperations, had been high-level FBI informants since the 1970s,\n\naiding the agency in its investigation of La Cosa Nostra, a rival\n\ncrime syndicate.       The opinion raised the prospect that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi had received numerous benefits from the FBI in return,\n\nincluding protection from prosecution, and at times, access to the\n\nnames of informants who were themselves providing information to\n\nthe FBI about the criminal activities of Bulger and Flemmi.             Id. at\n\n148-63, 322.        Some of the informants may have been killed as a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fresult, and the murderous activities of Bulger and Flemmi covered\n\nup.   Id. at 208-13.\n\n           The opinion speculated that Agent Connolly may have\n\ndisclosed to Bulger and Flemmi the identity of an individual, John\n\nMcIntyre, who was an informant for the local Quincy police and was\n\ndebriefed by the FBI, United States Customs Service, and the Drug\n\nEnforcement   Administration   (DEA).   Id.   at   213-15.   McIntyre\n\ndisappeared roughly six weeks after an October 17, 1984 interview\n\nwith FBI Agent Roderick Kennedy, in which McIntyre had linked\n\nBulger to gun-running and drug-smuggling operations. Id. His body\n\nwas found fifteen years later, on January 14, 2000, in a makeshift\n\ngrave near Boston.     But the opinion, published in September 1999,\n\nultimately concluded that it could not be determined whether FBI\n\nAgent Kennedy had, in fact, shared this information about McIntyre\n\nwith Connolly and whether Connolly, in turn, had told Bulger.     Id.\n\nat 214-15.    That was because, as the court said later, \"important\n\nFBI documents concerning John McIntyre were . . . improperly\n\nwithheld by agents of the Boston FBI until it was too late to\n\nquestion relevant witnesses concerning them.\"        United States v.\n\nFlemmi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2485436\"><a href=\"/opinion/2485436/united-states-v-flemmi/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mass. 2001).\n\n           The opinion also indicated the likelihood that Agent\n\nConnolly had disclosed to Bulger the name of another informant as\n\nto Bulger's crimes, Brian Halloran. In January 1982, Halloran told\n\ntwo FBI agents that Bulger and Flemmi had caused the 1981 murder of\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fa Tulsa businessman, Roger Wheeler. Connolly learned of Halloran's\n\ncooperation and disclosed it to Bulger.           Halloran was murdered in\n\nMay 1982.         Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 208-210.              Agent Morris\n\ntestified to this sequence of events in hearings before Judge Wolf\n\nin April 1998.\n\n             Agent Connolly was indicted on October 11, 2000 and\n\ncharged with numerous crimes, including \"alert[ing] Bulger and\n\nFlemmi to the identity of confidential law enforcement informants\n\nin   order   to     protect    Bulger's   and   Flemmi's    ongoing      criminal\n\nactivities\" and taking other steps to protect Bulger and Flemmi.\n\nConnolly was charged with inducing Agent Morris to do the same, in\n\nviolation    of     Morris's   legal   obligations.        Among   the    several\n\nracketeering acts charged was that Connolly had told Bulger and\n\nFlemmi of Halloran's statements that Bulger and Flemmi had caused\n\nWheeler's murder.        In turn, the indictment charged, Bulger caused\n\nHalloran     to    be   murdered.      Connolly   was   convicted,       and   his\n\nconviction was affirmed on appeal.           United States v.

The theory of the claim was that\n\nthe FBI's illicit protection of Bulger and Flemmi had facilitated\n\nthe murder of Roger Wheeler.3        This legal theory differed from that\n\narticulated     in    the    McIntyre    case,    as    there   was   no   direct\n\nrelationship between the FBI and Wheeler.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n          Specifically, the estate asserted legal theories of (a)\nconspiracy to protect Bulger and Flemmi from arrest and prosecution\nas a proximate cause of McIntyre's kidnaping, torture and execution\nin violation of McIntyre's First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment\nrights; (b) violation of those same Fourth and Fifth Amendment\nrights, stated as claims under Bivens v.

Factual and Procedural Background Relevant to McIntyre\n\n            In mid-October 1984, John McIntyre began cooperating with\n\nRichard Bergeron of the Quincy Police Department.                 Salemme, 91 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 213.       McIntyre told Bergeron that he was an engineer on\n\na ship named the Valhalla that had been used in an unsuccessful\n\nattempt to deliver guns and ammunition from Massachusetts to the\n\nIrish Republican Army (IRA) in Ireland.            He said that he worked for\n\nJoseph Murray, who secretly owned the Valhalla and was closely\n\nconnected to Bulger, and that Bulger was involved in the attempted\n\narms shipment through his associates Kevin Weeks and Patrick Nee.\n\nMcIntyre also mentioned Flemmi.          Id.    Bergeron told Agent Roderick\n\nKennedy, an FBI liaison officer, that McIntyre was cooperating and\n\nthat McIntyre had linked Bulger and his associates to the Valhalla.\n\nBergeron arranged for agents from the DEA and United States Customs\n\nService, along with Agent Kennedy, to participate in McIntyre's\n\ndebriefing.       Kennedy and a Customs agent interviewed McIntyre on\n\nOctober 17, 1984.         McIntyre told them that Bulger's associate\n\nPatrick Nee had traveled to Ireland to meet the Valhalla.                  Id. at\n\n214.     McIntyre also told them that Murray was partners in a\n\nseparate drug smuggling operation with \"an individual named Whitey\n\nwho    operates    a   liquor   store   in     South   Boston,\"    whom   Kennedy\n\nunderstood to be Bulger.        Id.     Around November 30, 1984, McIntyre\n\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f              Christopher McIntyre, John's brother, stated by affidavit\n\nthat he and Emily McIntyre, John's mother, filed multiple missing\n\npersons reports with the Quincy police.            Christopher said that the\n\ngovernment told him on one occasion that the \"mob\" had murdered\n\nJohn, but later told him that John was \"alive, a fugitive from\n\njustice and would be prosecuted if caught.\"            Emily also stated by\n\naffidavit that she had made \"repeated requests\" to the government\n\nfor information or help in finding her son but received none.\n\nInstead, she said, government agents told her that \"John was a\n\nfugitive.\"      In a 2000 Boston Herald interview, both Emily and\n\nChristopher said that they had suspected Bulger's hand in John's\n\ndisappearance in 1984 but said nothing out of fear.\n\n              On April 15, 1986, although McIntyre was still missing,\n\na grand jury indicted him along with Murray, Nee, and four others\n\nfor their roles in the Valhalla operation and drug smuggling.\n\nBulger and      Flemmi   were   not   named   as   defendants     or   otherwise\n\nmentioned in the indictment. The grand jury returned a superseding\n\nindictment on May 8, 1986, which again did not name Bulger or\n\nFlemmi   as    defendants.      The   court   then   issued   a   warrant    for\n\nMcIntyre's arrest.       On September 6, 1995, a note appeared in the\n\ndocket of the Valhalla prosecution: \"Case reopened as to John\n\nCrawley, John McIntyre, Michael Nigro.               NOTE: Case previously\n\nclosed in error. Defendants Crawley, McIntyre and Nigro remain\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffugitives.\"   The case remained open until March 20, 2000, when\n\nMcIntyre's death had been confirmed.\n\n          Meanwhile, on April 16, 1986, shortly after the first\n\nindictment, attorney John Loftus, acting on behalf of Emily, Chris,\n\nand Patricia McIntyre, John's sister, sent a letter to the Attorney\n\nGeneral, United States Customs Service, DEA, State Department, and\n\nUnited States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.       The FBI\n\nwas not one of the addressees on the letter.        The letter, whose\n\nsubject line was \"Re: Wrongful Death of John L. McIntyre,\" alleged\n\nthat John McIntyre was a government informant concerning IRA gun-\n\nrunning in Boston, that federal authorities leaked his informant\n\nstatus to the British government, and that the British government\n\ntold the IRA, resulting in McIntyre's abduction and murder.\n\n          On June 2, 1986, Emily McIntyre asked the Veterans\n\nAdministration (VA) to erect a headstone marker for her son at the\n\nMassachusetts National Cemetery.\n\n          On September 20, 1988, the Boston Globe ran a report\n\ndescribing Bulger as an FBI informant and raising the possibility\n\nthat Bulger \"has been able to exploit his cachet with the FBI\" to\n\nevade investigation and apprehension by the state police and the\n\nDEA. The article suggested that the FBI may have tipped Bulger off\n\nto recording devices in his home and car and to the timing of sting\n\noperations.   But it did not raise the possibility that the FBI\n\nleaked   information   to   Bulger   about   informants   in   his   own\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\forganization or shielded him from prosecution for crimes like\n\nmurder.    Nor did the article mention McIntyre.                The article\n\nreported that\n\n          State Police officials . . . asked the FBI to\n     conduct an internal inquiry. The FBI cleared two agents,\n     and the FBI leadership remains outraged at the suggestion\n     that any of its own would engage in that kind of\n     treachery.\n          James F. Ahearn, special agent in charge of the FBI\n     in Boston, was unequivocal when asked last month if\n     Bulger has had relations with the FBI that have left him\n     free of its scrutiny.\n          \"That is absolutely untrue,\" said Ahearn. \"We have\n     not had evidence that would warrant it and if we do\n     develop anything of an evidentiary nature, we will pursue\n     it. We specifically deny that there has been special\n     treatment of this individual.\" He declined to make any\n     further comment on the matter and instructed Connolly not\n     to speak on the subject.\n\n           In 1989, Emily McIntyre and Loftus published Valhalla's\n\nWake: The IRA, MI6, and the Assassination of a Young American\n\n(Atlantic Monthly Press).       In the book, they indicated awareness\n\nthat John had ties to the IRA and the \"Mob\" and that he faced\n\npossible   \"Mob[]    retribution\"     for   his   cooperation       with   the\n\ngovernment.     They stated that John's blue pickup truck had been\n\nspotted at Murray's place of business and that it was later found\n\nunder a bridge with his uncashed VA check inside.                   But they\n\nultimately theorized that British intelligence was responsible for\n\nJohn's murder.      Based on the McIntyre family's own investigation\n\ninto John's death, which involved interviews with \"an IRA courier\"\n\nand a \"source\" within British intelligence, the book speculated\n\nthat British     intelligence   had   its   own   mole   in   the   Valhalla,\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdiscovered from United States Customs agents that McIntyre was an\n\ninformant on a related drug-smuggling operation, falsely told the\n\nIRA that McIntyre was an informant on the Valhalla operation to\n\ndivert attention from the British mole, and then murdered McIntyre\n\nto prevent him from refuting the story.\n\n            In October 1991, Emily McIntyre applied to the VA for\n\ndeath benefits under her son's policy.\n\n            In the early to mid-1990s, the Boston Globe published a\n\nseries of articles on McIntyre's disappearance.                 One of those\n\narticles,   appearing    on   December    24,   1992,    stated       that   Sean\n\nO'Callaghan, a former IRA operative, had tipped off the Irish\n\npolice to the 1984 Valhalla shipment and that the IRA may have\n\nmistakenly suspected McIntyre of being the leak and murdered him.\n\nThe   story,    which   quoted   Emily    McIntyre,     said    that    \"[m]ost\n\nauthorities believe McIntyre was done in by his associates, . . .\n\nmost of whom were in the now-defunct Winter Hill Gang\" headed by\n\nBulger. The article noted that when Bulger heard that the Valhalla\n\nhad been seized, he said, in a conversation secretly recorded by\n\nDEA bugs in his apartment, \"That's our stuff,\" and that McIntyre\n\nwas last seen with Patrick Nee, a Bulger associate.             But the story\n\nmade no connection between the FBI and McIntyre's death.                In fact,\n\nin response to Emily McIntyre's theory that her son had been killed\n\nby    British   intelligence,    the     article   noted       that    \"federal\n\ninvestigators familiar with the Valhalla case say there is no\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fevidence that McIntyre was fingered by any agent of the US, Irish,\n\nor British governments\" (emphasis added).\n\n           On January 29, 1995, a second article in the Boston Globe\n\nreported   that   \"authorities   in   the   United   States\"   had   called\n\n\"ludicrous\" any claim that \"the US government negligently allowed\n\n[McIntyre] to be killed.\"        The story indicated that government\n\nofficials were not the only ones who might have known that McIntyre\n\nwas an informant, stating that \"[r]umors that [John] McIntyre was\n\ntalking [to the federal government] were rampant\" and citing Emily\n\nMcIntyre as saying that Customs agents had \"openly tailed [her\n\nson], and were parked outside her home the last night she saw her\n\nson.\"\n\n           Then, on December 11, 1996 and June 14, 1997, the Boston\n\nGlobe published two more articles reporting that law enforcement\n\nofficials believed McIntyre had been killed by the Winter Hill\n\nGang. The December 11 article, which quoted Emily McIntyre, stated\n\nthat \"[f]ederal agents believe McIntyre was killed by Boston\n\ngangsters who suspected him of informing against them.\"          The June\n\n14 article was more specific.            It theorized that Bulger had\n\ncompromised the Valhalla operation, after taking a hefty profit\n\nfrom it, by tipping off the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nRelying on witness statements and other evidence, the article\n\nsuggested that, afterwards, Bulger and Flemmi nonetheless tortured\n\nMcIntyre to find out what he had told authorities about the gun-\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\frunning and marijuana smuggling operations, and then killed him,\n\ndisposing of his body at sea.          Neither article made any mention of\n\nFBI involvement.\n\n            At around the time of the second article, in 1997, more\n\ndetails of the relationship between Bulger and Flemmi and their FBI\n\nhandlers came to light through the prosecution of Flemmi in the\n\ncase of United States v. Salemme, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510809\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510809/united-states-v-salemme/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In Salemme, on January 10, 1995, a grand jury indicted\n\nBulger and Flemmi, along with five others who were members of\n\neither La Cosa Nostra or the Winter Hill Gang, of RICO conspiracy\n\nand various other federal crimes.                Id. at 301.       Three more\n\nsuperseding indictments were obtained, with the last coming on July\n\n2, 1996.   Id. at 306.    None of the indictments mentioned McIntyre's\n\ndisappearance, although several referred to murders committed by\n\nBulger and Flemmi.\n\n            In    April   1997,   in    the    process   of   addressing   the\n\ndefendants'      motion   to   suppress       some   electronic   surveillance\n\nevidence, Judge Wolf, who was presiding over the Salemme case,\n\ndiscovered earlier filings in the case before a magistrate judge\n\nthat suggested that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI informants.              Id. at\n\n308.   This information raised questions about, inter alia, whether\n\nthe FBI had given Bulger and Flemmi immunity from prosecution for\n\ntheir ongoing criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f              In a June 6, 1997 order, over the FBI's objections, Judge\n\nWolf revealed that the FBI had, in response to a court order,\n\nconfirmed in a closed hearing that Bulger was an informant. United\n\nStates v. Salemme, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2135963\"><a href=\"/opinion/2135963/united-states-v-salemme/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. at 373.     In\n\na June 25, 1997 affidavit, Flemmi stated that Agent Morris had\n\nassured him that he and Bulger could be involved in any criminal\n\nactivities short of murder and would be protected by the FBI.\n\nSalemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 310.            Flemmi's affidavit was not sealed\n\nand an account of his statements was published the next day in the\n\nBoston Globe.      Several months later, on September 3, 1997, Flemmi\n\nsubmitted under seal a motion to dismiss, claiming, inter alia,\n\nthat the FBI had promised him immunity.              Id. at 311.       The motion\n\nwas unsealed, over government objections, on September 10.                    Id.\n\n              Several months later, on December 5, 1997, the Boston\n\nHerald made public that the Department of Justice had conducted its\n\nown   probe    into   Bulger    and   Flemmi's      relationship       with   their\n\nhandlers.      The article reported that Judge Wolf had said at a\n\nhearing     the   previous     day    that    the   Office      of   Professional\n\nResponsibility     had   launched     an     internal   probe    and    found   \"no\n\nevidence of continuing criminal conduct within the statute of\n\nlimitations\" by Agents Morris and Connolly.              Some details of this\n\ninvestigation were later revealed in Judge Wolf's opinion in\n\nSalemme, issued on September 15, 1999:\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f     In late June 1997, the Attorney General established a\n     task force of Department of Justice and FBI personnel to\n     investigate the allegations of misconduct raised by\n     Flemmi and the motions to suppress.      That task force\n     conducted its investigation in July and early August\n     1997, and issued a confidential report to the Attorney\n     General. With the agreement of the government, the court\n     reviewed the Executive Summary of that report and some of\n     the documents that the investigation generated in order\n     to decide certain issues concerning discovery . . . .\n\n91 F. Supp. 2d at 310.       Nothing in the record indicates that the\n\nunderlying facts of the Office of Professional Responsibility\n\ninvestigation were otherwise made public at the time. But from our\n\nreview of the docket in the Salemme case, it is clear that the\n\ngovernment repeatedly sought, at around this time, to keep Flemmi's\n\nallegations of government misconduct and the government's response\n\nto them under seal.\n\n            Judge Wolf held a series of evidentiary hearings from\n\nJanuary to October 1998 on the subject of Flemmi's claim of\n\nimmunity.    Id. at 312.     These hearings were open to the public.\n\nEmily McIntyre attended part of a hearing on April 15, 1998.                  In an\n\narticle the next day, the Boston Herald reported that at that\n\nhearing, Robert      Stutman,    the    former   local   chief    of    the   DEA,\n\ntestified   that   \"agents      in   his   office   'swore'      that   the    FBI\n\ncompromised their Flemmi-Bulger probe to the point where the pair's\n\nbureau   'handler'    was   unwelcome      at    DEA's   offices.\"       Stutman\n\nadmitted, however, that he had no proof of FBI wrongdoing and that\n\nhe \"d[id]n't know now\" if \"the FBI [had] burn[ed] us on [the]\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\finvestigation.\"       Nothing in the record indicates that Stutman ever\n\nmentioned McIntyre in his testimony.\n\n           One week later, on April 22, Morris testified, under a\n\ngrant of immunity, that he had told Connolly in early 1982 that\n\nanother FBI informant, Brian Halloran, had said that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi asked him to murder Roger Wheeler.               Id. at 209.       Morris\n\ntestified that Connolly told him that he had passed the information\n\non to Bulger and Flemmi.        Halloran was murdered shortly thereafter\n\non May 11, 1982.         The Boston Herald ran a story on April 23\n\nsummarizing Morris's testimony. As with Stutman, nothing indicates\n\nthat Morris ever mentioned McIntyre in his testimony.\n\n           On May 20, 1998, another DEA agent, Albert G. Reilly,\n\ntestified about the Valhalla. The Boston Globe summarized Reilly's\n\ntestimony the next day with the headline \"DEA unable to link Bulger\n\nto IRA guns.\"    The story recounted that \"authorities now believed\n\nthat   Bulger   had    tipped   off   authorities     to   the    gun-smuggling\n\noperation and that he and Flemmi tortured a Quincy man, John\n\nMcIntyre, who was suspected of cooperating with the authorities\"\n\n(emphasis added).      The story did not say, however, that the FBI had\n\ntipped off Bulger as to McIntyre's identity as an informant.                  The\n\narticle also    stated     that   Reilly     had   testified     that   he,   like\n\nStutman, believed the DEA's investigation of Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nbeen compromised by the FBI but had no way to prove it.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f           In early June 1998, after the May 25, 1998 critical date\n\nfor accrual of the McIntyre claims had passed, Richard Bergeron of\n\nthe Quincy Police Department testified about McIntyre's cooperation\n\nand   disappearance.     Id. at 213.       As best we can tell, Bergeron's\n\ntestimony was the first piece of evidence presented in the Salemme\n\nproceedings   that     provided   direct    information     about   McIntyre's\n\ndisappearance. Bergeron testified that McIntyre was \"petrified\" of\n\nthe people he was implicating and that McIntyre was not the type of\n\npotential witness whose cooperation could be publicly disclosed.\n\nBergeron then said that he told FBI Agent Kennedy that McIntyre had\n\nimplicated Bulger and his associates in the Valhalla operation. He\n\ntestified that he had arranged for Kennedy and a Customs agent to\n\ninterview McIntyre. Id. at 214. Kennedy had testified earlier, on\n\nApril 14, 1998, that he and Connolly often exchanged information.\n\nOther evidence also indicated that Kennedy had participated in\n\nprotecting    Bulger    and    Flemmi    from    investigation    on   previous\n\noccasions.     Id.      But,   because     the   government,     apparently   in\n\nviolation of discovery orders, did not produce Kennedy's reports of\n\nhis interview of McIntyre until after Kennedy had testified,\n\nKennedy was never questioned about whether he had passed on the\n\ninformation about McIntyre to Connolly and, if so, whether Connolly\n\nhad told Bulger and Flemmi.             Kennedy was not recalled to the\n\nwitness stand to provide this information.            Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f             During   Bergeron's    cross-examination,   the   prosecution\n\nasked him what individuals, to his knowledge, knew that McIntyre\n\nwas cooperating with authorities and might have passed on that\n\ninformation. When defense counsel objected, the prosecution stated\n\nthat its line of questioning was in response to the implication\n\nthat \"it was the FBI who may have leaked this [information to\n\nBulger and Flemmi] when there's literally a dozen people\" other\n\nthan the FBI who could have done so (emphasis added).                   The\n\nprosecution was explicit that the evidence was so speculative that\n\nthe court \"shouldn't infer that there was some leak from the FBI\n\nthat led to Mr. McIntyre's disappearance\" (emphasis added).             The\n\nprosecution then went on to establish that, in addition to the FBI,\n\nthe Quincy police, the Customs Service, and the DEA all knew of\n\nMcIntyre's cooperation.        The prosecution also established that\n\nMcIntyre had spoken to authorities about a number of \"notorious\n\ncriminals,\" as well as the IRA, \"[a]ll of whom would have had a\n\nmotive to make him disappear.\"\n\n             Judge    Wolf   published    a   260-page   opinion   in   the\n\nSalemme case on September 15, 1999, well after the cut-off date for\n\naccrual of McIntyre's claims.        As to McIntyre's disappearance, he\n\nconcluded,\n\n     [T]here is circumstantial evidence to suggest that\n     Kennedy may have told Connolly about McIntyre's\n     cooperation and claims and, in view [of] the Halloran\n     matter, reason to be concerned that Connolly may have\n     told Bulger and Flemmi. These issues cannot, however, be\n     resolved on the present record.\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fId. at 214-15.\n\n            McIntyre's body was recovered on January 14, 2000. Kevin\n\nWeeks, a Bulger associate, led law enforcement to McIntyre's\n\nmakeshift grave.      Flemmi, 195 F. Supp. 2d at 251 n.45.\n\n            On May 25, 2000, McIntyre's estate filed a notice of tort\n\nclaim with the FBI.\n\n            On    September      27,     2000,    a   grand    jury    returned    a\n\nsuperseding indictment of Bulger and Flemmi that alleged that in\n\nOctober    or    November   of   1984,     Bulger     and   Flemmi    learned   that\n\nMcIntyre was cooperating with the FBI and Customs Service regarding\n\nBulger's    involvement     in    both    the     Valhalla    operation   and     the\n\nimportation of marijuana by boat into Boston, and, as a result,\n\nkidnapped and murdered McIntyre.                The indictment did not say how\n\nBulger and Flemmi discovered McIntyre's cooperation.                    On October\n\n11, 2000, Connolly was indicted for his role in various murders\n\ncommitted by Bulger and Flemmi, but not for any role in McIntyre's\n\nmurder.\n\n            On March 8, 2001, McIntyre's estate filed suit in federal\n\ndistrict court.       McIntyre's claim was the first administrative\n\nclaim and first federal action to be filed arising from the FBI's\n\nrelationship with Bulger and Flemmi.                  On October 15, 2001, the\n\nUnited States moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)\n\non the ground that McIntyre's estate had failed to present its\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fadministrative claims within two years of accrual, as required by\n\nthe FTCA, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).\n\n          On March 31, 2002, the district court granted the motion,\n\nfinding that the claims had accrued before April 1998.     The court\n\nreasoned that, prior to April 1998, the McIntyres clearly believed\n\nJohn McIntyre to be dead and had sufficient facts to support a\n\nreasonable inference that Bulger and Flemmi had killed him, based\n\non local press reports that McIntyre was last seen with Nee, a\n\nBulger associate, and that Bulger ran the Valhalla operation.    The\n\ncourt also determined that the McIntyres had enough information to\n\nform the theory that \"the FBI was at least negligent in [its]\n\nhandling of Bulger and Flemmi.\"     The court relied principally on\n\n(1) the FBI's acknowledgment in 1997 that Bulger and Flemmi were\n\ninformants and (2) the April 15, 1998 hearing, attended in part by\n\nEmily McIntyre, in which DEA Agent Stutman testified about his\n\nsuspicions that the FBI had compromised a DEA investigation of\n\nBulger and Flemmi.     Final judgment was entered on motion of\n\nMcIntyre's estate.   The estate timely appealed.\n\nB.   Factual and Procedural Background Relevant to Wheeler\n\n          Roger Wheeler, a Tulsa businessman, owned World Jai Alai\n\n(WJA), which operated facilities where spectators could bet on Jai\n\nAlai matches.   Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 208.    John Callahan, who\n\nhad ties to the Winter Hill Gang, was president of WJA.          Id.\n\nWheeler suspected that Callahan was skimming money from WJA for\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fmembers of the Winter Hill Gang, including Bulger and Flemmi.\n\nWheeler fired Callahan and began an audit of WJA's financial\n\noperations.    Id. at 209.    Before the audit was completed, on May\n\n27, 1981, Wheeler was shot to death while sitting in his car in the\n\nparking lot of a Tulsa country club.       Id. at 207-08.\n\n            The Wheeler murder remained unsolved for many years.      In\n\nthe spring of 1995, David and Lawrence Wheeler, two sons of Roger\n\nWheeler, visited the FBI's office in Tulsa to deliver some of their\n\nfather's records requested by the office.       They stated that they\n\nwere unhappy with the lack of progress in the investigation.\n\nAccording to David Wheeler's affidavit, FBI Agent Jack Hawkins\n\nreplied, \"[I]f we do that, we will have to go wherever the evidence\n\nmight lead us . . . and you know, it might actually take us to some\n\ninvolvement on the part of your mother.        Are you willing to see\n\nyour mother go to jail?\"        David Wheeler interpreted this as a\n\nthreat intended to deter future complaints about the FBI's lack of\n\nprogress.\n\n            The Tulsa World and the Daily Oklahoman published at\n\nleast twelve articles on Wheeler's murder between 1995 and 1999.\n\nAt   the   time,   Patricia   (Wheeler's   widow),   Pamela   (Wheeler's\n\ndaughter), and Lawrence (one of Wheeler's sons) were living in\n\nTulsa.     David, along with another of Wheeler's sons, Mark, was\n\nliving in Texas.    Patricia and David stated by affidavit that they\n\nrecalled reading some of the Oklahoma press coverage. Lawrence and\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fMark recalled reading one or two articles, and Pamela said she did\n\nnot read any of them.\n\n          On January 19, 1995, the Tulsa World published a story\n\nstating that Brian Halloran had told the FBI that John Callahan\n\noffered him a contract to kill Wheeler, but that Halloran refused\n\nthe offer.   The article noted that Halloran was murdered shortly\n\nthereafter in 1982.     On July 11, 1997, as proceedings in the\n\nSalemme trial were developing, the Tulsa World reported that Bulger\n\nand Flemmi were \"potential suspects\" in Wheeler's murder and that\n\nFlemmi had executed an affidavit stating that he and Bulger were\n\ninformants and \"were given free reign from an FBI supervisor to\n\ncommit any crime as long as they did not 'clip anyone.'\"        On\n\nNovember 9, 1997, a Tulsa television station reported that the\n\nWheeler investigation \"ha[d] been held up by the FBI's attempts to\n\nbring down the Mafia in Boston\" and that \"the FBI did not share\n\ninformation it had about the death of Roger Wheeler Senior.\"   The\n\nnext day, the Tulsa World reported that \"[i]nvestigators said that\n\nthe prime suspects in Wheeler's killing turned out to be two highly\n\nplaced mob informants, working with the Boston FBI\" and that the\n\n\"Boston FBI protected their informants, James 'Whitey' Bulger and\n\nSteven [sic] 'The Rifleman' Flemmi.\"\n\n          On May 10, 1998, David Wheeler was interviewed by Ed\n\nBradley on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" program.   The following exchange was\n\ntelevised:\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f     Bradley: David Wheeler, Roger Wheeler's son, says he had\n     trouble understanding why his father's murder had\n     remained unsolved for so long. Until he found out Bulger\n     and Flemmi were FBI informants.\n\n     Wheeler: We've discovered that all along the FBI has been\n     in bed with the prime suspects in my father's murder.\n\n     Bradley: So you believe that the FBI protected your\n     father's killers and tried to prevent the truth from\n     coming out?\n\n     Wheeler: They not only protected my father's killers,\n     they to this day are protecting my father's killers and\n     they are to this day withholding information from the\n     police. This is eighteen years of covering up the crime.\n     This is eighteen years of being an accessory to murder.\n\nAt the close of the segment, David Wheeler also said, \"In the end,\n\nthere's one group, one group of people, that were supposed to help\n\nus, and that was the FBI, and those are the very people that\n\nbetrayed us, those are the very people that continue to betray us\n\nto this day.\"\n\n          During the segment, Bradley said that the \"extraordinary\n\nrelationship between the FBI and two organized crime bosses,\"\n\nnamely Bulger and Flemmi, \"may have allowed the FBI informants to\n\nget away with murder.\"    The segment also contained an interview of\n\nHomicide Sergeant Michael Huff of the Tulsa police department, who\n\nsaid that the Boston FBI had failed to share Halloran's information\n\nwith local and federal investigators in Tulsa working on the\n\nWheeler   investigation    and   that   this   failure   constituted\n\n\"obstruction of justice.\" Bradley also interviewed five detectives\n\nfrom Oklahoma, Florida, and Connecticut.       He stated that these\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fdetectives believed the Wheeler murder remained unsolved \"because\n\nBulger and Flemmi were protected by the FBI while they were\n\nproviding information on the Italian Mafia in New England.\"    One\n\ndetective, David Green, said that the FBI gave Bulger and Flemmi a\n\n\"license to steal\" and that \"apparently that license got a little\n\nbroader and covered a homicide.\"\n\n            David Wheeler said, by affidavit, that when he accused\n\nthe FBI of a cover-up on \"60 Minutes,\" he meant only that he had\n\npreviously been unaware of Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants\n\nand that he \"felt as though the FBI should have shared this\n\ninformation with [him] . . . long before this time.\"   He said that\n\nhe did not believe at that time that the FBI was responsible in any\n\nway for his father's death and that he had no facts to support such\n\na belief.\n\n            Patricia and Lawrence said by affidavit that they saw\n\nDavid on \"60 Minutes.\"    Pamela and Mark said, also by affidavit,\n\nthey did not see David on \"60 Minutes\" and did not discuss the show\n\nwith David or anyone else.   Mark said that he was aware that David\n\nappeared on the show, but Pamela said that she could not remember\n\nif she had been aware of that fact at the time.   The Wheelers said\n\nin their respective affidavits that tensions had arisen in the\n\nfamily since Roger's murder and that they communicated very little\n\namong themselves, particularly concerning the painful subject of\n\nthe murder.\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f           Following the \"60 Minutes\" interview, David Wheeler also\n\ngave interviews to the Boston press.         On May 12, 1998, The Boston\n\nHerald reported   that   David     Wheeler   said    that   he    \"has   always\n\nbelieved that [former FBI Agent Paul] Rico facilitated his father's\n\ndelivery into oblivion\" but that he only recently \"discovered that\n\noblivion may well have had names like Whitey and Stevey.\"                   The\n\narticle noted that David Wheeler said his father thought Rico might\n\nbe trying to kill him.   The article described Rico as Flemmi's \"FBI\n\nmentor\" and noted that Rico had recruited Flemmi as an informant.\n\nOn July 22, 1998, the Boston Globe interviewed David Wheeler and\n\ndescribed him as \"now believ[ing] the FBI has obstructed the\n\ninvestigation   into   his     father's   murder.\"        The    article   also\n\nsummarized the testimony of John Morris at the Salemme hearings in\n\nApril 1998, noting that Morris had testified that he told Connolly\n\nthat Halloran had implicated Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler\n\nmurder   investigation   and    that   Connolly     may   have    passed   this\n\ninformation on to Bulger and Flemmi.         On September 29, 1998, the\n\nBoston Globe reported John Martorano, a member of the Winter Hill\n\ngang, was negotiating a plea agreement with federal prosecutors.\n\nDescribing David Wheeler as \"the son of one of Martorano's alleged\n\nvictims,\" the article quoted him as stating that he would approve\n\nof a plea agreement for Martorano because \"[t]he people he's giving\n\nup are the people who have enjoyed the protection of the FBI for\n\nmany years while committing heinous crimes.\"\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f           By affidavit, David Wheeler said that he had \"probably\"\n\nread these articles, but Patricia, Pamela, and Lawrence said that\n\nthey had not, and Mark said that he did not recall whether he read\n\nthem.\n\n           At around the same time, in the summer of 1998, there was\n\nTulsa press coverage of developments in the Wheeler murder. On May\n\n17, 1998, the Tulsa World published an article with the headline:\n\n\"When G-men, Mobsters Are Friends/FBI Ignored Tip-Off on Tulsa\n\nMurder.\"   The article summarized Morris's testimony in April 1998,\n\nreporting that Morris had admitted to receiving cash and gifts from\n\nBulger and Flemmi, and to working with other agents to \"shield[]\n\nBulger and Flemmi from prosecution for 20 years because they were\n\nthe most prized secret FBI informants in New England history.\"    A\n\nsummary of Morris's testimony was again reported in a July 20, 1998\n\nTulsa World article about the Wheeler murder.      The article also\n\nreported that John Martorano had agreed to cooperate with federal\n\nprosecutors and to testify against Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler\n\nmurder case.\n\n           On September 9, 1999, after the Wheelers' May 11, 1999\n\ncut-off date for accrual had passed, Judge Wolf unsealed John\n\nMartorano's plea agreement, in which Martorano admitted that he had\n\nmurdered Roger Wheeler.   Judge Wolf's September 15, 1999 decision\n\nin Salemme described a series of specific incidents in the early\n\n1980s, before Wheeler's murder, in which FBI agents shielded Bulger\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\fand Flemmi from investigation.        91 F. Supp. 2d at 202-06.     As to\n\nWheeler's    murder,   Judge   Wolf   found   that   partly   because   of\n\nirregularities in the FBI's handling of the files relating to\n\nWheeler's murder, \"questions remain regarding the role, if any,\n\nplayed by Flemmi and Bulger in the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan\n\nmurders, and the full degree to which the FBI in Boston has, from\n\n1981 until recently, attempted to keep any such role from being\n\ndiscerned and demonstrated.\"     Id. at 213.    He noted that a pattern\n\nof false statements in Flemmi's informant file diverted attention\n\nfrom Flemmi's crimes and FBI misconduct, that reports containing\n\nHalloran's allegations against Bulger and Flemmi were not indexed\n\naccording to usual FBI policy and hence could not be discovered\n\nthrough a standard search of FBI indices, and that the FBI had\n\ndisobeyed discovery orders by its late disclosure of relevant\n\ndocuments.   Id. at 154 n.3.\n\n            On December 22, 1999, John Connolly was indicted for\n\nracketeering. A superseding indictment was returned on October 11,\n\n2000.   It charged that Connolly had alerted Bulger and Flemmi to\n\nthe identity of confidential law enforcement informants, tipped\n\nthem off to various law enforcement initiatives, and failed to\n\nreport information relating to them that was material to the\n\ninvestigation of criminal activity in the Boston area.            It also\n\ncharged that Connolly had obstructed a grand jury investigation\n\n\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\finto Wheeler's murder and tipped Bulger and Flemmi to Halloran's\n\ncooperation.\n\n           On September 27, 2000, a federal grand jury returned an\n\nindictment charging Bulger and Flemmi with racketeering; two of the\n\npredicate acts for the racketeering charge were the murder of Roger\n\nWheeler and the conspiracy to commit that murder.\n\n           The Wheelers filed a notice of tort claim with the FBI on\n\nMay 11, 2001.   After the FBI failed to respond, the Wheelers filed\n\nsuit in federal court on March 14, 2002.         As in the McIntyre case,\n\nthe United States moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(1) on the ground that the Wheelers had failed to present\n\ntheir   administrative   claims   within   two    years   of   accrual,   as\n\nrequired by the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).         On March 31, 2003, the\n\ndistrict court granted the motion, finding that the Wheelers' claim\n\naccrued no later than May 10, 1998, when David Wheeler appeared on\n\n\"60 Minutes.\"   The court reasoned that David Wheeler's statements\n\nshowed that he knew that Bulger and Flemmi were suspected in his\n\nfather's murder and that they may have escaped investigation and\n\nprosecution for the crime with the assistance of the FBI.                 The\n\ncourt then went on to say that \"[i]t does not matter that not all\n\nthe plaintiffs in this case were as informed as David Wheeler\"\n\nbecause they were in possession of sufficient facts to place them\n\non inquiry notice.    Final judgment was entered on motion of the\n\nWheelers, who then timely appealed.\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f                                 II.\n\nA.   The FTCA Accrual Standard\n\n          The FTCA provides, in relevant part, that \"[a] tort claim\n\nagainst the United States shall be forever barred unless it is\n\npresented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two\n\nyears after such claim accrues.\"   28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b).   Because the\n\nFTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity, it is strictly construed.\n\nSkwira v.

In United States v.

The Court held that\n\nsuch claims accrue when a plaintiff knows of both the existence and\n\nthe cause of his injury.       See id. at 119-202.         The Court\n\ndetermined that accrual does not await the point at which a\n\nplaintiff also knows that the acts inflicting the injury may\n\nconstitute medical malpractice.         Id. at 122.   Distinguishing\n\nbetween ignorance of the facts (of injury or its cause) and\n\nignorance of legal rights, the Court reasoned that a claimant, once\n\narmed with knowledge of the fact of injury and the identity of the\n\nparties that caused the injury, is no longer at the mercy of the\n\ngovernment.    At that point, claimants can go to others, such as\n\ndoctors or lawyers, who will tell them if they are victims of\n\nmalpractice.   Id.   The same is not necessarily true of plaintiffs\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fwho are ignorant of the facts, particularly when the government may\n\nbe in possession or control of the necessary information.\n\n             This court has extended this discovery rule to FTCA\n\nclaims outside the medical malpractice context.

Most circuits also apply a discovery rule to wrongful death\n\nactions.     See Skwira, 344 F.3d at 74 (collecting cases).\n\n             Under the discovery rule, \"a claim accrues when the\n\nplaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence\n\nshould have discovered, the factual basis for the cause of action.\"\n\nGonzalez, 284 F.3d at 288. The test for whether a plaintiff should\n\nhave discovered necessary facts is an objective one.                   Id. at 288-\n\n89.    We look first to whether sufficient facts were available to\n\nprovoke a reasonable person in the plaintiff's circumstances to\n\ninquire or investigate further.              \"A claim does not accrue when a\n\nperson has a mere hunch, hint, suspicion, or rumor of a claim, but\n\nsuch suspicions do give rise to a duty to inquire into the possible\n\nexistence     of     a    claim   in   the    exercise      of   due   diligence.\"\n\nKronisch v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756423\"><a href=\"/opinion/756423/gloria-kronisch-of-the-estate-of-stanley-milton-glickman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (2d Cir. 1998)\n\n(citation omitted and emphasis added).             Once a duty to inquire is\n\nestablished, the plaintiff is charged with the knowledge of what he\n\nor    she   would    have    uncovered       through    a   reasonably     diligent\n\ninvestigation.           Skwira, 344 F.3d at 77.            The next question is\n\nwhether     the     plaintiff,    if   armed     with    the     results   of   that\n\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\finvestigation, would know enough to permit a reasonable person to\n\nbelieve that she had been injured and that there is a causal\n\nconnection between the government and her injury.             Id. at 78.\n\nDefinitive knowledge is not necessary. Id. This inquiry is highly\n\nfact- and case-specific, as are the pertinent questions to ask.\n\n           In Attallah, for example, the plaintiffs learned in\n\nSeptember 1982 that the decomposed body of their courier, who had\n\nbeen transporting almost $700,000 of their money to Puerto Rico,\n\nhad been found.       955 F.2d at 778.      Over four years later, two\n\nCustoms agents were indicted for the robbery and murder of the\n\ncourier.     Id.    The court found that the plaintiffs had filed a\n\ntimely administrative claim against the United States because their\n\nclaim accrued when the Customs agents were indicted, not when the\n\ncourier's body was found.     Id. at 780.     The court focused on the\n\nfact that aside from the indictment, the only information that the\n\nplaintiffs had available about the whereabouts of their courier was\n\na Customs Service document showing that their courier had been\n\nprocessed at the airport customs office and then left the premises.\n\nId.   The court reasoned that if it took the police until 1987 to\n\ndiscover   sufficient    information   to   bring   charges   against   the\n\nCustoms agents, the plaintiffs could not be expected to be more\n\nefficient.    Id.\n\n           Another example is the Skwira case, in which a divided\n\ncourt, in three opinions, found that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\ffile a timely administrative claim.           Skwira, 344 F.3d at 83-86.\n\nThere, the claim was that a VA nurse had murdered Edward Skwira, a\n\npatient at the Northampton VA hospital, by injecting him with the\n\nstimulant epinephrine. The facts convincing to the majority on the\n\nissue of accrual were as follows.             Skwira was admitted to a\n\nsubstance abuse treatment facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, in\n\nearly February 1996 for the treatment of chronic alcoholism and on\n\nFebruary 15 was transferred to Ward C of the VA hospital, where the\n\nmurderess was working.         Id. at 69.     Despite the absence of any\n\nreason to anticipate heart problems, he suffered a catastrophic\n\ncardiac event later that day and died on February 18, with heart\n\nailments listed as the immediate cause of death.                Id.    By the\n\nsummer of 1996, articles began appearing in the Northampton local\n\npress describing an ongoing criminal investigation into the high\n\nnumber of suspicious deaths in Ward C, and the administrator was\n\nquoted as not ruling out foul play.          Id. at 68, 80.     By September\n\nor October of 1996, investigators contacted the families of some of\n\nthe   victims,   including     Skwira's,    to   voice   the    government's\n\n\"suspicions\" about the deaths and obtained permission to exhume and\n\nautopsy the bodies.     Id. at 68.     Skwira's autopsy showed that the\n\ndeath certificate had misstated the cause of death.              Id.   As the\n\nconcurring opinion stated, at that point \"a reasonable person would\n\nhave believed    that   some    kind   of   negligence   or    misconduct   by\n\ngovernment employees at the hospital might well underlie Edward\n\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fSkwira's death.\"    Id. at 85 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).               Had the\n\nplaintiffs sought out independent legal and medical advice at that\n\npoint, they should have been able to determine in the two-year\n\nperiod whether to file an administrative claim.              See Skwira, 344\n\nF.3d at 81.     The court observed that two other victims' families\n\ndid file timely claims, whereas the Skwiras waited three years\n\nafter the autopsy report before filing.             Id. at 82 n.19.\n\n           Skwira is instructive in the ways in which it is both\n\nlike and unlike the two cases at bar.          The differences are obvious.\n\nUnlike the victims in the cases at bar, Skwira was in the sole\n\ncustody and care of a government hospital and, overwhelmingly, the\n\nmost   likely   malefactor   was   one    of    a   very   limited    group   of\n\ngovernment employees at that hospital.          All of the deaths occurred\n\nin the same place with the same small cast of characters.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Gilbert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770705\"><a href=\"/opinion/770705/united-states-v-kristen-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir. 2000) (the\n\ndeaths in Ward C of the VA hospital occurred over a six-month\n\nperiod).   There was also certainty the patients were dead, unlike\n\nin McIntyre's situation.\n\n           The chief similarity between the two cases at bar and\n\nSkwira is that there was a government investigation into possible\n\nwrongdoing in all three cases.            But the circumstances of the\n\ninvestigation here were different than in Skwira.                    There, the\n\ngovernment came to the family with its suspicions of wrongdoing at\n\nthe hospital and explained the factual basis for those suspicions.\n\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\f344 F.3d at 68.   The government then helped develop the evidence of\n\nwrongdoing, informing the family that the cause of death reported\n\nwas different than that found in Skwira's autopsy.         Id.   By\n\ncontrast, in the two cases at bar, the government did not inform\n\nthe plaintiffs of any investigation, appears to have held the facts\n\nrevealed in its investigation confidential, and ultimately claimed\n\nto have cleared its agents of wrongdoing before the critical dates\n\nfor accrual purposes.5\n\nB.   Application to McIntyre's Claims\n\n          The claims made by the estate of McIntyre are based on\n\ntwo interrelated theories of how the FBI caused McIntyre's death:\n\n(1) by leaking his confidential informant status to Bulger and\n\nFlemmi, in violation of a special duty of non-disclosure owed to\n\nhim by the government, and (2) by protecting Bulger and Flemmi from\n\ninvestigation and prosecution, thus enabling and emboldening them\n\nto murder him.    As we understand the second theory, it is meant to\n\nbuttress the first theory; it is perhaps also meant to serve as an\n\nindependent basis for liability.6       The first theory, which we\n\nunderstand to be the predominant one, arises out of a special duty\n\n\n     5\n          The plaintiffs here do not argue that the pendency of a\ngovernment investigation should automatically toll accrual of their\nclaims.   That argument was rejected in Skwira, which found no\nstatutory basis for such tolling. See 344 F.3d at 85-86 (Boudin,\nC.J., concurring).\n     6\n          To the extent that the plaintiff does intend the second\ntheory as an independent basis for liability, the United States is\nfree to challenge the availability of that theory on remand.\n\n                                -35-\n\fthat the government has to confidential informants who would be\n\nendangered if their informant status were revealed to others,\n\nparticularly     those     whose   activities     are    the    subject   of    the\n\ninformant's     disclosures.

Because we find\n\nthat the    plaintiff      could   not   reasonably      be    expected   to   have\n\ndiscovered the facts supporting the first theory until after May\n\n25, 1998, we find that the case was not properly dismissed and\n\ntherefore reverse.\n\n           The    plaintiff's      predominant     theory       depends   on    the\n\nfollowing reasoning:\n\n           1.        McIntyre was cooperating with the government in\n\n                     its investigation of Bulger and Flemmi, which\n\n                     imposed a duty on the FBI;\n\n\n\n                                     -36-\n\f            2.     McIntyre was murdered;\n\n            3.     Bulger    and   Flemmi   were   responsible   for   the\n\n                   murder;\n\n            4.     McIntyre was murdered because Bulger and Flemmi\n\n                   learned he was informing on them to government\n\n                   authorities;\n\n            5.     It was agents of the FBI, Connolly and/or Morris,\n\n                   who told Bulger and Flemmi that McIntyre was\n\n                   cooperating with the FBI.\n\nThe district court focused on the first three parts of this\n\nsequence only.   This did not go far enough.       The key missing links\n\nare the fourth and fifth points.      We focus on the fifth: whether a\n\nreasonable person in the McIntyres' position, after conducting a\n\ndiligent investigation, would have uncovered a sufficient factual\n\nbasis to believe, before May 25, 1998, that the FBI was the source\n\nof the leak to Bulger and Flemmi.     We conclude that he or she would\n\nnot have.\n\n            Certainly before May of 1998, the McIntyre family knew of\n\nfacts that would permit a reasonable person to believe that Bulger\n\nand Flemmi were responsible for the killing of John McIntyre in\n\n1984 and that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI informants.        In our view,\n\nthat was not enough to trigger accrual, in light of the nature of\n\nMcIntyre's claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\f            A June 1997 Boston Globe article, described in our review\n\nof the facts, reported that witness statements and other evidence\n\nsupported the conclusion that Bulger and Flemmi had McIntyre\n\nkidnapped,    tortured   him   to   find   out   what    he   had    told   the\n\nauthorities, and then murdered him.          Implicit in this report was\n\nthat Bulger and Flemmi had somehow found out McIntyre was an\n\ninformant.     But the article never even mentioned the possibility\n\nthat the FBI had disclosed this information to Bulger and Flemmi or\n\nhad otherwise given its imprimatur to the murder.\n\n            Furthermore, the McIntyres were also faced with the\n\ngovernment's    affirmative    denials     of    any    wrongdoing    in    the\n\nrelationship between Bulger and Flemmi and FBI agents Morris and\n\nConnolly.     The government repeatedly denied wrongdoing in Boston\n\nGlobe articles from 1988 through 1995, and one article reported\n\nthat an internal FBI investigation had cleared the two agents.\n\nThen, a December 5, 1997 Boston Herald article stated that the\n\nDepartment of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility had\n\ninvestigated and \"cleared the FBI handlers [Morris and Connolly] of\n\n[wrongdoing    involving]   informant      gangsters    Whitey   Bulger     and\n\nStephen Flemmi.\"      Faced with a denial of wrongdoing by the FBI\n\nitself, and lacking any basis to controvert the denial other than\n\nrumor, the McIntyres did not have a reasoned basis to believe that\n\nit was the FBI that had leaked McIntyre's identity as an informant\n\nto Bulger and Flemmi.\n\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\f          We   turn   to   the   question   whether   there   was   later\n\ninformation between the December 5, 1997 denial of wrongdoing by\n\nthe FBI and May 25, 1998 that provided notice of that missing link.\n\nThe district court found such an event based on testimony by Agent\n\nStutman, the former local chief of the DEA, in the Salemme hearings\n\non April 15, 1998.    Because Emily McIntyre attended part of those\n\nhearings, the court attributed to her knowledge of Stutman's\n\nstatements that he and agents in his office suspected that the FBI\n\nhad compromised their investigation of Bulger and Flemmi but had no\n\nfacts to confirm their suspicions.       Even assuming that statement\n\nprovided a reasoned basis to believe that the FBI had compromised\n\nthe DEA's investigation, perhaps by tipping Bulger and Flemmi to\n\nlistening devices or warning them of raids, it does not provide a\n\nreasoned basis to believe that the FBI leaked McIntyre's informant\n\nstatus to Bulger and Flemmi.\n\n          The government points to a different event: an April 23,\n\n1998 Boston Herald story reporting that the previous day, Morris\n\nhad testified that in 1982, he told Connolly, who in turn told\n\nBulger and Flemmi, the identity of FBI informant Brian Halloran,\n\nwho had informed authorities that Bulger and Flemmi tried to hire\n\nhim to kill Roger Wheeler.         The government argues that this\n\ninformation -- that the FBI had leaked to Bulger and Flemmi the\n\nidentity of a different informant, as to a different crime, at a\n\ndifferent time -- provided sufficient facts for a reasonable person\n\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\fto believe that the same thing had happened to McIntyre.                          The\n\ngovernment argues that if there was evidence Bulger and Flemmi\n\nkilled   Halloran      because     the    FBI   told    them   Halloran     was    an\n\ninformant, then a reasonable person could have inferred that Bulger\n\nand Flemmi also killed John McIntyre based on a similar FBI leak.\n\nThe government's analogy overreaches both as a matter of logic and\n\nas a matter of fact.\n\n            Even assuming arguendo that the Boston Herald article was\n\nenough to lead the McIntyres to suspect that the FBI leaked\n\nMcIntyre's identity, and thus to trigger a duty to inquire, a\n\nreasonably diligent investigation would still not have revealed the\n\nnecessary factual predicate for their claim before the accrual\n\ndate.    Most     avenues    of    investigation        were    cut   off   by    the\n\npossibility of criminal liability for any FBI agents and others\n\ninvolved.    Attempts to gain information through depositions would\n\nlikely have been thwarted by invocations of the Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination.                And other information --\n\nsuch as testimony before the grand jury or facts discovered in the\n\ngovernment investigation -- was hidden behind a veil of secrecy.\n\nIn this sense, the McIntyres had even less access to critical\n\ninformation than most FTCA plaintiffs.                 See Kubrick, 444 U.S. at\n\n122 (adopting a discovery rule in part because \"the facts about\n\ncausation   may   be    in   the    control     of     the   putative   defendant,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\funavailable    to   the      plaintiff    or     at    least    very    difficult        to\n\nobtain\").\n\n            Without more specific information than provided in the\n\nBoston Herald article, a reasonable person could not have had a\n\nbasis to claim that the FBI betrayed McIntyre's cooperation to\n\nBulger and Flemmi.         Bulger and Flemmi apparently murdered people\n\nfor many reasons.         Some of those people were informants.                      But,\n\nwithout   more,     one    cannot     reasonably       deduce    from        a   victim's\n\ninformant status (1) that Bulger and Flemmi knew the victim to be\n\nan informant, (2) that, if Bulger and Flemmi knew the victim to be\n\nan informant, they murdered the victim for that reason, and (3)\n\nmost importantly, that even if Bulger and Flemmi murdered the\n\nvictim for being an informant, the source of their information as\n\nto the victim's informant status was the FBI.                          One could not\n\nreasonably infer, for purposes of FTCA accrual, from Morris's\n\ntestimony about Halloran that the FBI told Bulger and Flemmi about\n\nevery informant in their organization or that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nkilled every person that they knew to be informing against them,\n\nregardless of the circumstances.\n\n            Drawing a direct parallel between the murders of Halloran\n\nand McIntyre is particularly difficult because the situations were\n\nso   different.        The    cases     involved       different       and       unrelated\n\nunderlying    crimes      that   took    place    at    different      times       and   in\n\ndifferent places: the Wheeler murder was in 1981 in Oklahoma and\n\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\fwas related to control of a Jai Alai empire, whereas the Valhalla\n\ngun-running operation was in 1984 in Boston for the IRA. Moreover,\n\nHalloran arguably posed a greater threat to Bulger and Flemmi as an\n\ninformant than McIntyre did.       As Bergeron noted, and as Bulger and\n\nFlemmi might well have been aware, McIntyre was \"petrified\" of the\n\ntwo and was unlikely to come forward publicly or, by implication,\n\nto testify.      McIntyre was a low-level operative in a gun-running\n\noperation, whereas Halloran was a hit man with the power to\n\nimplicate Bulger and Flemmi for murder. Another factual difference\n\nis that there was some indication, as the prosecution itself argued\n\nin Salemme, that McIntyre's cooperation was known to those outside\n\nthe   government,    and   thus   that    Bulger     and    Flemmi   could   have\n\ndiscovered this information from some source other than the FBI.\n\nA January 29, 1995 Boston Globe article reported that \"[r]umors\n\nthat McIntyre was talking [to the federal government] were rampant\"\n\nat the time.\n\n           The    government's    own    behavior     further   undercuts     its\n\nargument here that there were sufficient facts before May 25, 1998\n\nto reasonably infer that FBI had betrayed McIntyre. In response to\n\na defense objection during the cross-examination of Bergeron in the\n\nSalemme hearings     on    June   4,   1998,   the    prosecution     said   that\n\n\"there's literally a dozen people\" outside the FBI who knew of\n\nMcIntyre's cooperation and could have passed the information to\n\nBulger   and   Flemmi.      The   prosecutor       argued    that    Judge   Wolf\n\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\f\"shouldn't infer that there was some leak from the FBI that led to\n\nMr.   McIntyre's     disappearance\"        because    the    evidence   was     too\n\nspeculative. That, of course, is directly contrary to the position\n\nof the United States as stated in the case at bar: that before May\n\nof 1998, the McIntyres not only should have drawn exactly that\n\ninference but should have acted on it by seeking legal and other\n\nexpert advice about filing an FTCA claim.\n\n            In the June 1998 Salemme hearings, after the critical\n\ndate for accrual purposes had passed, the prosecution also sought\n\nto establish in its questioning of Bergeron that McIntyre had\n\nspoken to authorities about a number of notorious individuals, as\n\nwell as the IRA, \"[a]ll of whom would have had a motive to make him\n\ndisappear.\"       This casts further doubt on whether Bulger or Flemmi\n\nhad caused McIntyre's disappearance, making even more remote the\n\ninference   that     the   FBI   had    leaked   McIntyre's     identity   as    an\n\ninformant and caused his murder.\n\n            This government position in June of 1998 is significant\n\nfor several reasons.         It shows that there was a real basis to\n\nquestion whether it was at all reasonable to infer that Connolly\n\nhad disclosed McIntyre's dual role to Bulger.               We have no reason to\n\nthink the federal prosecutor's position in Salemme was taken in bad\n\nfaith.      The    prosecution,        which   had   access    to   confidential\n\ninformation and was in possession of far more facts than members of\n\nthe public, argued to the court that it could not reasonably make\n\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fsuch an inference.    The McIntyres, who were in a far worse position\n\nto access or evaluate information, should not be required here to\n\ndraw such an inference.    See Attallah, 955 F.2d at 780 (\"The police\n\ndid not have sufficient information to bring charges against the\n\n[relevant    government    officials]      until   1987.        We    believe\n\n[plaintiffs] could not have been more efficient.\").\n\n            Equally importantly, the prosecutor's position in June of\n\n1998 was yet another expression by the United States in a public\n\nforum that Connolly had not leaked McIntyre's identity and no\n\nwrongdoing had occurred.\n\n            Our decision in Skwira hurts rather than helps the\n\ngovernment's position.      The United States in Skwira told the\n\nplaintiff that there was cause to investigate suspicious deaths of\n\npatients who were within the sole custody of a VA hospital when\n\nthey died and did not deny wrongdoing.        344 F.3d at 80.        Here, the\n\ngovernment   kept    confidential    its   investigation   of    claims    of\n\nmisconduct by Connolly and Morris and ultimately reported in 1997\n\nthat it found no wrongdoing.    Even Judge Wolf had great difficulty\n\nin prying loose coherent information about McIntyre's death by the\n\ndate of his opinion on September 15, 1999.          Judge Wolf commented\n\nthat the question of whether the FBI disclosed McIntyre's identity\n\ncould not \"be resolved on the present record\" because of the\n\ngovernment's delayed disclosure of documents and its desire to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\favoid bringing to light the circumstances surrounding McIntyre's\n\ndeath.   Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 215.\n\n              We reverse the dismissal of the claims by McIntyre's\n\nestate and remand.\n\nC.    Application to the Wheeler Case\n\n              The cut-off date for the accrual of the Wheelers' claim,\n\nfiled on May 11, 2001, is May 11, 1999.              The district court\n\nconcluded that their claim accrued on or before May 10, 1998 when\n\nRoger Wheeler appeared on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n              The Wheeler case is based on a fundamentally different\n\nlegal theory than the McIntyre case.          Unlike the McIntyre case,\n\nwhich is based on duties arising from the government/informant\n\nrelationship, the Wheelers' claim is not based on any direct\n\nrelationship between Roger Wheeler and the FBI.             The theory of\n\nliability is, as a result, much more indirect than that in the\n\nMcIntyre case.\n\n              The Wheelers have styled their Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 229,\n\nยงยง 2 and 6 wrongful death claims against the United States as based\n\non both direct and vicarious liability. They assert that the United\n\nStates is vicariously liable for the actions of Connolly, Morris,\n\nand   other    agents,   which   provided   Bulger   and   Flemmi   with   a\n\n\"protective shield\" against prosecution and investigation that gave\n\nthe two criminals the opportunity to commit crimes and emboldened\n\nthem to do so, proximately causing Wheeler's murder.         The Wheelers\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\falso assert that the United States is directly liable for failing\n\nto prevent Wheeler's murder, in light of the foreseeable risk that\n\nBulger and Flemmi would continue to engage in violent criminal\n\nactivity.    In addition, the Wheelers assert a generalized count\n\nagainst the United States for intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress based on Wheeler's murder.\n\n            For the Wheelers' claims to accrue, there had to be facts\n\navailable that would permit a reasonable person to conclude (1) that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were instrumental in the murder of Roger Wheeler;\n\n(2) that Bulger and Flemmi were informants for the FBI; and (3) that\n\nthe FBI had a special relationship with Bulger and Flemmi that\n\nprotected and encouraged them in their criminal activity, including\n\nWheeler's murder.\n\n            The Wheelers clearly had sufficient notice of the first\n\ntwo sets of facts before the May 11, 1999 accrual date.     On April\n\n22, 1998, Morris testified that Bulger and Flemmi were valuable FBI\n\ninformants and that he was afraid he had sent Halloran to his death\n\nby telling Connolly that Halloran was alleging that Bulger and\n\nFlemmi had tried to hire him to kill Wheeler.      Morris's testimony\n\non this point received national press attention.    It was summarized\n\nin two Tulsa World articles on May 17, 1998 and July 20, 1998 and\n\nin a July 22, 1998 Boston Globe article that quoted David Wheeler.\n\nIn addition, a July 20, 1998 Tulsa World article and a September 29,\n\n1998 Boston Globe article, which quoted David Wheeler, both reported\n\n\n\n                                 -46-\n\fthat John Martorano was negotiating a plea agreement with federal\n\nprosecutors and had implicated Bulger and Flemmi in the Wheeler\n\nmurder.    In addition, as the district court fairly pointed out,\n\nDavid Wheeler stated on the May 10, 1998 \"60 Minutes\" show that\n\nBulger and Flemmi had caused his father to be murdered, that the two\n\nwere FBI informants, and that the FBI was \"in bed\" with the two.\n\n            What proves fatal to the Wheelers' claim is that they were\n\nalso on notice of the third set of facts.           We sidestep the dispute\n\nabout whether David Wheeler meant his statements on \"60 Minutes\" to\n\nindicate    that    the   FBI   had   protected    Bulger   and   Flemmi   from\n\nprosecution and thus enabled and emboldened them to murder his\n\nfather.    Other statements on the \"60 Minutes\" show should have made\n\nclear the special relationship between the FBI and Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.    Ed Bradley reported that the \"extraordinary relationship\"\n\nbetween the FBI and Bulger and Flemmi \"may have allowed [them] to\n\nget away with murder.\"       A detective interviewed for the segment was\n\neven more explicit, describing Bulger and Flemmi as having a\n\n\"license\" from the FBI to commit crimes that \"covered a homicide.\"\n\n            In addition, separate from the \"60 Minutes\" show, there\n\nwas national and local news coverage before the critical date\n\ndescribing    the    FBI's      shielding    of   Bulger    and   Flemmi   from\n\nprosecution. At least some of those articles should have caught the\n\nWheelers' attention, because they specifically referenced Roger\n\n\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fWheeler's murder and even, in several instances, quoted David\n\nWheeler.\n\n           Two Tulsa World articles on July 11, 1997 and January 9,\n\n1998, both of which specifically mentioned the Wheeler murder,\n\nreported that Flemmi was claiming in the Salemme proceedings that\n\nthe FBI gave him and Bulger immunity from prosecution for their\n\nongoing criminal activities in exchange for information about\n\norganized crime activities.      The July 11 article specifically noted\n\nthat Flemmi had executed an affidavit stating that he and Bulger had\n\nbeen given \"free reign from an FBI supervisor to commit any crime\"\n\nshort of murder.        On May 10, 1998, the same night that the \"60\n\nMinutes\" segment ran, a local Tulsa news station, KOTV, reported\n\nthat the FBI had tipped Bulger and Flemmi to Halloran's cooperation\n\nin the Wheeler murder investigation and that Boston FBI agents may\n\nhave taken bribes from Bulger and Flemmi.\n\n           In the summer of 1998, two Tulsa World articles and one\n\nBoston Globe article that quoted David Wheeler reported that Morris\n\nadmitted   that   the    FBI   had   shielded   Bulger    and   Flemmi   from\n\nprosecution for twenty years because they were prized informants.\n\nThe Tulsa World article was entitled \"When G-men, Mobsters Are\n\nFriends/FBI Ignored Tip-Off on Tulsa Murder.\"            All three articles\n\nspecifically mentioned the Wheeler murder.        Morris's testimony was\n\nalso picked up by the national press, with coverage in May and June\n\nof 1998 from the Associated Press, the Salt Lake Tribune, the\n\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\fCharleston Gazette & Daily Mail, the L.A. Times, and the Seattle\n\nTimes.\n\n            In the summer and fall of 1998, following the \"60 Minutes\"\n\nsegment, David Wheeler himself drew the connection between his\n\nfather's murder and the FBI's special relationship with Bulger and\n\nFlemmi in his comments to the Boston press.             In a May 12, 1998\n\narticle headlined \"Dad's execution mystery no more to anxious son,\"\n\nthe Boston Herald described David Wheeler as saying in an interview\n\nthat   he   \"always   believed\"   that   former   FBI    agent   Paul   Rico\n\n\"facilitated\" his father's murder at the hands of Bulger and Flemmi.\n\nWheeler also told the Boston Globe on September 29, 1998 that John\n\nMartorano's cooperation would expose \"people who have enjoyed the\n\nprotection of the FBI for many years while committing heinous\n\ncrimes.\"\n\n            The   Oklahoma   press   and   television      coverage,    the\n\ninformation revealed on \"60 Minutes,\" and David Wheeler's interviews\n\nwith the Boston press are sufficient to establish that David Wheeler\n\nwas clearly on notice before the May 11, 1999 critical date.\n\n            The issue is whether the other family members, in their\n\ndifferent positions, could reasonably be expected to be aware of\n\nthis information.     The district court focused on David Wheeler and\n\nattributed his knowledge to all. We disagree with that methodology:\n\nthe \"knew or reasonably should have known\" question must be asked\n\nindividually, as to the information available to someone in each\n\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fplaintiff's situation.       There is a difference between \"knew\" and\n\n\"should have known.\"     A plaintiff could, at least in theory, have\n\nactual knowledge of critical facts even though he or she would not\n\notherwise be reasonably expected to know them.         As to whether a\n\nplaintiff \"reasonably should have known\" critical facts, the inquiry\n\nis an objective one: whether a reasonable person similarly situated\n\nto the plaintiff would have known the necessary facts.       See Skwira,\n\n344 F.3d at 80 (the \"degree of knowledge of injury and cause that\n\nwould prompt a reasonable person to take . . .         protective steps\n\nwill vary with the circumstances of the case\"); cf.

Geography may be particularly relevant where, as here,\n\nnotice is based on local television and press coverage.       Similarly,\n\nwhere, as here, some members of the family have actual notice but\n\nothers do not, the issue of how strong the family's ties are and how\n\nfrequently they communicate can be relevant.        A plaintiff who is\n\nestranged     from   other   more   knowledgeable   family   members   is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -50-\n\fdifferently situated than one who speaks with his or her family\n\nevery day.\n\n          Despite this leeway, the record here establishes that each\n\nof the Wheelers had available sufficient facts to raise suspicions\n\nprovoking a reasonable person to inquire further.

Had the Wheelers inquired\n\nfurther, the requisite facts were present in the Boston and Oklahoma\n\ntelevision and press coverage to allow a reasonable person to infer\n\na causal connection between the FBI's actions and Roger Wheeler's\n\nmurder.\n\n             Patricia Wheeler (Roger's widow) saw the \"60 Minutes\"\n\nprogram in May 1998 and some of the Oklahoma press articles; they\n\nwere sufficient at least to trigger a duty to inquire before the May\n\n11, 1999 critical date, painful as the subject was to her. The same\n\nis essentially true of Lawrence Wheeler, one of Roger's sons.\n\n             Pamela Wheeler Norberg (Roger's only daughter) did not see\n\nthe \"60 Minutes\" segment.     She has stated by affidavit that she did\n\nnot read any of the press coverage in the record on the painful\n\nsubject of her father's murder, and that she is estranged from her\n\nbrothers and communicates with them only infrequently.       While her\n\nclaim presents a closer case, we find that she had a duty to inquire\n\nbased on local and national press coverage. \"[W]here events receive\n\n\n\n                                  -51-\n\f. . . widespread publicity, plaintiffs may be charged with knowledge\n\nof their occurrence.\"   United Klans of Am. v.

He presents an even closer case\n\nthan Pamela because he lived in Texas and the television and press\n\ncoverage in the record appeared mostly in either Boston or Tulsa\n\nsources.
