This appeal is about a trademark\n\ndispute between companies in the hair care industry. The plaintiff\n\nis Great Clips, Inc. (a Minnesota corporation), which owns and\n\noperates hair salons throughout the United States and Canada; the\n\ntwo defendants--Great Cuts, Inc. (a Massachusetts corporation) and\n\nHair Cuttery of Greater Boston, L.L.C. (a limited liability company\n\norganized under the laws of Virginia)--provide hair cutting and\n\nstyling services in Massachusetts and elsewhere.           The background\n\nevents are essentially undisputed.\n\n            In 1985, Great Clips registered a trademark, \"GREAT\n\nCLIPS,\" for hair cutting and styling services, with the United\n\nStates Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\").            Thereafter, Dalan\n\nCorporation (\"Dalan\"), a Massachusetts corporation that is Great\n\nCuts and Hair Cuttery's predecessor-in-interest, sought to register\n\nwith the PTO the trademark \"GREAT CUTS\" for hair care services and\n\nproducts.     Great Clips opposed Dalan's trademark registration\n\napplication in a proceeding before the PTO's Trademark Trial and\n\nAppeal   Board,   and    Dalan   countered    by    petitioning   for     the\n\ncancellation of Great Clips' trademark.\n\n            In December 1989, Great Clips and Dalan entered into a\n\nsettlement   agreement    stipulating    to   the   withdrawal    of    their\n\nrespective claims and each agreed not to object further to the\n\nregistration of the other's trademark.         Critical to the present\n\ndispute is paragraph 4 of that agreement, which reads: \"Each party\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\freleases the other from any and all claims that arise or may arise\n\nfrom the application and registration of its own respective mark(s)\n\nmentioned in this agreement.\"     Following the agreement, Dalan\n\nobtained federal registration for its trademark and Great Clips\n\nretained federal registration for its own mark.\n\n          Nineteen years passed without incident, but in 2008,\n\nGreat Clips entered into agreements for franchisees to open stores\n\nin Massachusetts and New Hampshire using the GREAT CLIPS mark.   By\n\nthen, Dalan had transferred pertinent rights and interests in the\n\nGREAT CUTS trademark to Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts, which became\n\nDalan's successors-in-interest to the settlement agreement. In May\n\nand June of 2008, Dennis Ratner, an executive at Hair Cuttery,\n\nadvised Great Clips' chief executive that Hair Cuttery planned to\n\nsue Great Clips to prevent it from using the GREAT CLIPS mark in\n\nthe New England market, contending that such use would impair Hair\n\nCuttery's use of the GREAT CUTS mark.\n\n          Great Clips then sued Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts in\n\nfederal district court in Massachusetts seeking a declaration that\n\nGreat Clips was entitled to use its GREAT CLIPS mark in the United\n\nStates, that its use of the mark in New England would not infringe\n\nany of the defendants' trademark rights, and that the settlement\n\nagreement precluded the defendants from asserting otherwise.   Hair\n\nCuttery and Great Cuts counterclaimed for damages and injunctive\n\nrelief against Great Clips, asserting trademark confusion and\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fdilution,   unfair    competition,    and   unfair   and   deceptive   trade\n\npractices under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1), 1125(a), (c)\n\n(2006), and under state law, Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 93A, 110H (2009).\n\n            On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court\n\ngranted Great Clips' request for declaratory judgment by deciding\n\nthat the settlement agreement entitled Great Clips to use its\n\nfederally   registered    mark   without    geographic     limitation,   and\n\ntherefore rejected Great Cuts and Hair Cuttery's counterclaims.\n\nGreat Clips, Inc. v. Hair Cuttery of Greater Boston, L.L.C., No.\n\n08-cv-10959, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14281, at *1-2, *25 (D. Mass.\n\nFeb. 18, 2009).      Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts now appeal, arguing\n\nthat the district court misconstrued the settlement agreement and\n\nthat their counterclaims should have survived its summary judgment\n\ndecision.\n\n            At the threshold, we must consider our subject matter\n\njurisdiction because it might be debated, even though neither party\n\nhas contested it.     Fafel v. DiPaola, 399 F.3d 403, 410 (1st Cir.\n\n2005). Conceivably there is diversity jurisdiction as well but, as\n\nthe parties do not address the amount in controversy (or the\n\ncitizenship of the members of the Hair Cuttery limited liability\n\ncompany), we begin (and end) with federal question jurisdiction,\n\nwhich has no minimum amount in controversy.           Compare 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1331 (2006), with id. § 1332.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f            In   a   declaratory     action,    the        familiar    well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint rule asks whether there would \"necessarily\" be federal\n\njurisdiction \"if the declaratory judgment defendant brought a\n\ncoercive    action    [corresponding     to    the    declaration       sought]    to\n\nenforce    its   rights.\"        Franchise    Tax    Bd.    v.   Constr.   Laborers\n\nVacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 19 (1983); Am. Airlines, Inc. v.\n\nCardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 115 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998).                       As we\n\nhave stated:\n\n            [W]here the declaratory judgment action is\n            brought as an anticipatory defense to an\n            expected . . . [coercive] action . . . it is\n            the character of the threatened action . . .\n            which will determine whether there is federal-\n            question jurisdiction . . . .\n\nColonial Penn Group, Inc. v. Colonial Deposit Co., 834 F.2d 229,\n\n233 (1st Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n\nPub. Serv. Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 248 (1952)).                     A fair\n\ninterpretation       of   Hair   Cuttery's     threats       include    the     likely\n\nassertion of federal rights under the Lanham Act and this suffices\n\nto establish federal-question jurisdiction.                      See PHC, Inc. v.\n\nPioneer Healthcare, Inc., 75 F.3d 75, 78-79 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Turning       to   the   merits,    the        parties     assume     that\n\nMassachusetts law governs the interpretation of the settlement\n\nagreement, a colorable position that we accept, Nagle v. Acton-\n\nBoxborough Reg'l Sch. Dist., 576 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2009),\n\nalthough the relevant doctrines in Massachusetts governing contract\n\ninterpretation may not differ from those used in any other state\n\n                                       -5-\n\fconnected with the settlement agreement.              A grant of summary\n\njudgment by the district court is reviewed de novo.               Insituform\n\nTechs., Inc. v. Am. Home Assurance Co., 566 F.3d 274, 276 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n              Great Clips' position is that the potential Lanham Act\n\nand   state    law   claims   fail   because   the   settlement    agreement\n\neffectively surrenders Dalan's (and therefore the defendants')\n\nrights to object to Great Clips' use of the GREAT CLIPS trademark\n\nin connection with hair services or products.           By contrast, Hair\n\nCuttery and Great Cuts argue that paragraph 4 releases Great Clips\n\nonly from claims about registration of the mark, not from claims\n\nthat arise from Great Clips' infringing use of the mark, or at\n\nleast that the agreement is ambiguous on that point and should be\n\npresented to a jury.1\n\n              The defendants' claim to a jury trial goes nowhere.        In\n\nMassachusetts, as elsewhere, contracts are construed by the judge\n\nunless extrinsic evidence is offered to resolve supposed ambiguity,\n\nPrincipal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc., 233 F.3d 1, 3\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); in the latter event, the dispute may go to a jury\n\nso that it can resolve the underlying factual issues, Fishman v.\n\nLaSalle Nat'l Bank, 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir. 2001).            Defendants\n\n\n\n      1\n      Defendants do not argue that under the agreement related\nclaims under state law fare any better than Lanham Act claims, nor\ndo they argue that the settlement agreement permitted use of the\nGREAT CLIPS trademark only in specified parts of the country.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwere free in the summary judgment proceedings to identify pertinent\n\nextrinsic evidence (such as alleged discussions of the parties at\n\nthe time they entered into the settlement) or to seek discovery\n\nbased on some concrete indication that pertinent evidence might be\n\nfound; but they do not appear to have done either.2\n\n               Paragraph 4, which the parties treat as central and which\n\nwe have set forth above, mutually releases the parties \"from any\n\nand all claims that arise or may arise from the application and\n\nregistration\"      of    their    respective   marks.     Indisputably,       this\n\nincludes claims by defendants as to the validity of Great Clips'\n\nregistered       mark;      but   defendants   read     narrowly   the   phrase\n\n\"application and registration\" as limiting the release to claims\n\nthat arise in the registration process itself--for example, a claim\n\nof fraud in obtaining registration--and not extending to any later\n\nuse of the registered mark or marks in commercial activities.\n\n               Defendants' reading might be a permissible one as a\n\nmatter of language, but their narrow reading is in tension with\n\nother       language   in   paragraph   4   stressing    the   breadth   of    the\n\nprecluded claims.           Little light is cast on our problem by each\n\n\n\n        2\n      No such evidence is identified in the defendants' principal\nbrief on appeal. In their summary judgment papers, the defendants\nsaid in general terms that if they did not prevail on summary\njudgment they wanted discovery, but without some indication that\ndiscovery had some prospect of being fruitful, such a boilerplate\nreservation is not enough to defeat summary judgment by the other\nside. See C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 137 F.3d 41,\n45 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fside's proffer of dueling dictionary definitions of \"application\"\n\nand   \"registration,\"         the    terms'     use    in     the    Lanham    Act    or\n\nMassachusetts law, nor by various arguments based on rules of\n\ngrammar.      The    apparent       purpose    of   the     settlement,    and      other\n\nprovisions in the agreement, are more helpful guides.\n\n             Defendants may be right that the phrase \"application and\n\nregistration\"        refers    to     the     written       application       for     and\n\nregistration of the trademarks but, even if so, trademarks are\n\nregistered in order to be used and the substance of the agreement\n\nwas   that    each    side     conceded       the     other's       registration     and\n\nanticipated use of the registered marks.                    The release is broadly\n\nphrased (\"any and all claims\"; \"arise or may arise from\"), and\n\n\"Massachusetts case law instructs that the term 'arising out of'\n\nshould be broadly construed.\"               Brazas Sporting Arms, Inc. v. Am.\n\nEmpire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 220 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             Where language in a commercial contract leaves room for\n\ndoubt,     courts ask what one would be reasonable to expect in the\n\nbusiness context faced by the parties.                  Ucello v. Cosentino, 235\n\nN.E.2d 44, 47 (Mass. 1968); Clark v. State St. Trust Co., 169 N.E.\n\n897, 903 (Mass. 1930).         After all,       the point is to effectuate the\n\nshared purpose that the parties intended to accomplish by their\n\nagreement.     Kerrigan v. City of Boston, 278 N.E.2d 387, 393 (Mass.\n\n1972); Clark, 169 N.E. at 903.              See generally R.I. Charities Trust\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fv. Engelhard Corp., 267 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2001); Fishman, 247\n\nF.3d at 302-03.\n\n              Here, the most likely aim was to permit the parties to\n\nuse   their    respective   registered      marks    in    hair   services   and\n\nproducts, notwithstanding possible arguments on each side about\n\npotential confusion between their respective phrases--\"Great Cuts\"\n\nand \"Great Clips.\"     No evidence is offered that the parties sought\n\nonly to allow each to register its mark but to reserve for future\n\nlitigation the practical consequences of registration.                  Such an\n\nincomplete     settlement   is   unlikely    to     have   been   the   intended\n\noutcome; and, to accept it, we would require more pointed language\n\nor at the very least a proffer of extrinsic evidence.\n\n              Further, provisions of the agreement other than paragraph\n\n4 reinforce the view that its language extended to future disputes\n\nabout use of the marks and not just objections to registration.\n\nNotably, paragraph 6 states:\n\n                      6. Greatclips is using the phrase\n              \"GREATCLIPS FOR HAIR\" in connection with\n              providing its products and services, and Dalan\n              therefore agrees not to use the phrase \"GREAT\n              CUTS FOR HAIR\" in connection with providing\n              its products and services.     Notwithstanding\n              the above, Dalan may use the phrase it claims\n              to have been using for several years, namely,\n              \"GREAT CUTS - FOR GREAT LOOKING HAIR AT A\n              REALLY GREAT PRICE,\" or any other similar\n              phrase.\n\nAs the district court judge explained, \"Paragraph 6 is . . . most\n\nreasonably interpreted as a 'carve out' from ¶ 4, which released\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fall other infringement claims arising from Dalan's use of the\n\n'Great Cuts' mark.\"       Great Clips, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14281, at\n\n*20.    In other words, Dalan was agreeing not to use its own GREAT\n\nCUTS mark with the phrase \"FOR HAIR,\" save as permitted by the last\n\nsentence of paragraph 6; paragraph 6 thereby preserved Great Clips'\n\npotential claim against Dalan for use of the mark in the prohibited\n\nfashion--a claim that would otherwise be precluded by paragraph 4.\n\n            Similarly, paragraph 7 addresses future use by stating:\n\n                   7. Dalan agrees that if Greatclips,\n            Inc. becomes aware of a use of the mark GREAT\n            CUTS that is unauthorized by Dalan, Greatclips\n            may pursue enforcement of its rights against\n            such use and/or notify Dalan, and Dalan may\n            give consideration to objecting to such use.\n            Greatclips    agrees   to   give    the   same\n            consideration to any notification given it by\n            Dalan concerning a use of the mark GREATCLIPS\n            that is unauthorized by Greatclips.\n\nThe    district   court    correctly    explained    that     this   paragraph,\n\npreserving each party's rights to bring claims against third\n\nparties based on use of the other's mark, does not make sense\n\nunless paragraph 4 extended to bar some of the parties' use claims\n\nagainst each other.       Great Clips, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14281, at\n\n*20-21.\n\n            Defendants offer alternative explanations of paragraphs\n\n6 and 7 which we think unpersuasive; but what is most important,\n\nthese     additional      provisions    address     details     of   practical\n\nimplementation that are consistent with Great Clips' version of\n\nwhat the settlement was all about: that it was not merely concerned\n\n                                       -10-\n\fwith letting the formalities of registration be completed but aimed\n\nto achieve a working solution to the rights of the parties as to\n\nthe   conduct   of   their   businesses   including   the   use   of   their\n\nrespective marks.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Conceivably there is diversity jurisdiction as well but, as the parties do not address the amount in controversy (or the citizenship of the members of the Hair Cuttery limited liability company), we begin (and end) with federal question jurisdiction, which has no minimum amount in controversy. <i>Compare</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2006), <i>with id.</i> § 1332.</p>\n<p>In a declaratory action, the familiar well-pleaded complaint rule asks whether there would \"necessarily\" be federal jurisdiction \"if the declaratory judgment defendant brought a coercive action [corresponding to the declaration sought] to enforce its rights.\" <i>Franchise Tax Bd. v.

By contrast, Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts argue that paragraph 4 releases Great Clips only from claims about registration of the mark, not from claims that arise from Great Clips' infringing <i>use</i> of the mark, or at least that the agreement is ambiguous on that point and should be presented to a jury.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants' claim to a jury trial goes nowhere.

LaSalle Nat'l Bank,</i> 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir.2001). Defendants were free in the summary judgment proceedings to identify pertinent extrinsic evidence (such as alleged discussions of the parties at the time they entered into the settlement) or to seek discovery based on some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> concrete indication that pertinent evidence might be found; but they do not appear to have done either.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Paragraph 4, which the parties treat as central and which we have set forth above, mutually releases the parties \"from any and all claims that arise or may arise from the application and registration\" of their respective marks. Indisputably, this includes claims by defendants as to the validity of Great Clips' registered mark; but defendants read narrowly the phrase \"application and registration\" as limiting the release to claims that arise <i>in the registration process itself</i>for example, a claim of fraud in obtaining registrationand <i>not extending to any later use</i> of the registered mark or marks in commercial activities.</p>\n<p>Defendants' reading might be <i>a</i> permissible one as a matter of language, but their narrow reading is in tension with other language in paragraph 4 stressing the breadth of the precluded claims. Little light is cast on our problem by each side's proffer of dueling dictionary definitions of \"application\" and \"registration,\" the terms' use in the Lanham Act or Massachusetts law, nor by various arguments based on rules of grammar. The apparent purpose of the settlement, and other provisions in the agreement, are more helpful guides.</p>\n<p>Defendants may be right that the phrase \"application and registration\" refers to the written application for and registration of the trademarks but, even if so, trademarks are registered in order to be used and the substance of the agreement was that each side conceded the other's registration and anticipated use of the registered marks. The release is broadly phrased (\"any and all claims\"; \"arise or may arise from\"), and \"Massachusetts case law instructs that the term `arising out of' should be broadly construed.\" <i>Brazas Sporting Arms, Inc. v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.,</i> 220 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p>Where language in a commercial contract leaves room for doubt, courts ask what one would be reasonable to expect in the business context faced by the parties. <i>Ucello v.

Such an incomplete settlement is unlikely to have been the intended outcome; and, to accept it, we would require more pointed language or at the very least a proffer of extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> Further, provisions of the agreement other than paragraph 4 reinforce the view that its language extended to future disputes about use of the marks and not just objections to registration. Notably, paragraph 6 states:</p>\n<blockquote>6. Greatclips is using the phrase \"GREATCLIPS FOR HAIR\" in connection with providing its products and services, and Dalan therefore agrees not to use the phrase \"GREAT CUTS FOR HAIR\" in connection with providing its products and services. Notwithstanding the above, Dalan may use the phrase it claims to have been using for several years, namely, \"GREAT CUTSFOR GREAT LOOKING HAIR AT A REALLY GREAT PRICE,\" or any other similar phrase.</blockquote>\n<p>As the district court judge explained, \"Paragraph 6 is ... most reasonably interpreted as a `carve out' from ¶ 4, which released all <i>other</i> infringement claims arising from Dalan's use of the `Great Cuts' mark.\" <i>Great Clips,</i> 2009 WL 458554, at *6, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14281, at *20. In other words, Dalan was agreeing not <i>to use</i> its own GREAT CUTS mark with the phrase \"FOR HAIR,\" save as permitted by the last sentence of paragraph 6; paragraph 6 thereby preserved Great Clips' potential claim against Dalan for use of the mark in the prohibited fashiona claim that would otherwise be precluded by paragraph 4.</p>\n<p>Similarly, paragraph 7 addresses future use by stating:</p>\n<blockquote>7. Dalan agrees that if Greatclips, Inc. becomes aware of a use of the mark GREAT CUTS that is unauthorized by Dalan, Greatclips may pursue enforcement of its rights against such use and/or notify Dalan, and Dalan may give consideration to objecting to such use. Greatclips agrees to give the same consideration to any notification given it by Dalan concerning a use of the mark GREATCLIPS that is unauthorized by Greatclips.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court correctly explained that this paragraph, preserving each party's rights to bring claims against <i>third parties</i> based on use of the other's mark, does not make sense unless paragraph 4 extended to bar some of the parties' use claims against <i>each other. Great Clips,</i> 2009 WL 458554, at *6, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14281, at *20-21.</p>\n<p>Defendants offer alternative explanations of paragraphs 6 and 7 which we think unpersuasive; but what is most important, these additional provisions address details of practical implementation that are consistent with Great Clips' version of what the settlement was all about: that it was not merely concerned with letting the formalities of registration be completed but aimed to achieve a working solution to the rights of the parties as to the conduct of their businesses including the use of their respective marks.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Defendants do not argue that under the agreement related claims under state law fare any better than Lanham Act claims, nor do they argue that the settlement agreement permitted use of the GREAT CLIPS trademark only in specified parts of the country.</p>\n<p>[2]  No such evidence is identified in the defendants' principal brief on appeal. In their summary judgment papers, the defendants said in general terms that if they did not prevail on summary judgment they wanted discovery, but without some indication that discovery had some prospect of being fruitful, such a boilerplate reservation is not enough to defeat summary judgment by the other side. <i>See </i><i>C.B.

The plaintiff is Great Clips, Inc. (a Minnesota corporation), which owns and operates hair salons throughout the United States and Canada; the two defendants Great Cuts, Inc. (a Massachusetts corporation) and Hair Cuttery of Greater Boston, L.L.C. (a limited liability company organized under the laws of Virginia)provide hair cutting and styling services in Massachusetts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> and elsewhere. The background events are essentially undisputed.</p>\n<p>In 1985, Great Clips registered a trademark, \"GREAT CLIPS,\" for hair cutting and styling services, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\"). Thereafter, Dalan Corporation (\"Dalan\"), a Massachusetts corporation that is Great Cuts and Hair Cuttery's predecessor-in-interest, sought to register with the PTO the trademark \"GREAT CUTS\" for hair care services and products. Great Clips opposed Dalan's trademark registration application in a proceeding before the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, and Dalan countered by petitioning for the cancellation of Great Clips' trademark.</p>\n<p>In December 1989, Great Clips and Dalan entered into a settlement agreement stipulating to the withdrawal of their respective claims and each agreed not to object further to the registration of the other's trademark. Critical to the present dispute is paragraph 4 of that agreement, which reads: \"Each party releases the other from any and all claims that arise or may arise from the application and registration of its own respective mark(s) mentioned in this agreement.\" Following the agreement, Dalan obtained federal registration for its trademark and Great Clips retained federal registration for its own mark.</p>\n<p>Nineteen years passed without incident, but in 2008, Great Clips entered into agreements for franchisees to open stores in Massachusetts and New Hampshire using the GREAT CLIPS mark. By then, Dalan had transferred pertinent rights and interests in the GREAT CUTS trademark to Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts, which became Dalan's successors-in-interest to the settlement agreement. In May and June of 2008, Dennis Ratner, an executive at Hair Cuttery, advised Great Clips' chief executive that Hair Cuttery planned to sue Great Clips to prevent it from using the GREAT CLIPS mark in the New England market, contending that such use would impair Hair Cuttery's use of the GREAT CUTS mark.</p>\n<p>Great Clips then sued Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts in federal district court in Massachusetts seeking a declaration that Great Clips was entitled to use its GREAT CLIPS mark in the United States, that its use of the mark in New England would not infringe any of the defendants' trademark rights, and that the settlement agreement precluded the defendants from asserting otherwise. Hair Cuttery and Great Cuts counterclaimed for damages and injunctive relief against Great Clips, asserting trademark confusion and dilution, unfair competition, and unfair and deceptive trade practices under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1), 1125(a), (c) (2006), and under state law, Mass. Gen. Laws chs. 93A, 110H (2009).</p>\n<p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted Great Clips' request for declaratory judgment by deciding that the settlement agreement entitled Great Clips to use its federally registered mark without geographic limitation, and therefore rejected Great Cuts and Hair Cuttery's counterclaims. <i>Great Clips, Inc. v.

Greatclips is using the phrase \"GREATCLIPS FOR HAIR\" in connection with providing its products and services, and Dalan therefore agrees not to use the phrase \"GREAT CUTS FOR HAIR\" in connection with providing its products and services. Notwithstanding the above, Dalan may use the phrase it claims to have been using for several years, namely, \"GREAT CUTSFOR GREAT LOOKING HAIR AT A REALLY GREAT PRICE,\" or any other similar phrase.</blockquote>\n<p>As the district court judge explained, \"Paragraph 6 is ... most reasonably interpreted as a `carve out' from ¶ 4, which released all <i>other</i> infringement claims arising from Dalan's use of the `Great Cuts' mark.\" <i>Great Clips,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">458554</span></span>, at *6, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">14281</span></span>, at *20. In other words, Dalan was agreeing not <i>to use</i> its own GREAT CUTS mark with the phrase \"FOR HAIR,\" save as permitted by the last sentence of paragraph 6; paragraph 6 thereby preserved Great Clips' potential claim against Dalan for use of the mark in the prohibited fashiona claim that would otherwise be precluded by paragraph 4.</p>\n<p>Similarly, paragraph 7 addresses future use by stating:</p>\n<blockquote>7. Dalan agrees that if Greatclips, Inc. becomes aware of a use of the mark GREAT CUTS that is unauthorized by Dalan, Greatclips may pursue enforcement of its rights against such use and/or notify Dalan, and Dalan may give consideration to objecting to such use. Greatclips agrees to give the same consideration to any notification given it by Dalan concerning a use of the mark GREATCLIPS that is unauthorized by Greatclips.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court correctly explained that this paragraph, preserving each party's rights to bring claims against <i>third parties</i> based on use of the other's mark, does not make sense unless paragraph 4 extended to bar some of the parties' use claims against <i>each other. Great Clips,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">458554</span></span>, at *6, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">14281</span></span>, at *20-21.</p>\n<p>Defendants offer alternative explanations of paragraphs 6 and 7 which we think unpersuasive; but what is most important, these additional provisions address details of practical implementation that are consistent with Great Clips' version of what the settlement was all about: that it was not merely concerned with letting the formalities of registration be completed but aimed to achieve a working solution to the rights of the parties as to the conduct of their businesses including the use of their respective marks.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Defendants do not argue that under the agreement related claims under state law fare any better than Lanham Act claims, nor do they argue that the settlement agreement permitted use of the GREAT CLIPS trademark only in specified parts of the country.</p>\n<p>[2]  No such evidence is identified in the defendants' principal brief on appeal. In their summary judgment papers, the defendants said in general terms that if they did not prevail on summary judgment they wanted discovery, but without some indication that discovery had some prospect of being fruitful, such a boilerplate reservation is not enough to defeat summary judgment by the other side. <i>See </i><i>C.B.
