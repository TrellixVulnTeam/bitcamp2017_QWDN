In    this    appeal,   defendant-\n\nappellant Elmer C. Rodriguez-Castillo (Rodriguez) raises questions\n\nconcerning the operation of former Rule 16(a)(1)(B) of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure1 and the imposition of his sentence.\n\nConcluding that his arguments lack merit, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\n            We glean the relevant facts from the change-of-plea\n\ncolloquy, the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), and\n\nthe transcript of the disposition hearing.             See United States v.\n\nBrewster, 127 F.3d 22, 23 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Dietz,\n\n950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).         In all events, the facts are\n\nessentially uncontradicted.\n\n            On December 8, 1998, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nRodriguez   and   three   compatriots    for    various    drug-trafficking\n\noffenses.    Rodriguez initially asserted his innocence.           Early in\n\nthe case, the government supplied him with a summary of his prior\n\ncriminal record as then known to it.           The government's letter of\n\ntransmittal left no doubt that the criminal history was incomplete.\n\nThe convictions listed in this hypoplastic summary, without more,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Effective December 1, 2002, a new rule, redesignated as Rule\n16(a)(1)(D), replaced former Rule 16(a)(1)(B). The substance of\nthe rule remains the same, but the wording has changed slightly\n(e.g., the new version states that \"the government must furnish\"\ncertain information whereas the original version states that \"the\ngovernment shall furnish\" such information). Since the events in\nthis case transpired before the effective date of the revision, we\nrefer throughout to the original version.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwould have placed Rodriguez into criminal history category (CHC) II\n\nfor sentencing purposes.\n\n          Despite the plainly incomplete nature of the government's\n\ncriminal history submission, Rodriguez commenced plea negotiations.\n\nHe subsequently entered into a plea agreement (the Agreement).\n\nUnder the Agreement, the government committed itself to dismiss\n\ncertain charges and embrace a reduced drug-quantity determination\n\nin exchange for Rodriguez's plea of guilty to a single count of\n\nillegal importation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 952(a).\n\n          On March 21, 2002, Rodriguez entered a guilty plea to the\n\nimportation   count   and   the   district   court   commissioned   the\n\npreparation of the PSI Report.    When compiled, the report included\n\na more accurate description of Rodriguez's criminal past.            In\n\nparticular, it identified a 1989 felony conviction for aggravated\n\nunlawful appropriation of property in violation of 33 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 4272 that had not been included in the government's earlier\n\nsummary. That additional conviction pushed Rodriguez into CHC III.\n\nAs we shall see, this category change had a discernible effect on\n\nthe guideline sentencing range (GSR).\n\n          The drug-quantity compromise contained in the Agreement\n\nfixed the weight of the cocaine attributable to Rodriguez at 149\n\nkilograms, and, thus, lowered his base offense level under the\n\nsentencing guidelines to 36.      Rodriguez was entitled to a three-\n\nlevel credit for timely acceptance of responsibility and a two-\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\flevel reduction        reflecting    his      minor    role    in    the   offense     of\n\nconviction.       See USSG §§3E1.1, 3B1.2 (2000).               Had he remained in\n\nCHC II, his GSR would have been 121-151 months.                     The switch to CHC\n\nIII increased his GSR to 135-168 months.\n\n               At the disposition hearing, the district court sentenced\n\nRodriguez at the nadir of the applicable GSR, ordering him to serve\n\nan incarcerative term of 135 months.                This timely appeal followed.\n\n               Rodriguez   first    complains       that,     during    the     pre-plea\n\nnegotiations, the government failed to comply with the strictures\n\nof    former    Rule   16(a)(1)(B)       of   the   Federal    Rules       of   Criminal\n\nProcedure.       Although one might think that a defendant would know\n\nhis own criminal history, the rule mandates that, \"upon request by\n\nthe defendant, the government shall furnish to the defendant such\n\ncopy of the defendant's prior criminal record, if any, as is within\n\nthe    possession,     custody,     or    control      of   the     government,        the\n\nexistence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence\n\nmay become known, to the attorney for the government.\"                          Id.   This\n\nlanguage is mandatory, and courts have not hesitated to compel the\n\ngovernment to effect such production.                See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMcDaniel, 428 F. Supp. 1226, 1228 (D. Okla. 1977).\n\n               Here, Rodriguez made a timely request for his criminal\n\nhistory.        The government responded with a palpably incomplete\n\nsummary.        The record is murky as to whether the government's\n\npartial response reflected the exercise of due diligence.                              The\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\frecord is clear, however, that Rodriguez was not misled.                    The\n\ngovernment informed him that its proffer was incomplete, stating in\n\nits transmittal letter that it \"had been informed that [he] had\n\npreviously been convicted of a variety of felony offenses\" and that\n\nit would \"supplement [its] response when additional information is\n\nreceived.\"\n\n              The next step was up to Rodriguez. He could have awaited\n\nan encyclopedic response or moved to compel one.            He chose neither\n\ncourse.       Instead, he pursued plea negotiations, struck a final\n\nbargain, and changed his plea.         In so doing, Rodriguez waived his\n\nright to complain about the government's failure to effectuate full\n\nand complete compliance with former Rule 16(a)(1)(B).              We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n              A defendant who subscribes an unconditional guilty plea\n\nis deemed to have waived virtually all claims arising out of\n\ngarden-variety errors that may have antedated the plea. See United\n\nStates v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir. 1994) (collecting\n\ncases).     Although there is an exception to this principle, see,\n\ne.g.,   id.    at   699   (noting   that   jurisdictional   issues   are    not\n\nwaived), Rodriguez's case does not fit within its confines.                  He\n\nknowingly      entered    an   unconditional   guilty   plea;   advised     the\n\ndistrict      court   during    the   change-of-plea    colloquy     that    he\n\nunderstood that his guilty plea \"waiv[ed] [his] right to a trial\n\nand all the other rights\" associated therewith; and made no claim,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthen or now, that the sentencing court lacked authority to hear and\n\ndetermine his case.2\n\n          To be sure, the pre-plea colloquy between the court and\n\ndefense counsel was less than a model of clarity, and that colloquy\n\nmay well have given Rodriguez hope that his CHC would remain at II.\n\nBut such an interpretation would be unreasonable in light of the\n\ngovernment's up-front notice of the distinct possibility that\n\nadditional information about prior convictions might surface. Hope\n\nmay, as the aphorist would have it, spring eternal, but the\n\nfrustration of an expectation founded on hope alone, unanchored in\n\nobjective reasonableness, is not a cognizable basis for relief on\n\nappeal.\n\n          That ends this phase of the matter.     An unconditional\n\nguilty plea waives any and all independent non-jurisdictional\n\nclaims arising out of alleged errors antedating the plea.    Thus,\n\nRodriguez waived his right to insist upon compliance with the\n\nprovisions of former Rule 16(a)(1)(B) by his decision to plead\n\nguilty unconditionally without first having obtained, by a motion\n\nto compel or otherwise, his complete criminal record.    He cannot\n\nnow be heard to complain about the government's purported lapse.\n\n\n\n     2\n      We emphasize the unconditional nature of the plea because a\ndefendant may tender a conditional guilty plea and still preserve\nantecedent claims of error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2); see\nalso United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 392 (1st Cir.\n1995) (discussing effect of conditional plea). Rodriguez did not\navail himself of this option.\n\n                               -6-\n\f           Rodriguez's remaining assignment of error need not occupy\n\nus for long.   He strives to persuade us that the district court\n\nerred in not departing downward from the GSR on the ground that his\n\ncriminal   history   score   (which   placed    him   in   CHC   III)\n\noverrepresented his criminal past.    We are not convinced.\n\n           Ordinarily, a district court's discretionary decision not\n\nto depart from the GSR is unappealable.        See United States v.\n\nPierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Jimenez-\n\nOtero, 898 F.2d 813, 815 (1st Cir. 1990).      There are, however, a\n\nfew isthmian exceptions to this rule.    One exception springs into\n\nplay when a sentencing court's decision not to depart from the GSR\n\nresults from a misperception of its own authority.    See Pierro, 32\n\nF.3d at 619 (explaining that \"appellate jurisdiction may attach if\n\nit appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the sentencing\n\ncourt's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal authority to\n\ndeviate from the guideline range or, relatedly, from the court's\n\nmisapprehension of the rules governing departures\") (quoting United\n\nStates v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir. 1994)).      The basis\n\nfor the exception is that the sentencing court's determination that\n\nit lacked departure authority is not an exercise of discretion,\n\nbut, rather, a legal judgment (and, thus, appealable as of right).\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(2); see also Jimenez-Otero, 898 F.2d at\n\n814.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f               Rodriguez relies upon this exception.           He notes that the\n\nsentencing court commented, in colloquy, that it saw \"no way\" to go\n\nunder the low end of the GSR obtained by the use of CHC III.\n\nRodriguez       suggests       that   this      remark    evinces     the      court's\n\nmisperception that it lacked the power to depart.\n\n               This suggestion rests on a porous foundation.                  It takes\n\na bit of dialogue completely out of context.                Rodriguez never made\n\na request for a downward departure at the disposition hearing, and\n\nthe court's comment did not refer to that possibility at all.\n\nRather, the quoted statement was made in connection with the\n\ncourt's determination as to which CHC obtained (and, accordingly,\n\nwhich    GSR    applied).        Consequently,      the    \"lack    of       authority\"\n\nexception is plainly inapplicable here.\n\n               As   a   fallback,     Rodriguez    argues    that     he      made   the\n\n\"functional equivalent\" of a departure request.                     That argument\n\nfails.    In the first place, the transcript of the disposition\n\nhearing   reveals       that    nothing   remotely       resembling      a    departure\n\nrequest was made.        The argument is, therefore, groundless.                 In the\n\nsecond place, the argument, even if well-founded, would sink under\n\nthe weight of the aforementioned jurisdictional bar.                     See Pierro,\n\n32 F.3d at 619.\n\n               Rodriguez next asseverates that even in the absence of a\n\ndeparture request, the district court should have departed sua\n\nsponte.     His starting point is uncontroversial:                    it cannot be\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fgainsaid that a sentencing court has the authority to depart on its\n\nown volition.      See, e.g., USSG §4A1.3; see generally United States\n\nv. Burns, 501 U.S. 129, 138 (1991) (describing procedure to be\n\nemployed when district court essays a sua sponte departure under\n\nUSSG §5K2.0).       Nevertheless, the idea that a sentencing court's\n\nfailure to depart sua sponte creates an appealable issue is a novel\n\none.     We find it unsurprising that Rodriguez cites to no case law\n\nsupporting the notion.            After all the decision to depart is\n\ntypically an exercise of discretion and, absent a focused request\n\nby one of the parties, it would be surpassingly difficult to hold\n\nthat the sentencing court abused its discretion in not departing.\n\nCf. United States v. Reveron Martinez, 836 F.2d 684, 687 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (holding that a district court has no duty sua sponte to\n\nconsider a change of venue in a criminal case).\n\n               From a conceptual standpoint, Rodriguez's asseveration is\n\nalso unconvincing.       Its chief flaw is that it runs contrary to our\n\nusual rule for preserving claims of error.            Because the departure\n\nissue was not raised in the district court, analogous precedents\n\nsuggest that we should simply hold it unpreserved for appeal.               See\n\nMalave    v.    Carney   Hosp.,   170   F.3d   217,   222   (1st   Cir.   1999)\n\n(discussing the \"bedrock rule of appellate practice that . . .\n\nmatters not raised in the trial court cannot be hawked for the\n\nfirst time on appeal\"); see also United States v. LaGuardia, 902\n\nF.2d 1010, 1012-13 (1st Cir. 1990) (stating, in a case where a\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fdeparture had not been requested below, that the \"usual praxis\"\n\nwould be \"to ignore [the issue] on appeal\").\n\n            We are aware that one respected court has granted plain\n\nerror review in an instance in which a defendant failed to preserve\n\na departure argument for appeal. See United States v. Draffin, 286\n\nF.3d 606, 609 (D.C. Cir. 2002).            We need not decide today the\n\ncorrectness of that approach. In the best of circumstances, \"[t]he\n\nplain error hurdle is high.\"       United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d\n\n955, 956 (1st Cir. 1989).      To vault that hurdle, an appellant must\n\nmake a fourfold showing:      \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was\n\nclear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"              United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                This case\n\nstumbles over each of the four elements.\n\n            The short of it is that Rodriguez's argument for a\n\ndeparture is not very strong.      The facts may not even be sufficient\n\nto   support   a   discretionary    departure;    they   surely    are    not\n\nsufficient to mandate one.         We discern no error (let alone any\n\nobvious   error)   in   the   sentencing    court's   failure     to   depart\n\ndownward.   Finally, Rodriguez points to nothing that suggests that\n\na downward departure is needed either to forestall a miscarriage of\n\njustice or to restore public confidence in the criminal justice\n\nsystem. We conclude, therefore, that Rodriguez's belated quest for\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fa   departure     does   not   come   close    to     satisfying   the    criteria\n\nestablished for plain error review.3                Compare United States v.\n\nBelk, 346 F.3d 305, ___ (2d Cir. 2003) [No. 02-1636, slip op. at\n\n14], in which the court wrote that \"[t]o the extent that plain\n\nerror forfeiture analysis under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) extends to\n\na district court's failure to depart downwardly,\" it found \"no\n\nplain error in the District Court's failure sua sponte to consider\n\nand grant a vertical downward departure.\"\n\n              We need go no further.           We hold that (i) Rodriguez's\n\nguilty plea effectively foreclosed his right to complain about any\n\nshortfall in the government's compliance with the strictures of\n\nformer Rule       16(a)(1)(B),   and    (ii)    his    search   for   a   downward\n\ndeparture is doomed by his failure to ask the sentencing court for\n\none.       For the sake of completeness, we add that even if the lower\n\ncourt's failure to depart sua sponte is reviewable for plain error\n\n— a matter on which we take no view — Rodriguez's appeal would\n\nlanguish.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      This conclusion reinforces the Draffin court's intuition that\n\"[a]s a practical matter denying review of the failure to depart\nsua sponte and reviewing it for plain error will ordinarily yield\nthe same result: the sentence will be upheld.\" 286 F.3d at 609-\n10.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f",

Under the Agreement, the government committed itself to dismiss certain charges and embrace a reduced drug-quantity determination in exchange for Rodriguez's plea of guilty to a single count of illegal importation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 952(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 21, 2002, Rodriguez entered a guilty plea to the importation count and the district court commissioned the preparation of the PSI Report.

Laws Ann. &#167; 4272 that had not been included in the government's earlier summary. That additional conviction pushed Rodriguez into CHC III.

Although one might think that a defendant would know his own criminal history, the rule mandates that, \"upon request by the defendant, the government shall furnish to the defendant such copy of the defendant's prior criminal record, if any, as is within the possession, custody, or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government.\" <i>Id.</i> This language is mandatory, and courts have not hesitated to compel the government to effect such production. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The government responded with a palpably incomplete summary. The record is murky as to whether the government's partial response reflected the exercise of due diligence. The record is clear, however, that Rodriguez was not misled. The government informed him that its proffer was incomplete, stating in its transmittal letter that it \"had been informed that [he] had previously been convicted of a variety of felony offenses\" and that it would \"supplement [its] response when additional information is received.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step was up to Rodriguez. He could have awaited an encyclopedic response or moved to compel one. He chose neither course. Instead, he pursued plea negotiations, struck a final bargain, and changed his plea.

We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant who subscribes an unconditional guilty plea is deemed to have waived virtually all claims arising out of garden-variety errors that may have antedated the plea. <i>See United States v. Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d 697, 698-99 (1st Cir.1994) (collecting cases). Although there is an exception to this principle, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> at 699 (noting that jurisdictional issues are not waived), Rodriguez's case does not fit within its confines. He knowingly entered an unconditional guilty plea; advised the district court during the change-of-plea colloquy that he understood that his guilty plea \"waiv[ed][his] right to a trial and all the other rights\" associated therewith; and made no claim, then or now, that the sentencing court lacked authority to hear and determine his case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the pre-plea colloquy between the court and defense counsel was less than a model of clarity, and that colloquy may well have given Rodriguez hope that his CHC would remain at II. But such an interpretation would be unreasonable in light of the government's up-front notice of the distinct possibility that additional information about prior convictions might surface. Hope may, as the aphorist would have it, spring eternal, but the frustration of an expectation founded on hope alone, unanchored in objective reasonableness, is not a cognizable basis for relief on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of the matter. An unconditional guilty plea waives any and all independent non-jurisdictional claims arising out of alleged errors antedating the plea. Thus, Rodriguez waived his right to insist upon compliance with the provisions of former Rule 16(a)(1)(B) by his decision to plead guilty unconditionally without first having obtained, by a motion to compel or otherwise, his complete criminal record. He cannot now be heard to complain about the government's purported lapse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez's remaining assignment of error need not occupy us for long. He strives to persuade us that the district court erred in not departing downward from the GSR on the ground that his criminal history score (which placed him in CHC III) over-represented his criminal past. We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, a district court's discretionary decision not to depart from the GSR is unappealable. <i>See United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Jimenez-Otero,</i> 898 F.2d 813, 815 (1st Cir.1990). There are, however, a few isthmian exceptions to this rule. One exception springs into play when a sentencing court's decision not to depart from the GSR results from a misperception of its own authority. <i>See Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d at 619 (explaining that \"appellate jurisdiction may attach if it appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal authority to deviate from the guideline range or, relatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules governing departures\") (quoting <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 473 (1st Cir.1994)). The basis for the exception is that the sentencing court's determination that it lacked departure authority is not an exercise of discretion, but, rather, a legal judgment (and, thus, appealable as of right). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a)(2); <i>see also Jimenez-Otero,</i> 898 F.2d at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez relies upon this exception. He notes that the sentencing court commented, in colloquy, that it saw \"no way\" to go under the low end of the GSR obtained by the use of CHC III. Rodriguez suggests that this remark evinces the court's misperception that it lacked the power to depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suggestion rests on a porous foundation. It takes a bit of dialogue completely out of context. Rodriguez never made a request for a downward departure at the disposition hearing, and the court's comment did not refer to that possibility at all. Rather, the quoted statement was made in connection with the court's determination as to which CHC obtained (and, accordingly, which GSR applied). Consequently, the \"lack of authority\" exception is plainly inapplicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback, Rodriguez argues that he made the \"functional equivalent\" of a departure request. That argument fails. In the first place, the transcript of the disposition hearing reveals that nothing remotely resembling a departure request was made. The argument is, therefore, groundless. In the second place, the argument, even if well-founded, would sink under the weight of the aforementioned jurisdictional bar. <i>See Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d at 619.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez next asseverates that even in the absence of a departure request, the district court should have departed sua sponte. His starting point is uncontroversial: it cannot be gainsaid that a sentencing court has the authority to depart on its own volition. <i>See, e.g.,</i> USSG &#167; 4A1.3; <i>see generally Burns v. United States,</i> 501 U.S. 129, 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (describing procedure to be employed when district court essays a sua sponte departure under USSG &#167; 5K2.0). Nevertheless, the idea that a sentencing court's failure to depart sua sponte creates an appealable issue is a novel one. We find it unsurprising that Rodriguez cites to no case law supporting the notion. After all the decision to depart is typically an exercise of discretion and, absent a focused request by one of the parties, it would be surpassingly difficult to hold that the sentencing court abused its discretion in not departing. <i>Cf. United States v. Reveron Martinez,</i> 836 F.2d 684, 687 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that a district court has no duty sua sponte to consider a change of venue in a criminal case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From a conceptual standpoint, Rodriguez's asseveration is also unconvincing. Its chief flaw is that it runs contrary to our usual rule for preserving claims of error. Because the departure issue was not raised in the district court, analogous precedents suggest that we should simply hold it unpreserved for appeal. <i>See Malave v. Carney Hosp.,</i> 170 F.3d 217, 222 (1st Cir.1999) (discussing the \"bedrock rule of appellate practice that ... matters not raised in the trial court cannot be hawked for the first time on appeal\"); <i>see also United States v. LaGuardia,</i> 902 F.2d 1010, 1012-13 (1st Cir.1990) (stating, in a case where a departure had not been requested below, that the \"usual praxis\" would be \"to ignore [the issue] on appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware that one respected court has granted plain error review in an instance in which a defendant failed to preserve a departure argument for appeal. <i>See United States v. Draffin,</i> 286 F.3d 606, 609 (D.C.Cir.2002). We need not decide today the correctness of that approach. In the best of circumstances, \"[t]he plain error hurdle is high.\" <i>United States v. Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir.1989). To vault that hurdle, an appellant must make a fourfold showing: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). This case stumbles over each of the four elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that Rodriguez's argument for a departure is not very strong. The facts may not even be sufficient to support a discretionary departure; they surely are not sufficient to mandate one. We discern no error (let alone any obvious error) in the sentencing court's failure to depart downward. Finally, Rodriguez points to nothing that suggests that a downward departure is needed either to forestall a miscarriage of justice or to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system. We conclude, therefore, that Rodriguez's belated quest for a departure does not come close to satisfying the criteria established for plain error review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Compare <i>United States v. Belk,</i> 346 F.3d 305, 314 (2d Cir.2003), in which the court wrote that \"[t]o the extent that plain error forfeiture analysis under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) extends to a district court's failure to depart downwardly,\" it found \"no plain error in the District Court's failure sua sponte to consider and grant a vertical downward departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We hold that (i) Rodriguez's guilty plea effectively foreclosed his right to complain about any shortfall in the government's compliance with the strictures of former Rule 16(a)(1)(B), and (ii) his search for a downward departure is doomed by his failure to ask the sentencing court for one. For the sake of completeness, we add that even if the lower court's failure to depart sua sponte is reviewable for plain error &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Rodriguez's appeal would languish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Effective December 1, 2002, a new rule, redesignated as Rule 16(a)(1)(D), replaced former Rule 16(a)(1)(B).

Pierro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 619 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Jimenez-Otero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538475\"><a href=\"/opinion/538475/united-states-v-manuel-jimenez-otero/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 815 (1st Cir.1990). There are, however, a few isthmian exceptions to this rule. One exception springs into play when a sentencing court's decision not to depart from the GSR results from a misperception of its own authority. <i>See Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d at 619 (explaining that \"appellate jurisdiction may attach if it appears that the failure to depart stemmed from the sentencing court's mistaken impression that it lacked the legal authority to deviate from the guideline range or, relatedly, from the court's misapprehension of the rules governing departures\") (quoting <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 473 (1st Cir.1994)). The basis for the exception is that the sentencing court's determination that it lacked departure authority is not an exercise of discretion, but, rather, a legal judgment (and, thus, appealable as of right). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a)(2); <i>see also Jimenez-Otero,</i> 898 F.2d at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez relies upon this exception. He notes that the sentencing court commented, in colloquy, that it saw \"no way\" to go under the low end of the GSR obtained by the use of CHC III. Rodriguez suggests that this remark evinces the court's misperception that it lacked the power to depart.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suggestion rests on a porous foundation. It takes a bit of dialogue completely out of context. Rodriguez never made a request for a downward departure at the disposition hearing, and the court's comment did not refer to that possibility at all. Rather, the quoted statement was made in connection with the court's determination as to which CHC obtained (and, accordingly, which GSR applied). Consequently, the \"lack of authority\" exception is plainly inapplicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback, Rodriguez argues that he made the \"functional equivalent\" of a departure request. That argument fails. In the first place, the transcript of the disposition hearing reveals that nothing remotely resembling a departure request was made. The argument is, therefore, groundless. In the second place, the argument, even if well-founded, would sink under the weight of the aforementioned jurisdictional bar. <i>See Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d at 619.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez next asseverates that even in the absence of a departure request, the district court should have departed sua sponte. His starting point is uncontroversial: it cannot be gainsaid that a sentencing court has the authority to depart on its own volition. <i>See, e.g.,</i> USSG &#167; 4A1.3; <i>see generally Burns v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 138, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2182</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112620\"><a href=\"/opinion/112620/burns-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span> (1991) (describing procedure to be employed when district court essays a sua sponte departure under USSG &#167; 5K2.0). Nevertheless, the idea that a sentencing court's failure to depart sua sponte creates an appealable issue is a novel one. We find it unsurprising that Rodriguez cites to no case law supporting the notion. After all the decision to depart is typically an exercise of discretion and, absent a focused request by one of the parties, it would be surpassingly difficult to hold that the sentencing court abused its discretion in not departing. <i>Cf. United States v. Reveron Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499727\"><a href=\"/opinion/499727/united-states-v-luis-reveron-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 687 (1st Cir.1988) (holding that a district court has no duty sua sponte to consider a change of venue in a criminal case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From a conceptual standpoint, Rodriguez's asseveration is also unconvincing. Its chief flaw is that it runs contrary to our usual rule for preserving claims of error. Because the departure issue was not raised in the district court, analogous precedents suggest that we should simply hold it unpreserved for appeal. <i>See Malave v. Carney Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198366\"><a href=\"/opinion/198366/malave-v-carney-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1999) (discussing the \"bedrock rule of appellate practice that ... matters not raised in the trial court cannot be hawked for the first time on appeal\"); <i>see also United States v. LaGuardia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541060\"><a href=\"/opinion/541060/united-states-v-julio-la-guardia-united-states-of-america-v-eredia/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1012-13 (1st Cir.1990) (stating, in a case where a departure had not been requested below, that the \"usual praxis\" would be \"to ignore [the issue] on appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are aware that one respected court has granted plain error review in an instance in which a defendant failed to preserve a departure argument for appeal. <i>See United States v. Draffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185638\"><a href=\"/opinion/185638/united-states-v-draffin-donald-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 609 (D.C.Cir.2002). We need not decide today the correctness of that approach. In the best of circumstances, \"[t]he plain error hurdle is high.\" <i>United States v. Hunnewell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533778\"><a href=\"/opinion/533778/united-states-v-dale-scott-hunnewell/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir.1989). To vault that hurdle, an appellant must make a fourfold showing: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). This case stumbles over each of the four elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that Rodriguez's argument for a departure is not very strong. The facts may not even be sufficient to support a discretionary departure; they surely are not sufficient to mandate one. We discern no error (let alone any obvious error) in the sentencing court's failure to depart downward. Finally, Rodriguez points to nothing that suggests that a downward departure is needed either to forestall a miscarriage of justice or to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system. We conclude, therefore, that Rodriguez's belated quest for a departure does not come close to satisfying the criteria established for plain error review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Compare <i>United States v. Belk,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783827\"><a href=\"/opinion/783827/united-states-v-charles-belk/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 314 (2d Cir.2003), in which the court wrote that \"[t]o the extent that plain error forfeiture analysis under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) extends to a district court's failure to depart downwardly,\" it found \"no plain error in the District Court's failure sua sponte to consider and grant a vertical downward departure.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We hold that (i) Rodriguez's guilty plea effectively foreclosed his right to complain about any shortfall in the government's compliance with the strictures of former Rule 16(a)(1)(B), and (ii) his search for a downward departure is doomed by his failure to ask the sentencing court for one. For the sake of completeness, we add that even if the lower court's failure to depart sua sponte is reviewable for plain error &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; Rodriguez's appeal would languish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Effective December 1, 2002, a new rule, redesignated as Rule 16(a)(1)(D), replaced former Rule 16(a)(1)(B). The substance of the rule remains the same, but the wording has changed slightly (e.g., the new version states that \"the government must furnish\" certain information whereas the original version states that \"the government shall furnish\" such information).
