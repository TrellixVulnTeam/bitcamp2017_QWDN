Humphreys on brief for Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\nAmerica, American Council of the Blind, and National Educational\nand Legal Defense Services for the Blind, amici curiae.\n\n\n\n                          April 29, 2004\n\f            LYNCH,     Circuit      Judge.      The   district        court    entered\n\njudgment for the New Hampshire Committee of Blind Vendors and nine\n\nof its individual members (collectively, the Blind Vendors) and the\n\nUnited States Department of Education (USDOE), largely affirming a\n\nfederal     arbitration       panel     award    against      New     Hampshire      of\n\ncompensatory        damages    of     approximately        $900,000    as     well   as\n\nprospective equitable relief. The Blind Vendors' claim is that New\n\nHampshire did not give proper \"priority\" to blind vendors, as\n\nrequired by federal law, in running lucrative vending machine\n\noperations     in    rest     areas    along    federally      funded       interstate\n\nhighways.    New Hampshire gave others those concessions by contract\n\nin exchange for a percentage of the proceeds, which the state put\n\ninto the state treasury.              The district court characterized the\n\nstate's actions as \"stealing from the blind.\"\n\n            Several major issues are presented in this complex and\n\ndifficult case.       The threshold issue is whether New Hampshire, in\n\nlight of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, may be subject to either\n\nthe compensatory damages award or prospective equitable relief in\n\na federal forum.        The district court found the state waived any\n\nimmunity it may have had by its litigation conduct.                     We hold that\n\nthe   district      court     had   jurisdiction      to    affirm     an    award   of\n\nprospective equitable relief because the state waived any immunity\n\nto such relief in a federal forum (a) by its litigation conduct and\n\n(b) by judicial estoppel and its participation in the program\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\festablished by the Randolph-Sheppard Act (R-S Act), 20 U.S.C. § 107\n\net   seq.    Having   determined   that   Eleventh   Amendment    immunity\n\npresents no bar to prospective equitable relief here, we affirm\n\nsuch relief on the merits, finding that the state has not given\n\nproper \"priority\" to blind vendors as required by federal law and\n\nthat a conflicting state statute is preempted.\n\n            Our view of the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity from\n\ndamages is different.      We hold that the state has not waived\n\nimmunity from damages by its litigation conduct; we also conclude\n\nthat § 111(b) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STA\n\nAct),1 23 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq., under which the Blind Vendors seek\n\nrelief, does not clearly evidence an intent to subject states to\n\nsuch damages.    We vacate the damages award and order dismissal of\n\nthose claims.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            This case is shaped by two federal statutes.         The first\n\nis the Randolph-Sheppard Act, under which the federal government,\n\nin partnership with consenting states, seeks to provide economic\n\nopportunities to the blind by granting priority to licensed blind\n\nvendors in contracts to operate vending facilities on federal\n\nproperty.    20 U.S.C. § 107(a)-(b).        The Act, which was first\n\n\n      1\n          The STA Act was later renamed the Transportation Equity\nAct for the 21st Century.    Pub. L. No. 105-178, 112 Stat. 107\n(1998). The parties and papers in this case refer to the Act by\nboth names, but for clarity and convenience, this opinion will\nrefer to the Act as the STA Act.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fenacted in 1936, Pub. L. No. 74-732, 49 Stat. 1559 (1936), provides\n\nthat:\n\n       In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on\n       Federal property, priority shall be given to blind\n       persons licensed by a State agency as provided in this\n       chapter; and the Secretary, through the Commissioner,\n       shall, after consultation with the Administrator of\n       General Services and other heads of departments,\n       agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States in\n       control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of\n       Federal property, prescribe regulations designed to\n       assure that--\n\n            (1) the priority under this subsection is given to\n            such licensed blind persons (including assignment\n            of vending machine income pursuant to section 107d-\n            3 of this title to achieve and protect such\n            priority), and\n\n            (2) wherever feasible, one or more vending\n            facilities are established on all Federal property\n            to the extent that any such facility or facilities\n            would not adversely affect the interests of the\n            United States.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 107(b).\n\n            Under the R-S Act, participating states, such as New\n\nHampshire, can gain access to federal property to benefit their own\n\nblind vendors by having state agencies apply to the United States\n\nDepartment of Education to participate in and administer the\n\nprogram.    20 U.S.C. § 107b.      In their applications, those state\n\nagencies must agree to set up licensing programs for blind vendors,\n\nmatch them with available contracts for vending facilities on\n\nfederal property, and provide them with equipment and stock.                 Id.\n\nOnce    approved,   those   agencies   are   known    as    \"state     licensing\n\nagencies\"   (SLAs).     New   Hampshire's    SLA     is    the   New   Hampshire\n\n                                   -5-\n\fDepartment of Education, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation,\n\nBureau of Blind Services.\n\n          We quote a succinct description of the operation of the\n\nR-S Act set forth by a sister circuit:\n\n          The Randolph-Sheppard Act was enacted in order to\n     provide employment opportunities for the blind. The Act\n     grants priority to those blind persons who desire to\n     operate vending facilities on federal property.        20\n     U.S.C. § 107(b). The Act divides responsibility for the\n     blind vendor program between the state and federal\n     agencies. The Secretary of Education is responsible for\n     interpreting and enforcing the Act's provisions, and more\n     specifically, for designating state licensing agencies.\n     20 U.S.C. §§ 107a(a)(5), 107b; 34 C.F.R. §§ 395.5, 395.8.\n     A person seeking a position as a blind vendor applies to\n     the designated state agency and is licensed by that\n     agency. The state agency in turn applies to the federal\n     government for the placement of the licensee on federal\n     property.   20 U.S.C. § 107b.    Once the state and the\n     federal government have agreed on an appropriate location\n     for the vending facility, the state licensing agency is\n     responsible for equipping the facility and furnishing the\n     initial stock and inventory. 20 U.S.C. § 107b(2). The\n     blind vendor thereafter operates as a sole proprietor who\n     is entitled to the profits of the vending facility and\n     who is responsible for the facility's losses.\n          The Act requires that if the state licensing agency\n     operates vending machines that directly compete with a\n     vending facility operated by a blind vendor, then a\n     percentage of the income from such competing machines\n     must be given to the blind vendor licensed to do business\n     on that property. 20 U.S.C. § 107d-3. If no licensee is\n     operating a facility on the property, the income from\n     state-operated vending machines is used for a variety of\n     purposes that benefit all blind vendors in the state\n     program. 20 U.S.C. 107d-3(c).\n\nTenn. Dep't of Human Servs. v. United States Dep't of Educ., 979\n\nF.2d 1162, 1163-64 (6th Cir. 1992).\n\n          States'   participation   in   the   program   is   voluntary.\n\nStates choose whether they wish to have their agencies apply to\n\n                                -6-\n\fadminister    the   program   under    the   R-S   Act   and   take   on   the\n\ncorresponding obligations.      See 20 U.S.C. § 107b.          The principal\n\nbenefit that a state receives for participating in the program is\n\nan opportunity to improve the lot of its blind population.                   A\n\nparticipating state also receives funds.           For example, even if no\n\nblind vendor operates vending facilities on a particular federal\n\nproperty, the relevant SLA receives income from vending machines on\n\nthat property; these proceeds can be used to fund retirement,\n\nhealth insurance, sick leave, and vacation time for blind vendors\n\nand to defray various costs associated with running the program.\n\n20 U.S.C. §§ 107d-3(a), (c).\n\n             SLAs also agree to a three-step process (\"R-S grievance\n\nprocedures\") for dealing with blind licensees who are dissatisfied\n\nwith the operation of the vending program: first, a hearing at the\n\nstate level before the SLA; then, an opportunity to appeal in an\n\narbitration before a USDOE panel; and finally, judicial review of\n\nthe arbitration panel's decision in the federal courts under the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701.2            At the first\n\nstage, the SLA agrees:\n\n      to provide to any blind licensee dissatisfied with any\n      action arising from the operation or administration of\n      the vending facility program an opportunity for a fair\n      hearing, and . . . to submit the grievances of any blind\n      licensee not otherwise resolved by such hearing to\n      arbitration [before the USDOE].\n\n20   U.S.C.    §   107b(6).   After    the   hearing   before   the   SLA,   a\n\ndissatisfied blind licensee may go to arbitration before a panel\n\nconvened by the federal Secretary of Education, under 20 U.S.C. §\n\n107d-2(b)(1). The procedures used by the panel are governed by the\n\nAPA, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.      20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a).         The decision\n\nof the panel is \"subject to appeal and review as a final agency\n\naction\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701, in a federal district court.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a).\n\n\n      2\n              We quote again from Tenn. Dep't of Human Servs.:\n\n      In order to resolve disputes arising under the Act, both\n      administrative and judicial remedies are available for\n      licensed blind vendors. The Secretary of Education may\n      decertify a state licensing agency that refuses to\n      cooperate with the Secretary. 34 C.F.R. § 395.17. In\n      all other situations, the Secretary must rely on a blind\n      vendor to file a complaint in order to enforce the Act's\n      substantive provisions.     If a blind vendor has a\n      complaint regarding the state's operation of the program,\n      he or she may request an evidentiary hearing before the\n      state licensing agency and, if dissatisfied with the\n      outcome of the hearing, may ask the Secretary to convene\n      an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute. 20 U.S.C.\n      §§ 107d-1(a), 107d-2(b)(1).      An arbitration panel's\n      decision is subject to review as a final agency action.\n      20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a).\n\n979 F.2d at 1164.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           The R-S Act says nothing about what relief can be granted\n\nat any of the three levels when the grievance is initiated by a\n\nblind licensee, as here. It does specify, however, the relief that\n\ncan be granted when the grievance is initiated by an SLA.3             SLAs\n\nmay file complaints that a federal agency is violating the Act.         20\n\nU.S.C. § 107d-1(b).      In that situation, upon a finding by the panel\n\nthat \"acts or practices of any such . . . agency are in violation\n\nof [the R-S] Act, or any regulation issued thereunder,\" the head of\n\nthe offending agency \"shall cause such acts or practices to be\n\nterminated promptly and shall take such other action as may be\n\nnecessary to carry out the decision of the panel.\"            20 U.S.C. §\n\n107d-2(b)(2).    The statute does not expressly authorize the award\n\nof damages.\n\n           The   other    federal   statute   involved   is   the   Surface\n\nTransportation Assistance Act.         The STA Act seeks to increase\n\nconstruction and safety on the interstate and national highway\n\nsystems.   23 U.S.C. §§ 101(b), 103.          Most states receive large\n\namounts of federal funding under the Act; New Hampshire received\n\n\n     3\n           As one court has noted, § 107d-1 of the R-S Act\n\n     sets out a dual scheme of remedies. Subsection (a) gives the\n     blind licensee a direct action against the state licensing\n     agency.   Subsection (b), however, gives the blind licensee\n     nothing; rather, it gives the state agency authority to bring\n     a complaint against a federal entity controlling property on\n     which vending facilities are located.\n\nGa. Dep't of Human Res. v. Nash, 915 F.2d 1482, 1490 (11th Cir.\n1990).\n\n                                    -9-\n\fabout $141 million in 2002.   See U.S. Census Bureau, Federal Aid to\n\nStates for Fiscal Year 2002, at 17 tbl. 1 (2003).\n\n          Under the STA Act, a state cannot accept federal highway\n\nfunds without entering into an agreement with the Secretary of\n\nTransportation.   23 U.S.C. §§ 106, 110.       Included in such an\n\nagreement is the promise to comply with the terms and conditions\n\nset forth in Title 23.   23 C.F.R. § 630.112(a).    Title 23, in turn,\n\nsets forth a priority system for vending machines.       Historically,\n\nunder the STA Act, states accepting federal aid for construction\n\nprojects on the interstate system had to agree not to construct\n\n\"commercial establishments for serving motor vehicle users\" along\n\nthe rights-of-way of the interstate system.        23 U.S.C. § 111(a).\n\nIn 1983, Congress amended the Act to add 23 U.S.C. § 111(b), which\n\ncreates an exception to this general prohibition and sets forth a\n\npriority system for vending machines:\n\n     [A]ny State may permit the placement of vending machines\n     in rest and recreation areas, and in safety rest areas,\n     constructed or located on rights-of-way of the Interstate\n     System in such State. Such vending machines may only\n     dispense such food, drink, and other articles as the\n     State    transportation    department   determines    are\n     appropriate and desirable.     Such vending machines may\n     only be operated by the State.        In permitting the\n     placement of vending machines, the State shall give\n     priority to vending machines which are operated through\n     the State licensing agency designated pursuant to section\n     2(a)(5) of the Act of June 20, 1936, commonly known as\n     the 'Randolph-Sheppard Act' (20 U.S.C. 107a(a)(5)). The\n     costs of installation, operation, and maintenance of\n     vending machines shall not be eligible for Federal\n     assistance under this title.\n\n§ 111(b); Pub. L. No. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2097, 2106 (1983).\n\n                                -10-\n\f              The STA Act, however, does not expressly state how\n\ndisputes concerning the \"priority\" created in § 111(b) should be\n\nresolved.      In general, authority to enforce the STA Act has been\n\ndelegated to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),\n\nsee 23 U.S.C. § 315, whose regulations state:\n\n      If the [Federal Highway] Administrator determines that a\n      State has violated or failed to comply with the Federal\n      laws or the regulations in this part with respect to a\n      project, he may withhold payment to the State of Federal\n      funds on account of such project, withhold approval of\n      further projects in the State, and take such other action\n      that he deems appropriate under the circumstances, until\n      compliance or remedial action has been accomplished by\n      the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator.\n\n23 C.F.R. § 1.36.        Some provisions of the STA Act contain more\n\nspecific enforcement procedures, see, e.g., 23 U.S.C. §§ 116(c),\n\n131(b), 133(e), but § 111 does not.          The STA Act does not contain\n\na general suit mechanism or a provision requiring states to waive\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\n              In 1985, two years after the STA Act was amended to add\n\n§   111(b),    New   Hampshire   passed    legislation   to   place   vending\n\nmachines in rest areas along state turnpikes and the interstate\n\nhighway system.      N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 230:30-a, 229:3.         The New\n\nHampshire Department of Administrative Services (NHDAS) was put in\n\ncharge of administering the vending contracts.                NHDAS selected\n\nvendors through a competitive bidding process open to all.                See\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 21-I:11; N.H. Code Admin. R. Adm. 603.06.\n\nIts policy was generally to award the contract to the bidder\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f\"offering    the   highest   rate   of   return   to   the   State   of   New\n\nHampshire,\" as long as that bidder satisfied basic requirements\n\nlike the ability to meet the contract specifications and to post a\n\nperformance bond.    If two or more of the high bids were identical,\n\nthe contract would generally be awarded by \"drawn lot.\"                   The\n\nexception to this general rule was that if one of the high bidders\n\nwas the Bureau of Blind Services (the New Hampshire SLA), the\n\ncontract would be awarded to the Bureau (the Tie Rule).\n\n            Since the passage of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a,\n\nNHDAS has invited bids for vending machine contracts on five\n\noccasions for rest areas along rights-of-way of the interstate\n\nhighway system: (1) in 1988 for rest areas in Hooksett on I-93; (2)\n\nin 1991 for rest areas in Seabrook on I-95, Salem on I-93, and\n\nSpringfield on I-89; (3) in 1997 for rest areas in Lebanon on I-89,\n\nCanterbury on I-93, Sanbornton on I-93, and Sutton on I-89; (4) in\n\n1999 for those same rest areas when the 1997 contract had expired;\n\nand (5) in 2001 for the same Hooksett rest areas.            All of the rest\n\nareas in question are owned by the state of New Hampshire.                The\n\nHooksett rest areas are on toll roads and have been constructed and\n\nmaintained without federal aid.            The Seabrook rest areas were\n\nconstructed with federal aid, but are on the state turnpike system\n\nand are maintained through state funds.           In the first four bid\n\nopportunities, NHDAS followed its standard procedure as described\n\nabove.      The SLA did not bid on the 1988 and 1991 contracts,\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fapparently     because     both    contracts     contained      specifications\n\nrequiring    the    construction    of   shelters    to   house   the   vending\n\nmachines and the SLA is precluded from making capital expenditures\n\nunder state law.     The Bureau did bid on the 1997 and 1999 contracts\n\nbut lost to higher bidders in both instances.             In 2001, after this\n\nlitigation had begun, NHDAS departed from its standard policy.\n\nInstead of asking the SLA to submit a bid as the other contractors\n\ndid, NHDAS had the other contractors bid first and then offered the\n\nBureau the contract on the same terms as the high bid (the Match\n\nRule).    After consulting with the New Hampshire Committee of Blind\n\nVendors, the SLA turned down the offer, stating that it preferred\n\nto await clarification of its priority right in this action.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.    First Federal Court Action\n\n             On January 6, 1998, the Blind Vendors4 brought suit under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1331, alleging that the state had violated the STA Act,\n\n23 U.S.C. § 111(b), by awarding vending contracts without giving\n\npriority to machines operated through the SLA. The named defendant\n\nwas   the   state    of   New   Hampshire,     through    its   Department   of\n\nAdministrative      Services.      The   complaint   sought     an   injunction\n\nvoiding all existing vending machine contracts and requiring the\n\n\n\n      4\n          At this stage, the suit was brought only by the New\nHampshire Committee of Blind Vendors; the nine individual members\nhad not yet joined. For clarity and convenience, however, we refer\nto the Committee alone as the Blind Vendors.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fstate to grant the right to operate those vending machines to\n\nlicensed blind   vendors,   along   with   \"such   other   relief    as   is\n\nequitable and just.\"     The complaint did not seek damages for the\n\nalleged prior violations.\n\n          The state defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that\n\nthe court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Blind\n\nVendors had \"failed to exhaust\" their administrative remedies\n\nbefore filing their judicial action, as required by 20 U.S.C. §\n\n107d-1 of the R-S Act.   The motion also stated that \"[i]f the court\n\ndoes not dismiss this action, this court should abstain from\n\naccepting jurisdiction over this action,\" citing Colorado River\n\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976).\n\nThe state said that the Blind Vendors had simultaneously filed an\n\naction in the New Hampshire state courts and that the federal court\n\nshould defer to the state court.     As best we can tell, the state\n\ncourt action also invoked the STA Act and sought damages.\n\n          The state's motion in federal court did not seek to\n\ndismiss the action based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.            Nor did\n\nit seek dismissal on the ground that the state was not a proper\n\nparty or that no cause of action was stated.\n\n          In the supporting memorandum, the state also did not\n\nargue that the case was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.                 The\n\nstate did argue that the Blind Vendors' claim arose under the R-S\n\nAct because § 111(b) of the STA Act incorporated the R-S Act by\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\freferring to a priority for vending machines operated through \"the\n\nState licensing agency designated pursuant to\" the R-S Act.      The\n\nstate contended that R-S grievance procedures were available and\n\nhad to be exhausted.   Inherent in its argument was the assertion\n\nthat a claim under the STA Act could not be brought before the\n\nexhaustion of grievance procedures under the R-S Act.    The state\n\nqualified this argument in a footnote, stating that\n\n     Defendant does not agree that the Randolph-Sheppard Act\n     in general applies to the facts of this case nor that, to\n     the extent that it does apply, that it gives Petitioner\n     the rights claimed. However, for purposes of this Motion\n     to Dismiss only, it is assumed that Petitioner's\n     allegation that the Randolph-Sheppard Act applies will be\n     accepted as true.\n\n          In support of the abstention request, should the court\n\nnot dismiss the action, the state argued that the entire dispute\n\n(both damages and injunctive relief) would be more readily resolved\n\nin the pending state court action, noting:\n\n     Plaintiff's   state  and   federal   suits  were   filed\n     essentially at the same time and both are at very early\n     stages. Thus, the forums' order of jurisdiction is not\n     a factor. Finally, the parallel state-court proceeding\n     would be the better vehicle for the complete and prompt\n     resolution of the issues between the parties.        See\n     Elmendorf, 48 F.2d at 50. Part of the relief which the\n     Plaintiff seeks is termination of contractual rights\n     between the State and third parties. The State has not\n     and does not waive its immunity to suit in federal court\n     under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States\n     Constitution in regards to suits involving contractual\n     rights. Therefore, only in the state court action can\n     all of the issues raised by this pleading be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f(emphasis added).      Thus, the state conceded that even if the claim\n\ncould not go forward in federal court, the state court proceeding\n\ncould go forward.\n\n          The Blind Vendors opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that their claims arose under the STA Act rather than\n\nthe R-S Act, that R-S grievance procedures therefore did not apply,\n\nand that the STA Act itself had no grievance procedures to be\n\nexhausted.     The Blind Vendors also argued that abstention was\n\nimproper, as they sought only prospective injunctive relief, while\n\nthe state court action did not seek any equitable relief.5                 The\n\nstate did not file a reply.\n\n             The federal court issued an order and judgment on March\n\n17, 1998, dismissing the complaint without prejudice, finding that\n\nthe Blind Vendors had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\nThe   court    accepted   the    state's    argument    that   the   STA   Act\n\nincorporated the R-S Act's administrative procedures, and relied\n\nprincipally on the statutory text of the R-S Act, which states that\n\nR-S grievance procedures apply to \"[a]ny blind licensee who is\n\ndissatisfied    with    any   action   arising   from    the   operation   or\n\nadministration of the vending facility program.\" 20 U.S.C. § 107d-\n\n1(a) (emphasis added).          The court found that the term \"vending\n\nfacility program\" included the program under § 111(b) of the STA\n\n\n      5\n          The Blind Vendors noted that the state was free to ask\nthat any damages claim in state court be combined with the\nequitable claim in federal court, if it wanted all issues combined.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fAct.       The court also addressed in a footnote what it understood to\n\nbe the state's reference to the Eleventh Amendment:\n\n       Parenthetically, the court notes that the State also\n       claims that the Eleventh Amendment precludes any award of\n       monetary damages. At a minimum, that issue is open to\n       debate.\n\nB.     State Administrative Hearing\n\n               By   letter   dated    March    30,    1998,   the   Blind   Vendors6\n\nrequested a state administrative hearing before the SLA under the\n\nfirst stage of R-S grievance procedures.               The Blind Vendors sought\n\ninjunctive relief, \"challeng[ing] the right of the State to grant\n\nany vending contracts on Interstate Highways to anyone but licensed\n\nblind       vendors,    unless       blind    vendors      consent     to   another\n\narrangement.\" Significantly, the Blind Vendors also, for the first\n\ntime pertinent to the case before us, sought money damages in the\n\nform of commissions paid to the state since the inception of the\n\nSTA Act as well as for lost profits.             New Hampshire does not claim\n\nthat it asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity before the state\n\nHearing Officer, and our review of the record reveals no such claim\n\nof   immunity.         (Of   course,    this    was    a   state     administrative\n\nproceeding, albeit one required under a federal statute in an\n\nagreement with the state.) Instead, the state moved to dismiss the\n\nproceedings before the SLA on the basis that:\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          At this point, the Committee was joined by nine of its\nindividual members.\n\n                                        -17-\n\f     (1) the rest areas at issue are on state, not federal,\n     property and so are not subject to the R-S Act;\n\n     (2) the plaintiffs' claims arise under provisions of the R-S\n     Act that are not incorporated into the STA Act;\n\n     (3) any priority required by 20 U.S.C. § 111 has in fact been\n     provided;\n\n     (4) even assuming the plaintiffs had any rights under the R-S\n     Act, the statute does not authorize the state Hearing Officer\n     to terminate an existing concession agreement or to award\n     relief.\n\n          The state Hearing Officer granted the state's motion to\n\ndismiss on July 3, 1998, saying:\n\n     Because the State has presented credible and unrebutted\n     evidence that the 'rest areas' in issue are located on\n     State land, and because the Federal statutes [i.e., the\n     R-S Act and STA Act] can reasonably be read [to] require\n     the requested State agency 'priority' apply only to\n     accommodate such an application to a vending machine rest\n     area on 'Federal' land, there is no factual issue that\n     will reasonably permit the Committee of Blind Vendors to\n     prevail on these facts.       Therefore, the matter is\n     dismissed.7\n\nThe Blind Vendors moved for reconsideration.     They did not dispute\n\nthat the R-S Act applies only to federal land, but argued that §\n\n111(b), unlike the R-S Act, clearly applies to rest areas on both\n\nstate and federal land.   The state responded by arguing that if the\n\nR-S Act does not apply to these rest areas, the Hearing Officer had\n\nno jurisdiction to issue relief.       The Hearing Officer denied the\n\n\n\n     7\n          The Hearing Officer's ruling that § 111(b) applies only\non federal land is puzzling.    The state never contested that §\n111(b) applied to state-owned rest areas; it argued only that the\nR-S Act did not apply to such rest areas and that the priority\nrequired by § 111(b) was provided here.\n\n                                -18-\n\fmotion on July 23, 1998, reiterating its position that neither §\n\n111(b) nor the R-S Act applies to state-owned land.\n\nC.   Proceedings Before Federal Arbitration Panel\n\n            In October 1998, the Blind Vendors appealed the state\n\nHearing Officer's decision, as authorized under 20 U.S.C. § 107d-\n\n1(a), by filing a letter of complaint with the federal Secretary of\n\nEducation against the SLA. In the letter, the Blind Vendors sought\n\n(1) recognition that the priority provisions of § 111(b) apply to\n\nstate-owned rest areas off of the interstate highway system, (2)\n\nrecognition that New Hampshire's competitive bidding process under\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a violates § 111(b) by failing to\n\nprovide    priority,   (3)   permission      to    interfere   with   existing\n\ncontracts to provide blind vendors a priority to operate vending\n\nmachines at New Hampshire rest areas, and (4) money damages in the\n\nform of all commissions paid to the state since the inception of\n\nthe STA Act, as well as lost profits.             The Secretary, as required\n\nby 20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a), convened an arbitration panel to hear the\n\ncase.\n\n            By letter dated October 28, 1998, the state8 moved to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction, but not on Eleventh Amendment\n\ngrounds.      The   state    argued    principally      that   R-S    grievance\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          At this stage, the SLA, rather than the state itself, was\nthe respondent, but we refer to the SLA as \"the state\" for clarity\nand convenience.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fprocedures did not apply to the Blind Vendors' complaint because\n\nthe claims arose under the STA Act, not the R-S Act.\n\n          Later, sometime between January and March of 2000, the\n\nstate filed an undated memorandum that included a challenge to the\n\npanel's jurisdiction on the ground that \"[a]bsent a clear intent of\n\nthe Congress to waive a State's sovereign immunity under the\n\nEleventh Amendment, the Constitution does not provide for federal\n\njurisdiction over disputes against states by federal court or by\n\nextension a federally appointed arbitration panel.\"    Because the\n\nSTA Act expressed no such intent, the state argued, there was no\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          This argument that no relief was available in a federal\n\nforum was raised more than two years into the controversy.    This\n\nmarks the first occasion that we have found in which the state\n\nargued that the Eleventh Amendment precluded application of the STA\n\nAct or the R-S Act to grant any form of relief.        The state's\n\nmemorandum cited Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000),\n\nwhich was decided on January 11, 2000.   Perhaps reading Kimel is\n\nwhat prompted the state to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity for\n\nthe first time.   We note, though, that as far back as 1973, the\n\nstate of New Hampshire has raised the issue of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity from suit under federal statutes.   See Carver v. Hooker,\n\n369 F. Supp. 204, 216 (D.N.H. 1973) (discussing Eleventh Amendment\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fimmunity of state official from suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\n\nother federal statutes).\n\n          The Blind Vendors also filed a memorandum on jurisdiction\n\non March 3, 2000.   It is unclear whether this memorandum was filed\n\nin reply to or simultaneously with the state's memorandum.           In any\n\nevent, the Blind Vendors' memorandum did not respond to the new\n\nEleventh Amendment argument.\n\n          At a hearing before the arbitration panel on March 10,\n\nduring which the parties engaged in extensive oral argument, the\n\nstate made no mention of Eleventh Amendment immunity.         Nor did the\n\nstate mention Eleventh Amendment immunity in the requested rulings\n\nof law that it submitted to the arbitration panel.\n\n          On June 12, 2000, the arbitration panel rejected the\n\nstate's jurisdictional challenge, finding that Congress intended R-\n\nS grievance procedures to apply to disputes over priority under §\n\n111(b).   The   panel   made   no   mention   of   the   state's   Eleventh\n\nAmendment argument.     There was a dissenting opinion, which argued\n\nthat the complaint should be dismissed because the STA Act does not\n\nemploy R-S grievance procedures; that opinion did not address the\n\nEleventh Amendment issue either.           The state did not press its\n\nEleventh Amendment argument, nor did it go to federal court to\n\nenjoin the R-S grievance procedures on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n\n          In a separate order issued on July 11, 2001, the panel\n\nruled against the state on the merits.        The most pertinent of the\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fpanel's rulings of law and findings of fact can be found in the\n\nappendix to this opinion.     Principally, the panel held that the\n\npriority provisions of § 111(b) required that SLAs be given a\n\n\"right of first refusal.\"    The panel found that this meant that the\n\nSLA had to \"receive an opportunity to operate vending machines\n\nbefore any private vendor is even pursued\" (emphasis original), and\n\nthat the SLA \"must waive its right to a priority in writing before\n\n[the state] approaches any other entity.\"     It held that N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 230:30-a, which it found to adopt a conflicting\n\npriority policy, was preempted.\n\n          The panel also awarded what it termed \"prospective[]\"\n\ndamages in the amount of all commissions received from the disputed\n\nrest areas after October 28, 1998 (when the panel determined that\n\nthe Blind Vendors had filed their complaint with the USDOE) and\n\nordered that these amounts be paid to the SLA for appropriate uses\n\nto benefit blind vendors.      The panel denied the Blind Vendors'\n\nclaim for attorneys' fees.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          On September 13, 2001, the New Hampshire Department of\n\nEducation, NHDAS, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation,\n\nand the State Treasurer filed two suits in federal district court\n\nagainst the USDOE and the Blind Vendors, seeking review of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fpanel decision under 20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a).9                The Blind Vendors\n\nfiled    counterclaims    in     both   suits,    seeking    confirmation     and\n\nenforcement of the panel's decision, an award of attorneys' fees,\n\nand a modification to the panel's damages award to calculate\n\ndamages from 1985, when N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a was\n\nenacted, or in the alternative, from January 6, 1998, when the\n\nBlind    Vendors   had   first    brought      suit.   The    two    suits   were\n\nconsolidated with the assent of the state agencies.                 On motion of\n\nthe Blind Vendors, and over the objection of the state agencies,\n\nthe district court then dismissed all of the state agencies except\n\nfor the state Department of Education, on the ground that the\n\nagencies, as members of the executive branch, were barred from\n\ntaking positions independent or contrary to one another.\n\n            In response, the state Department of Education, now the\n\nonly remaining state agency in the case, moved to substitute the\n\nstate of New Hampshire as the real party in interest.                         New\n\nHampshire supported the motion, asserting that it was the \"proper\n\nreal party in interest.\"          The state does not now and has never\n\nargued that it is not a properly named party.                 Nor has it ever\n\nargued that state officers, not state agencies, were the only\n\nproper parties before the court or that prospective equitable\n\nrelief could be awarded only against state officers.\n\n\n     9\n          One suit was brought by the New Hampshire Department of\nEducation, while the other was brought by NHDAS, the New Hampshire\nDepartment of Transportation, and the State Treasurer.\n\n                                        -23-\n\f             Both sides filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The\n\nstate     asserted   Eleventh        Amendment    immunity         against   both     the\n\narbitration panel proceeding and any suit in federal court or\n\nelsewhere based on 23 U.S.C. § 111(b).                 On the merits, the state\n\nfurther    argued    that     N.H.    Rev.    Stat.    Ann.    §    230:30-a     is   not\n\npreempted     because    the    NHDAS        policy    is    consistent      with     the\n\n\"priority\" required by § 111(b).               Finally, the state argued that\n\nthe damages calculation should have excluded commissions from rest\n\nareas     where   the   SLA    could    not     meet    the    necessary        contract\n\nspecifications and should be further reduced to account for the\n\ncapital and maintenance costs incurred by the state to build\n\nvending machine shelters.10              The state          abandoned a number of\n\narguments it had made earlier.\n\n             The Blind Vendors contended that the state waived its\n\nEleventh     Amendment      immunity    by     participating         in   the    program\n\nestablished by the R-S Act and by appealing the arbitration panel's\n\ndecision to federal court.            They further argued that the panel's\n\ninterpretation of \"priority\" under § 111(b) was proper, based on\n\n\n\n     10\n          In addition, the state argued that 23 U.S.C. § 111(b)\nviolates the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments because, the state said, there is no rational\nbasis for granting priority to blind vendors. The state further\nargued that the damages award exceeded the arbitration panel's\nstatutory authority because the rest areas were all on state-owned\nland and at least one rest area had been built and maintained\nentirely with state funds.      The district court rejected both\narguments, and the state has raised neither on appeal, so we do not\naddress them.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fsimilar use of the term \"priority\" in the R-S Act.          Finally, they\n\nargued that the arbitration panel did not award them sufficient\n\ndamages: the amount of damages should have been calculated from\n\nJanuary 6, 1998 rather than October 28, 1998.\n\n           The district court granted in part and denied in part\n\nboth motions for summary judgment.      The court largely affirmed the\n\narbitration panel's order, modifying only the amount of the damages\n\nawarded.    The court held that the state had waived its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity by its litigation conduct, due to (a) the\n\nstate's failure to raise its Eleventh Amendment immunity in the\n\n1998 federal court litigation and in the initial stages of the\n\nadministrative process, (b) the state's argument in its 1998 motion\n\nto dismiss that R-S grievance procedures should apply, and (c) the\n\nstate's    invocation   of   federal    jurisdiction   to    review   the\n\narbitration panel's order.      Proceeding to the merits, the court\n\nconcluded that the arbitration panel's construction of \"priority\"\n\nin § 111(b) was entitled to deference, see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984), and that\n\nthe panel's construction was a reasonable one within the scope of\n\nits discretion.    Finally, the court modified the damages award,\n\nreducing it to compensate the state for the capital and maintenance\n\ncosts of building vending machine shelters at several rest areas\n\nand moving the start date for damages from October 28, 1998 to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fMarch 30, 1998, the date on which the Blind Vendors first requested\n\na state administrative hearing.     The state timely appealed.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n            The state argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars \"the\n\nUSDOE Arbitration Panel proceeding, any suit for damages in federal\n\ncourt and any suit in state court based on the STA [Act].\"\n\n            A state's immunity under the Eleventh Amendment applies\n\nwhether a private plaintiff's suit is for monetary damages or some\n\nother type of relief.

State\n\nPorts Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 766 (2002).\n\n            The state asserts Eleventh Amendment immunity from both\n\nthe arbitration panel proceedings and the federal court action.\n\nSee generally id.; R.I.

See generally\n\nKimel, 528 U.S. at 74-91; Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999).     The\n\nissue is whether the state has waived any immunity that it may\n\nhave.     Our review as to this issue is de novo.       Arecibo Cmty.\n\nHealth Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            A state can waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit\n\nin three ways: (1) by a clear declaration that it intends to submit\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fitself to the jurisdiction of a federal court or administrative\n\nproceeding, Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ.\n\nExpense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 676 (1999); Great N. Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nRead, 322 U.S. 47, 54 (1944); (2) by consent to or participation in\n\na federal program for which waiver of immunity is an express\n\ncondition, Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 246-47\n\n(1985); or (3) by affirmative conduct in litigation, Lapides v. Bd.\n\nof Regents, 535 U.S. 613, 620 (2002); Gardner v. New Jersey, 329\n\nU.S. 565, 574 (1947).\n\n          The   state   here   invokes   two    independent      aspects   of\n\nimmunity from suit: immunity from suit in a federal forum (judicial\n\nor administrative) and substantive immunity from liability.                See\n\nJonathan R. Siegel, Waivers of State Sovereign Immunity and the\n\nIdeology of the Eleventh Amendment, 52 Duke L.J. 1167, 1192-93\n\n(2003);   Carlos   Manuel   Vazquez,     What    Is   Eleventh    Amendment\n\nImmunity?, 106 Yale L.J. 1683, 1697-98 (1997).         In fact, this case\n\ninvolves two different aspects of a state's substantive liability\n\nimmunity from suits by private persons: immunity from damages and\n\nimmunity from prospective equitable relief. Certainly, a state may\n\nwaive its immunity from substantive liability without waiving its\n\nimmunity from suit in a federal forum.          See Coll. Sav. Bank, 527\n\nU.S. at 676; Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 241.         The Supreme Court thus\n\nfar has not addressed whether a state may waive federal forum\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fimmunity without waiving substantive liability immunity under the\n\nEleventh Amendment.   We assume arguendo that a state may do so.\n\nA.   Waiver of Eleventh Amendment     Immunity    Against   Suit   for\n     Prospective Equitable Relief\n\n     1.   Waiver by Litigation Conduct\n\n          The state argues that no prospective equitable relief may\n\nbe granted at all in either state or federal court against it for\n\nviolations of the federal statutes at issue.     The state certainly\n\nnever argued to the district court in 1998 that such relief was not\n\navailable or that the Eleventh Amendment barred suit or any relief\n\nagainst it.\n\n          We conclude that the state has waived by its litigation\n\nconduct any Eleventh Amendment immunity that it may have from\n\nfederal proceedings (forum immunity) and from prospective equitable\n\nrelief (substantive liability immunity).11   When the state moved in\n\n1998 to dismiss the federal court action, it did not assert that\n\nCongress lacked the power or intent to submit the state to federal\n\njurisdiction under the STA Act or the R-S Act for prospective\n\nequitable relief. When the state mentioned the Eleventh Amendment,\n\nit was only to say that there would be no Eleventh Amendment issues\n\nas to claims in a state court proceeding in which damages were\n\n\n\n     11\n          The state does not contend that its counsel lacked\nauthority under state law to waive immunity. That consideration\nhas not survived Lapides in cases such as this, where a state\nvoluntarily invokes federal jurisdiction. See Lapides v. Bd. of\nRegents, 535 U.S. 613, 621-22 (2002).\n\n                               -28-\n\fsought. The fact that the state focused only on Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity        to    damages       and   simultaneously       agreed   to   a    federal\n\nadministrative forum reinforces our view that the state by its\n\nconduct has waived its current objection to prospective equitable\n\nrelief in a federal forum.                 This case goes well beyond a simple\n\nmatter     of    failure       to    raise   an     immunity    argument     in   earlier\n\nproceedings.\n\n                The concept of waiver by litigation conduct is related to\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel.                   Here, the state's failure to\n\nraise Eleventh Amendment immunity was accompanied by an affirmative\n\nassertion that the STA Act incorporates R-S grievance procedures\n\n(with its concomitant process of judicial review) and that those\n\nprocedures must be exhausted before claims could be pursued under\n\nthe STA Act.12           The plaintiffs did not assert that the R-S Act\n\napplied; it was the state that made that argument, and the state\n\nis,   as    a        result,    judicially        estopped.      See    Cadle     Co.    v.\n\nSchlictmann, Conway, Crowley & Hugo, 338 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); Beddall v. State Street Bank and Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).               The state then acted consistently with its\n\nassertion, participated in the grievance procedures, and in doing\n\nso advantaged itself to the detriment of the Blind Vendors.                             The\n\n\n\n      12\n          It is true that in the 1998 federal court filing seeking\ndismissal on exhaustion grounds, the state defendants reserved the\nquestion whether the facts of the case brought it within the\nstatutory reach of the R-S Act. That is a very different argument.\n\n                                             -29-\n\fdistrict court relied on the position articulated by the state in\n\ndismissing the Blind Vendors' initial federal court action in March\n\nof 1998.\n\n           Attempting now to be excused, the state argues that in\n\n1998 it never suggested to the federal court that the STA Act\n\nincorporated the R-S Act procedures and that the action must be\n\ndismissed for failure to exhaust.     Based on a footnote in its\n\nmemorandum to the district court in 1998, the state says that its\n\nargument was, at most, that if plaintiffs were basing their claim\n\non rights under the R-S Act, then R-S grievance procedures applied.\n\nThat argument mischaracterizes the content of its papers.\n\n           The state's argument is disingenuous: if the STA Act did\n\nnot incorporate R-S grievance procedures and those procedures\n\ntherefore did not apply to the case, then there was no basis for\n\nthe state's motion to dismiss on exhaustion grounds.   Moreover, in\n\nresponse to the state's 1998 motion to dismiss, the Blind Vendors\n\nhad argued that their claim was not based on the R-S Act at all,\n\nbut only on the STA Act, and no exhaustion was required.   The state\n\ndid not withdraw or alter its position, and the district court then\n\ndismissed the claims based on the state's position.\n\n           Having gained an advantage by obtaining the dismissal,\n\nthe state did not seek to clarify its position with the district\n\ncourt, but rather took advantage of the dismissal. By invoking R-S\n\ngrievance procedures (knowing that those procedures ultimately\n\n\n                               -30-\n\fprovided for federal judicial review) to obtain dismissal of a\n\nclaim      for    injunctive      relief,    and    then   participating   in   the\n\nadministrative process, the state has waived any immunity it may\n\nhave to a federal forum and prospective equitable relief.\n\n                 In   essence,     the      state    voluntarily     invoked    the\n\njurisdiction of a federal agency, the USDOE, and the federal courts\n\nin review of the agency determination, including their power to\n\ngrant prospective equitable relief, even though it was not formally\n\nthe   plaintiff        in   the   administrative       proceeding.     The     state\n\nvoluntarily put itself in the position of being a party in a\n\nfederal administrative forum whose actions would be reviewed in\n\nfederal court.         The state's actions expressed a clear choice to\n\nsubmit its rights for adjudication in the federal courts.13                       To\n\npermit the state to reverse course would contravene the reasons for\n\nthe doctrine of waiver by litigation conduct recognized by Lapides\n\nand Lapides's core concern that a state cannot selectively invoke\n\nits Eleventh Amendment immunity to gain litigation advantage.\n\nSee Lapides, 535 U.S. at 622-23; see also Gardner, 329 U.S. at 573-\n\n74; Wis. Dep't of Corr. v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381, 393 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n      13\n          We note that the state is nominally the party in federal\ncourt by its own choice to substitute itself as the party\ndefendant. See Gunter v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 200 U.S. 273,\n284-87 (1906) (state voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of\nthe federal courts when Attorney General appeared \"for and on\nbehalf of the State\" in an earlier, related action brought against\nstate officers and not against the state itself).\n\n                                         -31-\n\f(Kennedy,    J.,       concurring).      The    same     concerns    about    unfair\n\nlitigation advantage underlie the judicial estoppel doctrine.\n\n            When the federal court dismissed the action on exhaustion\n\ngrounds, the Blind Vendors immediately instituted the first step of\n\nR-S Act grievance procedures by requesting a hearing before the\n\nSLA.    The state even then did not \"clarify\" its argument; rather,\n\nit   defended     on    the   merits,   and    never   mentioned     the   Eleventh\n\nAmendment.      It is true that the state finally, more than two years\n\ninto this matter in early 2000, did raise Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity before the USDOE panel, citing Kimel.                 But even then, the\n\nissue was raised almost in passing -- in one paragraph at the end\n\nof a memorandum concerned mostly with other issues -- and was not\n\nmentioned in oral argument or in the state's requested conclusions\n\nof law.14\n\n            The    state relies on the doctrine                that an \"Eleventh\n\nAmendment    defense      sufficiently        partakes    of   the   nature    of   a\n\njurisdictional bar\" that it may be raised on appeal even if not\n\nraised in the trial court.            Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 678\n\n(1974). The scope of that \"belated-raising\" doctrine after Lapides\n\nis unclear.15      Regardless, the state is wrong in arguing that the\n\n\n       14\n          In fairness, we note that Alden v. Maine was decided in\n1999, and Federal Maritime Commission v. South Carolina State Ports\nAuthority was not decided until 2002.\n       15\n          The doctrine was articulated in Ford Motor Co. v. Dep't\nof Treasury of Ind., 323 U.S. 459, 467 (1945), which Lapides\nexpressly overruled. See Lapides, 535 U.S. at 623.\n\n                                        -32-\n\f\"belated-raising\" doctrine undercuts the waiver doctrine.        The\n\ndoctrine that a state may waive its immunity by its litigation\n\nconduct has been alive and well both before and after Edelman.   See\n\nLapides, 535 U.S. at 618-24; Gunter v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co.,\n\n200 U.S. 273, 284 (1906).   To be clear, this case involves more\n\nthan a simple failure by the state to raise Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity in earlier proceedings; it involves a voluntary and\n\ncalculated choice by the state to gain the advantage of dismissal\n\nof the 1998 federal action for injunctive relief by arguing that\n\nthe remedies and grievance procedures of the R-S Act applied to\n\nclaims under the STA Act and that those procedures had to be\n\nexhausted.16   The state then entered those R-S Act procedures\n\nwithout a whimper of protest.   As to the Blind Vendors' claims for\n\nprospective equitable relief in a federal forum, the state, having\n\n\n\n     16\n          There may be another possible basis for finding waiver of\nimmunity by litigation conduct. While states may assert Eleventh\nAmendment immunity from suit by private parties in both state and\nfederal courts, there is a well-recognized exception to immunity\nset forth in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which allows the\naward of prospective equitable relief against state officers. The\nvitality of the Ex parte Young doctrine is demonstrated by the\nSupreme Court's recent opinion in Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv.\nComm'n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645-46 (2002).\n     It is true that the Blind Vendors here named state agencies\nrather than state officers as defendants in federal court and in\nthe R-S grievance procedures.     Nonetheless, the state (and its\nagencies), faced with a claim for prospective equitable relief\nsince 1998, has never raised the argument that such relief is\navailable only against state officers. Indeed, the state moved to\nsubstitute itself as the party defendant. Its litigation conduct\ncould be viewed as estopping any objection that it may have to the\napplication of the Ex parte Young exception.\n\n                                -33-\n\fgained the advantage that it sought, is bound by the choice that it\n\nmade.\n\n      2.     Waiver of Prospective Equitable Relief in a Federal Forum\n             by Operation of the R-S Act\n\n             We also conclude that because the state is judicially\n\nestopped from denying that R-S grievance procedures apply to claims\n\nunder § 111(b) of the STA Act and the state has voluntarily\n\nparticipated in the R-S Act program, the state has waived any\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity it may have to awards of prospective\n\nequitable relief in a federal forum resulting from R-S grievance\n\nprocedures.       We do not decide the independent question whether the\n\nstate, solely by entering into agreements under the STA Act, has\n\nwaived     any    Eleventh   Amendment   immunity     that   it   has   to   the\n\nrequirements of the STA Act.\n\n             This case does not involve a situation in which the state\n\nmay   have   been    coerced   into   waiving   its    immunity    by   federal\n\nrequirements forcing it to choose between waiver and \"exclusion .\n\n. . from an otherwise permissible activity.\"           See Coll. Sav. Bank,\n\n527 U.S. at 687.       By its voluntary agreement and participation in\n\nthe federal program created by the R-S Act, the state has been\n\ngiven a right it would not otherwise have: access to federal\n\nproperty.        No argument is presented that, absent any agreement\n\notherwise, Congress could not constitutionally withhold that right\n\nfrom states.\n\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\f          Congress was quite clear in 20 U.S.C. § 107b that states\n\nparticipating in the R-S Act program \"shall . . . agree\" to submit\n\nany disputes that blind vendors may have regarding the vending\n\nprogram to the hearing and arbitration procedures set forth in 20\n\nU.S.C. § 107d-1.       The thrust of the state's argument is that even\n\nif it agreed to R-S grievance procedures, no relief of any sort can\n\nbe awarded against it as a result of those procedures.               The effect\n\nof this argument would be to render those procedures meaningless.\n\nNo court has ever agreed with the state's position that no relief\n\nmay be granted under R-S grievance procedures.\n\n             States whose SLAs apply to participate in the R-S Act\n\nmust have anticipated that by agreeing to the procedures, they\n\nagreed to some form of relief, at least prospective equitable\n\nrelief, against them even if they are named directly as parties.\n\nAfter all, \"[t]he only parties with whom blind vendors can have\n\ndisputes to submit to arbitration are states.\"                McNabb v. United\n\nStates Dep't of Educ., 862 F.2d 681, 685 (8th Cir. 1988) (Lay,\n\nC.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The statute also\n\nrequires states to agree that the arbitration under the R-S Act\n\nshall be final and binding on the parties, subject to APA review.\n\n20 U.S.C. §§ 107b, 107d-1(a).        That agreement supports waiver of\n\nobjections    to   a   federal   forum   and,   at   least,    to   prospective\n\nequitable relief. See Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495\n\nU.S. 299, 307-08 (1990).\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fB.   Waiver of Eleventh Amendment Immunity From Damages\n\n     1.   Waiver of Immunity From Damages by Litigation Conduct\n\n          The   question   whether   the   state   has   waived   Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity from substantive liability for damages resolves\n\ndifferently on this record, largely because the Blind Vendors' 1998\n\ncomplaint in federal court contained no demand for damages.\n\n          No waiver occurred in the 1998 federal action.               The\n\ncomplaint in that action sought only injunctive relief and \"such\n\nother relief as is equitable and just.\"       The state was not put on\n\nnotice by the 1998 federal court complaint that damages were at\n\nissue in that federal court proceeding, and so had no reason to\n\nassert Eleventh Amendment immunity from damages. Indeed, the Blind\n\nVendors expressly stated that their claim in the federal court\n\naction encompassed only prospective injunctive relief.            The state\n\ncannot be said to have voluntarily waived immunity from damages\n\nwhen it faced no claim for damages at that time.\n\n          The argument that the state waived any immunity from\n\ndamages in the 1998 litigation is based on a perceived unfairness,\n\nwell-articulated by the USDOE as follows:\n\n          The State's decision to forego raising an immunity\n     argument allowed it to continue an illegal practice for\n     five years at the [Blind Vendors'] expense while\n     precluding any recovery for the blind vendors' losses.\n     If the State had raised and prevailed on a claim of\n     immunity   in   1998,   the   [Blind    Vendors]   would,\n     nevertheless, have been able to obtain prospective relief\n     under Ex parte Young.     By requiring that the [Blind\n     Vendors] pursue administrative remedies, the State\n     successfully postponed by years judicial resolution of\n\n                              -36-\n\f     the controversy. If the State is permitted to assert\n     immunity from the procedures it persuaded the district\n     court to require, it will have successfully deprived the\n     [Blind Vendors] of a judicial remedy to which it would\n     otherwise have been entitled.        The Supreme Court\n     established in Lapides that in situations of this kind,\n     the claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity has been waived.\n\nThis was clearly how the district court viewed the matter.\n\n          We agree that, for reasons explained above, unfairness\n\nwould occur if the state were permitted now to assert immunity to\n\nbar prospective equitable relief, but we think a closer analysis is\n\nrequired to determine if the same logic applies in the context of\n\nimmunity from damages. The operating assumption behind the USDOE's\n\nargument is that if the state had directly raised its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity to damages in 1998, the Blind Vendors would\n\ninstead have sought only injunctive relief against state officers\n\nunder Ex parte Young and thus would not have had to go through the\n\nlengthy R-S grievance procedures.       But this assumption is wrong.\n\nExhaustion of R-S grievance procedures is required even when only\n\ninjunctive relief is sought.17    See Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\n\n\n     17\n          Of course, exhaustion would not be necessary if the\ndistrict court in 1998 had been wrong in finding that R-S grievance\nprocedures applied to an STA Act claim. In that case, the Blind\nVendors could argue that, had it not been for the state's arguments\nin its motion to dismiss, the Blind Vendors could have proceeded\ndirectly to the question whether there is a cause of action,\noutside of the R-S Act, for claims under § 111(b), and if so, would\nhave obtained injunctive relief in 1998 if successful on the\nmerits. The Blind Vendors could thus argue that the state's motion\nto dismiss caused delay. But, in that case, any such delay would\nhave been caused by the state's urging the court to apply R-S\ngrievance procedures, not its failure to raise Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.   And, in any event, for reasons explained later, we\n\n                                 -37-\n\fAmerica v. Weinberger, 795 F.2d 90, 93, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\n\n(requiring exhaustion of R-S grievance procedures when plaintiffs\n\nsought only injunctive relief); see also 20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a) (R-S\n\ngrievance   procedures        apply    to    \"[a]ny   blind    licensee      who   is\n\ndissatisfied     with   any    action       arising   from    the    operation     or\n\nadministration of the vending facility program\" (emphasis added)).\n\nThe state's failure to assert immunity has made the Blind Vendors\n\nno worse off; it is the need for exhaustion, and not the failure to\n\nassert Eleventh Amendment immunity, that caused the delay.\n\n            Moreover, a finding of waiver in this situation would\n\nwork its own type of unfairness.            The Blind Vendors presumably did\n\nnot sue for damages in federal court because they were aware of\n\npotential Eleventh Amendment problems; instead, the Blind Vendors\n\nbrought a state court action seeking damages.                 And the state did,\n\nin 1998, allude to an Eleventh Amendment problem with a damages\n\naction in federal court.             In these circumstances, a finding of\n\nwaiver by litigation conduct would be unfair.\n\n            It   is   true    that    the    state    did    not    raise   Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity when damages were claimed before the state\n\nHearing Officer in the R-S grievance procedures.                      But at that\n\npoint, the state had already taken the position in federal court\n\nthat an award of damages in a federal proceeding would pose an\n\n\n\nconclude that R-S grievance procedures are properly applied to §\n111(b) claims.\n\n                                       -38-\n\fEleventh Amendment problem but that there would be no such problem\n\nin a state proceeding.\n\n          It is also true that the state did not immediately move\n\nbefore the USDOE arbitration panel to dismiss the Blind Vendors'\n\ndamages claims on Eleventh Amendment grounds.    But it did do so\n\neventually, and in light of its earlier posture in the controversy,\n\nwe cannot say the belated raising constitutes voluntary waiver by\n\nlitigation conduct.\n\n          Finally, the Blind Vendors, but not the USDOE, argue that\n\nthe state waived immunity simply by voluntarily seeking review of\n\nthe adverse administrative decision in this action in federal\n\ncourt.   They argue that if the state wanted to preserve its\n\nimmunity from damages, it should have simply waited for the Blind\n\nVendors to file an action in district court to enforce the award\n\nand then defended by asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity at that\n\npoint.\n\n          This argument -- that the seeking of judicial review of\n\nan agency decision under the APA by a state that was a defendant\n\nbefore the agency is sufficient alone to infer a waiver of immunity\n\nfrom damages -- fails, given the facts of this case.    This court\n\nheld in R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2002), that a state did not waive Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity solely by seeking judicial review of an agency's adverse\n\n\n\n\n                               -39-\n\fdetermination.     Id. at 50.18     The court noted that the state in\n\nLapides had waived immunity in state court and was \"attempt[ing] to\n\nregain, by a change in forum, litigation advantage that the state\n\nhas already renounced by a general statute.\"               Id. at 49; see\n\nLapides, 535 U.S. at 617-18 (expressly limiting its holding to\n\ncases where the state's immunity in state court has been waived or\n\nabrogated).    The court noted that Rhode Island, by contrast, had\n\n\"consistently asserted its sovereign immunity, both [in federal\n\ncourt] and in the administrative proceeding,\" and hence gained no\n\nunfair advantage by seeking a change in forum.             R.I. Dep't, 304\n\nF.3d at 49.      The same logic applies here as to damages.                New\n\nHampshire gained no unfair advantage as to damages by seeking\n\njudicial review of the administrative decision, given that it has\n\nconsistently asserted its immunity from damages when at issue.\n\n     2.   Interpretation of the STA Act As to Authority To Award\n          Damages\n\n          Having    determined     that    the    state   has   not   by   its\n\nlitigation    conduct   waived    its   ability   to   assert   an    Eleventh\n\n\n     18\n          The Blind Vendors do not mention R.I. Dep't of Envtl.\nMgmt. v. United States, 304 U.S. F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2002), in their\nbrief. But they do argue that Fed. Mar. Comm'n v. S.C. State Port\nAuth., 535 U.S. 743 (2002), and by implication R.I. Dep't, differs\nfrom the case at bar because it involved an administrative\nadjudication of a complaint against a \"non-consenting state.\"\nHere, they argue, New Hampshire consented to administrative\nadjudication because it sought and obtained dismissal of the 1998\nsuit on the ground that R-S grievance procedures should apply. We\ndisagree for the reasons stated earlier and add that it was not the\nstate but the Blind Vendors that filed a complaint before the\nfederal administrative tribunal.\n\n                                    -40-\n\fAmendment defense to damages, we turn to the question whether\n\nCongress intended to award damages in this situation.                  The Blind\n\nVendors argue that the state has waived immunity as to damages as\n\npart of its agreement to participate in the R-S Act.              Two circuit\n\ncourts have agreed with this theory.           See Del. Dep't of Health &\n\nSoc. Servs. Div. for Visually Impaired v. United States Dep't of\n\nEduc., 772 F.2d 1123, 1137-38 (3d Cir. 1985); Premo v. Martin, 119\n\nF.3d 764, 769-71 (9th Cir. 1997).             One, the Sixth Circuit, has\n\ndisagreed, see Tenn. Dep't of Human Servs., 979 F.2d at 1167-68,19\n\nas has at least one member of an Eighth Circuit panel.            See McNabb,\n\n862 F.2d at 687-88 (Doty, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart).\n\n            Those courts finding that damages could be awarded in R-S\n\ngrievance   procedures    and    were   not   precluded    by    the    Eleventh\n\nAmendment note that arbitrators were generally authorized to award\n\ndamages at the time § 107b(6) was passed.           See Premo, 119 F.3d at\n\n770. The argument is that an agreement to arbitration under the R-\n\nS Act was inherently an agreement to waive immunity from damages.\n\nAn   argument   could   also    be   made   that   the   state   and     federal\n\n\n\n      19\n          The Sixth Circuit held that (1) the Eleventh Amendment\ndid not bar the arbitration panel from awarding damages because the\nAmendment applied only in Article III proceedings, but (2) the\nAmendment did prevent a subsequent attempt to collect the\narbitration award in federal court. Tenn. Dep't Hum. Servs., 979\nF.2d at 1167-68. Our focus is on the court's second holding. The\nreasoning behind court's first holding has since been overruled in\nFed. Mar. Comm'n, 535 U.S. at 760-61.\n\n                                     -41-\n\fgovernment have a contractual relationship intended to benefit\n\nblind     vendors,    and    damages       are    a    common   remedy       in    such\n\nrelationships.       See Delaware Dep't, 772 F.2d at 1136-37.20\n\n            The R-S Act statutory text is silent as to what remedies\n\nmay be awarded against states in grievances brought by blind\n\nvendors. The regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Education\n\ndo not define what remedies the arbitration panel may award.                       The\n\nonly discussion of remedies in the R-S Act is 20 U.S.C. § 107d-\n\n2(b)(2), which       indicates      that   where      a   federal   agency    is   the\n\ndefendant, it is the role of the federal agency head to remedy any\n\nviolation of the Act.         See Ga. Dep't of Human Res. v. Nash, 915\n\nF.2d 1482, 1492 (11th Cir. 1990).                Section 107d-2(b)(2) does not\n\nexpressly authorize an award of damages, nor does it expressly\n\nwaive the federal government's immunity from damages.                      Differing\n\nconclusions    can    be    drawn   about    the      state's   immunity     in    this\n\nstatutory scheme.\n\n            At best, there is disagreement as to whether the R-S Act\n\narbitration panels can award damages, with reasoned arguments made\n\non both sides.       Here, there is an additional layer of uncertainty.\n\nEven assuming that the R-S Act allows damages to be awarded against\n\nstates based on complaints by blind vendors, it is not clear\n\nwhether Congress intended in § 111(b) of the STA Act to subject\n\n\n     20\n          Delaware Dep't was decided in 1985, without foreknowledge\nof the Supreme Court's later articulation of tests for waiver of\nEleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n                                       -42-\n\fstates to damages awards for violations found in R-S grievance\n\nprocedures. Given Congress's silence in the STA Act itself and the\n\ndisagreement about damages under the R-S grievance procedures, we\n\ncannot, as a matter of statutory construction of the STA Act, find\n\nan intent to subject states to damages awards under the STA Act.\n\nSee Vermont Agency of Nat. Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens,\n\n529 U.S. 765, 787 (2000) (\"[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual\n\nconstitutional balance between States and the Federal Government,\n\nit must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the\n\nlanguage of the statute.\" (citing Will v. Mich. Dep't of State\n\nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989))).\n\n          Accordingly, we vacate the damages award.\n\n\n\n\n                               -43-\n\f",

The   district        court    entered\n\njudgment for the New Hampshire Committee of Blind Vendors and nine\n\nof its individual members (collectively, the Blind Vendors) and the\n\nUnited States Department of Education (USDOE), largely affirming a\n\nfederal     arbitration       panel     award    against      New     Hampshire      of\n\ncompensatory        damages    of     approximately        $900,000    as     well   as\n\nprospective equitable relief. The Blind Vendors' claim is that New\n\nHampshire did not give proper \"priority\" to blind vendors, as\n\nrequired by federal law, in running lucrative vending machine\n\noperations     in    rest     areas    along    federally      funded       interstate\n\nhighways.    New Hampshire gave others those concessions by contract\n\nin exchange for a percentage of the proceeds, which the state put\n\ninto the state treasury.              The district court characterized the\n\nstate's actions as \"stealing from the blind.\"\n\n            Several major issues are presented in this complex and\n\ndifficult case.       The threshold issue is whether New Hampshire, in\n\nlight of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, may be subject to either\n\nthe compensatory damages award or prospective equitable relief in\n\na federal forum.        The district court found the state waived any\n\nimmunity it may have had by its litigation conduct.                     We hold that\n\nthe   district      court     had   jurisdiction      to    affirm     an    award   of\n\nprospective equitable relief because the state waived any immunity\n\nto such relief in a federal forum (a) by its litigation conduct and\n\n(b) by judicial estoppel and its participation in the program\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\festablished by the Randolph-Sheppard Act (R-S Act), 20 U.S.C. § 107\n\net   seq.    Having   determined   that   Eleventh   Amendment    immunity\n\npresents no bar to prospective equitable relief here, we affirm\n\nsuch relief on the merits, finding that the state has not given\n\nproper \"priority\" to blind vendors as required by federal law and\n\nthat a conflicting state statute is preempted.\n\n            Our view of the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity from\n\ndamages is different.      We hold that the state has not waived\n\nimmunity from damages by its litigation conduct; we also conclude\n\nthat § 111(b) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STA\n\nAct),1 23 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq., under which the Blind Vendors seek\n\nrelief, does not clearly evidence an intent to subject states to\n\nsuch damages.    We vacate the damages award and order dismissal of\n\nthose claims.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            This case is shaped by two federal statutes.         The first\n\nis the Randolph-Sheppard Act, under which the federal government,\n\nin partnership with consenting states, seeks to provide economic\n\nopportunities to the blind by granting priority to licensed blind\n\nvendors in contracts to operate vending facilities on federal\n\nproperty.    20 U.S.C. § 107(a)-(b).        The Act, which was first\n\n\n      1\n          The STA Act was later renamed the Transportation Equity\nAct for the 21st Century.    Pub. L. No. 105-178, 112 Stat. 107\n(1998). The parties and papers in this case refer to the Act by\nboth names, but for clarity and convenience, this opinion will\nrefer to the Act as the STA Act.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fenacted in 1936, Pub. L. No. 74-732, 49 Stat. 1559 (1936), provides\n\nthat:\n\n       In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on\n       Federal property, priority shall be given to blind\n       persons licensed by a State agency as provided in this\n       chapter; and the Secretary, through the Commissioner,\n       shall, after consultation with the Administrator of\n       General Services and other heads of departments,\n       agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States in\n       control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of\n       Federal property, prescribe regulations designed to\n       assure that--\n\n            (1) the priority under this subsection is given to\n            such licensed blind persons (including assignment\n            of vending machine income pursuant to section 107d-\n            3 of this title to achieve and protect such\n            priority), and\n\n            (2) wherever feasible, one or more vending\n            facilities are established on all Federal property\n            to the extent that any such facility or facilities\n            would not adversely affect the interests of the\n            United States.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 107(b).\n\n            Under the R-S Act, participating states, such as New\n\nHampshire, can gain access to federal property to benefit their own\n\nblind vendors by having state agencies apply to the United States\n\nDepartment of Education to participate in and administer the\n\nprogram.    20 U.S.C. § 107b.      In their applications, those state\n\nagencies must agree to set up licensing programs for blind vendors,\n\nmatch them with available contracts for vending facilities on\n\nfederal property, and provide them with equipment and stock.                 Id.\n\nOnce    approved,   those   agencies   are   known    as    \"state     licensing\n\nagencies\"   (SLAs).     New   Hampshire's    SLA     is    the   New   Hampshire\n\n                                   -5-\n\fDepartment of Education, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation,\n\nBureau of Blind Services.\n\n          We quote a succinct description of the operation of the\n\nR-S Act set forth by a sister circuit:\n\n          The Randolph-Sheppard Act was enacted in order to\n     provide employment opportunities for the blind. The Act\n     grants priority to those blind persons who desire to\n     operate vending facilities on federal property.        20\n     U.S.C. § 107(b). The Act divides responsibility for the\n     blind vendor program between the state and federal\n     agencies. The Secretary of Education is responsible for\n     interpreting and enforcing the Act's provisions, and more\n     specifically, for designating state licensing agencies.\n     20 U.S.C. §§ 107a(a)(5), 107b; 34 C.F.R. §§ 395.5, 395.8.\n     A person seeking a position as a blind vendor applies to\n     the designated state agency and is licensed by that\n     agency. The state agency in turn applies to the federal\n     government for the placement of the licensee on federal\n     property.   20 U.S.C. § 107b.    Once the state and the\n     federal government have agreed on an appropriate location\n     for the vending facility, the state licensing agency is\n     responsible for equipping the facility and furnishing the\n     initial stock and inventory. 20 U.S.C. § 107b(2). The\n     blind vendor thereafter operates as a sole proprietor who\n     is entitled to the profits of the vending facility and\n     who is responsible for the facility's losses.\n          The Act requires that if the state licensing agency\n     operates vending machines that directly compete with a\n     vending facility operated by a blind vendor, then a\n     percentage of the income from such competing machines\n     must be given to the blind vendor licensed to do business\n     on that property. 20 U.S.C. § 107d-3. If no licensee is\n     operating a facility on the property, the income from\n     state-operated vending machines is used for a variety of\n     purposes that benefit all blind vendors in the state\n     program. 20 U.S.C. 107d-3(c).\n\nTenn.

See 20 U.S.C. § 107b.          The principal\n\nbenefit that a state receives for participating in the program is\n\nan opportunity to improve the lot of its blind population.                   A\n\nparticipating state also receives funds.           For example, even if no\n\nblind vendor operates vending facilities on a particular federal\n\nproperty, the relevant SLA receives income from vending machines on\n\nthat property; these proceeds can be used to fund retirement,\n\nhealth insurance, sick leave, and vacation time for blind vendors\n\nand to defray various costs associated with running the program.\n\n20 U.S.C. §§ 107d-3(a), (c).\n\n             SLAs also agree to a three-step process (\"R-S grievance\n\nprocedures\") for dealing with blind licensees who are dissatisfied\n\nwith the operation of the vending program: first, a hearing at the\n\nstate level before the SLA; then, an opportunity to appeal in an\n\narbitration before a USDOE panel; and finally, judicial review of\n\nthe arbitration panel's decision in the federal courts under the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701.2            At the first\n\nstage, the SLA agrees:\n\n      to provide to any blind licensee dissatisfied with any\n      action arising from the operation or administration of\n      the vending facility program an opportunity for a fair\n      hearing, and . . . to submit the grievances of any blind\n      licensee not otherwise resolved by such hearing to\n      arbitration [before the USDOE].\n\n20   U.S.C.    §   107b(6).   After    the   hearing   before   the   SLA,   a\n\ndissatisfied blind licensee may go to arbitration before a panel\n\nconvened by the federal Secretary of Education, under 20 U.S.C. §\n\n107d-2(b)(1). The procedures used by the panel are governed by the\n\nAPA, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.      20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a).         The decision\n\nof the panel is \"subject to appeal and review as a final agency\n\naction\" under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701, in a federal district court.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a).\n\n\n      2\n              We quote again from Tenn. Dep't of Human Servs.:\n\n      In order to resolve disputes arising under the Act, both\n      administrative and judicial remedies are available for\n      licensed blind vendors. The Secretary of Education may\n      decertify a state licensing agency that refuses to\n      cooperate with the Secretary. 34 C.F.R. § 395.17. In\n      all other situations, the Secretary must rely on a blind\n      vendor to file a complaint in order to enforce the Act's\n      substantive provisions.     If a blind vendor has a\n      complaint regarding the state's operation of the program,\n      he or she may request an evidentiary hearing before the\n      state licensing agency and, if dissatisfied with the\n      outcome of the hearing, may ask the Secretary to convene\n      an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute. 20 U.S.C.\n      §§ 107d-1(a), 107d-2(b)(1).      An arbitration panel's\n      decision is subject to review as a final agency action.\n      20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a).\n\n979 F.2d at 1164.\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           The R-S Act says nothing about what relief can be granted\n\nat any of the three levels when the grievance is initiated by a\n\nblind licensee, as here. It does specify, however, the relief that\n\ncan be granted when the grievance is initiated by an SLA.3             SLAs\n\nmay file complaints that a federal agency is violating the Act.         20\n\nU.S.C. § 107d-1(b).      In that situation, upon a finding by the panel\n\nthat \"acts or practices of any such . . . agency are in violation\n\nof [the R-S] Act, or any regulation issued thereunder,\" the head of\n\nthe offending agency \"shall cause such acts or practices to be\n\nterminated promptly and shall take such other action as may be\n\nnecessary to carry out the decision of the panel.\"            20 U.S.C. §\n\n107d-2(b)(2).    The statute does not expressly authorize the award\n\nof damages.\n\n           The   other    federal   statute   involved   is   the   Surface\n\nTransportation Assistance Act.         The STA Act seeks to increase\n\nconstruction and safety on the interstate and national highway\n\nsystems.   23 U.S.C. §§ 101(b), 103.          Most states receive large\n\namounts of federal funding under the Act; New Hampshire received\n\n\n     3\n           As one court has noted, § 107d-1 of the R-S Act\n\n     sets out a dual scheme of remedies. Subsection (a) gives the\n     blind licensee a direct action against the state licensing\n     agency.   Subsection (b), however, gives the blind licensee\n     nothing; rather, it gives the state agency authority to bring\n     a complaint against a federal entity controlling property on\n     which vending facilities are located.\n\nGa.

See U.S. Census Bureau, Federal Aid to\n\nStates for Fiscal Year 2002, at 17 tbl. 1 (2003).\n\n          Under the STA Act, a state cannot accept federal highway\n\nfunds without entering into an agreement with the Secretary of\n\nTransportation.   23 U.S.C. §§ 106, 110.       Included in such an\n\nagreement is the promise to comply with the terms and conditions\n\nset forth in Title 23.   23 C.F.R. § 630.112(a).    Title 23, in turn,\n\nsets forth a priority system for vending machines.       Historically,\n\nunder the STA Act, states accepting federal aid for construction\n\nprojects on the interstate system had to agree not to construct\n\n\"commercial establishments for serving motor vehicle users\" along\n\nthe rights-of-way of the interstate system.        23 U.S.C. § 111(a).\n\nIn 1983, Congress amended the Act to add 23 U.S.C. § 111(b), which\n\ncreates an exception to this general prohibition and sets forth a\n\npriority system for vending machines:\n\n     [A]ny State may permit the placement of vending machines\n     in rest and recreation areas, and in safety rest areas,\n     constructed or located on rights-of-way of the Interstate\n     System in such State. Such vending machines may only\n     dispense such food, drink, and other articles as the\n     State    transportation    department   determines    are\n     appropriate and desirable.     Such vending machines may\n     only be operated by the State.        In permitting the\n     placement of vending machines, the State shall give\n     priority to vending machines which are operated through\n     the State licensing agency designated pursuant to section\n     2(a)(5) of the Act of June 20, 1936, commonly known as\n     the 'Randolph-Sheppard Act' (20 U.S.C. 107a(a)(5)). The\n     costs of installation, operation, and maintenance of\n     vending machines shall not be eligible for Federal\n     assistance under this title.\n\n§ 111(b); Pub. L. No. 97-424, 96 Stat. 2097, 2106 (1983).\n\n                                -10-\n\f              The STA Act, however, does not expressly state how\n\ndisputes concerning the \"priority\" created in § 111(b) should be\n\nresolved.      In general, authority to enforce the STA Act has been\n\ndelegated to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),\n\nsee 23 U.S.C. § 315, whose regulations state:\n\n      If the [Federal Highway] Administrator determines that a\n      State has violated or failed to comply with the Federal\n      laws or the regulations in this part with respect to a\n      project, he may withhold payment to the State of Federal\n      funds on account of such project, withhold approval of\n      further projects in the State, and take such other action\n      that he deems appropriate under the circumstances, until\n      compliance or remedial action has been accomplished by\n      the State to the satisfaction of the Administrator.\n\n23 C.F.R. § 1.36.        Some provisions of the STA Act contain more\n\nspecific enforcement procedures, see, e.g., 23 U.S.C. §§ 116(c),\n\n131(b), 133(e), but § 111 does not.          The STA Act does not contain\n\na general suit mechanism or a provision requiring states to waive\n\nsovereign immunity.\n\n              In 1985, two years after the STA Act was amended to add\n\n§   111(b),    New   Hampshire   passed    legislation   to   place   vending\n\nmachines in rest areas along state turnpikes and the interstate\n\nhighway system.      N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 230:30-a, 229:3.         The New\n\nHampshire Department of Administrative Services (NHDAS) was put in\n\ncharge of administering the vending contracts.                NHDAS selected\n\nvendors through a competitive bidding process open to all.                See\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 21-I:11; N.H. Code Admin. R. Adm. 603.06.\n\nIts policy was generally to award the contract to the bidder\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f\"offering    the   highest   rate   of   return   to   the   State   of   New\n\nHampshire,\" as long as that bidder satisfied basic requirements\n\nlike the ability to meet the contract specifications and to post a\n\nperformance bond.    If two or more of the high bids were identical,\n\nthe contract would generally be awarded by \"drawn lot.\"                   The\n\nexception to this general rule was that if one of the high bidders\n\nwas the Bureau of Blind Services (the New Hampshire SLA), the\n\ncontract would be awarded to the Bureau (the Tie Rule).\n\n            Since the passage of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a,\n\nNHDAS has invited bids for vending machine contracts on five\n\noccasions for rest areas along rights-of-way of the interstate\n\nhighway system: (1) in 1988 for rest areas in Hooksett on I-93; (2)\n\nin 1991 for rest areas in Seabrook on I-95, Salem on I-93, and\n\nSpringfield on I-89; (3) in 1997 for rest areas in Lebanon on I-89,\n\nCanterbury on I-93, Sanbornton on I-93, and Sutton on I-89; (4) in\n\n1999 for those same rest areas when the 1997 contract had expired;\n\nand (5) in 2001 for the same Hooksett rest areas.            All of the rest\n\nareas in question are owned by the state of New Hampshire.                The\n\nHooksett rest areas are on toll roads and have been constructed and\n\nmaintained without federal aid.            The Seabrook rest areas were\n\nconstructed with federal aid, but are on the state turnpike system\n\nand are maintained through state funds.           In the first four bid\n\nopportunities, NHDAS followed its standard procedure as described\n\nabove.      The SLA did not bid on the 1988 and 1991 contracts,\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fapparently     because     both    contracts     contained      specifications\n\nrequiring    the    construction    of   shelters    to   house   the   vending\n\nmachines and the SLA is precluded from making capital expenditures\n\nunder state law.     The Bureau did bid on the 1997 and 1999 contracts\n\nbut lost to higher bidders in both instances.             In 2001, after this\n\nlitigation had begun, NHDAS departed from its standard policy.\n\nInstead of asking the SLA to submit a bid as the other contractors\n\ndid, NHDAS had the other contractors bid first and then offered the\n\nBureau the contract on the same terms as the high bid (the Match\n\nRule).    After consulting with the New Hampshire Committee of Blind\n\nVendors, the SLA turned down the offer, stating that it preferred\n\nto await clarification of its priority right in this action.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA.    First Federal Court Action\n\n             On January 6, 1998, the Blind Vendors4 brought suit under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1331, alleging that the state had violated the STA Act,\n\n23 U.S.C. § 111(b), by awarding vending contracts without giving\n\npriority to machines operated through the SLA. The named defendant\n\nwas   the   state    of   New   Hampshire,     through    its   Department   of\n\nAdministrative      Services.      The   complaint   sought     an   injunction\n\nvoiding all existing vending machine contracts and requiring the\n\n\n\n      4\n          At this stage, the suit was brought only by the New\nHampshire Committee of Blind Vendors; the nine individual members\nhad not yet joined. For clarity and convenience, however, we refer\nto the Committee alone as the Blind Vendors.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fstate to grant the right to operate those vending machines to\n\nlicensed blind   vendors,   along   with   \"such   other   relief    as   is\n\nequitable and just.\"     The complaint did not seek damages for the\n\nalleged prior violations.\n\n          The state defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that\n\nthe court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Blind\n\nVendors had \"failed to exhaust\" their administrative remedies\n\nbefore filing their judicial action, as required by 20 U.S.C. §\n\n107d-1 of the R-S Act.   The motion also stated that \"[i]f the court\n\ndoes not dismiss this action, this court should abstain from\n\naccepting jurisdiction over this action,\" citing Colorado River\n\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976).\n\nThe state said that the Blind Vendors had simultaneously filed an\n\naction in the New Hampshire state courts and that the federal court\n\nshould defer to the state court.     As best we can tell, the state\n\ncourt action also invoked the STA Act and sought damages.\n\n          The state's motion in federal court did not seek to\n\ndismiss the action based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.            Nor did\n\nit seek dismissal on the ground that the state was not a proper\n\nparty or that no cause of action was stated.\n\n          In the supporting memorandum, the state also did not\n\nargue that the case was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.                 The\n\nstate did argue that the Blind Vendors' claim arose under the R-S\n\nAct because § 111(b) of the STA Act incorporated the R-S Act by\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\freferring to a priority for vending machines operated through \"the\n\nState licensing agency designated pursuant to\" the R-S Act.      The\n\nstate contended that R-S grievance procedures were available and\n\nhad to be exhausted.   Inherent in its argument was the assertion\n\nthat a claim under the STA Act could not be brought before the\n\nexhaustion of grievance procedures under the R-S Act.    The state\n\nqualified this argument in a footnote, stating that\n\n     Defendant does not agree that the Randolph-Sheppard Act\n     in general applies to the facts of this case nor that, to\n     the extent that it does apply, that it gives Petitioner\n     the rights claimed. However, for purposes of this Motion\n     to Dismiss only, it is assumed that Petitioner's\n     allegation that the Randolph-Sheppard Act applies will be\n     accepted as true.\n\n          In support of the abstention request, should the court\n\nnot dismiss the action, the state argued that the entire dispute\n\n(both damages and injunctive relief) would be more readily resolved\n\nin the pending state court action, noting:\n\n     Plaintiff's   state  and   federal   suits  were   filed\n     essentially at the same time and both are at very early\n     stages. Thus, the forums' order of jurisdiction is not\n     a factor. Finally, the parallel state-court proceeding\n     would be the better vehicle for the complete and prompt\n     resolution of the issues between the parties.        See\n     Elmendorf, 48 F.2d at 50. Part of the relief which the\n     Plaintiff seeks is termination of contractual rights\n     between the State and third parties. The State has not\n     and does not waive its immunity to suit in federal court\n     under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States\n     Constitution in regards to suits involving contractual\n     rights. Therefore, only in the state court action can\n     all of the issues raised by this pleading be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f(emphasis added).      Thus, the state conceded that even if the claim\n\ncould not go forward in federal court, the state court proceeding\n\ncould go forward.\n\n          The Blind Vendors opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing,\n\ninter alia, that their claims arose under the STA Act rather than\n\nthe R-S Act, that R-S grievance procedures therefore did not apply,\n\nand that the STA Act itself had no grievance procedures to be\n\nexhausted.     The Blind Vendors also argued that abstention was\n\nimproper, as they sought only prospective injunctive relief, while\n\nthe state court action did not seek any equitable relief.5                 The\n\nstate did not file a reply.\n\n             The federal court issued an order and judgment on March\n\n17, 1998, dismissing the complaint without prejudice, finding that\n\nthe Blind Vendors had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\nThe   court    accepted   the    state's    argument    that   the   STA   Act\n\nincorporated the R-S Act's administrative procedures, and relied\n\nprincipally on the statutory text of the R-S Act, which states that\n\nR-S grievance procedures apply to \"[a]ny blind licensee who is\n\ndissatisfied    with    any   action   arising   from    the   operation   or\n\nadministration of the vending facility program.\" 20 U.S.C. § 107d-\n\n1(a) (emphasis added).          The court found that the term \"vending\n\nfacility program\" included the program under § 111(b) of the STA\n\n\n      5\n          The Blind Vendors noted that the state was free to ask\nthat any damages claim in state court be combined with the\nequitable claim in federal court, if it wanted all issues combined.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fAct.       The court also addressed in a footnote what it understood to\n\nbe the state's reference to the Eleventh Amendment:\n\n       Parenthetically, the court notes that the State also\n       claims that the Eleventh Amendment precludes any award of\n       monetary damages. At a minimum, that issue is open to\n       debate.\n\nB.     State Administrative Hearing\n\n               By   letter   dated    March    30,    1998,   the   Blind   Vendors6\n\nrequested a state administrative hearing before the SLA under the\n\nfirst stage of R-S grievance procedures.               The Blind Vendors sought\n\ninjunctive relief, \"challeng[ing] the right of the State to grant\n\nany vending contracts on Interstate Highways to anyone but licensed\n\nblind       vendors,    unless       blind    vendors      consent     to   another\n\narrangement.\" Significantly, the Blind Vendors also, for the first\n\ntime pertinent to the case before us, sought money damages in the\n\nform of commissions paid to the state since the inception of the\n\nSTA Act as well as for lost profits.             New Hampshire does not claim\n\nthat it asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity before the state\n\nHearing Officer, and our review of the record reveals no such claim\n\nof   immunity.         (Of   course,    this    was    a   state     administrative\n\nproceeding, albeit one required under a federal statute in an\n\nagreement with the state.) Instead, the state moved to dismiss the\n\nproceedings before the SLA on the basis that:\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          At this point, the Committee was joined by nine of its\nindividual members.\n\n                                        -17-\n\f     (1) the rest areas at issue are on state, not federal,\n     property and so are not subject to the R-S Act;\n\n     (2) the plaintiffs' claims arise under provisions of the R-S\n     Act that are not incorporated into the STA Act;\n\n     (3) any priority required by 20 U.S.C. § 111 has in fact been\n     provided;\n\n     (4) even assuming the plaintiffs had any rights under the R-S\n     Act, the statute does not authorize the state Hearing Officer\n     to terminate an existing concession agreement or to award\n     relief.\n\n          The state Hearing Officer granted the state's motion to\n\ndismiss on July 3, 1998, saying:\n\n     Because the State has presented credible and unrebutted\n     evidence that the 'rest areas' in issue are located on\n     State land, and because the Federal statutes [i.e., the\n     R-S Act and STA Act] can reasonably be read [to] require\n     the requested State agency 'priority' apply only to\n     accommodate such an application to a vending machine rest\n     area on 'Federal' land, there is no factual issue that\n     will reasonably permit the Committee of Blind Vendors to\n     prevail on these facts.       Therefore, the matter is\n     dismissed.7\n\nThe Blind Vendors moved for reconsideration.     They did not dispute\n\nthat the R-S Act applies only to federal land, but argued that §\n\n111(b), unlike the R-S Act, clearly applies to rest areas on both\n\nstate and federal land.   The state responded by arguing that if the\n\nR-S Act does not apply to these rest areas, the Hearing Officer had\n\nno jurisdiction to issue relief.       The Hearing Officer denied the\n\n\n\n     7\n          The Hearing Officer's ruling that § 111(b) applies only\non federal land is puzzling.    The state never contested that §\n111(b) applied to state-owned rest areas; it argued only that the\nR-S Act did not apply to such rest areas and that the priority\nrequired by § 111(b) was provided here.\n\n                                -18-\n\fmotion on July 23, 1998, reiterating its position that neither §\n\n111(b) nor the R-S Act applies to state-owned land.\n\nC.   Proceedings Before Federal Arbitration Panel\n\n            In October 1998, the Blind Vendors appealed the state\n\nHearing Officer's decision, as authorized under 20 U.S.C. § 107d-\n\n1(a), by filing a letter of complaint with the federal Secretary of\n\nEducation against the SLA. In the letter, the Blind Vendors sought\n\n(1) recognition that the priority provisions of § 111(b) apply to\n\nstate-owned rest areas off of the interstate highway system, (2)\n\nrecognition that New Hampshire's competitive bidding process under\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a violates § 111(b) by failing to\n\nprovide    priority,   (3)   permission      to    interfere   with   existing\n\ncontracts to provide blind vendors a priority to operate vending\n\nmachines at New Hampshire rest areas, and (4) money damages in the\n\nform of all commissions paid to the state since the inception of\n\nthe STA Act, as well as lost profits.             The Secretary, as required\n\nby 20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a), convened an arbitration panel to hear the\n\ncase.\n\n            By letter dated October 28, 1998, the state8 moved to\n\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction, but not on Eleventh Amendment\n\ngrounds.      The   state    argued    principally      that   R-S    grievance\n\n\n\n\n     8\n          At this stage, the SLA, rather than the state itself, was\nthe respondent, but we refer to the SLA as \"the state\" for clarity\nand convenience.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fprocedures did not apply to the Blind Vendors' complaint because\n\nthe claims arose under the STA Act, not the R-S Act.\n\n          Later, sometime between January and March of 2000, the\n\nstate filed an undated memorandum that included a challenge to the\n\npanel's jurisdiction on the ground that \"[a]bsent a clear intent of\n\nthe Congress to waive a State's sovereign immunity under the\n\nEleventh Amendment, the Constitution does not provide for federal\n\njurisdiction over disputes against states by federal court or by\n\nextension a federally appointed arbitration panel.\"    Because the\n\nSTA Act expressed no such intent, the state argued, there was no\n\njurisdiction.\n\n          This argument that no relief was available in a federal\n\nforum was raised more than two years into the controversy.    This\n\nmarks the first occasion that we have found in which the state\n\nargued that the Eleventh Amendment precluded application of the STA\n\nAct or the R-S Act to grant any form of relief.        The state's\n\nmemorandum cited Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118323\"><a href=\"/opinion/118323/kimel-v-florida-bd-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000),\n\nwhich was decided on January 11, 2000.   Perhaps reading Kimel is\n\nwhat prompted the state to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity for\n\nthe first time.   We note, though, that as far back as 1973, the\n\nstate of New Hampshire has raised the issue of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity from suit under federal statutes.   See Carver v.

It is unclear whether this memorandum was filed\n\nin reply to or simultaneously with the state's memorandum.           In any\n\nevent, the Blind Vendors' memorandum did not respond to the new\n\nEleventh Amendment argument.\n\n          At a hearing before the arbitration panel on March 10,\n\nduring which the parties engaged in extensive oral argument, the\n\nstate made no mention of Eleventh Amendment immunity.         Nor did the\n\nstate mention Eleventh Amendment immunity in the requested rulings\n\nof law that it submitted to the arbitration panel.\n\n          On June 12, 2000, the arbitration panel rejected the\n\nstate's jurisdictional challenge, finding that Congress intended R-\n\nS grievance procedures to apply to disputes over priority under §\n\n111(b).   The   panel   made   no   mention   of   the   state's   Eleventh\n\nAmendment argument.     There was a dissenting opinion, which argued\n\nthat the complaint should be dismissed because the STA Act does not\n\nemploy R-S grievance procedures; that opinion did not address the\n\nEleventh Amendment issue either.           The state did not press its\n\nEleventh Amendment argument, nor did it go to federal court to\n\nenjoin the R-S grievance procedures on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n\n          In a separate order issued on July 11, 2001, the panel\n\nruled against the state on the merits.        The most pertinent of the\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fpanel's rulings of law and findings of fact can be found in the\n\nappendix to this opinion.     Principally, the panel held that the\n\npriority provisions of § 111(b) required that SLAs be given a\n\n\"right of first refusal.\"    The panel found that this meant that the\n\nSLA had to \"receive an opportunity to operate vending machines\n\nbefore any private vendor is even pursued\" (emphasis original), and\n\nthat the SLA \"must waive its right to a priority in writing before\n\n[the state] approaches any other entity.\"     It held that N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 230:30-a, which it found to adopt a conflicting\n\npriority policy, was preempted.\n\n          The panel also awarded what it termed \"prospective[]\"\n\ndamages in the amount of all commissions received from the disputed\n\nrest areas after October 28, 1998 (when the panel determined that\n\nthe Blind Vendors had filed their complaint with the USDOE) and\n\nordered that these amounts be paid to the SLA for appropriate uses\n\nto benefit blind vendors.      The panel denied the Blind Vendors'\n\nclaim for attorneys' fees.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          On September 13, 2001, the New Hampshire Department of\n\nEducation, NHDAS, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation,\n\nand the State Treasurer filed two suits in federal district court\n\nagainst the USDOE and the Blind Vendors, seeking review of the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fpanel decision under 20 U.S.C. § 107d-2(a).9                The Blind Vendors\n\nfiled    counterclaims    in     both   suits,    seeking    confirmation     and\n\nenforcement of the panel's decision, an award of attorneys' fees,\n\nand a modification to the panel's damages award to calculate\n\ndamages from 1985, when N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a was\n\nenacted, or in the alternative, from January 6, 1998, when the\n\nBlind    Vendors   had   first    brought      suit.   The    two    suits   were\n\nconsolidated with the assent of the state agencies.                 On motion of\n\nthe Blind Vendors, and over the objection of the state agencies,\n\nthe district court then dismissed all of the state agencies except\n\nfor the state Department of Education, on the ground that the\n\nagencies, as members of the executive branch, were barred from\n\ntaking positions independent or contrary to one another.\n\n            In response, the state Department of Education, now the\n\nonly remaining state agency in the case, moved to substitute the\n\nstate of New Hampshire as the real party in interest.                         New\n\nHampshire supported the motion, asserting that it was the \"proper\n\nreal party in interest.\"          The state does not now and has never\n\nargued that it is not a properly named party.                 Nor has it ever\n\nargued that state officers, not state agencies, were the only\n\nproper parties before the court or that prospective equitable\n\nrelief could be awarded only against state officers.\n\n\n     9\n          One suit was brought by the New Hampshire Department of\nEducation, while the other was brought by NHDAS, the New Hampshire\nDepartment of Transportation, and the State Treasurer.\n\n                                        -23-\n\f             Both sides filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The\n\nstate     asserted   Eleventh        Amendment    immunity         against   both     the\n\narbitration panel proceeding and any suit in federal court or\n\nelsewhere based on 23 U.S.C. § 111(b).                 On the merits, the state\n\nfurther    argued    that     N.H.    Rev.    Stat.    Ann.    §    230:30-a     is   not\n\npreempted     because    the    NHDAS        policy    is    consistent      with     the\n\n\"priority\" required by § 111(b).               Finally, the state argued that\n\nthe damages calculation should have excluded commissions from rest\n\nareas     where   the   SLA    could    not     meet    the    necessary        contract\n\nspecifications and should be further reduced to account for the\n\ncapital and maintenance costs incurred by the state to build\n\nvending machine shelters.10              The state          abandoned a number of\n\narguments it had made earlier.\n\n             The Blind Vendors contended that the state waived its\n\nEleventh     Amendment      immunity    by     participating         in   the    program\n\nestablished by the R-S Act and by appealing the arbitration panel's\n\ndecision to federal court.            They further argued that the panel's\n\ninterpretation of \"priority\" under § 111(b) was proper, based on\n\n\n\n     10\n          In addition, the state argued that 23 U.S.C. § 111(b)\nviolates the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments because, the state said, there is no rational\nbasis for granting priority to blind vendors. The state further\nargued that the damages award exceeded the arbitration panel's\nstatutory authority because the rest areas were all on state-owned\nland and at least one rest area had been built and maintained\nentirely with state funds.      The district court rejected both\narguments, and the state has raised neither on appeal, so we do not\naddress them.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fsimilar use of the term \"priority\" in the R-S Act.          Finally, they\n\nargued that the arbitration panel did not award them sufficient\n\ndamages: the amount of damages should have been calculated from\n\nJanuary 6, 1998 rather than October 28, 1998.\n\n           The district court granted in part and denied in part\n\nboth motions for summary judgment.      The court largely affirmed the\n\narbitration panel's order, modifying only the amount of the damages\n\nawarded.    The court held that the state had waived its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity by its litigation conduct, due to (a) the\n\nstate's failure to raise its Eleventh Amendment immunity in the\n\n1998 federal court litigation and in the initial stages of the\n\nadministrative process, (b) the state's argument in its 1998 motion\n\nto dismiss that R-S grievance procedures should apply, and (c) the\n\nstate's    invocation   of   federal    jurisdiction   to    review   the\n\narbitration panel's order.      Proceeding to the merits, the court\n\nconcluded that the arbitration panel's construction of \"priority\"\n\nin § 111(b) was entitled to deference, see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\n\nNatural Res. Def. Council, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842-43 (1984), and that\n\nthe panel's construction was a reasonable one within the scope of\n\nits discretion.    Finally, the court modified the damages award,\n\nreducing it to compensate the state for the capital and maintenance\n\ncosts of building vending machine shelters at several rest areas\n\nand moving the start date for damages from October 28, 1998 to\n\n\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fMarch 30, 1998, the date on which the Blind Vendors first requested\n\na state administrative hearing.     The state timely appealed.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n            The state argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars \"the\n\nUSDOE Arbitration Panel proceeding, any suit for damages in federal\n\ncourt and any suit in state court based on the STA [Act].\"\n\n            A state's immunity under the Eleventh Amendment applies\n\nwhether a private plaintiff's suit is for monetary damages or some\n\nother type of relief.

See\n\nJonathan R. Siegel, Waivers of State Sovereign Immunity and the\n\nIdeology of the Eleventh Amendment, 52 Duke L.J. 1167, 1192-93\n\n(2003);   Carlos   Manuel   Vazquez,     What    Is   Eleventh    Amendment\n\nImmunity?, 106 Yale L.J. 1683, 1697-98 (1997).         In fact, this case\n\ninvolves two different aspects of a state's substantive liability\n\nimmunity from suits by private persons: immunity from damages and\n\nimmunity from prospective equitable relief. Certainly, a state may\n\nwaive its immunity from substantive liability without waiving its\n\nimmunity from suit in a federal forum.          See Coll. Sav. Bank, 527\n\nU.S. at 676; Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 241.         The Supreme Court thus\n\nfar has not addressed whether a state may waive federal forum\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fimmunity without waiving substantive liability immunity under the\n\nEleventh Amendment.   We assume arguendo that a state may do so.\n\nA.   Waiver of Eleventh Amendment     Immunity    Against   Suit   for\n     Prospective Equitable Relief\n\n     1.   Waiver by Litigation Conduct\n\n          The state argues that no prospective equitable relief may\n\nbe granted at all in either state or federal court against it for\n\nviolations of the federal statutes at issue.     The state certainly\n\nnever argued to the district court in 1998 that such relief was not\n\navailable or that the Eleventh Amendment barred suit or any relief\n\nagainst it.\n\n          We conclude that the state has waived by its litigation\n\nconduct any Eleventh Amendment immunity that it may have from\n\nfederal proceedings (forum immunity) and from prospective equitable\n\nrelief (substantive liability immunity).11   When the state moved in\n\n1998 to dismiss the federal court action, it did not assert that\n\nCongress lacked the power or intent to submit the state to federal\n\njurisdiction under the STA Act or the R-S Act for prospective\n\nequitable relief. When the state mentioned the Eleventh Amendment,\n\nit was only to say that there would be no Eleventh Amendment issues\n\nas to claims in a state court proceeding in which damages were\n\n\n\n     11\n          The state does not contend that its counsel lacked\nauthority under state law to waive immunity. That consideration\nhas not survived Lapides in cases such as this, where a state\nvoluntarily invokes federal jurisdiction. See Lapides v. Bd. of\nRegents, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 621-22 (2002).\n\n                               -28-\n\fsought. The fact that the state focused only on Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity        to    damages       and   simultaneously       agreed   to   a    federal\n\nadministrative forum reinforces our view that the state by its\n\nconduct has waived its current objection to prospective equitable\n\nrelief in a federal forum.                 This case goes well beyond a simple\n\nmatter     of    failure       to    raise   an     immunity    argument     in   earlier\n\nproceedings.\n\n                The concept of waiver by litigation conduct is related to\n\nthe doctrine of judicial estoppel.                   Here, the state's failure to\n\nraise Eleventh Amendment immunity was accompanied by an affirmative\n\nassertion that the STA Act incorporates R-S grievance procedures\n\n(with its concomitant process of judicial review) and that those\n\nprocedures must be exhausted before claims could be pursued under\n\nthe STA Act.12           The plaintiffs did not assert that the R-S Act\n\napplied; it was the state that made that argument, and the state\n\nis,   as    a        result,    judicially        estopped.

The state then acted consistently with its\n\nassertion, participated in the grievance procedures, and in doing\n\nso advantaged itself to the detriment of the Blind Vendors.                             The\n\n\n\n      12\n          It is true that in the 1998 federal court filing seeking\ndismissal on exhaustion grounds, the state defendants reserved the\nquestion whether the facts of the case brought it within the\nstatutory reach of the R-S Act. That is a very different argument.\n\n                                             -29-\n\fdistrict court relied on the position articulated by the state in\n\ndismissing the Blind Vendors' initial federal court action in March\n\nof 1998.\n\n           Attempting now to be excused, the state argues that in\n\n1998 it never suggested to the federal court that the STA Act\n\nincorporated the R-S Act procedures and that the action must be\n\ndismissed for failure to exhaust.     Based on a footnote in its\n\nmemorandum to the district court in 1998, the state says that its\n\nargument was, at most, that if plaintiffs were basing their claim\n\non rights under the R-S Act, then R-S grievance procedures applied.\n\nThat argument mischaracterizes the content of its papers.\n\n           The state's argument is disingenuous: if the STA Act did\n\nnot incorporate R-S grievance procedures and those procedures\n\ntherefore did not apply to the case, then there was no basis for\n\nthe state's motion to dismiss on exhaustion grounds.   Moreover, in\n\nresponse to the state's 1998 motion to dismiss, the Blind Vendors\n\nhad argued that their claim was not based on the R-S Act at all,\n\nbut only on the STA Act, and no exhaustion was required.   The state\n\ndid not withdraw or alter its position, and the district court then\n\ndismissed the claims based on the state's position.\n\n           Having gained an advantage by obtaining the dismissal,\n\nthe state did not seek to clarify its position with the district\n\ncourt, but rather took advantage of the dismissal. By invoking R-S\n\ngrievance procedures (knowing that those procedures ultimately\n\n\n                               -30-\n\fprovided for federal judicial review) to obtain dismissal of a\n\nclaim      for    injunctive      relief,    and    then   participating   in   the\n\nadministrative process, the state has waived any immunity it may\n\nhave to a federal forum and prospective equitable relief.\n\n                 In   essence,     the      state    voluntarily     invoked    the\n\njurisdiction of a federal agency, the USDOE, and the federal courts\n\nin review of the agency determination, including their power to\n\ngrant prospective equitable relief, even though it was not formally\n\nthe   plaintiff        in   the   administrative       proceeding.     The     state\n\nvoluntarily put itself in the position of being a party in a\n\nfederal administrative forum whose actions would be reviewed in\n\nfederal court.         The state's actions expressed a clear choice to\n\nsubmit its rights for adjudication in the federal courts.13                       To\n\npermit the state to reverse course would contravene the reasons for\n\nthe doctrine of waiver by litigation conduct recognized by Lapides\n\nand Lapides's core concern that a state cannot selectively invoke\n\nits Eleventh Amendment immunity to gain litigation advantage.\n\nSee Lapides, 535 U.S. at 622-23; see also Gardner, 329 U.S. at 573-\n\n74; Wis.

To be clear, this case involves more\n\nthan a simple failure by the state to raise Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity in earlier proceedings; it involves a voluntary and\n\ncalculated choice by the state to gain the advantage of dismissal\n\nof the 1998 federal action for injunctive relief by arguing that\n\nthe remedies and grievance procedures of the R-S Act applied to\n\nclaims under the STA Act and that those procedures had to be\n\nexhausted.16   The state then entered those R-S Act procedures\n\nwithout a whimper of protest.

The\nvitality of the Ex parte Young doctrine is demonstrated by the\nSupreme Court's recent opinion in Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub.

Nonetheless, the state (and its\nagencies), faced with a claim for prospective equitable relief\nsince 1998, has never raised the argument that such relief is\navailable only against state officers. Indeed, the state moved to\nsubstitute itself as the party defendant. Its litigation conduct\ncould be viewed as estopping any objection that it may have to the\napplication of the Ex parte Young exception.\n\n                                -33-\n\fgained the advantage that it sought, is bound by the choice that it\n\nmade.\n\n      2.     Waiver of Prospective Equitable Relief in a Federal Forum\n             by Operation of the R-S Act\n\n             We also conclude that because the state is judicially\n\nestopped from denying that R-S grievance procedures apply to claims\n\nunder § 111(b) of the STA Act and the state has voluntarily\n\nparticipated in the R-S Act program, the state has waived any\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity it may have to awards of prospective\n\nequitable relief in a federal forum resulting from R-S grievance\n\nprocedures.       We do not decide the independent question whether the\n\nstate, solely by entering into agreements under the STA Act, has\n\nwaived     any    Eleventh   Amendment   immunity     that   it   has   to   the\n\nrequirements of the STA Act.\n\n             This case does not involve a situation in which the state\n\nmay   have   been    coerced   into   waiving   its    immunity    by   federal\n\nrequirements forcing it to choose between waiver and \"exclusion .\n\n. . from an otherwise permissible activity.\"           See Coll. Sav. Bank,\n\n527 U.S. at 687.       By its voluntary agreement and participation in\n\nthe federal program created by the R-S Act, the state has been\n\ngiven a right it would not otherwise have: access to federal\n\nproperty.        No argument is presented that, absent any agreement\n\notherwise, Congress could not constitutionally withhold that right\n\nfrom states.\n\n\n\n                                      -34-\n\f          Congress was quite clear in 20 U.S.C. § 107b that states\n\nparticipating in the R-S Act program \"shall . . . agree\" to submit\n\nany disputes that blind vendors may have regarding the vending\n\nprogram to the hearing and arbitration procedures set forth in 20\n\nU.S.C. § 107d-1.       The thrust of the state's argument is that even\n\nif it agreed to R-S grievance procedures, no relief of any sort can\n\nbe awarded against it as a result of those procedures.               The effect\n\nof this argument would be to render those procedures meaningless.\n\nNo court has ever agreed with the state's position that no relief\n\nmay be granted under R-S grievance procedures.\n\n             States whose SLAs apply to participate in the R-S Act\n\nmust have anticipated that by agreeing to the procedures, they\n\nagreed to some form of relief, at least prospective equitable\n\nrelief, against them even if they are named directly as parties.\n\nAfter all, \"[t]he only parties with whom blind vendors can have\n\ndisputes to submit to arbitration are states.\"                McNabb v.

Waiver of Eleventh Amendment Immunity From Damages\n\n     1.   Waiver of Immunity From Damages by Litigation Conduct\n\n          The   question   whether   the   state   has   waived   Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity from substantive liability for damages resolves\n\ndifferently on this record, largely because the Blind Vendors' 1998\n\ncomplaint in federal court contained no demand for damages.\n\n          No waiver occurred in the 1998 federal action.               The\n\ncomplaint in that action sought only injunctive relief and \"such\n\nother relief as is equitable and just.\"       The state was not put on\n\nnotice by the 1998 federal court complaint that damages were at\n\nissue in that federal court proceeding, and so had no reason to\n\nassert Eleventh Amendment immunity from damages. Indeed, the Blind\n\nVendors expressly stated that their claim in the federal court\n\naction encompassed only prospective injunctive relief.            The state\n\ncannot be said to have voluntarily waived immunity from damages\n\nwhen it faced no claim for damages at that time.\n\n          The argument that the state waived any immunity from\n\ndamages in the 1998 litigation is based on a perceived unfairness,\n\nwell-articulated by the USDOE as follows:\n\n          The State's decision to forego raising an immunity\n     argument allowed it to continue an illegal practice for\n     five years at the [Blind Vendors'] expense while\n     precluding any recovery for the blind vendors' losses.\n     If the State had raised and prevailed on a claim of\n     immunity   in   1998,   the   [Blind    Vendors]   would,\n     nevertheless, have been able to obtain prospective relief\n     under Ex parte Young.     By requiring that the [Blind\n     Vendors] pursue administrative remedies, the State\n     successfully postponed by years judicial resolution of\n\n                              -36-\n\f     the controversy. If the State is permitted to assert\n     immunity from the procedures it persuaded the district\n     court to require, it will have successfully deprived the\n     [Blind Vendors] of a judicial remedy to which it would\n     otherwise have been entitled.        The Supreme Court\n     established in Lapides that in situations of this kind,\n     the claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity has been waived.\n\nThis was clearly how the district court viewed the matter.\n\n          We agree that, for reasons explained above, unfairness\n\nwould occur if the state were permitted now to assert immunity to\n\nbar prospective equitable relief, but we think a closer analysis is\n\nrequired to determine if the same logic applies in the context of\n\nimmunity from damages. The operating assumption behind the USDOE's\n\nargument is that if the state had directly raised its Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity to damages in 1998, the Blind Vendors would\n\ninstead have sought only injunctive relief against state officers\n\nunder Ex parte Young and thus would not have had to go through the\n\nlengthy R-S grievance procedures.       But this assumption is wrong.\n\nExhaustion of R-S grievance procedures is required even when only\n\ninjunctive relief is sought.17    See Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\n\n\n     17\n          Of course, exhaustion would not be necessary if the\ndistrict court in 1998 had been wrong in finding that R-S grievance\nprocedures applied to an STA Act claim. In that case, the Blind\nVendors could argue that, had it not been for the state's arguments\nin its motion to dismiss, the Blind Vendors could have proceeded\ndirectly to the question whether there is a cause of action,\noutside of the R-S Act, for claims under § 111(b), and if so, would\nhave obtained injunctive relief in 1998 if successful on the\nmerits. The Blind Vendors could thus argue that the state's motion\nto dismiss caused delay. But, in that case, any such delay would\nhave been caused by the state's urging the court to apply R-S\ngrievance procedures, not its failure to raise Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.   And, in any event, for reasons explained later, we\n\n                                 -37-\n\fAmerica v. Weinberger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472980\"><a href=\"/opinion/472980/randolph-sheppard-vendors-of-america-v-caspar-w-weinberger-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93, 96 (D.C. Cir. 1986)\n\n(requiring exhaustion of R-S grievance procedures when plaintiffs\n\nsought only injunctive relief); see also 20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a) (R-S\n\ngrievance   procedures        apply    to    \"[a]ny   blind    licensee      who   is\n\ndissatisfied     with   any    action       arising   from    the    operation     or\n\nadministration of the vending facility program\" (emphasis added)).\n\nThe state's failure to assert immunity has made the Blind Vendors\n\nno worse off; it is the need for exhaustion, and not the failure to\n\nassert Eleventh Amendment immunity, that caused the delay.\n\n            Moreover, a finding of waiver in this situation would\n\nwork its own type of unfairness.            The Blind Vendors presumably did\n\nnot sue for damages in federal court because they were aware of\n\npotential Eleventh Amendment problems; instead, the Blind Vendors\n\nbrought a state court action seeking damages.                 And the state did,\n\nin 1998, allude to an Eleventh Amendment problem with a damages\n\naction in federal court.             In these circumstances, a finding of\n\nwaiver by litigation conduct would be unfair.\n\n            It   is   true    that    the    state    did    not    raise   Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity when damages were claimed before the state\n\nHearing Officer in the R-S grievance procedures.                      But at that\n\npoint, the state had already taken the position in federal court\n\nthat an award of damages in a federal proceeding would pose an\n\n\n\nconclude that R-S grievance procedures are properly applied to §\n111(b) claims.\n\n                                       -38-\n\fEleventh Amendment problem but that there would be no such problem\n\nin a state proceeding.\n\n          It is also true that the state did not immediately move\n\nbefore the USDOE arbitration panel to dismiss the Blind Vendors'\n\ndamages claims on Eleventh Amendment grounds.    But it did do so\n\neventually, and in light of its earlier posture in the controversy,\n\nwe cannot say the belated raising constitutes voluntary waiver by\n\nlitigation conduct.\n\n          Finally, the Blind Vendors, but not the USDOE, argue that\n\nthe state waived immunity simply by voluntarily seeking review of\n\nthe adverse administrative decision in this action in federal\n\ncourt.   They argue that if the state wanted to preserve its\n\nimmunity from damages, it should have simply waited for the Blind\n\nVendors to file an action in district court to enforce the award\n\nand then defended by asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity at that\n\npoint.\n\n          This argument -- that the seeking of judicial review of\n\nan agency decision under the APA by a state that was a defendant\n\nbefore the agency is sufficient alone to infer a waiver of immunity\n\nfrom damages -- fails, given the facts of this case.

Section 107d-2(b)(2) does not\n\nexpressly authorize an award of damages, nor does it expressly\n\nwaive the federal government's immunity from damages.                      Differing\n\nconclusions    can    be    drawn   about    the      state's   immunity     in    this\n\nstatutory scheme.\n\n            At best, there is disagreement as to whether the R-S Act\n\narbitration panels can award damages, with reasoned arguments made\n\non both sides.       Here, there is an additional layer of uncertainty.\n\nEven assuming that the R-S Act allows damages to be awarded against\n\nstates based on complaints by blind vendors, it is not clear\n\nwhether Congress intended in § 111(b) of the STA Act to subject\n\n\n     20\n          Delaware Dep't was decided in 1985, without foreknowledge\nof the Supreme Court's later articulation of tests for waiver of\nEleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n                                       -42-\n\fstates to damages awards for violations found in R-S grievance\n\nprocedures. Given Congress's silence in the STA Act itself and the\n\ndisagreement about damages under the R-S grievance procedures, we\n\ncannot, as a matter of statutory construction of the STA Act, find\n\nan intent to subject states to damages awards under the STA Act.\n\nSee Vermont Agency of Nat.
