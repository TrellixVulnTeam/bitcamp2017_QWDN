Petitioner Savry Keo seeks review\n\nof the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of\n\ndeportation.    Keo entered the United States on a visa in 1997 to\n\nvisit family.    Several months later, Keo applied for asylum with\n\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), claiming he\n\nfeared persecution in light of a violent coup d'état that had taken\n\nplace in his native Cambodia.          After a hearing, an Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) denied Keo's petition. The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion, and this petition\n\nfollowed.    We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            On June 6, 1997, Keo entered Los Angeles, California, to\n\nvisit his mother and younger sister for a month and then return to\n\nCambodia.    Only two days before his scheduled return flight, a\n\nbloody coup erupted in Cambodia during which the Cambodian People's\n\nParty (CPP) ousted from power the National United Front for a\n\nNeutral,    Peaceful,     Cooperative,         and   Independent    Cambodia\n\n(FUNCINPEC).    Keo declined to return to his home country, citing\n\nvarious news reports of violence directed toward FUNCINPEC members.\n\nApproximately   two   months   after     the    outbreak   of   fighting,   on\n\nSeptember 19, 1997, Keo submitted an application for asylum to the\n\nINS.\n\n            Keo was given an assessment interview on February 25,\n\n1999, after which the interviewing asylum officer recommended\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fagainst granting Keo asylum.       On March 2, 1999, the INS commenced\n\nremoval proceedings against Keo.           Keo acknowledged that he was\n\nremovable from the United States and sought asylum as well as\n\nwithholding of removal. On March 15, 2000, a hearing was conducted\n\non these issues before an IJ.\n\n           In Keo's asylum application and testimony, he explained\n\nthat he had been employed as a police officer in Cambodia since\n\n1980.    Starting    in   1993,   when    the    United   Nations   sponsored\n\nelections in Cambodia, Keo began to develop preliminary ties with\n\nFUNCINPEC.     He had previously been a member of the CPP because he\n\nviewed such political membership as a prerequisite to government\n\nemployment.     This suspicion was confirmed, according to Keo, when\n\nhe was suspended from his job for three months in 1993 due to his\n\ncontacts with the FUNCINPEC party.              As Keo later acknowledged,\n\nthough, this suspension was at least partially attributable to his\n\nfailure to follow direct orders.\n\n             After returning to work from his suspension, Keo did not\n\nreestablish his ties with the FUNCINPEC party until 1996.              At that\n\ntime, he \"secretly\" joined FUNCINPEC through conversations with his\n\ngeneral supervisor in the police department, Mr. Hosak, who Keo\n\ntestified was a prominent member of the FUNCINPEC party.               Shortly\n\nthereafter, Hosak promoted Keo to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel,\n\nwhich   resulted   in   Keo's   FUNCINPEC   membership      becoming    widely\n\nsuspected among his co-workers.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f          Keo testified that soon after learning of the CPP coup\n\nwhile in America, his wife, who remained in Cambodia, informed him\n\nthat Hosak had been killed and that he too would be in danger if he\n\nreturned to Cambodia. These warnings were substantiated, according\n\nto Keo, when a relative who had traveled from America to Cambodia\n\nreported that Keo remained an active target of the CPP due to his\n\naffiliations with FUNCINPEC, his status as a former CPP official,\n\nand his relationship with Hosak.         The relative also noted that\n\nseveral weeks after the coup, CPP forces had entered and searched\n\nKeo's home.   Additionally, Keo presented to the IJ three letters\n\nfrom people presently residing in Cambodia that indicated he would\n\nface imminent danger should he return.       In one letter, a colleague\n\nof Keo's from the police force wrote that his fellow officers\n\nbelieve him to be a \"traitor that . . . ran away from [his]\n\nresponsibilities, country and nation.\"       In another letter, written\n\nin 1999, Keo's uncle warned that the CPP \"army came to the village\n\n. . . about 4-5 times looking for you\" and \"will always [be]\n\nlooking for you.\"\n\n          After considering Keo's testimony and asylum application\n\nalong with    the   asylum   officer's   assessment   and   a   1999   State\n\nDepartment report on human rights practices in Cambodia, the IJ\n\nfound that Keo had \"not established that if he were to return to\n\nCambodia . . . he would be persecuted or [that he] has a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.\"      First, the IJ noted that while Keo\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fmight legitimately fear retaliation or prosecution for abandoning\n\nhis   job   as   a   police   officer,    such    fears    were     not   based     on\n\npolitically      motivated    persecution.         Second,    the    IJ    was     not\n\nconvinced that Keo's membership in FUNCINPEC was truly a matter of\n\npublic knowledge in Cambodia, pointing out that Keo had testified\n\nthat his membership was secret.               Third, the IJ pointed out that\n\neven assuming that \"it was not a secret that [Keo] was a member of\n\nthe FUNCINPEC Party, that party presently is part of a coalition in\n\nCambodia . . . and members of that party are sharing power with the\n\nCPP.\"    The IJ denied Keo's requests for asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval and granted his request for voluntary departure.\n\n            Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (a)(7) (2003) (formerly 8\n\nC.F.R. § 3.1(e)(4)), the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without\n\nopinion.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            When faced with a substantial evidence challenge, this\n\ncourt    reviews     BIA   decisions     to    determine     whether      they     are\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"                INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502\n\nU.S. 478, 481 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); Albathani\n\nv. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003).            Where, as here, the BIA\n\nhas     summarily    affirmed    without       opinion     under    8     C.F.R.     §\n\n1003.1(a)(7), we treat the findings and conclusions of the IJ as\n\nthose of the Board.        Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f2003).   As such, the IJ's determination must stand unless we \"find\n\nthat the evidence not only supports [petitioner's] conclusion, but\n\ncompels it.\"      Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n. 1; Albathani, 318\n\nF.3d at 371.\n\n           Only applicants who qualify as a \"refugee\" within the\n\nmeaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42) are entitled to asylum.          See id.\n\n§   1158(b)(1);    8   C.F.R.   §   208.13(a)   (2000).   Two   routes   are\n\navailable to meet this standard.         First, an applicant can qualify\n\nas a refugee if he or she carries the burden of demonstrating a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of one of five\n\nstatutory factors: race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion. Id. § 208.13(b)(1);\n\nEl Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 202-03 (1st Cir. 2003).             To\n\ndo so, an applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear is both\n\ngenuine and objectively reasonable. See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168\n\nF.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).         Alternatively, an applicant has a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution if he or\n\nshe carries the burden of showing past persecution on the basis of\n\none of the statutory factors.           El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 202-03;\n\nYatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           Although Keo claimed in his asylum application that he\n\nwas subject to past persecution from 1975 until 1979 at the hands\n\nof the Khmer Rouge, his appeal rests primarily on the claim that he\n\nhas a well-founded fear of future persecution. Keo argues that the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fIJ's conclusion to the contrary was not based on substantial\n\nevidence and that the IJ improperly relied on adverse credibility\n\ndeterminations that were the result of difficulties in translating\n\nKeo's testimony from Khmer to English.   After a careful review of\n\nthe record, we find that the evidence does not compel a conclusion\n\ncontrary to that reached by the IJ, and thus we affirm.\n\n          Even if Keo has a genuine fear of returning to his native\n\nCambodia, the record does not compel the conclusion that this fear\n\nderives from the threat of persecution on the basis of Keo's\n\npolitical beliefs.    As the IJ noted in his decision, and as Keo\n\nadmitted in his testimony, the FUNCINPEC party now retains some\n\nauthority in a new coalition government that formed in Cambodia in\n\nNovember 1998.     Keo's status as a member of FUNCINPEC does not\n\ncompel the conclusion that he would be in danger should he return\n\nto Cambodia. Moreover, the IJ had sufficient evidence to find that\n\nKeo's ties to FUNCINPEC are not a matter of public knowledge in\n\nCambodia. Accepting that some of Keo's testimony was ambiguous due\n\nto translation difficulties, Keo was ultimately quite clear that he\n\ndid not officially join FUNCINPEC until 1996, and, even then, did\n\nso secretly.     And while Keo also testified that this secret was\n\ndiscovered when Hosak promoted him, the IJ had sufficient evidence\n\nto find that Keo had not met his burden of establishing that his\n\nFUNCINPEC membership was a matter of public knowledge.    Finally,\n\nmuch of the evidence that Keo presented -- in particular the three\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fletters warning him of danger should he return to Cambodia --\n\nsuggested that any danger Keo might face in Cambodia would stem\n\nfrom his co-workers' perception that he \"abandoned\" his country by\n\nnot returning to his official duties after the coup.             As both the\n\nIJ and the interviewing asylum officer noted, any such reaction is\n\nnot based on Keo's race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\n\n           For the same reasons, we decline to upset the IJ's\n\nrefusal to grant withholding of removal.       See Mediouni v. INS, 314\n\nF.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Because the standard for withholding\n\ndeportation is more stringent than that for asylum, a petitioner\n\nunable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy\n\nthe former.\" (internal quotations omitted)).\n\n                                   III.\n\n           We affirm the decision of the BIA denying the application\n\nfor   asylum   and   withholding   of   removal;   the   order   permitting\n\nvoluntary departure stands.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

Keo entered the United States on a visa in 1997 to visit family. Several months later, Keo applied for asylum with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), claiming he feared persecution in light of a violent coup d'&#233;tat that had taken place in his native Cambodia. After a hearing, an Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Keo's petition. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion, and this petition followed. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 1997, Keo entered Los Angeles, California, to visit his mother and younger sister for a month and then return to Cambodia. Only two days before his scheduled return flight, a bloody coup erupted in Cambodia during which the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) ousted from power the National United Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent Cambodia (FUNCINPEC). Keo declined to return to his home country, citing various news reports of violence directed toward FUNCINPEC members. Approximately two months after the outbreak of fighting, on September 19, 1997, Keo submitted an application for asylum to the INS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keo was given an assessment interview on February 25, 1999, after which the interviewing asylum officer recommended against granting Keo asylum. On March 2, 1999, the INS commenced removal proceedings against Keo. Keo acknowledged that he was removable from the United States and sought asylum as well as withholding of removal. On March 15, 2000, a hearing was conducted on these issues before an IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Keo's asylum application and testimony, he explained that he had been employed as a police officer in Cambodia since 1980. Starting in 1993, when the United Nations sponsored elections in Cambodia, Keo began to develop preliminary ties with FUNCINPEC. He had previously been a member of the CPP because he viewed such political membership as a prerequisite to government employment. This suspicion was confirmed, according to Keo, when he was suspended from his job for three months in 1993 due to his contacts with the FUNCINPEC party. As Keo later acknowledged, though, this suspension was at least partially attributable to his failure to follow direct orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After returning to work from his suspension, Keo did not reestablish his ties with the FUNCINPEC party until 1996. At that time, he \"secretly\" joined FUNCINPEC through conversations with his general supervisor in the police department, Mr. Hosak, who Keo testified was a prominent member of the FUNCINPEC party. Shortly thereafter, Hosak promoted Keo to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, which resulted in Keo's FUNCINPEC membership becoming widely suspected among his co-workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keo testified that soon after learning of the CPP coup while in America, his wife, who remained in Cambodia, informed him that Hosak had been killed and that he too would be in danger if he returned to Cambodia. These warnings were substantiated, according to Keo, when a relative who had traveled from America to Cambodia reported that Keo remained an active target of the CPP due to his affiliations with FUNCINPEC, his status as a former CPP official, and his relationship with Hosak. The relative also noted that several weeks after the coup, CPP forces had entered and searched Keo's home. Additionally, Keo presented to the IJ three letters from people presently residing in Cambodia that indicated he would face imminent danger should he return. In one letter, a colleague of Keo's from the police force wrote that his fellow officers believe him to be a \"traitor that ... ran away from [his] responsibilities, country and nation.\" In another letter, written in 1999, Keo's uncle warned that the CPP \"army came to the village ... about 4-5 times looking for you\" and \"will always [be] looking for you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering Keo's testimony and asylum application along with the asylum officer's assessment and a 1999 State Department report on human rights practices in Cambodia, the IJ found that Keo had \"not established that if he were to return to Cambodia ... he would be persecuted or [that he] has a well-founded fear of persecution.\" First, the IJ noted that while Keo might legitimately fear retaliation or prosecution for abandoning his job as a police officer, such fears were not based on politically motivated persecution. Second, the IJ was not convinced that Keo's membership in FUNCINPEC was truly a matter of public knowledge in Cambodia, pointing out that Keo had testified that his membership was secret. Third, the IJ pointed out that even assuming that \"it was not a secret that [Keo] was a member of the FUNCINPEC Party, that party presently is part of a coalition in Cambodia ... and members of that party are sharing power with the CPP.\" The IJ denied Keo's requests for asylum and withholding of removal and granted his request for voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) (2003) (formerly 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(e)(4)), the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When faced with a substantial evidence challenge, this court reviews BIA decisions to determine whether they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v.

Two routes are available to meet this standard. First, an applicant can qualify as a refugee if he or she carries the burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of one of five statutory factors: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 208.13(b)(1); <i>El Moraghy v.

Keo argues that the IJ's conclusion to the contrary was not based on substantial evidence and that the IJ improperly relied on adverse credibility determinations that were the result of difficulties in translating Keo's testimony from Khmer to English. After a careful review of the record, we find that the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ, and thus we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Keo has a genuine fear of returning to his native Cambodia, the record does not compel the conclusion that this fear derives from the threat of persecution on the basis of Keo's political beliefs. As the IJ noted in his decision, and as Keo admitted in his testimony, the FUNCINPEC party now retains some authority in a new coalition government that formed in Cambodia in November 1998. Keo's status as a member of FUNCINPEC does not compel the conclusion that he would be in danger should he return to Cambodia. Moreover, the IJ had sufficient evidence to find that Keo's ties to FUNCINPEC are not a matter of public knowledge in Cambodia. Accepting that some of Keo's testimony was ambiguous due to translation difficulties, Keo was ultimately quite clear that he did not officially join FUNCINPEC until 1996, and, even then, did so secretly. And while Keo also testified that this secret was discovered when Hosak promoted him, the IJ had sufficient evidence to find that Keo had not met his burden of establishing that his FUNCINPEC membership was a matter of public knowledge. Finally, much of the evidence that Keo presented &#8212; in particular the three letters warning him of danger should he return to Cambodia &#8212; suggested that any danger Keo might face in Cambodia would stem from his co-workers' perception that he \"abandoned\" his country by not returning to his official duties after the coup.
