LOVELY,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Elaine Mittleman on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 26, 2009\n\f      Per Curiam.    Defendant-appellant Michael Lovely appeals from\n\nhis sentence, arguing that the district court did not recognize it\n\nhad discretion to reduce a career criminal offender Guideline\n\nsentence and that it did not sufficiently take into consideration\n\nLovely's background in sentencing him.          The sentence is affirmed.\n\n      We review questions of law, such as the legal meaning of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines, de novo.            See United States v. Vazquez-\n\nBotet, 532 F.3d 37, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).        Review of findings of fact\n\nis for clear error, United States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 575 (1st\n\nCir. 1996), and appellate review of the overall sentence is for\n\nreasonableness. United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\nApplication of 28 U.S.C. § 994(h)\n\n      There was no error in the court's imposition of a Guideline\n\nsentence.   The court recognized that the Guidelines were advisory\n\nonly. During the Guideline calculations, the court made clear that\n\nit understood the Guideline range to be advisory in the context of\n\nthe application of career criminal offender statute, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n994(h), stating, \"[994(h) is] not determinative.            It doesn't set a\n\nminimum. It's not a mandatory.\" The court properly considered the\n\nGuideline range in determining the sentence imposed.              As we have\n\nrecently noted in a career offender case, sentencing judges now\n\nhave \"considerable leeway to vary from the Guidelines range,\" but\n\nthe   Guidelines    remain   the   starting   point   for   any   sentencing\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdecision, and \"the Guidelines range may substantially influence a\n\nparticular defendant's sentence, especially when large increases\n\nimposed on career offenders are involved.\"                    United States v.\n\nGiggey, 551 F.3d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n\n      18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4) requires sentencing courts to consider\n\nthe category of the defendant as set forth in the Guidelines, and\n\n§   3553(a)(5)   requires      consideration      of   \"any   pertinent   policy\n\nstatement...issued        by   the   Sentencing        Commission.\"       Policy\n\nstatements in the guidelines follow the mandate to the Commission\n\nin 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) to \"assure that the guidelines specify a\n\nsentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term\" for\n\ncareer   offenders   as    defined   in     the   statute.      The   background\n\ncommentary to USSG § 4B1.1, the career criminal offender guideline,\n\nmakes clear that the guideline implements the directive of the\n\nstatute.   While not decisive, \"[p]olicy statements issued by the\n\nSentencing Commission are, of course, pertinent to sentencing\n\ndeterminations even under the now-advisory guidelines.\"                   United\n\nStates v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(5)).    The Supreme Court has also emphasized the need for\n\nsentencing courts to follow the factors outlined in § 3553(a). See\n\nKimbrough v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 558, 570 (2007) (\"while [§\n\n3553(a)] still requires a court to give respectful consideration to\n\nthe Guidelines,..., Booker permits the court to tailor the sentence\n\nin light of other statutory concerns\") (emphasis supplied).                 The\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fcourt here properly assessed the 3553(a) factors, including the\n\nCongressional intent evidenced in the policy statements, and it\n\nalso maintained that the Guideline range was advisory.\n\n       The court's discussion with the parties about the appropriate\n\nrole of § 994(h) does not demonstrate that it failed to understand\n\nits discretion, only that it sought guidance about how best to\n\nincorporate the statutory directive in its application of the\n\nadvisory Guidelines.        The court made clear its own understanding\n\nthat    the   Guidelines     themselves     were     advisory   but     sought\n\nclarification from counsel on whether he could \"just ignore\" the\n\nlanguage of § 994(h).       The parties replied that § 994(h) had to be\n\nconsidered.      The court did just that, assessing it in the context\n\nof the factors expressed in § 3553(a).            There was no error.\n\nReasonableness of the Sentence\n\n       Lovely also claims that the district court \"did not address\n\nthe complete disconnect\" between his Career Offender predicates and\n\nhis    offense    conduct    and   failed    to     \"discuss    the   special\n\ncircumstances of those crimes\" in imposing the sentence.                 This\n\nclaim fails because the district court directly and reasonably\n\naddressed Lovely's concerns at sentencing.              It noted first, in\n\nresponse to the defense's argument for a departure on the grounds\n\nthat Lovely's risk of recidivism was low,\n\n       I do not find departure appropriate. I don't find any\n       overrepresentatation of criminal history here.    The\n       recidivism that Mr. Lovely has shown and the violence\n       that he has shown suggests that the criminal history\n\n                                    -4-\n\f     calculation is appropriate, and I don't find that the\n     circumstances here do justify a [§] 5K2.0 departure.\n\nThe court was within its discretion to choose not to impose a\n\ndeparture.    Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.      The district court\n\nsimilarly    considered   defendant's   arguments   that   Lovely   was\n\ndifferent because he dealt primarily marijuana, not crack, and\n\nbecause he accepted responsibility for his conduct and cooperated\n\nwith authority.    The court concluded that these factors could be\n\nappropriately addressed with the selection of a sentence within the\n\nGuideline range.   The court's sentence was not unreasonable.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
