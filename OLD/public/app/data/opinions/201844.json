José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n           Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Godwin Aldarondo-Girald, with whom Aldarondo Girald Law Office\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Gregory T. Usera, with whom Lourdes C. Hernández-Venegas and\nSchuster Usera & Aguiló LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         October 7, 2005\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Appellant Bolívar Ramírez Rodríguez\n\n(Ramírez) filed an age discrimination claim against his former\n\nemployer,     Boehringer   Ingelheim     Pharmaceuticals,    Inc.   (BIPI),\n\npursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 621-634, and Puerto Rico law. The district court granted\n\nsummary judgment for BIPI on the ground that Ramírez had not\n\nestablished a prima facie case of discrimination.           Alternatively,\n\neven if he had made such a case, the district court ruled that he\n\nhad not presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that\n\nBIPI's proffered non-discriminatory reason for terminating him was\n\npretextual.     On appeal, Ramírez challenges the summary judgment\n\norder, as well as an array of rulings by the district court on\n\nevidentiary issues.    We affirm on the alternative ground set forth\n\nby the district court.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            We take the following facts from the summary judgment\n\nrecord,   presenting   them   in   the   light   most   favorable   to   the\n\nappellant and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.            See\n\nGonzalez-Pina v. Rodriguez, 407 F.3d 425, 431 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Ramírez was born on March 23, 1951.           He worked as a\n\nprofessional sales representative (PSR) for BIPI from November 1,\n\n1977 to August 15, 2001, when he was terminated.          As the district\n\ncourt explained, Ramirez's \"principal activity\" as a PSR was\n\n\"promoting [BIPI's] products by conducting visits to physicians,\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fhospitals, and pharmacies, educating health professionals about\n\n[BIPI's] products, and providing product samples.\"      Ramírez, like\n\nall of the PSRs, was assigned to a particular geographic territory.\n\nAt the time of his termination, he was assigned to the southwest\n\nregion of Puerto Rico. Relevant to this case, BIPI policy requires\n\nPSRs to obtain a signed Sample Signature Document (SSD) each time\n\nthey provide drug samples to a doctor.     The SSD must be completed\n\nin full in the PSR's presence.   BIPI's sampling policy is designed\n\nto comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing\n\nAct (PDMA), 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq.1\n\n          Before   1999,   Ramírez     routinely   received   positive\n\nperformance evaluations for his work.      In his 1999 evaluation of\n\nRamírez,2 district manager Valeriano García (García) -- the BIPI\n\n\n     1\n      The PDMA regulates, inter alia, distribution of samples of\nprescription drugs to physicians.     It permits manufacturers and\nauthorized   distributors   to    provide   samples   to   licensed\npractitioners only upon written request \"made on a form which\ncontains the practitioner's name, address, and professional\ndesignation, the identity of the drug sample requested, the\nquantity of drug samples requested, the name of the manufacturer or\nauthorized distributor of the drug sample, the date of the request\nand signature of the practitioner making the request.\" 21 U.S.C.\n§ 353(d)(3)(A).    The PDMA also requires drug manufacturers and\ndistributors to \"conduct, at least annually, a complete and\naccurate inventory of all drug samples in the possession of [their]\nrepresentatives\" and to \"maintain records for at least 3 years of\nall drug samples distributed, destroyed, or returned to the\nmanufacturer or distributor, of all inventories maintained under\nthis subparagraph, of all thefts or significant losses of drug\nsamples, and of all requests [made by a practitioner pursuant to 21\nU.S.C. § 353(d)(3)(A)] for drug samples.\" 21 U.S.C. § 353(d)(C).\n     2\n      Although the evaluation covered the 1999 calendar year, it\nwas actually completed in March 2000.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fDistrict Manager for Puerto Rico and Miami, and Ramírez's direct\n\nsupervisor -- rated Ramírez as meeting expectations in most areas.\n\nHowever,   García   also   raised   several    concerns   about   Ramírez's\n\nperformance.    Specifically, García noted that Ramírez \"[d]id not\n\ncall on [doctors in his territory] other than [in] Ponce and\n\nMayagüez,\" that he \"[d]id not follow 4 week cycle plan [for\n\nvisiting doctors] as instructed,\" and that he was \"[o]ver-sampling\n\ntargets and non-targets.\"3       García noted similar concerns, in more\n\ndetail, in an email he sent on January 31, 2000 to Antonio\n\nHernández, another District Manager in Florida, and Noel Díaz, who\n\nwas slated to assume García's duties in the Commonwealth in the\n\nnewly-created   position    of    District    Manager   for   Puerto   Rico.\n\nAlthough Ramírez questioned the basis for these concerns when he\n\nreceived his evaluation, the record does not indicate that he\n\npursued his objections any further.\n\n           Díaz became the District Manager for Puerto Rico, and\n\ntherefore Ramírez's direct supervisor, on February 28, 2000.             In\n\nMarch 2000, BIPI informed Ramírez and the other PSRs that it was\n\nrestructuring the Puerto Rico sales region to accommodate an\n\nexpansion in the size of the sales force, i.e., an increase from 5\n\n\n\n     3\n      In its brief, BIPI explains that \"oversampling means the\nexcessive distribution of drug samples to specific doctors.\" The\nprimary reason BIPI writes its policies to prevent oversampling is\nthat \"it would permit certain doctors to obtain more samples than\nare necessary for their practice, thus opening the door to illegal\nsample distribution and/or sales.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\fPSRs to 7 PSRs.      As a result of the restructuring, Ramírez lost the\n\ncity of Ponce and gained the municipality of Arecibo.\n\n              Also in March 2000, Díaz asserted that Ramírez had failed\n\nto timely renew his car registration and driver's license and\n\ntherefore was driving his company car without valid documentation.\n\nAs    a    result   of   Díaz's    assertion,    Ramírez    also   received   an\n\nadmonishing email from Larry Wood, BIPI's Regional Director for the\n\nSoutheast Region. Ramírez responded by submitting evidence that he\n\nhad renewed both his license and registration on time.              In a letter\n\nto Wood, Ramírez described the accusations as \"baseless and only\n\nlaunched with ulterior motives as part of a personal agenda to\n\nterminate my employment.\"\n\n              On April 5, 2000, while the dispute regarding the license\n\nand       registration   was      ongoing,    Ramírez   suffered    a   stroke.\n\nAttributing the stroke to the stress of an argument with Díaz,\n\nRamírez applied for treatment under the State Insurance Fund,\n\nPuerto Rico's workmen's compensation program.\n\n              On April 6, 2000, Díaz reported to Wood additional\n\nconcerns about Ramírez's sampling practices.               Specifically, in an\n\nemail to Wood, Díaz reported that (1) Ramírez's physician database\n\nwas composed largely of primary care physicians rather than the\n\nsub-specialists who would be expected to receive a large proportion\n\nof samples, (2) 50% of the physician listings in the database had\n\nonly postal, not physical, addresses, and (3) Ramírez did not\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fappear to be contacting important specialized physicians.                Díaz\n\nalso reported talking to two cardiologists who had asked Ramírez\n\nnot to return to their offices after he asked them to sign\n\nconfirmation documents, i.e., SSDs, that overstated the number of\n\nsamples that he had provided.         In the email, Díaz speculated that\n\nRamírez was \"maintain[ing] a base of physicians that allow him to\n\ndump large amounts of samples.          In return he gets four or five\n\nsigned slips without date.       He then allocates the signed slips on\n\na monthly basis and enters them accordingly to the system.\"              Díaz\n\nalso expressed concerns about Ramírez's storage of samples.\n\n             On May 8, 2000, Wood sent a letter instructing Ramírez to\n\nmove his samples within five days from his mother's house to a\n\ncommercial storage facility.          Acknowledging that Ramírez was on\n\nshort-term disability leave, Wood offered to arrange for the\n\nsamples to be moved if Ramírez was unable to transport them\n\nhimself.     At the time, Ramírez was the only PSR in Puerto Rico who\n\ndid not store his samples in a commercial facility.             In a letter\n\ndated May 19, 2000, Ramírez responded that his previous District\n\nManager had approved the storage arrangement.                In the letter,\n\nRamírez    also   noted   that   he    felt   \"persecuted,    harassed    and\n\ndiscriminated by Mr. Noel Díaz because of my age and time with the\n\ncompany.\"4    Wood replied to Ramírez's letter on June 9, 2000.            He\n\n\n     4\n      Ramírez again described Díaz as harassing him in a June 7,\n2000 letter to Wood regarding the dispute over whether Ramírez had\ntimely renewed his driver's license.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fassured     Ramírez     that     he     would        investigate        the    claims   of\n\npersecution, harassment and discrimination, but reiterated that\n\nRamírez had to move his samples. Wood also cautioned that \"failure\n\nto follow my directive may constitute insubordination, which can\n\nresult in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.\"\n\nRamírez ultimately moved the samples.\n\n            Wood    and      Ramírez    met     on    July    13,     2000     to   discuss\n\nRamírez's complaints of harassment and discrimination. In a letter\n\ndated September 19, 2000, Wood indicated that \"both prior and\n\nsubsequent to our July 13th meeting, I conducted an investigation\n\nof your allegations of discrimination and harassment.                           Please be\n\nadvised that after careful investigation, I found no support for\n\nyour allegations that you have been subject to discriminatory or\n\nharassing behavior by [Díaz] or by any Company employee.\"\n\n            On October 6, 2000, BIPI informed Ramírez that he would\n\nbe   laid   off    as   of    October     13,    2000       because     his    short-term\n\ndisability    benefits        were     expiring       and    he   had    not    \"provided\n\ndocumentation that enables [his] return to work.\"                        On October 10,\n\n2000, Ramírez informed Díaz that he had received authorization from\n\nthe State Insurance Fund to return to work the following day.\n\nAccordingly, Ramírez returned to work from short-term disability\n\nleave on October 11, 2000.\n\n            Díaz, Hernández, and Wood met with Ramírez on October 20,\n\n2000 to outline a series of directives with which Ramírez had to\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fcomply upon returning to work and to establish deadlines for\n\ncompletion of those directives.        On May 10, 2001, Díaz informed\n\nWood that he and Hernández had visited several doctors in Ramírez's\n\nsales territory and that the doctors had reported irregularities in\n\nRamírez's sampling practice.          According to Díaz, the doctors\n\nreported that Ramírez left blank SSDs to be signed outside his\n\npresence or asked them to sign undated SSDs, both violations of\n\nBIPI policy, which is designed to ensure compliance with federal\n\nregulations.\n\n            Also on May 10, 2001, Ramírez asserted that pursuant to\n\nan order by Díaz, he had not received any literature or promotional\n\nmaterials since December 2000. In a letter to Wood, Díaz responded\n\nthat he had arranged to stop delivery of promotional materials and\n\nsamples to Ramírez while he was on short-term disability leave.\n\nDíaz   maintained   that   Ramírez   \"started   to   receive   his   normal\n\nshipments\" upon his return to work in October 2000 and that he did\n\nnot know why Ramírez had not received his December 2000 order.\n\nDíaz also indicated that he had again arranged to stop delivery of\n\nsamples and material to Ramírez as of May 10, 2001 based on the\n\ndoctors' reports regarding Ramírez's sampling practices.\n\n            On June 13, 2001, Ramírez filed a claim with the Anti-\n\nDiscrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (ADU),\n\nalleging that Díaz\n\n       began a series of harassing acts against me [in February\n       2000] . . . due to my age. These acts on the part of the\n\n                                     -8-\n\f     company, by means of [Díaz and Wood], consisted in\n     changing my sales region in a manner which was\n     disadvantageous to myself . . .; forcing to change the\n     place of storing my samples to Ponce, in spite of the\n     fact that my residence and seat of operations is in\n     Mayaguez; make or promote accusations of insubordination\n     when I complained about the treatment that I was\n     receiving; false pointing out of negligence in the use of\n     my car and improper intervention with my treatment by the\n     State Insurance Fund . . . [w]hen I was in my disability\n     caused by a stroke [that] occurred during a heavy\n     discussion with Mr. Díaz.\n\n            During    August   2001,    Díaz    continued    to    investigate\n\nRamírez's sampling practices.           On August 15, 2001, Ramírez was\n\nterminated.     In a letter confirming Ramírez's termination, Wood\n\nattributed the decision to his \"violation of the Prescription Drug\n\nMarketing     Act    and   Company   policy    as   it   relates    to   sample\n\ndistribution    and    documentation.\"         Following    his   termination,\n\nRamírez amended his ADU claim to include a charge of retaliation.\n\n            Ramírez filed the present suit in the federal district\n\ncourt for the District of Puerto Rico on August 20, 2002, alleging\n\nviolations of the ADEA and Puerto Rico law.              BIPI filed a motion\n\nfor summary judgment on February 9, 2004, and Ramírez filed an\n\nopposition to the motion on April 2, 2004.           On September 24, 2004,\n\nthe court found that Ramírez had not established a prima facie case\n\nof age discrimination and that, even if Ramírez had made his prima\n\nfacie case, he had not demonstrated that BIPI's asserted non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for terminating him -- i.e., violations of\n\nthe PDMA and company sampling policies -- was pretextual.                   The\n\ncourt also found that Ramírez's retaliation claim was flawed for\n\n                                       -9-\n\fessentially the same reasons, namely that he had not made a prima\n\nfacie showing that he was dismissed in retaliation for filing a\n\nclaim with the ADU and that, even if he could make such a prima\n\nfacie showing, he had not established that BIPI's asserted non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual.             Accordingly,\n\nthe court granted summary judgment for BIPI on all claims.                  This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           On appeal, Ramírez challenges not only the merits of the\n\ndistrict court's summary judgment ruling, but also its handling of\n\nseveral   discovery   and   evidentiary     issues.     We    turn    to   those\n\npreliminary issues first.\n\nA.         Motion to compel discovery\n\n           In defending against the claim of discrimination and\n\nretaliation, BIPI has asserted that it terminated Ramírez solely\n\nbecause of violations of the PDMA and company sampling policy.\n\nThis claim of violations rests on written statements by three\n\nphysicians   regarding      Ramírez's     improper    sampling       practices.\n\nAlthough BIPI disclosed the statements to Ramírez during discovery,\n\nit did so only after redacting the physicians' names and addresses,\n\nciting the physicians' concerns that Ramírez might seek reprisal\n\nagainst them if he learned their identities.                 Ramírez filed a\n\nmotion to compel discovery of the identifying information, arguing\n\nthat he had a right to \"know all the details related to th[e]\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fstatements, and to depose, if necessary, those physicians who\n\nallegedly prepared said statements.\"         BIPI opposed the motion and\n\nsought a protective order. The district court denied the motion to\n\ncompel and granted the protective order.                 On appeal, Ramírez\n\nassigns error to the denial of his motion to compel and the\n\ncorresponding grant of a protective order.          Reviewing the court's\n\nruling under the deferential abuse of discretion standard, see\n\nAyala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n1996), we reject Ramírez's claim.\n\n              Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n\npermits the district court to grant a protective order in the\n\ndiscovery context for \"good cause shown.\"                The district court\n\nexplained that it was granting BIPI's request for protection to\n\n\"safeguard what appears to be a legitimate concern for defendant,\"\n\ni.e.,   the    physicians'   fear   of   reprisal   by   Ramírez.   Ramírez\n\nchallenges the court's explanation on the grounds that BIPI \"did\n\nnot submit any supporting document or specific fact to sustain the\n\n[physicians'] alleged 'fears'\" of reprisal, and therefore did not\n\nshow good cause for the order.           He further faults the district\n\ncourt for \"fail[ing] to discuss whether the producing party's\n\nburden of production and its interests outweighed the opposing\n\nparty's right to obtain the information sought.\"\n\n              While it perhaps would have been preferable for the\n\ndistrict court to explain its decision to grant a protective order\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fin more depth, see United States v. Microsoft Corp., 165 F.3d 952,\n\n959-60 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (noting that Rule 26(c) requires \"an\n\nindividualized balancing of the many interests that may be present\n\nin a particular case\"), its failure to do so does not affect our\n\nanalysis.     FDIC v. Ogden Corp., 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(noting that \"[w]e have thus far refused to insist upon a rigid\n\nrule\"    precluding      summary      disposition     of   pre-trial     discovery\n\nmotions). As we have repeatedly stated, \"[i]t is well settled that\n\nthe   trial    judge    has   broad    discretion     in   ruling   on   pre-trial\n\nmanagement matters.\" Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 91. Here, the court\n\nused its discretion to craft an order tailored to the situation it\n\nfaced.        Although    that     order   denied     Ramírez   access     to   the\n\nphysicians' identifying information, the court indicated that the\n\norder was merely a \"temporary remedy . . . [that] may be modified\n\nif    adequate   safeguards      are   offered\"     and    specifically    invited\n\nRamírez's     counsel    to   \"propose     to   the    court    alternatives     to\n\nsafeguard what appears to be a legitimate concern for defendant.\"\n\nThe court also emphasized that it \"remains open to solutions.\"                   In\n\nshort, the court did not treat its protective order as definitively\n\nprecluding Ramírez from engaging in further discovery regarding the\n\nstatements. Rather, the court expressed a willingness to work with\n\nRamírez to balance the physicians' privacy and safety concerns with\n\nhis interest in conducting discovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f          Notwithstanding the court's explicit invitation, Ramírez\n\ndoes not appear to have suggested any alternative methods by which\n\nhe could conduct discovery regarding the physician statements. The\n\nreason for this omission is not clear from the record.   If Ramírez\n\nfelt that he did not have enough time to respond to the court's\n\ninvitation before addressing BIPI's motion for summary judgment --\n\nwhich was pending when the court issued the protective order5 -- he\n\ncould have informed the court of his situation by means of a motion\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).6     It is undisputed\n\nthat he did not file such a motion.      Instead, Ramírez filed a\n\nmotion in limine with his opposition to the summary judgment\n\nmotion, seeking to exclude the physicians' statements entirely on\n\nthe ground that he had been \"denied his right to discover relevant\n\ninformation and to confront the alleged evidence in which Defendant\n\n\n     5\n      We supply the following dates to provide a brief chronology\nof the discovery dispute.     Ramírez filed his motion to compel\ndiscovery on December 5, 2003. BIPI requested the protective order\non January 16, 2004.     Ramírez filed his opposition to BIPI's\nrequest on January 28, 2004.        BIPI submitted the physician\nstatements to the court under seal on January 29, 2004. Ramírez\nopposed the filing under seal on February 3, 2004. BIPI filed a\nmotion for summary judgment on February 9, 2004, while the motions\nregarding the physician statements were still pending. The court\ngranted the protective order on March 3, 2004. Ramírez filed his\nopposition to summary judgment, along with a motion in limine\nseeking to exclude the physician statements, on March 31, 2004.\n     6\n      \"Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the\nmotion [for summary judgment] that the party cannot for reasons\nstated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's\nopposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or\nmay order a continuance . . . or may make such other order as is\njust.\"\n\n                               -13-\n\fattempts to sustain its nondiscriminatory reason to discharge him.\"\n\nNowhere in the motion in limine did Ramírez acknowledge the court's\n\nwillingness to consider alternative avenues by which he could\n\ndiscover information relating to the statements or request more\n\ntime to proffer such alternatives.\n\n              It is troubling that Ramirez did not have an opportunity\n\nto challenge the doctor's accounts that led to his termination.\n\nWhile this case is not about whether the statements are true or\n\nnot,    see   infra    Section   II.B.2,    evidence    of   falsity    would     be\n\nrelevant      to   a   claim   that   BIPI's   professed     reliance       on   the\n\nstatements was a pretext for age discrimination. Ramírez, however,\n\nbears substantial responsibility for his own predicament because of\n\nhis failure to respond to the court's invitation for proposals for\n\nmodification of the protective order.                  In light of Ramírez's\n\nfailure to take advantage of this opportunity, his claim that the\n\ncourt    abused    its   discretion    in   denying    his   motion    to   compel\n\ndiscovery and granting the protective order rings hollow.                        Cf.\n\nMass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am.

Motion in limine\n\n           As noted, Ramírez filed a motion in limine, concurrently\n\nwith his opposition to summary judgment, seeking to exclude the\n\nphysicians' statements and other evidence as inadmissible under the\n\nFederal   Rules   of   Evidence.    Ramírez   asserts   that   the   court\n\nimplicitly rejected the motion by considering the disputed evidence\n\nin its order granting summary judgment, and that the rejection was\n\nerroneous.   We review for an abuse of discretion.        White v. N.H.\n\nDep't of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           1. Evidence at issue\n\n           In his motion in limine, Ramírez sought to exclude\n\nevidence relating to his alleged sampling irregularities in 1999\n\nand the unidentified physicians' statements, as described below.7\n\n           a. Sales report\n\n           BIPI's Proposed Statement of Uncontested Facts included\n\nthe following assertions:\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Ramírez also sought to exclude a sentence in BIPI's proposed\nstatement of uncontested facts relating to BIPI's decision to\nterminate another PSR, Zoe Corretjer, for \"similar reasons as those\nthat led to plaintiff's termination.\" Ramírez asserts on appeal\nthat the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion\nwith regard to that sentence. We need not reach this claim. There\nis no indication in the record that the court denied the motion to\nexclude the statement regarding Corretjer's termination. To the\ncontrary, given that the district court did not refer to\nCorretjer's termination in its order granting summary judgment, it\nappears that the court granted that aspect of Ramírez's motion in\nlimine.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f     15. On January 19, 2000, [Ramírez's then-supervisor]\n     Garcia made an email request to [BIPI sales analyst] Rita\n     Riberio, to provide him with the total amount of samples\n     given of each product by each sales representative in\n     Puerto Rico during 1999. Riberio answered said inquiry,\n     also [by] email, on January 28, 2000. . . .\n\n     16. The information provided by Riberio indicated\n     peculiarities with several PSRs, including Ramírez. . . .\n     This information led García to conclude that plaintiff\n     could be incurring in the practice known in the industry\n     as \"oversampling,\" and that he may not be complying with\n     his assigned territory. On January 31, 2000, [García]\n     communicated these concerns by email to Antonio\n     Hernández, District Manager in Florida, and Noel Díaz,\n     who would shortly become District Manager in Puerto Rico.\n     . . .\n\n     . . .\n\n     23. During a meeting held on March 28, 2000 in Miami,\n     Noel Díaz discussed his concerns regarding Valeriano\n     García's January 2000 communications in connection with\n     plaintiff's apparent oversampling with Larry Wood, BIPI's\n     Regional Director for the Southeast Region of the United\n     States. Díaz decided to investigate the matter further,\n     as suggested by García. . . .\n\n     . . .\n\n     28. . . . On April 6, 2000, Díaz reported that he\n     identified   additional   concerns  about  plaintiff's\n     practices that arose during the course of Díaz's field\n     work with plaintiff and an additional set of numbers\n     generated by Rita Riberio.\n\n\n\nRiberio's January 28 response to García's request for information\n\nwas among the exhibits appended to the Proposed Statement of\n\nUncontested Facts.\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f          Ramírez asserts that Riberio's response -- which was in\n\nthe form of a data report8 -- is inadmissible hearsay, and that the\n\ncourt should therefore have excluded both the response and Proposed\n\nStatements 15, 16, 23, and 28, which Ramírez asserts are all\n\nrelated to it.\n\n          b. Physicians' statements\n\n          Ramírez also sought to exclude BIPI's Proposed Statements\n\n29, 30, 41, 42, 44, and 47 on the ground that they \"refer to\n\ninformation obtained by Mr. Noel Díaz and Mr. Antonio Hernández\n\nfrom alleged visits and communications with several doctors\" whose\n\nidentifying information was not disclosed to Ramírez.      On appeal,\n\nRamírez continues to assert that because he was not able to conduct\n\ndiscovery regarding the identity of the physicians, the physician\n\nstatements   are   inadmissible    hearsay   and   the   corresponding\n\nstatements must be deleted from BIPI's proposed statement of\n\nuncontested facts.9\n\n\n     8\n      Ramírez also sought to exclude the cover memo that Riberio\nsent to García with the report. The memo merely states that her\nresults were attached and that García was free to \"share this\ninformation with [his colleagues] if you think they could use it.\"\nFor ease of reference, we use the term \"report\" as a short hand for\nboth the report and the cover memo.\n     9\n      We note that not all of the proposed statements of\nuncontested facts identified by Ramírez actually rely on the\nstatements by unidentified physicians. Proposed statements 29 and\n30 do not cite the redacted physicians' statements, but rather cite\nan April 6, 2000 email from Díaz to Wood in which Díaz reported\ntalking to two physicians who had asked Ramírez not to return to\ntheir offices as a result of irregularities in his sampling\n\n                                  -17-\n\f           2. Hearsay claim\n\n           On   appeal,   Ramírez    asserts   that   the   evidence    and\n\nstatements that we have just described constitute inadmissible\n\nhearsay.    \"'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the\n\ndeclarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\n\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"        Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(c).    Hearsay evidence is not admissible at trial, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 802, or for summary judgment purposes, see Vazquez v. Lopez-\n\nRosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998), unless it falls within\n\none of the exceptions specified in the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 802.      In Ramírez's view, none of the evidence\n\nthat he seeks to exclude is covered by a hearsay exception.\n\n           At the risk of stating the obvious, whether a particular\n\nstatement falls within a hearsay exception is relevant only if the\n\nstatement is, in fact, hearsay.      We must therefore consider, as an\n\ninitial matter, whether any of the evidence at issue -- either\n\nRiberio's report or the physician statements -- is hearsay.             By\n\ndefinition, hearsay is a statement \"offered in evidence to prove\n\nthe truth of the matter asserted.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).       BIPI\n\n\n\n\npractice.   The email, which was appended to BIPI's proposed\nstatement of uncontested facts as Exhibit 10, identified the\nphysicians by name and provided their addresses and phone numbers.\nFor reasons that are unclear to us, neither party has referred to\nthis email on appeal.\n\n                                    -18-\n\fasserts that it did not offer the evidence at issue to prove the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted.       We agree.\n\n            The \"matter asserted\" in both Riberio's report and the\n\nphysician    statements   is    essentially     that   Ramírez's     sampling\n\npractice was inconsistent with company policy and the PDMA.               The\n\ncompany offers these assertions to explain the basis for its\n\ndecision    to    terminate    Ramírez   from   his    employment.       That\n\nexplanation alone has evidentiary significance.           See Zapata-Matos\n\nv. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting\n\nthat in an employment discrimination case, \"once the plaintiff has\n\nmet the low standard of showing prima facie discrimination, the\n\nemployer must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason [for\n\nthe adverse employment action] in response\"). In short, the report\n\nand physician statements were not offered to prove that Ramírez\n\nengaged in misconduct, but rather to demonstrate that his superiors\n\nhad reason, based on a thorough investigation, to believe that he\n\nhad.\n\n            In an attempt to rescue his claim, Ramírez asserts that\n\nRibiero's report and the physician statements were, in fact,\n\nsubmitted    to   demonstrate    that    Ramírez   violated   company    and\n\nindustry-wide sampling policies, i.e., for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted.    He maintains that BIPI has defended its decision to\n\nterminate him on the grounds that he engaged in such misconduct,\n\nrather than on the more nuanced ground that it thought he had\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fengaged in such misconduct.     We reject this reasoning.        Although\n\nBIPI may have framed its argument inconsistently at times, it\n\nexplained in its motion for summary judgment that \"the results of\n\n[the] investigation into plaintiff's sampling practices . . . led\n\nto the conclusion that plaintiff had incurred in serious violations\n\nof the PDMA and Company policies.\"           BIPI further explained, in\n\nopposing Ramírez's motion in limine, that the evidence at issue was\n\n\"not being offered to prove that the plaintiff in fact engaged in\n\nthe practice of over-sampling or violated company policies, but to\n\nshow that this was the information defendant had before it and that\n\ndefendant considered this information when it made its decision to\n\nterminate plaintiff's employment.\" In short, BIPI has defended its\n\ndecision   on   the   grounds   that    it    thought,   based   on   its\n\ninvestigation, that Ramírez had engaged in misconduct.10\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      Through his motion in limine, Ramírez also sought to exclude\nRibiero's report and the physician statements pursuant to Federal\nRule of Evidence 403, which provides, in part, that, \"[a]lthough\nrelevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" On\nappeal, Ramírez asserts that the district court abused its\ndiscretion under Rule 403 by considering Ribiero's report and the\nphysicians' statements before ruling in its summary judgment order.\nWe disagree.    Although \"courts also have the power to exclude\nevidence under Rule 403 at the summary judgment stage,\" see Jack B.\nWeinstein & Margaret A. Berger, 2 Weinstein's Federal Evidence\n§ 403.02[1][b] (2d ed. 2005), Ramírez has not demonstrated that the\nevidence he seeks to exclude meets the \"unfair prejudice\" standard\nset forth in that rule.\n\n                                 -20-\n\f                                     III.\n\n              Ramírez challenges the court's grant of summary judgment\n\nfor BIPI on his age discrimination claim.                Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate      when     \"the   pleadings,      depositions,       answers    to\n\ninterrogatories,        and   admissions    on   file,   together     with    the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n              Under the ADEA, it is \"unlawful for an employer . . . to\n\ndischarge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual's age.\"                  29\n\nU.S.C.    §   623(a)(1).      The   district     court   properly    considered\n\nRamírez's ADEA claim under the burden-shifting framework set forth\n\nin McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973):\n\n    once the plaintiff has met the low standard of showing\n    prima facie discrimination, the employer must articulate\n    a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason in response. Once\n    that   reason  is   articulated,   the  presumption   of\n    discrimination drops out of the picture, the McDonnell\n    Douglas framework with its presumptions and burdens\n    disappears, and the sole remaining issue is of\n    discrimination vel non.\n\nZapata-Matos, 277 F.3d at 44-45 (internal citations omitted).11\n\n\n     11\n      The prima facie showing of discrimination under McDonnell\nDouglas has four components:\n\n     An ADEA claimant must adduce evidence that (1) she was at\n     least forty years of age; (2) her job performance met the\n     employer's legitimate expectations; (3) the employer\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           Having reviewed the relevant legal framework,12 we turn\n\nto the specific facts of the case at hand.         Instead of evaluating\n\nRamírez's prima facie case, as the district court did, we assume\n\narguendo   that   Ramírez   has   made   out   a   prima   facie   case   of\n\ndiscrimination based on age.      In response, BIPI has articulated a\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate\n\nRamírez’s employment–-namely, its conclusion, based on the results\n\nof an investigation, that Ramírez’s sampling practices violated the\n\nPDMA and company policy.13   At this stage, then, \"[t]he question to\n\n\n     subjected her to an adverse employment action (e.g., an\n     actual or constructive discharge); and (4) the employer\n     had a continuing need for the services provided by the\n     position from which the claimant was discharged.\n\nGonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 68 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002).\n     12\n      On appeal, Ramírez asserts for the first time that the\ndistrict court should have considered his claim not only under the\nMcDonnell Douglas framework, but also under the standards set forth\nin Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90 (2003) for mixed-\nmotive employment discrimination claims, i.e., claims that \"both\nlegitimate and illegitimate reasons motivated the [adverse\nemployment] decision.\"    Id. at 93.    Because Ramírez failed to\nadvance this argument in the district court, we consider it waived.\nSee Hillstrom v. Best W. TLC Hotel, 354 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2003)\n(expressing doubt that the plaintiff had preserved claim that\nDesert Palace applied to his ADEA suit, \"as he never suggested to\nthe district court that he was presenting a mixed-motive case\");\nDavis v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 251 F.3d 227, 232 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(\"[W]here a plaintiff fails to present arguments to the district\ncourt in opposition to a defendant's motion for summary judgment,\nwe have refused to consider those arguments for the first time on\nappeal.\").\n     13\n      The physician statements whose admissibility we discussed in\nSection II reported that Ramírez usually left a large amount of\nsamples and asked the physicians to sign multiple sample signature\ndocuments.\n\n                                  -22-\n\fbe resolved is whether the defendant's explanation of its conduct,\n\ntogether with any other evidence, could reasonably be seen by a\n\njury not only to be false but to suggest an age-driven animus.\"\n\nRonda-Perez v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria -- P.R., 404 F.3d\n\n42, 44 (1st Cir. 2005).    Urging us to answer this question in the\n\naffirmative, Ramírez asserts that BIPI's articulated reason for his\n\ntermination was false and alleges that several aspects of BIPI's\n\nconduct reveal a discriminatory animus based on age.      We examine\n\nthese claims.\n\nA.        Territory reorganization\n\n          In March 2000, BIPI realigned the sales territories in\n\nPuerto Rico to accommodate an expansion of its sales force from\n\nfive PSRs to seven PSRs.   Ramírez asserts that the realignment had\n\na negative impact on him and another PSR, Félix Ruiz, who was 58\n\nyears old at the time, and that the more desirable territories were\n\ngiven to the new 28- and 35-year old PSRs.14   Ramírez focuses on the\n\n\n     14\n      BIPI contends that Ramírez's claim regarding the 2000\nreorganization \"is time-barred, inasmuch as it is a discrete act\nwhich occurred more than 300 days prior to his filing of the ADU\ncharge.\" This contention is a reference to 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(2),\nwhich establishes a 300-day filing period for claims under the ADEA\nin \"deferral states\" including Puerto Rico. Am. Airlines, Inc. v.\nCardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 122 (1st Cir. 1998). It is true\nthat the March 2000 territory reorganization occurred more than 300\ndays before Ramírez filed his ADU claim on June 13, 2001. We do\nnot view Ramírez's reference to the reorganization as an attempt to\nrecover for a discrete act, however, but rather as part of his\neffort to demonstrate that BIPI's stated reason for his termination\nwas pretextual. The 300-day statute of limitations does not \"bar\nan employee from using the prior acts as background evidence in\nsupport of a timely claim.\" Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,\n\n                                -23-\n\ffact that Ponce was removed from his territory and replaced with\n\nArecibo,    which     has    fewer    specialists       spread    over   a     wider\n\ngeographical area.          He emphasizes that his new territory had 88\n\nspecialists and Ruiz's had 82 specialists, while the 28- and 35-\n\nyear-old PSRs' territories had 208 specialists and 121 specialists,\n\nrespectively.        While    acknowledging      that    territories     had   been\n\nreorganized, and that Ponce had been removed from his territory\n\nbefore,    Ramírez    asserts    that    \"the    process    followed     in    prior\n\nreorganizations was different.           Appellant and Mr. Félix Ruiz were\n\nconsulted, and all changes were discussed with them prior to\n\nbecoming in effect. . . .            The 2000 reorganization was [behind]\n\nclosed    doors.\"      Together,     Ramírez     asserts,   this    evidence     is\n\nsufficient to create a dispute of material fact as to whether the\n\nreorganization reflected a discriminatory animus.                 We disagree.\n\n            Ramírez    has    conceded    that    BIPI   has     reorganized     its\n\nterritories in the past and that Ponce was removed from his\n\nterritory in 1995. Although he has not explained the circumstances\n\nof the 1995 removal, it is notable that he does not assert that the\n\n1995 removal was motivated by a discriminatory animus.                   The only\n\ndifference he cites between prior reorganizations and the 2000\n\n\n536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002) (discussing an analogous 300-day time bar\nfor claims brought under Title VII); see Mercado v. Ritz-Carlton\nSan Juan, 410 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that \"we have\nheld repeatedly that the ADEA and Title VII stand[ ] in pari passu\nand that judicial precedents interpreting one such statute [are]\ninstructive in decisions involving [the other]\") (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (alterations in original).\n\n                                        -24-\n\freorganization is that during prior reorganizations, PSRs were\n\nconsulted        and   that      new   employees      were    given     less   complex\n\nterritories. The fact that PSRs were not consulted before the 2000\n\nreorganization is not evidence that the reorganization was carried\n\nout in a discriminatory way. Nor has Ramírez offered evidence that\n\nthe 2000 reorganization was a deviation from BIPI's policy -- if\n\nBIPI had such a policy in the first place -- of assigning less\n\ncomplex territories to newer PSRs.                 He has pointed out only that\n\nthe newly created territories had more specialists than his, not\n\nthat they were somehow more complex.\n\nB.              Discriminatory comments\n\n                Ramírez asserts that Díaz, his supervisor at the time of\n\nhis       termination,      Valeriano    García,      the    district    manager    who\n\nsupervised Ramírez prior to Díaz, and Antonio Hernández, a district\n\nmanager in Florida, made comments that reflect a discriminatory\n\nanimus and therefore support a finding that BIPI's articulated\n\nreason for his termination was pretextual.                     The district court,\n\nquoting Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d\n\n46, 55 (1st Cir. 2000), recognized that \"[d]iscriminatory comments\n\nmay       be   probative    of   pretext    if    a   plaintiff    can    'show    that\n\ndiscriminatory comments were made by the key decisionmaker or those\n\nin    a    position    to    influence     the    decisionmaker.'\"         The    court\n\nconcluded, however, that \"[g]iven Defendant's compelling stated\n\nreason for Plaintiff's termination, the[] stray remarks [cited by\n\n\n                                           -25-\n\fRamírez]       do    not     permit    the    inference      that       Defendant's       real\n\nmotivation for Plaintiff's discharge was age discrimination.\"\n\n               On    appeal,       Ramírez    asserts      that    in    considering       the\n\nallegedly discriminatory comments, the district court failed to\n\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to him, and instead\n\n\"weighted the evidence in favor of the appellee.\" We consider this\n\nargument with regard to each of the comments that Ramírez has\n\nidentified as discriminatory.\n\n               1. \"Sacred cows\"\n\n               Relying on the deposition testimony of PSR Rafael Oliver,\n\nRamírez asserts that during a private meeting on January 12, 2000,\n\nDíaz told Oliver and another PSR, Rommel Barnacet, \"that he (Mr.\n\nDíaz)        had    orders    to    'cut     off'    the    heads       of   older        sales\n\nrepresentatives that Mr. Díaz, Mr. Rommel Barnacet, and Mr. Oliver\n\ncalled       'the    sacred     cows,'       but    that    they    should      keep      this\n\ninformation secret.\"           This description does not accurately reflect\n\nOliver's       testimony,       which      was     that    Díaz    said      that    he    had\n\ninstructions to cut off the heads of some \"sacred cows,\" not of\n\n\"older sales representatives.\"                It was Oliver who interpreted the\n\ncomment as a reference to age.15                 Oliver also testified that he was\n\n\n\n        15\n      BIPI asserts that Oliver's testimony regarding his\ninterpretation of the \"sacred cow\" comment is inadmissible because\nit reflects \"mere conjecture as to what someone may have meant.\"\nWe reject this claim, concluding that Oliver's interpretation of\nthe comment was admissible as opinion testimony by a lay witness.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 701.\n\n                                             -26-\n\fconsidered          a     \"sacred    cow\"   because        he   was    disabled,     but   that\n\nBarnacet, who was five years younger than Oliver, was not a sacred\n\ncow.         Nevertheless, given the summary judgment posture of this\n\ncase, we conclude that the district court erred in disregarding the\n\n\"sacred           cows\"    comment    altogether.           Oliver     testified     that    he\n\nunderstood \"sacred cows\" as a reference to the oldest PSRs in terms\n\nof both seniority and age.                  Drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor        of    Ramírez,    we    think      that   a    jury      relying   on   Oliver's\n\ntestimony could interpret Díaz's comment as a reference to age.\n\n                   In a related vein, Ramírez also emphasizes the deposition\n\ntestimony of Ruiz that during a meeting on February 28, 2000, Díaz\n\nstated that he had \"instructions from management that they had to\n\n'cut     off       the    heads'     of   the    oldest     representatives.\"16            This\n\ntestimony, like Oliver's testimony, is somewhat ambiguous.                                   It\n\nappears that Ruiz described only the instruction to \"cut off the\n\nheads\" as a quote from Díaz.                    We cannot tell from the testimony\n\nwhether Díaz referred specifically to \"the oldest representatives,\"\n\nor if Díaz made a different reference that Ruiz interpreted as a\n\nreference to age, as was the case with Oliver.                             Again, however,\n\ngiven the posture of this case, we recognize that a jury could\n\ninterpret the comment as a reference to age.\n\n\n\n\n        16\n             The district court did not directly address this testimony.\n\n                                                -27-\n\f             2. Employee salary\n\n             According to the deposition testimony of PSR Rafael\n\nOliver, \"there were always comments\" from García and Hernández to\n\nthe effect that \"you have to pay two [employees] in their twenties\n\nless than one in his fifties because of what is being earned.     That\n\nwith that salary they would pay two, or they would pay two and a\n\nhalf.\"     Ramírez cites this statement as evidence that \"Mr. Díaz,\n\nMr.      Hernández,   and   Mr.   García     preferred   young   sales\n\nrepresentatives,\" and therefore that he was terminated because of\n\nhis age.      Even if this statement does reflect age bias (the\n\ninference most favorable to Ramírez), Ramírez has cited no evidence\n\non appeal that either Hernández or García -- as opposed to Díaz,\n\nhis direct supervisor -- was involved in the decision to terminate\n\nhim.17     \"[S]tatements made either by nondecisionmakers[,] or by\n\ndecisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are\n\ninsufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the\n\nrequisite discriminatory animus.\"        Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n      17\n      In a motion opposing summary judgment, Ramírez asserted that\ncomments by García and Hernández were probative of discriminatory\nanimus because \"García was Plaintiff's supervisor and allegedly\nbegan the so called investigation in the year 2000\" and \"Hernández\nacted as Regional Director, he was notified of Plaintiff's alleged\nviolations and participated in Plaintiff's supervision.\" Neither\nof these assertions address the role of García and Hernández in the\ndecision to terminate Ramírez in August 2001.\n\n                                  -28-\n\f            3. \"Twilight zone\"\n\n            In his deposition, Ramírez testified that Hernández said\n\nthat \"[t]hose old guys are in the 'twilight zone.'\"                  As the\n\ndistrict court pointed out, however, Ramírez has not explained\n\nwhen, or in what context, he heard the statement.           Moreover, as the\n\ndistrict court also noted, \"[w]hile Mr. Oliver [also] claims that\n\nMr. Hernández stated that 'these people are in the twilight zone'\n\nafter meetings with unnamed employees, notably, Mr. Oliver's quote\n\nmakes no reference to age.\"       To the contrary, Oliver interpreted\n\nthe \"twilight zone\" comment as referring to people who did not meet\n\ntheir sales quotas.     More importantly, as we have already noted,\n\nRamírez cites no evidence on appeal to demonstrate that Hernández\n\nwas involved in the decision to terminate him.         See id.\n\nC.          Disparate treatment\n\n            Ramírez   asserts    that   he   was   subjected    to   adverse\n\ndisparate treatment that revealed a discriminatory animus on the\n\npart   of   his   superiors.      The   district    court    rejected   this\n\ncontention, concluding that it rested on \"unsupported allegations.\"\n\n            1. Employee discipline\n\n            Ramírez contends that BIPI has a disciplinary procedure\n\nrequiring \"progressive discipline before termination or discharge\"\n\nand that the procedure was not followed in his case.             He further\n\nasserts that other employees \"did not use the proper sampling and\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\ftargeting procedures\" but that \"no one else was disciplined, much\n\nless discharged.\"\n\n            It is true that BIPI's employee manual sets forth a\n\nprocedure to \"monitor consistent non-compliance\" with the rules\n\nestablished for ensuring sampling accountability.                     However, the\n\nmanual also sets forth a series of \"unacceptable\" practices that\n\n\"will result in varying levels of disciplinary action up to and\n\nincluding termination.\"          (Emphasis added.)         One of the practices\n\nlisted is \"any violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of\n\n1987,\" the ground that BIPI has cited for Ramírez's termination.\n\nMoreover,     the   manual   also         cautions     that    \"[t]ermination      of\n\nemployment    can   result   .    .   .    in    the   event   of   any   breach   of\n\ndiscipline or job standards which is deemed serious enough.\"                    BIPI\n\napparently concluded that Ramírez's perceived violations of the\n\nPDMA and company policies designed to comply with that Act were\n\n\"serious enough\" to result in termination, rather than a lesser\n\nsanction.     It is not our role to second-guess the merits of that\n\nconclusion.    See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments,\n\nassessing the merits -- or even the rationality -- of employers'\n\nnondiscriminatory business decisions.\").\n\n            Although Ramírez asserts that other employees did not use\n\nproper sampling procedures but were not disciplined, he has not\n\nidentified any employee who engaged in sampling violations akin to\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fthose for which he was terminated.     The closest Ramírez comes is an\n\nallegation that García, his former supervisor, \"gave orders to use\n\nun-approved and illegal materials.\" The documents to which Ramírez\n\ncites in support of this proposition are far from clear, however,\n\nand they do not indicate whether, if García did violate company\n\npolicy designed to comply with the PDMA, decisionmakers at BIPI\n\nwere aware of the violation.     Accordingly, we reject Ramírez's\n\nclaim that his termination reflects disparate treatment based on\n\nhis age.\n\n           2. Salary\n\n           Ramírez did not receive a merit-based salary increase for\n\nthe year 2001, while all other PSRs did.       In an email informing\n\nRamírez of the salary decision, Díaz explained that\n\n     merit increases are based on the sales and general\n     performance of any given representative during a one year\n     period.   The guideline for the year 2000 was 4.0%.\n     Unfortunately your extended leave of absence due to Short\n     Term Disability did not allow a fair evaluation period to\n     make the merit assessment for the year. Therefore the\n     decision has been made to leave your year 2000 base pay\n     unchanged at $63,500.00 for the year 2001.\n\nIn his motion opposing summary judgment, and again on appeal,\n\nRamírez asserts the denial of a salary increase violated company\n\npolicy.    Contrary to Ramírez's representation, however, company\n\npolicy does not establish that \"any employee on leave will receive\n\na salary increase in proportion to the time worked.\"       Rather, it\n\nprovides that \"[i]f approved, a proratum will apply to all annual\n\nmerit reviews when issued for less than a 12 month salary cycle\"\n\n                                -31-\n\fand   that   \"[t]he    amount      of   your    merit    increase,       if   any,    is\n\ndiscretionary.\"       (Emphasis added.)         BIPI did not approve a merit-\n\nbased increase for 2001 because it was unable to evaluate Ramírez's\n\nperformance for 2000.       Company policy therefore did not require an\n\nincrease in proportion to the time worked.\n\n             Ramírez asserts that the denial of a salary increase\n\nreflects disparate treatment nonetheless because, unlike Ramírez,\n\nPSR   Oliver    received       salary       increases     while     on     short-term\n\ndisability.      The    only      evidence     that    Ramírez     cites      for   this\n\nproposition    is     his   own    \"unsworn      statement       under   penalty      of\n\nperjury.\"    While the document that Ramírez cites is admissible for\n\nsummary judgment purposes despite being unsworn, see Goldman,\n\nAntonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer & Hertell v. Medfit Int'l, Inc.,\n\n982 F.2d 686, 689-90 (1st Cir. 1993), his specific statement about\n\nOliver's salary is inadmissible because Ramírez does not explain\n\nthe basis for his knowledge.            See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Cloutier\n\nv. Costco Wholesale Corp., 390 F.3d 126, 137 (1st Cir. 2004), cert.\n\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 2940 (2005).                   We therefore cannot credit\n\nRamírez's claim.\n\n             3. Conditions upon return from short-term disability\n\n             Finally, Ramírez asserts that he was singled out for\n\nadverse   disparate     treatment       upon     his   return     from   short      term\n\ndisability,     when    BIPI      imposed      \"work    rules,    conditions,        and\n\nexaminations not required [of] other [PSRs].\"                     The only sources\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fthat Ramírez cites for his contention that similar requirements\n\nwere not imposed on other PSRs are his own deposition testimony to\n\nthat effect and a letter that he wrote to Díaz regarding his\n\ncompliance with the conditions, in which he asserted that after\n\nspeaking with Ruiz and Oliver, he learned that \"after their short\n\nterm disability, they were never required to comply with these\n\ndirectives or similar directives.\"    This evidence does not help\n\nRamírez. First, the statements of Ruiz and Oliver are inadmissible\n\nhearsay.   See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), 802.     Second, even if the\n\nevidence were admissible, it still does not establish that Ramírez\n\nwas subjected to adverse disparate treatment based on his age.   As\n\nRamírez's own statements indicate, Ruiz -- who is eight years older\n\nthan Ramírez -- was not subjected to similar treatment.18\n\nD.         Falsity of stated reason\n\n           Ramírez also alleges that BIPI falsified the physicians'\n\nstatements or requested them only after it had made the decision to\n\n\n\n     18\n       Ramírez also asserts in passing that he was subjected to\ndisparate treatment when Wood instructed him to store his samples\nin a commercial storage facility rather than at his mother's house.\nEmphasizing that he stored samples at his mother's house -- with\nhis District Manager's approval -- for many years prior to April\n2000, Ramírez points out that BIPI's storage policy does not\nactually require samples to be kept in a commercial facility.\nWhile that may be the case, there is no evidence to support\nRamírez's contention that the order to move his samples reflected\na discriminatory animus. Before Wood's order, Ramírez was the only\nPSR in Puerto Rico who did not store his samples in a commercial\nfacility. By requiring him to move his samples to such a facility,\nWood was merely putting Ramírez in the same position as all of the\nother PSRs.\n\n                               -33-\n\fterminate      him.        He   has    provided       no    evidence,     however,     to\n\nsubstantiate       those    allegations,        see    Fed.      R.    Civ.   P.    56(e)\n\n(cautioning that \"[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and\n\nsupported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest\n\nupon    the   mere     allegations      or   denials       of   the   adverse      party's\n\npleading\"),19 and the evidence that is in the record supports a\n\nfinding that BIPI did not fabricate its articulated reason for\n\nterminating Ramírez's employment.\n\n              In   a   letter    confirming       Ramírez’s        termination,      BIPI\n\nattributed its decision to Ramírez’s \"violation of the Prescription\n\nDrug Marketing Act and Company policy as it relates to sample\n\ndistribution and documentation.\" BIPI has produced the physicians’\n\nstatements that led it to this conclusion, which it has articulated\n\nconsistently throughout the course of this litigation. See Zapata-\n\nMatos,      277    F.3d    at   47     (emphasizing         that      explanations     by\n\nrepresentatives of an employer for their decision to terminate the\n\nplaintiff “are themselves consistent and not contradicted by either\n\ncontemporaneous documents or statements made at termination, or\n\nstatements made later”).              As the district court recognized, BIPI\n\nalso proffered evidence of other \"perceived irregularities in\n\nPlaintiff's sales practice\" dating back several years, as well as\n\n\n\n       19\n      Although Ramírez was hampered in that effort by his inability\nto conduct discovery regarding the physicians' identities, he bears\nsubstantial responsibility for that limitation, as we have\ndiscussed.\n\n                                         -34-\n\fevidence of its investigation into the irregularities.                     The record\n\nthus presents no basis for a finding that BIPI did not believe, in\n\ngood faith, that it had a legitimate reason to terminate Ramírez.\n\nWe    recognize    that     “the     employer’s     good     faith   belief   is    not\n\nautomatically conclusive” on the issue of pretext.                     However, there\n\nis also no evidence in the record to support a jury finding that\n\nthe    articulated       reason,      though      honestly     held,    “constituted\n\ndiscrimination (e.g., stereotyping).”                Id. at 45-46.\n\nE.             Conclusion\n\n               In determining whether a defendant is entitled to summary\n\njudgment on an ADEA claim, we must consider, inter alia, \"the\n\nprobative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is\n\nfalse, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and\n\nthat properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"         Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530\n\nU.S. 133, 149 (2000).           As we have discussed, Ramírez has offered\n\nvirtually no proof that BIPI's explanation for his termination is\n\nfalse.    He has not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury\n\nfinding that the territory reorganization was motivated by a\n\ndiscriminatory         animus   or    that   he     suffered    adverse    disparate\n\ntreatment as a result of his age.                 Nor are the comments by García\n\nand Hernández probative of discriminatory animus, without evidence\n\nthat    they    were    involved      in   the     decision    to    terminate     him.\n\nMoreover, there is no support in the record for Ramírez's claim\n\n\n                                           -35-\n\fthat BIPI fabricated the physicians' statements or obtained them\n\nafter it had decided to terminate him based on his age.\n\n             In short, the only evidence of a discriminatory motive\n\nthat Ramírez has unearthed are two comments by Díaz in early 2000\n\nthat    a   jury   could   interpret   to     evince   animus   based   on   age.\n\nHowever, Ramírez was not terminated until more than eighteen months\n\nafter Díaz made the comments at issue, and at the time of his\n\ntermination, Ruiz, who is several years older than Ramírez, was\n\nstill   employed     at    the   company.     Against   this    background,   we\n\nconclude that Díaz's comments, standing alone, are insufficient to\n\nsupport a finding that Ramírez was terminated because of his age.\n\nThe district court was correct to grant summary judgment to BIPI on\n\nthe ADEA discrimination claim.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n             Ramírez challenges the court's grant of summary judgment\n\non his claim that he was terminated in retaliation for filing a\n\ndiscrimination complaint with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Labor (ADU).                 We review the court's\n\nsummary judgment ruling de novo.            Gonzalez-Pina, 407 F.3d at 431.\n\n             In addition to prohibiting age discrimination, the ADEA\n\nalso protects individuals who invoke the statute's protections.\n\nSee    29 U.S.C. § 623(d) (\"It shall be unlawful for an employer to\n\ndiscriminate against any of his employees . . . because such\n\nindividual . . . has opposed any practice made unlawful by this\n\n\n                                       -36-\n\fsection,      or   .    .    .     made   a   charge,     testified,     assisted,    or\n\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\n\nlitigation      under       this    chapter.\").         Where    there   is   no   direct\n\nevidence of retaliation, our analysis of a claim under § 623(d)\n\nclosely tracks the McDonnell Douglas framework.                           First, \"the\n\nplaintiff must make a prima facie showing that (i) he engaged in\n\nADEA-protected conduct, (ii) he was thereafter subjected to an\n\nadverse employment action, and (iii) a causal connection existed\n\nbetween the protected conduct and the adverse action.\"                         Mesnick,\n\n950 F.2d at 827.20          If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of\n\nretaliation, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a\n\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.\"\n\nId.        Finally, if the defendant presents such a reason, \"the\n\nultimate burden falls on the plaintiff to show that the employer's\n\nproffered      reason       is     a   pretext       masking    retaliation    for   the\n\nemployee's opposition to a practice cast into doubt by the ADEA.\"\n\nId.    As we emphasized in Mesnick, the \"critical inquiry [is]\n\nwhether the aggregate evidence of pretext and retaliatory animus\n\nsuffices to make out a jury question.\"                   Id.\n\n\n\n\n      20\n      It is not essential to a plaintiff's prima facie case that\nthe underlying conduct actually constitute an ADEA violation.\nRather, \"[i]t is enough that the plaintiff had a reasonable, good-\nfaith belief that a violation occurred; that he acted on it; that\nthe employer knew of the plaintiff's conduct; and that the employer\nlashed out in consequence of it.\" Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 827.\n\n                                              -37-\n\f            Ramírez filed a complaint with the ADU on June 13, 2001,\n\nasserting that he had been subjected to \"a series of harassing acts\n\n. . . due to [his] age.\"21        He was terminated approximately two\n\nmonths later, on August 15, 2001.         Accordingly, the district court\n\nfound, and BIPI has conceded, that Ramírez established the first\n\ntwo elements of the prima facie showing described in Mesnick,\n\nnamely that he engaged in ADEA-protected conduct (i.e., filing a\n\ncomplaint of age discrimination) and that he subsequently suffered\n\nan adverse employment action (i.e., termination).               The district\n\ncourt concluded, however, that Ramírez's prima facie case faltered\n\non the third element, namely the existence of a causal connection\n\nbetween the filing of the ADU claim and the subsequent termination.\n\nThe court found that the temporal proximity between the two events\n\n-- two months -- was \"insufficient, standing alone, to establish a\n\ncausal connection.\"       The court further held that even assuming\n\narguendo that Ramírez established a prima facie case, BIPI would\n\nstill be entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation claim\n\nbecause it \"offered enough evidence to suggest that its decision to\n\nfire    Plaintiff   was   based   on    Plaintiff's   alleged    malfeasance\n\n\n\n\n       21\n      In his ADU complaint, Ramírez also alleged that he had been\n\"the victim of discrimination due to national origin and/or race --\nPuerto Rican -- since the company provides higher salary raises and\nbetter terms and conditions of employment . . . to its\npredominantly white and North American employees in the United\nStates.\" That aspect of Ramírez's claim is not part of this suit.\n\n                                       -38-\n\f. . . [and] Plaintiff has not offered any evidence to suggest that\n\nDefendant's actions were pretextual.\"\n\n            On appeal, Ramírez emphasizes that although his superiors\n\nhad concerns about his conduct by January 2000, they \"waited until\n\nAugust 2001 to discharge him, two months after he filed a charge of\n\ndiscrimination     before    the    [ADU].\"      While     Ramírez's    superiors\n\nspeculated that he was engaging in improper \"oversampling\" as early\n\nas January 2000, however, the physician statements that BIPI cites\n\nas the basis for Ramírez's termination were not documented until\n\nMay 10, 2001.     Ramírez filed his complaint with the ADU one month\n\nlater.      He   therefore   was    terminated     three    months     after   Wood\n\nreceived the physician complaints and two months after engaging in\n\nADEA-protected activity.           The fact that Wood terminated Ramírez\n\nafter he filed his ADU claim rather than before does not, standing\n\nalone, establish a causal connection between the ADU complaint and\n\nthe termination.      \"[C]hronological proximity does not by itself\n\nestablish    causality,      particularly     if    '[t]he     larger     picture\n\nundercuts any claim of causation.'\"           Wright v. CompUSA, Inc., 352\n\nF.3d 472, 478 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Ramírez's other causation argument rests on the fact that\n\nhe was terminated without notice instead of being subjected to less\n\nsevere discipline first, as he asserts would have been consistent\n\nwith company policies.        As we have already discussed, however,\n\nRamírez's termination was not inconsistent with company policy, nor\n\n\n                                      -39-\n\fhas he provided evidence that other employees were subjected to\n\nless severe discipline (or no discipline at all) based on similar\n\nconduct.      The fact that he was terminated, rather than merely\n\nreprimanded, two months after filing an ADU complaint does not\n\nestablish     that    the   termination    was    causally    linked    to    the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n             Nor has Ramírez offered evidence to support a finding\n\nthat    BIPI's   articulated    reason    for    the   termination     --    i.e.,\n\nviolations of company sampling policy and the PDMA -- was a pretext\n\nfor retaliation. He has not, for example, pointed to any \"comments\n\nby     the   employer   which   intimate    a    retaliatory       mindset\"     or\n\ndemonstrated that he was subjected to differential treatment after\n\nfiling the ADU complaint. Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 828.22 Ramírez does\n\nattempt to demonstrate pretext by arguing that the physicians'\n\nstatements were inadmissible hearsay and thus BIPI has not advanced\n\na    legitimate,     non-discriminatory    reason      for   his   termination.\n\nHowever, as we have already concluded, the physicians' statements\n\nwere admissible.\n\n\n\n\n       22\n      To be sure, Ramírez alleges disparate treatment in the fact\nthat he was terminated instead of being subjected to less severe\ndiscipline.    As we have discussed, however, Ramírez cites no\nevidence to support his claim that other employees were disciplined\nless severely, if at all, for similar violations. A party opposing\nsummary judgment \"may not rest upon . . . mere allegations.\" Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n                                    -40-\n\f               In short, Ramírez has not \"present[ed] evidence from\n\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that [his] employer retaliated\n\nagainst him for engaging in ADEA-protected activity.\"                 Id.    We\n\ntherefore conclude that the district court was correct to award\n\nsummary judgment to BIPI on the retaliation claim.\n\n                                         V.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in handling the discovery issues\n\nsurrounding the physicians' statements or in denying Ramírez's\n\nmotion    in    limine   to   exclude    Ribiero's   sales   report   and   the\n\nphysicians' statements, and that BIPI was entitled to summary\n\njudgment on both the age discrimination and retaliation claims.23\n\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     23\n      Upon granting summary judgment on the age discrimination and\nretaliation claims, the district court ordered the dismissal of the\nentire case. Ramírez has not appealed the resulting dismissal of\nhis state law claims, on which the district court did not\nspecifically rule.\n\n                                        -41-\n\f",

(BIPI), pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 621-634, and Puerto Rico law. The district court granted summary judgment for BIPI on the ground that Ram&#237;rez had not established a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination. Alternatively, even if he had made such a case, the district court ruled that he had not presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that BIPI's proffered non-discriminatory reason for terminating him was pretextual. On appeal, Ram&#237;rez challenges the summary judgment order, as well as an array of rulings by the district court on evidentiary issues. We affirm on the alternative ground set forth by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the following facts from the summary judgment record, presenting them in the light most favorable to the appellant and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>See Gonzalez-Pina v.

He worked as a professional sales representative (PSR) for BIPI from November 1, 1977 to August 15, 2001, when he was terminated. As the district court explained, Ramirez's \"principal activity\" as a PSR was \"promoting [BIPI's] products by conducting visits to physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies, educating health professionals about [BIPI's] products, and providing product samples.\" Ram&#237;rez, like all of the PSRs, was assigned to a particular geographic territory. At the time of his termination, he was assigned to the southwest region of Puerto Rico. Relevant to this case, BIPI policy requires PSRs to obtain a signed Sample Signature Document (SSD) each time they provide drug samples to a doctor. The SSD must be completed in full in the PSR's presence. BIPI's sampling policy is designed to comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 301 <i>et seq.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before 1999, Ram&#237;rez routinely received positive performance evaluations for his work. In his 1999 evaluation of Ram&#237;rez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> district manager Valeriano Garc&#237;a (Garc&#237;a) &#8212; the BIPI District Manager for Puerto Rico and Miami, and Ram&#237;rez's direct supervisor &#8212; rated Ram&#237;rez as meeting expectations in most areas. However, Garc&#237;a also raised several concerns about Ram&#237;rez's performance. Specifically, Garc&#237;a noted that Ram&#237;rez \"[d]id not call on [doctors in his territory] other than [in] Ponce and Mayag&#252;ez,\" that he \"[d]id not follow 4 week cycle plan [for visiting doctors] as instructed,\" and that he was \"[o]ver-sampling targets and non-targets.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Garc&#237;a noted similar concerns, in more detail, in an email he sent on January 31, 2000 to Antonio Hern&#225;ndez, another District Manager in Florida, and Noel D&#237;az, who was slated to assume Garc&#237;a's duties in the Commonwealth in the newly-created position of District Manager for Puerto Rico. Although Ram&#237;rez questioned the basis for these concerns when he received his evaluation, the record does not indicate that he pursued his objections any further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az became the District Manager for Puerto Rico, and therefore Ram&#237;rez's direct supervisor, on February 28, 2000. In March 2000, BIPI informed Ram&#237;rez and the other PSRs that it was restructuring the Puerto Rico sales region to accommodate an expansion in the size of the sales force, <i>i.e.,</i> an increase from 5 PSRs to 7 PSRs. As a result of the restructuring, Ram&#237;rez lost the city of Ponce and gained the municipality of Arecibo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in March 2000, D&#237;az asserted that Ram&#237;rez had failed to timely renew his car registration and driver's license and therefore was driving his company car without valid documentation. As a result of D&#237;az's assertion, Ram&#237;rez also received an admonishing email from Larry Wood, BIPI's Regional Director for the Southeast Region. Ram&#237;rez responded by submitting evidence that he had renewed both his license and registration on time. In a letter to Wood, Ram&#237;rez described the accusations as \"baseless and only launched with ulterior motives as part of a personal agenda to terminate my employment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 2000, while the dispute regarding the license and registration was ongoing, Ram&#237;rez suffered a stroke. Attributing the stroke to the stress of an argument with D&#237;az, Ram&#237;rez applied for treatment under the State Insurance Fund, Puerto Rico's workmen's compensation program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 2000, D&#237;az reported to Wood additional concerns about Ram&#237;rez's sampling practices. Specifically, in an email to Wood, D&#237;az reported that (1) Ram&#237;rez's physician database was composed largely of primary care physicians rather than the sub-specialists who would be expected to receive a large proportion of samples, (2) 50% of the physician listings in the database had only postal, not physical, addresses, and (3) Ram&#237;rez did not appear to be contacting important specialized physicians. D&#237;az also reported talking to two cardiologists who had asked Ram&#237;rez not to return to their offices after he asked them to sign confirmation documents, <i>i.e.,</i> SSDs, that overstated the number of samples that he had provided. In the email, D&#237;az speculated that Ram&#237;rez was \"maintain[ing] a base of physicians that allow him to dump large amounts of samples. In return he gets four or five signed slips without date. He then allocates the signed slips on a monthly basis and enters them accordingly to the system.\" D&#237;az also expressed concerns about Ram&#237;rez's storage of samples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, 2000, Wood sent a letter instructing Ram&#237;rez to move his samples within five days from his mother's house to a commercial storage facility. Acknowledging that Ram&#237;rez was on short-term disability leave, Wood offered to arrange for the samples to be moved if Ram&#237;rez was unable to transport them himself. At the time, Ram&#237;rez was the only PSR in Puerto Rico who did not store his samples in a commercial facility. In a letter dated May 19, 2000, Ram&#237;rez responded that his previous District Manager had approved the storage arrangement. In the letter, Ram&#237;rez also noted that he felt \"persecuted, harassed and discriminated by Mr. Noel D&#237;az because of my age and time with the company.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Wood replied to Ram&#237;rez's letter on June 9, 2000. He assured Ram&#237;rez that he would investigate the claims of persecution, harassment and discrimination, but reiterated that Ram&#237;rez had to move his samples. Wood also cautioned that \"failure to follow my directive may constitute insubordination, which can result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.\" Ram&#237;rez ultimately moved the samples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wood and Ram&#237;rez met on July 13, 2000 to discuss Ram&#237;rez's complaints of harassment and discrimination. In a letter dated September 19, 2000, Wood indicated that \"both prior and subsequent to our July 13th meeting, I conducted an investigation of your allegations of discrimination and harassment. Please be advised that after careful investigation, I found no support for your allegations that you have been subject to discriminatory or harassing behavior by [D&#237;az] or by any Company employee.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 2000, BIPI informed Ram&#237;rez that he would be laid off as of October 13, 2000 because his short-term disability benefits were expiring and he had not \"provided documentation that enables [his] return to work.\" On October 10, 2000, Ram&#237;rez informed D&#237;az that he had received authorization from the State Insurance Fund to return to work the following day. Accordingly, Ram&#237;rez returned to work from short-term disability leave on October 11, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az, Hern&#225;ndez, and Wood met with Ram&#237;rez on October 20, 2000 to outline a series of directives with which Ram&#237;rez had to comply upon returning to work and to establish deadlines for completion of those directives. On May 10, 2001, D&#237;az informed Wood that he and Hern&#225;ndez had visited several doctors in Ram&#237;rez's sales territory and that the doctors had reported irregularities in Ram&#237;rez's sampling practice. According to D&#237;az, the doctors reported that Ram&#237;rez left blank SSDs to be signed outside his presence or asked them to sign undated SSDs, both violations of BIPI policy, which is designed to ensure compliance with federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on May 10, 2001, Ram&#237;rez asserted that pursuant to an order by D&#237;az, he had not received any literature or promotional materials since December 2000. In a letter to Wood, D&#237;az responded that he had arranged to stop delivery of promotional materials and samples to Ram&#237;rez while he was on short-term disability leave. D&#237;az maintained that Ram&#237;rez \"started to receive his normal shipments\" upon his return to work in October 2000 and that he did not know why Ram&#237;rez had not received his December 2000 order. D&#237;az also indicated that he had again arranged to stop delivery of samples and material to Ram&#237;rez as of May 10, 2001 based on the doctors' reports regarding Ram&#237;rez's sampling practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 2001, Ram&#237;rez filed a claim with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (ADU), alleging that D&#237;az</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">began a series of harassing acts against me [in February 2000]... due to my age. These acts on the part of the company, by means of [D&#237;az and Wood], consisted in changing my sales region in a manner which was disadvantageous to myself ...; forcing to change the place of storing my samples to Ponce, in spite of the fact that my residence and seat of operations is in Mayaguez; make or promote accusations of insubordination when I complained about the treatment that I was receiving; false pointing out of negligence in the use of my car and improper intervention with my treatment by the State Insurance Fund ... [w]hen I was in my disability caused by a stroke [that] occurred during a heavy discussion with Mr. D&#237;az.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During August 2001, D&#237;az continued to investigate Ram&#237;rez's sampling practices. On August 15, 2001, Ram&#237;rez was terminated. In a letter confirming Ram&#237;rez's termination, Wood attributed the decision to his \"violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Company policy as it relates to sample distribution and documentation.\" Following his termination, Ram&#237;rez amended his ADU claim to include a charge of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez filed the present suit in the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico on August 20, 2002, alleging violations of the ADEA and Puerto Rico law. BIPI filed a motion for summary judgment on February 9, 2004, and Ram&#237;rez filed an opposition to the motion on April 2, 2004. On September 24, 2004, the court found that Ram&#237;rez had not established a prima facie case of age discrimination and that, even if Ram&#237;rez had made his prima facie case, he had not demonstrated that BIPI's asserted non-discriminatory reason for terminating him &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> violations of the PDMA and company sampling policies &#8212; was pretextual. The court also found that Ram&#237;rez's retaliation claim was flawed for essentially the same reasons, namely that he had not made a prima facie showing that he was dismissed in retaliation for filing a claim with the ADU and that, even if he could make such a prima facie showing, he had not established that BIPI's asserted non-discriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment for BIPI on all claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez challenges not only the merits of the district court's summary judgment ruling, but also its handling of several discovery and evidentiary issues. We turn to those preliminary issues first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to compel discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defending against the claim of discrimination and retaliation, BIPI has asserted that it terminated Ram&#237;rez solely because of violations of the PDMA and company sampling policy. This claim of violations rests on written statements by three physicians regarding Ram&#237;rez's improper sampling practices. Although BIPI disclosed the statements to Ram&#237;rez during discovery, it did so only after redacting the physicians' names and addresses, citing the physicians' concerns that Ram&#237;rez might seek reprisal against them if he learned their identities. Ram&#237;rez filed a motion to compel discovery of the identifying information, arguing that he had a right to \"know all the details related to th[e] statements, and to depose, if necessary, those physicians who allegedly prepared said statements.\" BIPI opposed the motion and sought a protective order. The district court denied the motion to compel and granted the protective order. On appeal, Ram&#237;rez assigns error to the denial of his motion to compel and the corresponding grant of a protective order. Reviewing the court's ruling under the deferential abuse of discretion standard, <i>see Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.1996), we reject Ram&#237;rez's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits the district court to grant a protective order in the discovery context for \"good cause shown.\" The district court explained that it was granting BIPI's request for protection to \"safeguard what appears to be a legitimate concern for defendant,\" <i>i.e.,</i> the physicians' fear of reprisal by Ram&#237;rez. Ram&#237;rez challenges the court's explanation on the grounds that BIPI \"did not submit any supporting document or specific fact to sustain the [physicians'] alleged `fears'\" of reprisal, and therefore did not show good cause for the order. He further faults the district court for \"fail[ing] to discuss whether the producing party's burden of production and its interests outweighed the opposing party's right to obtain the information sought.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it perhaps would have been preferable for the district court to explain its decision to grant a protective order in more depth, <i>see United States v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 165 F.3d 952, 959-60 (D.C.Cir.1999) (noting that Rule 26(c) requires \"an individualized balancing of the many interests that may be present in a particular case\"), its failure to do so does not affect our analysis. <i>FDIC v. Ogden Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir.2000) (noting that \"[w]e have thus far refused to insist upon a rigid rule\" precluding summary disposition of pre-trial discovery motions). As we have repeatedly stated, \"[i]t is well settled that the trial judge has broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management matters.\" <i>Ayala-Gerena,</i> 95 F.3d at 91. Here, the court used its discretion to craft an order tailored to the situation it faced. Although that order denied Ram&#237;rez access to the physicians' identifying information, the court indicated that the order was merely a \"temporary remedy ... [that] may be modified if adequate safeguards are offered\" and specifically invited Ram&#237;rez's counsel to \"propose to the court alternatives to safeguard what appears to be a legitimate concern for defendant.\" The court also emphasized that it \"remains open to solutions.\" In short, the court did not treat its protective order as definitively precluding Ram&#237;rez from engaging in further discovery regarding the statements. Rather, the court expressed a willingness to work with Ram&#237;rez to balance the physicians' privacy and safety concerns with his interest in conducting discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the court's explicit invitation, Ram&#237;rez does not appear to have suggested any alternative methods by which he could conduct discovery regarding the physician statements. The reason for this omission is not clear from the record. If Ram&#237;rez felt that he did not have enough time to respond to the court's invitation before addressing BIPI's motion for summary judgment &#8212; which was pending when the court issued the protective order<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> &#8212; he could have informed the court of his situation by means of a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It is undisputed that he did not file such a motion. Instead, Ram&#237;rez filed a motion in limine with his opposition to the summary judgment motion, seeking to exclude the physicians' statements entirely on the ground that he had been \"denied his right to discover relevant information and to confront the alleged evidence in which Defendant attempts to sustain its nondiscriminatory reason to discharge him.\" Nowhere in the motion in limine did Ram&#237;rez acknowledge the court's willingness to consider alternative avenues by which he could discover information relating to the statements or request more time to proffer such alternatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is troubling that Ramirez did not have an opportunity to challenge the doctor's accounts that led to his termination. While this case is not about whether the statements are true or not, <i>see infra</i> Section II.B.2, evidence of falsity would be relevant to a claim that BIPI's professed reliance on the statements was a pretext for age discrimination. Ram&#237;rez, however, bears substantial responsibility for his own predicament because of his failure to respond to the court's invitation for proposals for modification of the protective order. In light of Ram&#237;rez's failure to take advantage of this opportunity, his claim that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion to compel discovery and granting the protective order rings hollow. <i>Cf. Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 45 (1st Cir.1998) (\"A party relying on Rule 56(f) must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing discovery.\"); <i>Springfield Terminal Ry. v. Can. Pac. Ltd.,</i> 133 F.3d 103, 109 (1st Cir.1997) (cautioning that \"failure to resort to such first aid [as Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f)] will ordinarily bar belated aid\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Ram&#237;rez asserts that the court implicitly rejected the motion by considering the disputed evidence in its order granting summary judgment, and that the rejection was erroneous.

On appeal, Ram&#237;rez continues to assert that because he was not able to conduct discovery regarding the identity of the physicians, the physician statements are inadmissible hearsay and the corresponding statements must be deleted from BIPI's proposed statement of uncontested facts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Hearsay claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez asserts that the evidence and statements that we have just described constitute inadmissible hearsay. \"`Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Hearsay evidence is not admissible at trial, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 802, or for summary judgment purposes, <i>see Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1998), unless it falls within one of the exceptions specified in the Federal Rules of Evidence. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 802. In Ram&#237;rez's view, none of the evidence that he seeks to exclude is covered by a hearsay exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the risk of stating the obvious, whether a particular statement falls within a hearsay exception is relevant only if the statement is, in fact, hearsay. We must therefore consider, as an initial matter, whether any of the evidence at issue &#8212; either Riberio's report or the physician statements &#8212; is hearsay. By definition, hearsay is a statement \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). BIPI asserts that it did not offer the evidence at issue to prove the truth of the matter asserted. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"matter asserted\" in both Riberio's report and the physician statements is essentially that Ram&#237;rez's sampling practice was inconsistent with company policy and the PDMA. The company offers these assertions to explain the basis for its decision to terminate Ram&#237;rez from his employment. That explanation alone has evidentiary significance. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that in an employment discrimination case, \"once the plaintiff has met the low standard of showing prima facie discrimination, the employer must articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason [for the adverse employment action] in response\"). In short, the report and physician statements were not offered to prove that Ram&#237;rez engaged in misconduct, but rather to demonstrate that his superiors had reason, based on a thorough investigation, to believe that he had.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to rescue his claim, Ram&#237;rez asserts that Ribiero's report and the physician statements were, in fact, submitted to demonstrate that Ram&#237;rez violated company and industry-wide sampling policies, <i>i.e.,</i> for the truth of the matter asserted. He maintains that BIPI has defended its decision to terminate him on the grounds that he engaged in such misconduct, rather than on the more nuanced ground that it <i>thought</i> he had engaged in such misconduct. We reject this reasoning. Although BIPI may have framed its argument inconsistently at times, it explained in its motion for summary judgment that \"the results of [the] investigation into plaintiff's sampling practices ... led to the conclusion that plaintiff had incurred in serious violations of the PDMA and Company policies.\" BIPI further explained, in opposing Ram&#237;rez's motion in limine, that the evidence at issue was \"not being offered to prove that the plaintiff in fact engaged in the practice of over-sampling or violated company policies, but to show that this was the information defendant had before it and that defendant considered this information when it made its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment.\" In short, BIPI has defended its decision on the grounds that it thought, based on its investigation, that Ram&#237;rez had engaged in misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez challenges the court's grant of summary judgment for BIPI on his age discrimination claim. Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the ADEA, it is \"unlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(a)(1). The district court properly considered Ram&#237;rez's ADEA claim under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Once that reason is articulated, the presumption of discrimination drops out of the picture, the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework with its presumptions and burdens disappears, and the sole remaining issue is of discrimination vel non.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 44-45 (internal citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the relevant legal framework,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> we turn to the specific facts of the case at hand. Instead of evaluating Ram&#237;rez's <i>prima facie</i> case, as the district court did, we assume <i>arguendo</i> that Ram&#237;rez has made out a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination based on age. In response, BIPI has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate Ram&#237;rez's employment&#8212;namely, its conclusion, based on the results of an investigation, that Ram&#237;rez's sampling practices violated the PDMA and company policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> At this stage, then, \"[t]he question to be resolved is whether the defendant's explanation of its conduct, together with any other evidence, could reasonably be seen by a jury not only to be false but to suggest an age-driven animus.\" <i>Ronda-Perez v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria &#8212; P.R.,</i> 404 F.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir.2005). Urging us to answer this question in the affirmative, Ram&#237;rez asserts that BIPI's articulated reason for his termination was false and alleges that several aspects of BIPI's conduct reveal a discriminatory animus based on age. We examine these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Territory reorganization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2000, BIPI realigned the sales territories in Puerto Rico to accommodate an expansion of its sales force from five PSRs to seven PSRs. Ram&#237;rez asserts that the realignment had a negative impact on him and another PSR, F&#233;lix Ruiz, who was 58 years old at the time, and that the more desirable territories were given to the new 28- and 35-year old PSRs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Ram&#237;rez focuses on the fact that Ponce was removed from his territory and replaced with Arecibo, which has fewer specialists spread over a wider geographical area. He emphasizes that his new territory had 88 specialists and Ruiz's had 82 specialists, while the 28- and 35-year-old PSRs' territories had 208 specialists and 121 specialists, respectively. While acknowledging that territories had been reorganized, and that Ponce had been removed from his territory before, Ram&#237;rez asserts that \"the process followed in prior reorganizations was different. Appellant and Mr. F&#233;lix Ruiz were consulted, and all changes were discussed with them prior to becoming in effect.... The 2000 reorganization was [behind] closed doors.\" Together, Ram&#237;rez asserts, this evidence is sufficient to create a dispute of material fact as to whether the reorganization reflected a discriminatory animus. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez has conceded that BIPI has reorganized its territories in the past and that Ponce was removed from his territory in 1995. Although he has not explained the circumstances of the 1995 removal, it is notable that he does not assert that the 1995 removal was motivated by a discriminatory animus. The only difference he cites between prior reorganizations and the 2000 reorganization is that during prior reorganizations, PSRs were consulted and that new employees were given less complex territories. The fact that PSRs were not consulted before the 2000 reorganization is not evidence that the reorganization was carried out in a discriminatory way. Nor has Ram&#237;rez offered evidence that the 2000 reorganization was a deviation from BIPI's policy &#8212; if BIPI had such a policy in the first place &#8212; of assigning less complex territories to newer PSRs. He has pointed out only that the newly created territories had more specialists than his, not that they were somehow more complex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Discriminatory comments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez asserts that D&#237;az, his supervisor at the time of his termination, Valeriano Garc&#237;a, the district manager who supervised Ram&#237;rez prior to D&#237;az, and Antonio Hern&#225;ndez, a district manager in Florida, made comments that reflect a discriminatory animus and therefore support a finding that BIPI's articulated reason for his termination was pretextual. The district court, quoting <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir.2000), recognized that \"[d]iscriminatory comments may be probative of pretext if a plaintiff can `show that discriminatory comments were made by the key decisionmaker or those in a position to influence the decisionmaker.'\" The court concluded, however, that \"[g]iven Defendant's compelling stated reason for Plaintiff's termination, the[] stray remarks [cited by Ram&#237;rez] do not permit the inference that Defendant's real motivation for Plaintiff's discharge was age discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez asserts that in considering the allegedly discriminatory comments, the district court failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to him, and instead \"weighted the evidence in favor of the appellee.\" We consider this argument with regard to each of the comments that Ram&#237;rez has identified as discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>\"Sacred cows\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the deposition testimony of PSR Rafael Oliver, Ram&#237;rez asserts that during a private meeting on January 12, 2000, D&#237;az told Oliver and another PSR, Rommel Barnacet, \"that he (Mr. D&#237;az) had orders to `cut off' the heads of older sales representatives that Mr. D&#237;az, Mr. Rommel Barnacet, and Mr. Oliver called `the sacred cows,' but that they should keep this information secret.\" This description does not accurately reflect Oliver's testimony, which was that D&#237;az said that he had instructions to cut off the heads of some \"sacred cows,\" not of \"older sales representatives.\" It was Oliver who interpreted the comment as a reference to age.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Oliver also testified that he was considered a \"sacred cow\" because he was disabled, but that Barnacet, who was five years younger than Oliver, was not a sacred cow. Nevertheless, given the summary judgment posture of this case, we conclude that the district court erred in disregarding the \"sacred cows\" comment altogether. Oliver testified that he understood \"sacred cows\" as a reference to the oldest PSRs in terms of both seniority and age. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Ram&#237;rez, we think that a jury relying on Oliver's testimony could interpret D&#237;az's comment as a reference to age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, Ram&#237;rez also emphasizes the deposition testimony of Ruiz that during a meeting on February 28, 2000, D&#237;az stated that he had \"instructions from management that they had to `cut off the heads' of the oldest representatives.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> This testimony, like Oliver's testimony, is somewhat ambiguous. It appears that Ruiz described only the instruction to \"cut off the heads\" as a quote from D&#237;az. We cannot tell from the testimony whether D&#237;az referred specifically to \"the oldest representatives,\" or if D&#237;az made a different reference that Ruiz interpreted as a reference to age, as was the case with Oliver. Again, however, given the posture of this case, we recognize that a jury could interpret the comment as a reference to age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Employee salary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the deposition testimony of PSR Rafael Oliver, \"there were always comments\" from Garc&#237;a and Hern&#225;ndez to the effect that \"you have to pay two [employees] in their twenties less than one in his fifties because of what is being earned. That with that salary they would pay two, or they would pay two and a half.\" Ram&#237;rez cites this statement as evidence that \"Mr. D&#237;az, Mr. Hern&#225;ndez, and Mr. Garc&#237;a preferred young sales representatives,\" and therefore that he was terminated because of his age. Even if this statement does reflect age bias (the inference most favorable to Ram&#237;rez), Ram&#237;rez has cited no evidence on appeal that either Hern&#225;ndez or Garc&#237;a &#8212; as opposed to D&#237;az, his direct supervisor &#8212; was involved in the decision to terminate him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> \"[S]tatements made either by nondecisionmakers[,] or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.\" <i>Gonzalez v.

Moreover, as the district court also noted, \"[w]hile Mr. Oliver [also] claims that Mr. Hern&#225;ndez stated that `these people are in the twilight zone' after meetings with unnamed employees, notably, Mr. Oliver's quote makes no reference to age.\" To the contrary, Oliver interpreted the \"twilight zone\" comment as referring to people who did not meet their sales quotas. More importantly, as we have already noted, Ram&#237;rez cites no evidence on appeal to demonstrate that Hern&#225;ndez was involved in the decision to terminate him. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Disparate treatment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez asserts that he was subjected to adverse disparate treatment that revealed a discriminatory animus on the part of his superiors. The district court rejected this contention, concluding that it rested on \"unsupported allegations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Employee discipline</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez contends that BIPI has a disciplinary procedure requiring \"progressive discipline before termination or discharge\" and that the procedure was not followed in his case. He further asserts that other employees \"did not use the proper sampling and targeting procedures\" but that \"no one else was disciplined, much less discharged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that BIPI's employee manual sets forth a procedure to \"monitor consistent non-compliance\" with the rules established for ensuring sampling accountability. However, the manual also sets forth a series of \"unacceptable\" practices that \"will result in varying levels of disciplinary action up to and <i>including termination.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) One of the practices listed is \"any violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987,\" the ground that BIPI has cited for Ram&#237;rez's termination. Moreover, the manual also cautions that \"[t]ermination of employment can result ... in the event of any breach of discipline or job standards which is deemed serious enough.\" BIPI apparently concluded that Ram&#237;rez's perceived violations of the PDMA and company policies designed to comply with that Act were \"serious enough\" to result in termination, rather than a lesser sanction. It is not our role to second-guess the merits of that conclusion. <i>See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits &#8212; or even the rationality &#8212; of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Ram&#237;rez asserts that other employees did not use proper sampling procedures but were not disciplined, he has not identified any employee who engaged in sampling violations akin to those for which he was terminated. The closest Ram&#237;rez comes is an allegation that Garc&#237;a, his former supervisor, \"gave orders to use un-approved and illegal materials.\" The documents to which Ram&#237;rez cites in support of this proposition are far from clear, however, and they do not indicate whether, if Garc&#237;a did violate company policy designed to comply with the PDMA, decisionmakers at BIPI were aware of the violation. Accordingly, we reject Ram&#237;rez's claim that his termination reflects disparate treatment based on his age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Salary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez did not receive a merit-based salary increase for the year 2001, while all other PSRs did. In an email informing Ram&#237;rez of the salary decision, D&#237;az explained that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">merit increases are based on the sales and general performance of any given representative during a one year period. The guideline for the year 2000 was 4.0%. Unfortunately your extended leave of absence due to Short Term Disability did not allow a fair evaluation period to make the merit assessment for the year. Therefore the decision has been made to leave your year 2000 base pay unchanged at $63,500.00 for the year 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his motion opposing summary judgment, and again on appeal, Ram&#237;rez asserts the denial of a salary increase violated company policy. Contrary to Ram&#237;rez's representation, however, company policy does not establish that \"any employee on leave will receive a salary increase in proportion to the time worked.\" Rather, it provides that \"<i>[i]f approved,</i> a proratum will apply to all annual merit reviews when issued for less than a 12 month salary cycle\" and that \"[t]he amount of your merit increase, if any, is discretionary.\" (Emphasis added.) BIPI did not approve a merit-based increase for 2001 because it was unable to evaluate Ram&#237;rez's performance for 2000. Company policy therefore did not require an increase in proportion to the time worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez asserts that the denial of a salary increase reflects disparate treatment nonetheless because, unlike Ram&#237;rez, PSR Oliver received salary increases while on short-term disability. The only evidence that Ram&#237;rez cites for this proposition is his own \"unsworn statement under penalty of perjury.\" While the document that Ram&#237;rez cites is admissible for summary judgment purposes despite being unsworn, <i>see Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer &amp; Hertell v. Medfit Int'l, Inc.,</i> 982 F.2d 686, 689-90 (1st Cir.1993), his specific statement about Oliver's salary is inadmissible because Ram&#237;rez does not explain the basis for his knowledge. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <i>Cloutier v. Costco Wholesale Corp.,</i> 390 F.3d 126, 137 (1st Cir.2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 2940, 162 L.Ed.2d 873 (2005). We therefore cannot credit Ram&#237;rez's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Conditions upon return from short-term disability</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ram&#237;rez asserts that he was singled out for adverse disparate treatment upon his return from short term disability, when BIPI imposed \"work rules, conditions, and examinations not required [of] other [PSRs].\" The only sources that Ram&#237;rez cites for his contention that similar requirements were not imposed on other PSRs are his own deposition testimony to that effect and a letter that he wrote to D&#237;az regarding his compliance with the conditions, in which he asserted that after speaking with Ruiz and Oliver, he learned that \"after their short term disability, they were never required to comply with these directives or similar directives.\" This evidence does not help Ram&#237;rez. First, the statements of Ruiz and Oliver are inadmissible hearsay. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), 802. Second, even if the evidence were admissible, it still does not establish that Ram&#237;rez was subjected to adverse disparate treatment based on his age. As Ram&#237;rez's own statements indicate, Ruiz &#8212; who is eight years older than Ram&#237;rez &#8212; was not subjected to similar treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Falsity of stated reason</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez also alleges that BIPI falsified the physicians' statements or requested them only after it had made the decision to terminate him. He has provided no evidence, however, to substantiate those allegations, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (cautioning that \"[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> and the evidence that is in the record supports a finding that BIPI did not fabricate its articulated reason for terminating Ram&#237;rez's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter confirming Ram&#237;rez's termination, BIPI attributed its decision to Ram&#237;rez's \"violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Company policy as it relates to sample distribution and documentation.\" BIPI has produced the physicians' statements that led it to this conclusion, which it has articulated consistently throughout the course of this litigation. <i>See Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 47 (emphasizing that explanations by representatives of an employer for their decision to terminate the plaintiff \"are themselves consistent and not contradicted by either contemporaneous documents or statements made at termination, or statements made later\"). As the district court recognized, BIPI also proffered evidence of other \"perceived irregularities in Plaintiff's sales practice\" dating back several years, as well as evidence of its investigation into the irregularities. The record thus presents no basis for a finding that BIPI did not believe, in good faith, that it had a legitimate reason to terminate Ram&#237;rez. We recognize that \"the employer's good faith belief is not automatically conclusive\" on the issue of pretext. However, there is also no evidence in the record to support a jury finding that the articulated reason, though honestly held, \"constituted discrimination (e.g., stereotyping).\" <i>Id.</i> at 45-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a defendant is entitled to summary judgment on an ADEA claim, we must consider, <i>inter alia,</i> \"the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). As we have discussed, Ram&#237;rez has offered virtually no proof that BIPI's explanation for his termination is false. He has not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the territory reorganization was motivated by a discriminatory animus or that he suffered adverse disparate treatment as a result of his age. Nor are the comments by Garc&#237;a and Hern&#225;ndez probative of discriminatory animus, without evidence that they were involved in the decision to terminate him. Moreover, there is no support in the record for Ram&#237;rez's claim that BIPI fabricated the physicians' statements or obtained them after it had decided to terminate him based on his age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the only evidence of a discriminatory motive that Ram&#237;rez has unearthed are two comments by D&#237;az in early 2000 that a jury could interpret to evince animus based on age. However, Ram&#237;rez was not terminated until more than eighteen months after D&#237;az made the comments at issue, and at the time of his termination, Ruiz, who is several years older than Ram&#237;rez, was still employed at the company. Against this background, we conclude that D&#237;az's comments, standing alone, are insufficient to support a finding that Ram&#237;rez was terminated because of his age. The district court was correct to grant summary judgment to BIPI on the ADEA discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez challenges the court's grant of summary judgment on his claim that he was terminated in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (ADU). We review the court's summary judgment ruling <i>de novo. Gonzalez-Pina,</i> 407 F.3d at 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to prohibiting age discrimination, the ADEA also protects individuals who invoke the statute's protections. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(d) (\"It shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees... because such individual ... has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or ... made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under this chapter.\"). Where there is no direct evidence of retaliation, our analysis of a claim under &#167; 623(d) closely tracks the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. First, \"the plaintiff must make a <i>prima facie</i> showing that (i) he engaged in ADEA-protected conduct, (ii) he was thereafter subjected to an adverse employment action, and (iii) a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\" <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 827.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of retaliation, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, if the defendant presents such a reason, \"the ultimate burden falls on the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reason is a pretext masking retaliation for the employee's opposition to a practice cast into doubt by the ADEA.\" <i>Id.</i> As we emphasized in <i>Mesnick,</i> the \"critical inquiry [is] whether the aggregate evidence of pretext and retaliatory animus suffices to make out a jury question.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez filed a complaint with the ADU on June 13, 2001, asserting that he had been subjected to \"a series of harassing acts... due to [his] age.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> He was terminated approximately two months later, on August 15, 2001. Accordingly, the district court found, and BIPI has conceded, that Ram&#237;rez established the first two elements of the <i>prima facie</i> showing described in <i>Mesnick,</i> namely that he engaged in ADEA-protected conduct (<i>i.e.,</i> filing a complaint of age discrimination) and that he subsequently suffered an adverse employment action (<i>i.e.,</i> termination). The district court concluded, however, that Ram&#237;rez's <i>prima facie</i> case faltered on the third element, namely the existence of a causal connection between the filing of the ADU claim and the subsequent termination. The court found that the temporal proximity between the two events &#8212; two months &#8212; was \"insufficient, standing alone, to establish a causal connection.\" The court further held that even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Ram&#237;rez established a <i>prima facie</i> case, BIPI would still be entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation claim because it \"offered enough evidence to suggest that its decision to fire Plaintiff was based on Plaintiff's alleged malfeasance ... [and] Plaintiff has not offered any evidence to suggest that Defendant's actions were pretextual.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez emphasizes that although his superiors had concerns about his conduct by January 2000, they \"waited until August 2001 to discharge him, two months after he filed a charge of discrimination before the [ADU].\" While Ram&#237;rez's superiors speculated that he was engaging in improper \"oversampling\" as early as January 2000, however, the physician statements that BIPI cites as the basis for Ram&#237;rez's termination were not documented until May 10, 2001. Ram&#237;rez filed his complaint with the ADU one month later. He therefore was terminated three months after Wood received the physician complaints and two months after engaging in ADEA-protected activity. The fact that Wood terminated Ram&#237;rez after he filed his ADU claim rather than before does not, standing alone, establish a causal connection between the ADU complaint and the termination. \"[C]hronological proximity does not by itself establish causality, particularly if `[t]he larger picture undercuts any claim of causation.'\" <i>Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,</i> 352 F.3d 472, 478 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez's other causation argument rests on the fact that he was terminated without notice instead of being subjected to less severe discipline first, as he asserts would have been consistent with company policies. As we have already discussed, however, Ram&#237;rez's termination was not inconsistent with company policy, nor has he provided evidence that other employees were subjected to less severe discipline (or no discipline at all) based on similar conduct. The fact that he was terminated, rather than merely reprimanded, two months after filing an ADU complaint does not establish that the termination was causally linked to the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Ram&#237;rez offered evidence to support a finding that BIPI's articulated reason for the termination &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> violations of company sampling policy and the PDMA &#8212; was a pretext for retaliation. He has not, for example, pointed to any \"comments by the employer which intimate a retaliatory mindset\" or demonstrated that he was subjected to differential treatment after filing the ADU complaint. <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 828.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> Ram&#237;rez does attempt to demonstrate pretext by arguing that the physicians' statements were inadmissible hearsay and thus BIPI has not advanced a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination.

It is true that the March 2000 territory reorganization occurred more than 300 days before Ram&#237;rez filed his ADU claim on June 13, 2001. We do not view Ram&#237;rez's reference to the reorganization as an attempt to recover for a discrete act, however, but rather as part of his effort to demonstrate that BIPI's stated reason for his termination was pretextual.

While that may be the case, there is no evidence to support Ram&#237;rez's contention that the order to move his samples reflected a discriminatory animus. Before Wood's order, Ram&#237;rez was the only PSR in Puerto Rico who did not store his samples in a commercial facility.

He worked as a professional sales representative (PSR) for BIPI from November 1, 1977 to August 15, 2001, when he was terminated. As the district court explained, Ramirez's \"principal activity\" as a PSR was \"promoting [BIPI's] products by conducting visits to physicians, hospitals, and pharmacies, educating health professionals about [BIPI's] products, and providing product samples.\" Ram&#237;rez, like all of the PSRs, was assigned to a particular geographic territory. At the time of his termination, he was assigned to the southwest region of Puerto Rico. Relevant to this case, BIPI policy requires PSRs to obtain a signed Sample Signature Document (SSD) each time they provide drug samples to a doctor. The SSD must be completed in full in the PSR's presence. BIPI's sampling policy is designed to comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 301 <i>et seq.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before 1999, Ram&#237;rez routinely received positive performance evaluations for his work. In his 1999 evaluation of Ram&#237;rez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> district manager Valeriano Garc&#237;a (Garc&#237;a) &#8212; the BIPI District Manager for Puerto Rico and Miami, and Ram&#237;rez's direct supervisor &#8212; rated Ram&#237;rez as meeting expectations in most areas. However, Garc&#237;a also raised several concerns about Ram&#237;rez's performance. Specifically, Garc&#237;a noted that Ram&#237;rez \"[d]id not call on [doctors in his territory] other than [in] Ponce and Mayag&#252;ez,\" that he \"[d]id not follow 4 week cycle plan [for visiting doctors] as instructed,\" and that he was \"[o]ver-sampling targets and non-targets.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Garc&#237;a noted similar concerns, in more detail, in an email he sent on January 31, 2000 to Antonio Hern&#225;ndez, another District Manager in Florida, and Noel D&#237;az, who was slated to assume Garc&#237;a's duties in the Commonwealth in the newly-created position of District Manager for Puerto Rico. Although Ram&#237;rez questioned the basis for these concerns when he received his evaluation, the record does not indicate that he pursued his objections any further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az became the District Manager for Puerto Rico, and therefore Ram&#237;rez's direct supervisor, on February 28, 2000. In March 2000, BIPI informed Ram&#237;rez and the other PSRs that it was restructuring the Puerto Rico sales region to accommodate an expansion in the size of the sales force, <i>i.e.,</i> an increase from 5 PSRs to 7 PSRs. As a result of the restructuring, Ram&#237;rez lost the city of Ponce and gained the municipality of Arecibo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in March 2000, D&#237;az asserted that Ram&#237;rez had failed to timely renew his car registration and driver's license and therefore was driving his company car without valid documentation. As a result of D&#237;az's assertion, Ram&#237;rez also received an admonishing email from Larry Wood, BIPI's Regional Director for the Southeast Region. Ram&#237;rez responded by submitting evidence that he had renewed both his license and registration on time. In a letter to Wood, Ram&#237;rez described the accusations as \"baseless and only launched with ulterior motives as part of a personal agenda to terminate my employment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 2000, while the dispute regarding the license and registration was ongoing, Ram&#237;rez suffered a stroke. Attributing the stroke to the stress of an argument with D&#237;az, Ram&#237;rez applied for treatment under the State Insurance Fund, Puerto Rico's workmen's compensation program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 2000, D&#237;az reported to Wood additional concerns about Ram&#237;rez's sampling practices. Specifically, in an email to Wood, D&#237;az reported that (1) Ram&#237;rez's physician database was composed largely of primary care physicians rather than the sub-specialists who would be expected to receive a large proportion of samples, (2) 50% of the physician listings in the database had only postal, not physical, addresses, and (3) Ram&#237;rez did not appear to be contacting important specialized physicians. D&#237;az also reported talking to two cardiologists who had asked Ram&#237;rez not to return to their offices after he asked them to sign confirmation documents, <i>i.e.,</i> SSDs, that overstated the number of samples that he had provided. In the email, D&#237;az speculated that Ram&#237;rez was \"maintain[ing] a base of physicians that allow him to dump large amounts of samples. In return he gets four or five signed slips without date. He then allocates the signed slips on a monthly basis and enters them accordingly to the system.\" D&#237;az also expressed concerns about Ram&#237;rez's storage of samples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 8, 2000, Wood sent a letter instructing Ram&#237;rez to move his samples within five days from his mother's house to a commercial storage facility. Acknowledging that Ram&#237;rez was on short-term disability leave, Wood offered to arrange for the samples to be moved if Ram&#237;rez was unable to transport them himself. At the time, Ram&#237;rez was the only PSR in Puerto Rico who did not store his samples in a commercial facility. In a letter dated May 19, 2000, Ram&#237;rez responded that his previous District Manager had approved the storage arrangement. In the letter, Ram&#237;rez also noted that he felt \"persecuted, harassed and discriminated by Mr. Noel D&#237;az because of my age and time with the company.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Wood replied to Ram&#237;rez's letter on June 9, 2000. He assured Ram&#237;rez that he would investigate the claims of persecution, harassment and discrimination, but reiterated that Ram&#237;rez had to move his samples. Wood also cautioned that \"failure to follow my directive may constitute insubordination, which can result in disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.\" Ram&#237;rez ultimately moved the samples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wood and Ram&#237;rez met on July 13, 2000 to discuss Ram&#237;rez's complaints of harassment and discrimination. In a letter dated September 19, 2000, Wood indicated that \"both prior and subsequent to our July 13th meeting, I conducted an investigation of your allegations of discrimination and harassment. Please be advised that after careful investigation, I found no support for your allegations that you have been subject to discriminatory or harassing behavior by [D&#237;az] or by any Company employee.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 2000, BIPI informed Ram&#237;rez that he would be laid off as of October 13, 2000 because his short-term disability benefits were expiring and he had not \"provided documentation that enables [his] return to work.\" On October 10, 2000, Ram&#237;rez informed D&#237;az that he had received authorization from the State Insurance Fund to return to work the following day. Accordingly, Ram&#237;rez returned to work from short-term disability leave on October 11, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D&#237;az, Hern&#225;ndez, and Wood met with Ram&#237;rez on October 20, 2000 to outline a series of directives with which Ram&#237;rez had to comply upon returning to work and to establish deadlines for completion of those directives. On May 10, 2001, D&#237;az informed Wood that he and Hern&#225;ndez had visited several doctors in Ram&#237;rez's sales territory and that the doctors had reported irregularities in Ram&#237;rez's sampling practice. According to D&#237;az, the doctors reported that Ram&#237;rez left blank SSDs to be signed outside his presence or asked them to sign undated SSDs, both violations of BIPI policy, which is designed to ensure compliance with federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on May 10, 2001, Ram&#237;rez asserted that pursuant to an order by D&#237;az, he had not received any literature or promotional materials since December 2000. In a letter to Wood, D&#237;az responded that he had arranged to stop delivery of promotional materials and samples to Ram&#237;rez while he was on short-term disability leave. D&#237;az maintained that Ram&#237;rez \"started to receive his normal shipments\" upon his return to work in October 2000 and that he did not know why Ram&#237;rez had not received his December 2000 order. D&#237;az also indicated that he had again arranged to stop delivery of samples and material to Ram&#237;rez as of May 10, 2001 based on the doctors' reports regarding Ram&#237;rez's sampling practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 2001, Ram&#237;rez filed a claim with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (ADU), alleging that D&#237;az</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">began a series of harassing acts against me [in February 2000]... due to my age.

On August 15, 2001, Ram&#237;rez was terminated. In a letter confirming Ram&#237;rez's termination, Wood attributed the decision to his \"violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Company policy as it relates to sample distribution and documentation.\" Following his termination, Ram&#237;rez amended his ADU claim to include a charge of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez filed the present suit in the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico on August 20, 2002, alleging violations of the ADEA and Puerto Rico law. BIPI filed a motion for summary judgment on February 9, 2004, and Ram&#237;rez filed an opposition to the motion on April 2, 2004. On September 24, 2004, the court found that Ram&#237;rez had not established a prima facie case of age discrimination and that, even if Ram&#237;rez had made his prima facie case, he had not demonstrated that BIPI's asserted non-discriminatory reason for terminating him &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> violations of the PDMA and company sampling policies &#8212; was pretextual. The court also found that Ram&#237;rez's retaliation claim was flawed for essentially the same reasons, namely that he had not made a prima facie showing that he was dismissed in retaliation for filing a claim with the ADU and that, even if he could make such a prima facie showing, he had not established that BIPI's asserted non-discriminatory reason for firing him was pretextual. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment for BIPI on all claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez challenges not only the merits of the district court's summary judgment ruling, but also its handling of several discovery and evidentiary issues. We turn to those preliminary issues first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to compel discovery</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In defending against the claim of discrimination and retaliation, BIPI has asserted that it terminated Ram&#237;rez solely because of violations of the PDMA and company sampling policy. This claim of violations rests on written statements by three physicians regarding Ram&#237;rez's improper sampling practices. Although BIPI disclosed the statements to Ram&#237;rez during discovery, it did so only after redacting the physicians' names and addresses, citing the physicians' concerns that Ram&#237;rez might seek reprisal against them if he learned their identities. Ram&#237;rez filed a motion to compel discovery of the identifying information, arguing that he had a right to \"know all the details related to th[e] statements, and to depose, if necessary, those physicians who allegedly prepared said statements.\" BIPI opposed the motion and sought a protective order. The district court denied the motion to compel and granted the protective order. On appeal, Ram&#237;rez assigns error to the denial of his motion to compel and the corresponding grant of a protective order. Reviewing the court's ruling under the deferential abuse of discretion standard, <i>see Ayala-Gerena v.

Ram&#237;rez challenges the court's explanation on the grounds that BIPI \"did not submit any supporting document or specific fact to sustain the [physicians'] alleged `fears'\" of reprisal, and therefore did not show good cause for the order.

As we have repeatedly stated, \"[i]t is well settled that the trial judge has broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management matters.\" <i>Ayala-Gerena,</i> 95 F.3d at 91. Here, the court used its discretion to craft an order tailored to the situation it faced. Although that order denied Ram&#237;rez access to the physicians' identifying information, the court indicated that the order was merely a \"temporary remedy ... [that] may be modified if adequate safeguards are offered\" and specifically invited Ram&#237;rez's counsel to \"propose to the court alternatives to safeguard what appears to be a legitimate concern for defendant.\" The court also emphasized that it \"remains open to solutions.\" In short, the court did not treat its protective order as definitively precluding Ram&#237;rez from engaging in further discovery regarding the statements. Rather, the court expressed a willingness to work with Ram&#237;rez to balance the physicians' privacy and safety concerns with his interest in conducting discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the court's explicit invitation, Ram&#237;rez does not appear to have suggested any alternative methods by which he could conduct discovery regarding the physician statements. The reason for this omission is not clear from the record. If Ram&#237;rez felt that he did not have enough time to respond to the court's invitation before addressing BIPI's motion for summary judgment &#8212; which was pending when the court issued the protective order<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> &#8212; he could have informed the court of his situation by means of a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It is undisputed that he did not file such a motion. Instead, Ram&#237;rez filed a motion in limine with his opposition to the summary judgment motion, seeking to exclude the physicians' statements entirely on the ground that he had been \"denied his right to discover relevant information and to confront the alleged evidence in which Defendant attempts to sustain its nondiscriminatory reason to discharge him.\" Nowhere in the motion in limine did Ram&#237;rez acknowledge the court's willingness to consider alternative avenues by which he could discover information relating to the statements or request more time to proffer such alternatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is troubling that Ramirez did not have an opportunity to challenge the doctor's accounts that led to his termination. While this case is not about whether the statements are true or not, <i>see infra</i> Section II.B.2, evidence of falsity would be relevant to a claim that BIPI's professed reliance on the statements was a pretext for age discrimination. Ram&#237;rez, however, bears substantial responsibility for his own predicament because of his failure to respond to the court's invitation for proposals for modification of the protective order. In light of Ram&#237;rez's failure to take advantage of this opportunity, his claim that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion to compel discovery and granting the protective order rings hollow. <i>Cf.

He maintains that BIPI has defended its decision to terminate him on the grounds that he engaged in such misconduct, rather than on the more nuanced ground that it <i>thought</i> he had engaged in such misconduct. We reject this reasoning. Although BIPI may have framed its argument inconsistently at times, it explained in its motion for summary judgment that \"the results of [the] investigation into plaintiff's sampling practices ... led to the conclusion that plaintiff had incurred in serious violations of the PDMA and Company policies.\" BIPI further explained, in opposing Ram&#237;rez's motion in limine, that the evidence at issue was \"not being offered to prove that the plaintiff in fact engaged in the practice of over-sampling or violated company policies, but to show that this was the information defendant had before it and that defendant considered this information when it made its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment.\" In short, BIPI has defended its decision on the grounds that it thought, based on its investigation, that Ram&#237;rez had engaged in misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez challenges the court's grant of summary judgment for BIPI on his age discrimination claim.

Urging us to answer this question in the affirmative, Ram&#237;rez asserts that BIPI's articulated reason for his termination was false and alleges that several aspects of BIPI's conduct reveal a discriminatory animus based on age. We examine these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Territory reorganization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 2000, BIPI realigned the sales territories in Puerto Rico to accommodate an expansion of its sales force from five PSRs to seven PSRs. Ram&#237;rez asserts that the realignment had a negative impact on him and another PSR, F&#233;lix Ruiz, who was 58 years old at the time, and that the more desirable territories were given to the new 28- and 35-year old PSRs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> Ram&#237;rez focuses on the fact that Ponce was removed from his territory and replaced with Arecibo, which has fewer specialists spread over a wider geographical area. He emphasizes that his new territory had 88 specialists and Ruiz's had 82 specialists, while the 28- and 35-year-old PSRs' territories had 208 specialists and 121 specialists, respectively. While acknowledging that territories had been reorganized, and that Ponce had been removed from his territory before, Ram&#237;rez asserts that \"the process followed in prior reorganizations was different. Appellant and Mr. F&#233;lix Ruiz were consulted, and all changes were discussed with them prior to becoming in effect.... The 2000 reorganization was [behind] closed doors.\" Together, Ram&#237;rez asserts, this evidence is sufficient to create a dispute of material fact as to whether the reorganization reflected a discriminatory animus. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez has conceded that BIPI has reorganized its territories in the past and that Ponce was removed from his territory in 1995. Although he has not explained the circumstances of the 1995 removal, it is notable that he does not assert that the 1995 removal was motivated by a discriminatory animus. The only difference he cites between prior reorganizations and the 2000 reorganization is that during prior reorganizations, PSRs were consulted and that new employees were given less complex territories. The fact that PSRs were not consulted before the 2000 reorganization is not evidence that the reorganization was carried out in a discriminatory way. Nor has Ram&#237;rez offered evidence that the 2000 reorganization was a deviation from BIPI's policy &#8212; if BIPI had such a policy in the first place &#8212; of assigning less complex territories to newer PSRs. He has pointed out only that the newly created territories had more specialists than his, not that they were somehow more complex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Discriminatory comments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez asserts that D&#237;az, his supervisor at the time of his termination, Valeriano Garc&#237;a, the district manager who supervised Ram&#237;rez prior to D&#237;az, and Antonio Hern&#225;ndez, a district manager in Florida, made comments that reflect a discriminatory animus and therefore support a finding that BIPI's articulated reason for his termination was pretextual. The district court, quoting <i>Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2000), recognized that \"[d]iscriminatory comments may be probative of pretext if a plaintiff can `show that discriminatory comments were made by the key decisionmaker or those in a position to influence the decisionmaker.'\" The court concluded, however, that \"[g]iven Defendant's compelling stated reason for Plaintiff's termination, the[] stray remarks [cited by Ram&#237;rez] do not permit the inference that Defendant's real motivation for Plaintiff's discharge was age discrimination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez asserts that in considering the allegedly discriminatory comments, the district court failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to him, and instead \"weighted the evidence in favor of the appellee.\" We consider this argument with regard to each of the comments that Ram&#237;rez has identified as discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>\"Sacred cows\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on the deposition testimony of PSR Rafael Oliver, Ram&#237;rez asserts that during a private meeting on January 12, 2000, D&#237;az told Oliver and another PSR, Rommel Barnacet, \"that he (Mr. D&#237;az) had orders to `cut off' the heads of older sales representatives that Mr. D&#237;az, Mr. Rommel Barnacet, and Mr. Oliver called `the sacred cows,' but that they should keep this information secret.\" This description does not accurately reflect Oliver's testimony, which was that D&#237;az said that he had instructions to cut off the heads of some \"sacred cows,\" not of \"older sales representatives.\" It was Oliver who interpreted the comment as a reference to age.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Oliver also testified that he was considered a \"sacred cow\" because he was disabled, but that Barnacet, who was five years younger than Oliver, was not a sacred cow. Nevertheless, given the summary judgment posture of this case, we conclude that the district court erred in disregarding the \"sacred cows\" comment altogether. Oliver testified that he understood \"sacred cows\" as a reference to the oldest PSRs in terms of both seniority and age. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Ram&#237;rez, we think that a jury relying on Oliver's testimony could interpret D&#237;az's comment as a reference to age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, Ram&#237;rez also emphasizes the deposition testimony of Ruiz that during a meeting on February 28, 2000, D&#237;az stated that he had \"instructions from management that they had to `cut off the heads' of the oldest representatives.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> This testimony, like Oliver's testimony, is somewhat ambiguous. It appears that Ruiz described only the instruction to \"cut off the heads\" as a quote from D&#237;az. We cannot tell from the testimony whether D&#237;az referred specifically to \"the oldest representatives,\" or if D&#237;az made a different reference that Ruiz interpreted as a reference to age, as was the case with Oliver.

That with that salary they would pay two, or they would pay two and a half.\" Ram&#237;rez cites this statement as evidence that \"Mr. D&#237;az, Mr. Hern&#225;ndez, and Mr. Garc&#237;a preferred young sales representatives,\" and therefore that he was terminated because of his age. Even if this statement does reflect age bias (the inference most favorable to Ram&#237;rez), Ram&#237;rez has cited no evidence on appeal that either Hern&#225;ndez or Garc&#237;a &#8212; as opposed to D&#237;az, his direct supervisor &#8212; was involved in the decision to terminate him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> \"[S]tatements made either by nondecisionmakers[,] or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus.\" <i>Gonzalez v.

Moreover, as the district court also noted, \"[w]hile Mr. Oliver [also] claims that Mr. Hern&#225;ndez stated that `these people are in the twilight zone' after meetings with unnamed employees, notably, Mr. Oliver's quote makes no reference to age.\" To the contrary, Oliver interpreted the \"twilight zone\" comment as referring to people who did not meet their sales quotas. More importantly, as we have already noted, Ram&#237;rez cites no evidence on appeal to demonstrate that Hern&#225;ndez was involved in the decision to terminate him. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Disparate treatment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez asserts that he was subjected to adverse disparate treatment that revealed a discriminatory animus on the part of his superiors. The district court rejected this contention, concluding that it rested on \"unsupported allegations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Employee discipline</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez contends that BIPI has a disciplinary procedure requiring \"progressive discipline before termination or discharge\" and that the procedure was not followed in his case. He further asserts that other employees \"did not use the proper sampling and targeting procedures\" but that \"no one else was disciplined, much less discharged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that BIPI's employee manual sets forth a procedure to \"monitor consistent non-compliance\" with the rules established for ensuring sampling accountability. However, the manual also sets forth a series of \"unacceptable\" practices that \"will result in varying levels of disciplinary action up to and <i>including termination.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) One of the practices listed is \"any violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987,\" the ground that BIPI has cited for Ram&#237;rez's termination. Moreover, the manual also cautions that \"[t]ermination of employment can result ... in the event of any breach of discipline or job standards which is deemed serious enough.\" BIPI apparently concluded that Ram&#237;rez's perceived violations of the PDMA and company policies designed to comply with that Act were \"serious enough\" to result in termination, rather than a lesser sanction. It is not our role to second-guess the merits of that conclusion. <i>See Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 825 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits &#8212; or even the rationality &#8212; of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Ram&#237;rez asserts that other employees did not use proper sampling procedures but were not disciplined, he has not identified any employee who engaged in sampling violations akin to those for which he was terminated. The closest Ram&#237;rez comes is an allegation that Garc&#237;a, his former supervisor, \"gave orders to use un-approved and illegal materials.\" The documents to which Ram&#237;rez cites in support of this proposition are far from clear, however, and they do not indicate whether, if Garc&#237;a did violate company policy designed to comply with the PDMA, decisionmakers at BIPI were aware of the violation. Accordingly, we reject Ram&#237;rez's claim that his termination reflects disparate treatment based on his age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Salary</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez did not receive a merit-based salary increase for the year 2001, while all other PSRs did. In an email informing Ram&#237;rez of the salary decision, D&#237;az explained that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">merit increases are based on the sales and general performance of any given representative during a one year period. The guideline for the year 2000 was 4.0%. Unfortunately your extended leave of absence due to Short Term Disability did not allow a fair evaluation period to make the merit assessment for the year. Therefore the decision has been made to leave your year 2000 base pay unchanged at $63,500.00 for the year 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his motion opposing summary judgment, and again on appeal, Ram&#237;rez asserts the denial of a salary increase violated company policy. Contrary to Ram&#237;rez's representation, however, company policy does not establish that \"any employee on leave will receive a salary increase in proportion to the time worked.\" Rather, it provides that \"<i>[i]f approved,</i> a proratum will apply to all annual merit reviews when issued for less than a 12 month salary cycle\" and that \"[t]he amount of your merit increase, if any, is discretionary.\" (Emphasis added.) BIPI did not approve a merit-based increase for 2001 because it was unable to evaluate Ram&#237;rez's performance for 2000. Company policy therefore did not require an increase in proportion to the time worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez asserts that the denial of a salary increase reflects disparate treatment nonetheless because, unlike Ram&#237;rez, PSR Oliver received salary increases while on short-term disability. The only evidence that Ram&#237;rez cites for this proposition is his own \"unsworn statement under penalty of perjury.\" While the document that Ram&#237;rez cites is admissible for summary judgment purposes despite being unsworn, <i>see Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer &amp; Hertell v.

First, the statements of Ruiz and Oliver are inadmissible hearsay. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), 802. Second, even if the evidence were admissible, it still does not establish that Ram&#237;rez was subjected to adverse disparate treatment based on his age. As Ram&#237;rez's own statements indicate, Ruiz &#8212; who is eight years older than Ram&#237;rez &#8212; was not subjected to similar treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Falsity of stated reason</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez also alleges that BIPI falsified the physicians' statements or requested them only after it had made the decision to terminate him. He has provided no evidence, however, to substantiate those allegations, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (cautioning that \"[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> and the evidence that is in the record supports a finding that BIPI did not fabricate its articulated reason for terminating Ram&#237;rez's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter confirming Ram&#237;rez's termination, BIPI attributed its decision to Ram&#237;rez's \"violation of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Company policy as it relates to sample distribution and documentation.\" BIPI has produced the physicians' statements that led it to this conclusion, which it has articulated consistently throughout the course of this litigation. <i>See Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 47 (emphasizing that explanations by representatives of an employer for their decision to terminate the plaintiff \"are themselves consistent and not contradicted by either contemporaneous documents or statements made at termination, or statements made later\"). As the district court recognized, BIPI also proffered evidence of other \"perceived irregularities in Plaintiff's sales practice\" dating back several years, as well as evidence of its investigation into the irregularities. The record thus presents no basis for a finding that BIPI did not believe, in good faith, that it had a legitimate reason to terminate Ram&#237;rez. We recognize that \"the employer's good faith belief is not automatically conclusive\" on the issue of pretext. However, there is also no evidence in the record to support a jury finding that the articulated reason, though honestly held, \"constituted discrimination (e.g., stereotyping).\" <i>Id.</i> at 45-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a defendant is entitled to summary judgment on an ADEA claim, we must consider, <i>inter alia,</i> \"the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Reeves v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (2000). As we have discussed, Ram&#237;rez has offered virtually no proof that BIPI's explanation for his termination is false. He has not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the territory reorganization was motivated by a discriminatory animus or that he suffered adverse disparate treatment as a result of his age. Nor are the comments by Garc&#237;a and Hern&#225;ndez probative of discriminatory animus, without evidence that they were involved in the decision to terminate him. Moreover, there is no support in the record for Ram&#237;rez's claim that BIPI fabricated the physicians' statements or obtained them after it had decided to terminate him based on his age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the only evidence of a discriminatory motive that Ram&#237;rez has unearthed are two comments by D&#237;az in early 2000 that a jury could interpret to evince animus based on age. However, Ram&#237;rez was not terminated until more than eighteen months after D&#237;az made the comments at issue, and at the time of his termination, Ruiz, who is several years older than Ram&#237;rez, was still employed at the company. Against this background, we conclude that D&#237;az's comments, standing alone, are insufficient to support a finding that Ram&#237;rez was terminated because of his age. The district court was correct to grant summary judgment to BIPI on the ADEA discrimination claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez challenges the court's grant of summary judgment on his claim that he was terminated in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor (ADU). We review the court's summary judgment ruling <i>de novo. Gonzalez-Pina,</i> 407 F.3d at 431.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to prohibiting age discrimination, the ADEA also protects individuals who invoke the statute's protections. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 623(d) (\"It shall be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees... because such individual ... has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or ... made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under this chapter.\"). Where there is no direct evidence of retaliation, our analysis of a claim under &#167; 623(d) closely tracks the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework. First, \"the plaintiff must make a <i>prima facie</i> showing that (i) he engaged in ADEA-protected conduct, (ii) he was thereafter subjected to an adverse employment action, and (iii) a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.\" <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 827.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of retaliation, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, if the defendant presents such a reason, \"the ultimate burden falls on the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reason is a pretext masking retaliation for the employee's opposition to a practice cast into doubt by the ADEA.\" <i>Id.</i> As we emphasized in <i>Mesnick,</i> the \"critical inquiry [is] whether the aggregate evidence of pretext and retaliatory animus suffices to make out a jury question.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ram&#237;rez filed a complaint with the ADU on June 13, 2001, asserting that he had been subjected to \"a series of harassing acts... due to [his] age.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> He was terminated approximately two months later, on August 15, 2001. Accordingly, the district court found, and BIPI has conceded, that Ram&#237;rez established the first two elements of the <i>prima facie</i> showing described in <i>Mesnick,</i> namely that he engaged in ADEA-protected conduct (<i>i.e.,</i> filing a complaint of age discrimination) and that he subsequently suffered an adverse employment action (<i>i.e.,</i> termination). The district court concluded, however, that Ram&#237;rez's <i>prima facie</i> case faltered on the third element, namely the existence of a causal connection between the filing of the ADU claim and the subsequent termination. The court found that the temporal proximity between the two events &#8212; two months &#8212; was \"insufficient, standing alone, to establish a causal connection.\" The court further held that even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Ram&#237;rez established a <i>prima facie</i> case, BIPI would still be entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation claim because it \"offered enough evidence to suggest that its decision to fire Plaintiff was based on Plaintiff's alleged malfeasance ... [and] Plaintiff has not offered any evidence to suggest that Defendant's actions were pretextual.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ram&#237;rez emphasizes that although his superiors had concerns about his conduct by January 2000, they \"waited until August 2001 to discharge him, two months after he filed a charge of discrimination before the [ADU].\" While Ram&#237;rez's superiors speculated that he was engaging in improper \"oversampling\" as early as January 2000, however, the physician statements that BIPI cites as the basis for Ram&#237;rez's termination were not documented until May 10, 2001. Ram&#237;rez filed his complaint with the ADU one month later. He therefore was terminated three months after Wood received the physician complaints and two months after engaging in ADEA-protected activity. The fact that Wood terminated Ram&#237;rez after he filed his ADU claim rather than before does not, standing alone, establish a causal connection between the ADU complaint and the termination. \"[C]hronological proximity does not by itself establish causality, particularly if `[t]he larger picture undercuts any claim of causation.'\" <i>Wright v.

As we have already discussed, however, Ram&#237;rez's termination was not inconsistent with company policy, nor has he provided evidence that other employees were subjected to less severe discipline (or no discipline at all) based on similar conduct. The fact that he was terminated, rather than merely reprimanded, two months after filing an ADU complaint does not establish that the termination was causally linked to the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Ram&#237;rez offered evidence to support a finding that BIPI's articulated reason for the termination &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> violations of company sampling policy and the PDMA &#8212; was a pretext for retaliation. He has not, for example, pointed to any \"comments by the employer which intimate a retaliatory mindset\" or demonstrated that he was subjected to differential treatment after filing the ADU complaint. <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 828.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> Ram&#237;rez does attempt to demonstrate pretext by arguing that the physicians' statements were inadmissible hearsay and thus BIPI has not advanced a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his termination.

We need not reach this claim. There is no indication in the record that the court denied the motion to exclude the statement regarding Corretjer's termination. To the contrary, given that the district court did not refer to Corretjer's termination in its order granting summary judgment, it appears that the court<i>granted</i> that aspect of Ram&#237;rez's motion in limine.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Ram&#237;rez also sought to exclude the cover memo that Riberio sent to Garc&#237;a with the report. The memo merely states that her results were attached and that Garc&#237;a was free to \"share this information with [his colleagues] if you think they could use it.\" For ease of reference, we use the term \"report\" as a short hand for both the report and the cover memo</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We note that not all of the proposed statements of uncontested facts identified by Ram&#237;rez actually rely on the statements by unidentified physicians.

The email, which was appended to BIPI's proposed statement of uncontested facts as Exhibit 10, identified the physicians by name and provided their addresses and phone numbers.
