Klumper, Assistant United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         October 28, 2003\n\f            SELYA,      Circuit    Judge.      In   this   sentencing     appeal,\n\ndefendant-appellant Guillermo Mansur-Ramos labors to persuade us\n\nthat the district court erred in imposing too long a term of\n\nimmurement and, to make matters worse, attaching an impermissible\n\ncondition of supervised release to his sentence.                      Finding his\n\narguments unconvincing, we affirm the sentence.\n\n            The facts are sordid, but straightforward.                  We derive\n\nthem     from     the    change-of-plea        colloquy,        the   presentence\n\ninvestigation      report,   and    the     transcript     of   the   disposition\n\nhearing.    See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n            At all times relevant hereto, the appellant worked as a\n\npolice officer assigned to the tactical operations division in\n\nPonce, Puerto Rico.          He exploited his position to enter into\n\nillegal arms trafficking.          When he attempted to sell weapons to a\n\npotential customer who was in fact a government informant, federal\n\nagents surveilled and videotaped several ensuing meetings.\n\n            On February 21, 2001, the appellant sold the informant a\n\n.22 caliber long rifle for $500.             He bragged that he obtained the\n\nweapon through a seizure made under the guise of official police\n\nbusiness.       During this recorded meeting the informant emphasized,\n\nand the appellant clearly understood, that drug kingpins with whom\n\nhe was in contact wanted \"larger\" weapons. Speaking to this point,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fthe appellant described his continuing efforts to locate high-\n\npowered firearms, particularly AK47s and AR15s.\n\n          At   a   follow-up   meeting    held   on   March   5,   2001,   the\n\nappellant sold the informant a .38 caliber revolver for $260.              The\n\nappellant boasted that he had procured the gun by assaulting a man\n\non the street, striking him over the head with the barrel of his\n\npistol and robbing him.    The appellant again assured the informant\n\nthat his search for deadlier weapons continued.\n\n          The third meeting with which we are concerned took place\n\non March 26, 2001.    At that time, the appellant sold the informant\n\na .38 caliber revolver for $500.         The appellant had acquired this\n\nfirearm by means of another illegal seizure.\n\n          In due season, a federal grand jury returned a twelve\n\ncount indictment against the appellant.           After some preliminary\n\nskirmishing (not relevant here), the appellant pled guilty to five\n\ncounts of the indictment, namely, (i) interfering with commerce by\n\nrobbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951, (ii) possessing a firearm\n\nwith an obliterated serial number in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(k), and (iii) three counts of selling stolen firearms in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(j), 924(a)(2).           As part of the plea\n\nagreement, both sides agreed to recommend a guideline sentencing\n\nrange (GSR) of 70-87 months (offense level 27/criminal history\n\ncategory I).   The government reserved the right to argue for the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fhigh end of the range and the appellant reserved the right to argue\n\nfor the low end.\n\n            At the disposition hearing, the district court sentenced\n\nthe appellant to an 80-month incarcerative term, to be followed by\n\nthree years of supervised release.         In addition to the standard\n\nconditions of supervised release, the court attached a special\n\ncondition    requiring   the   appellant   to   provide   the   probation\n\ndepartment with evidence demonstrating that he was filing income\n\ntax returns with the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury as required\n\nby law.\n\n            This timely appeal followed.         In it, the appellant\n\nasseverates that the sentencing court erred (i) in choosing a\n\nsentence above the low end of the GSR, and (ii) in imposing an\n\nimpertinent condition of supervised release.\n\n            We turn first to the district court's choice of an 80-\n\nmonth term of immurement.       In selecting that figure, the court\n\nenumerated five considerations.         First, the appellant's actions\n\nwere antithetical to his role as a police officer (a person sworn\n\nto guard against the commission of crime).        Second, unauthorized\n\narms trafficking is per se illegal.        Third, the appellant engaged\n\nin the sale of weapons knowing that they were intended for use by\n\ndrug kingpins.     Fourth, one gun sold by the appellant had an\n\nobliterated serial number.      Fifth, the appellant had displayed a\n\npropensity for violent behavior.        Despite his failure to object\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fbelow, the appellant now terms unfounded the district court's\n\ninference that the weapons in question were intended for use by\n\ndrug kingpins and contends that the court violated his right to due\n\nprocess by basing its sentencing determination on that material\n\nmisstatement of fact.    This contention lacks force.\n\n            A district court is not required to cite any reason for\n\nsentencing a defendant within a properly-constructed GSR that spans\n\nno more than 24 months.      See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c).    Here, the\n\nparties concur both that the GSR itself was properly calculated and\n\nthat it spanned a period of only 17 months.   Because Congress does\n\nnot require sentencing courts to offer any reason for within-the-\n\nrange choices in such cases, it would seem odd to say that Congress\n\nwants appellate courts to review the sufficiency of each and every\n\nreason cited by a district court in support of a within-the-range\n\nsentence.   Consistent with the statutory structure, we have held,\n\nwith a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that when a district\n\ncourt imposes a sentence within the guideline range, the court of\n\nappeals ordinarily lacks authority to scrutinize the rationale for\n\nthat sentence.   See United States v. O'Connell, 252 F.3d 524, 529-\n\n30 (1st Cir. 2001) (collecting cases).    Our sister circuits have\n\nuniformly adopted the same position.   See, e.g., United States v.\n\nOwens, 308 F.3d 791, 795 (7th Cir. 2001); United States v. Woodrum,\n\n959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Garcia, 919\n\nF.2d 1478, 1479 (10th Cir. 1990).\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f            Despite this general rule, we have left open the question\n\nof whether appellate jurisdiction exists to review a sentence that\n\nis within the applicable GSR but allegedly violative of due process\n\nbecause it is premised upon a material misstatement of fact.                  See\n\nO'Connell, 252 F.3d at 530 n.2.               We can envision situations in\n\nwhich a sentencing court's misapprehension of a material fact might\n\nimplicate due process concerns and thus require vacation of such a\n\nsentence.     See, e.g., United States v. DeWire, 271 F.3d 333, 340\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 2001) (suggesting that such a need might arise if\n\ntrial court had mistaken the defendant for someone else); United\n\nStates v. McDavid, 41 F.3d 841, 844 (2d Cir. 1995) (vacating\n\nsentence because trial court mistakenly believed defendant was on\n\nprobation at the time he committed the offense of conviction);\n\nUnited States v. Nichols, 979 F.2d 402, 409 (6th Cir. 1993)\n\n(suggesting    that    appellate      jurisdiction     would   exist   where    a\n\ndefendant   raised     a    colorable   constitutional     challenge    to    the\n\nsentence); cf. United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 24 n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (noting that even standardless prosecutorial discretion\n\ncannot be exercised so as to contravene constitutionally protected\n\nrights, such as race or religion).\n\n            Although       this   question    is   interesting,   we   need   not\n\ndefinitively answer it here.         Not every bevue sinks to the level of\n\na due process violation, see, e.g., United States v. Pighetti, 898\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fF.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 1990), and this case fails to present even a\n\ncolorable claim of constitutional error.\n\n              In the first place, we doubt that any error occurred.\n\nAfter all, a sentencing court is not restricted to direct evidence,\n\nbut may base its findings on reasonable inferences from the record\n\nas a whole.     See United States v. Cunningham, 201 F.3d 20, 26 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); United States v. Jones, 997 F.2d 967, 970 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).     This principle is apposite here.              Although the record\n\nreflects no direct statement by the appellant indicating his\n\nknowledge that the weapons he was peddling would wind up in the\n\nhands    of   drug   kingpins,   the   record    makes    manifest     that   the\n\ninformant wanted arms for drug lords — and the appellant knew as\n\nmuch.    And, moreover, there were numerous other allusions to \"drug\n\nkingpins\" or the equivalent during the conversations between the\n\ntwo men. Taken in context, these references adequately support the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the end users of the firearms were\n\nlikely to be persons engaged in large-scale drug trafficking.\n\n              In the second place, we doubt the materiality of the\n\nfinding.      Fairly read, the record belies the appellant's assertion\n\nthat the      district   court   relied      solely on   the   \"drug   kingpin\"\n\ninference.      To the contrary, the court cited no fewer than four\n\nother facts that influenced its sentencing determination — and the\n\nappellant does not challenge the provenance of any of those facts.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we are at a loss to see how the\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fappellant's due process rights were transgressed by a sentencing\n\njudge who plainly believed that the appellant's overall conduct,\n\nwhether or not described with laser-like precision, merited a\n\nsentence somewhat above the low end of, but nonetheless within, the\n\nGSR.\n\n            We move now to the appellant's claim that the lower court\n\nerred in requiring him, during the period of supervised release, to\n\nproduce    evidence     that   he   was   filing    income    tax   returns    in\n\ncompliance with law. Typically, we review challenges to conditions\n\nof supervised release for abuse of discretion.                United States v.\n\nBrown, 235 F.3d 2, 3 (1st Cir. 2000).         Here, however, the appellant\n\nfailed to object to the imposition of the special condition in the\n\ndistrict court.    Consequently, our review is for plain error.               See\n\nUnited States v. Allen, 312 F.3d 512, 514 (1st Cir. 2002); Brown,\n\n235 F.3d at 3.\n\n            In order to surmount the high hurdle posed by plain error\n\nreview, the appellant must show, at a bare minimum, \"an obvious and\n\nclear   error   under    current    law   that     affected   his   substantial\n\nrights.\"     Brown, 235 F.3d at 4.           Even if close perscrutation\n\nreveals such an error, the reviewing court may disregard it if the\n\nerror does not \"seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"             United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 736 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           The appellant asserts that the challenged condition is\n\nnot reasonably     related       to   the    offenses    of   conviction.       This\n\nassertion overlooks the breadth of a sentencing court's discretion\n\nto custom-tailor conditions of supervised release that reasonably\n\nrespond to a wide variety of considerations.                  These include \"(1)\n\nthe defendant's offense, history and characteristics; (2) the need\n\nfor adequate deterrence; and (3) the need to protect the public\n\nfrom further crimes of the defendant.\"                 United States v. Phaneuf,\n\n91 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing USSG §5D1.3(b)).\n\n           Here, the principal offense conduct — trafficking in\n\nillegal weapons — was commercial in nature and, for aught that\n\nappears, motivated primarily by greed.                 Given this circumstance,\n\nthe district court had a valid interest in ensuring that the\n\nappellant complied with income-reporting requirements after his\n\nrelease from custody.         The special condition allows the court,\n\nthrough   the   probation     department,         to   monitor   the   appellant's\n\nearnings and identify any potential disparity between his income\n\nand his lifestyle.         Relatedly, it serves to deter the appellant\n\nfrom engaging in schemes similar to the crimes of conviction once\n\nhe is released from prison by forcing him to account for his\n\nincome.\n\n           We need go no further.            The most that can be said for the\n\nappellant's     position    is    that      the   relatedness    of    the   special\n\ncondition of supervised release is somewhat attenuated.                      But the\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fcondition is, at the very least, arguably reasonable.   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Behler, 187 F.3d 772, 780 (8th Cir. 1999) (holding\n\nthat access to financial information was reasonably related to a\n\ndefendant's narcotics convictions because financial gain motivated\n\nthe underlying crimes).   Because the error — if there is one — is\n\nneither clear nor obvious, the applicable standard of review\n\ndefenestrates the appellant's claim.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

We can envision situations in which a sentencing court's misapprehension of a material fact might implicate due process concerns and thus require vacation of such a sentence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Dewire,</i> 271 F.3d 333, 340 n. 8 (1st Cir.2001) (suggesting that such a need might arise if trial court had mistaken the defendant for someone else); <i>United States v.

Although the record reflects no direct statement by the appellant indicating his knowledge that the weapons he was peddling would wind up in the hands of drug kingpins, the record makes manifest that the informant wanted arms for drug lords &#8212; and the appellant knew as much. And, moreover, there were numerous other allusions to \"drug kingpins\" or the equivalent during the conversations between the two men.

To the contrary, the court cited no fewer than four other facts that influenced its sentencing determination &#8212; and the appellant does not challenge the provenance of any of those facts. Under these circumstances, we are at a loss to see how the appellant's due process rights were transgressed by a sentencing judge who plainly believed that the appellant's overall conduct, whether or not described with laser-like precision, merited a sentence somewhat above the low end of, but nonetheless within, the GSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move now to the appellant's claim that the lower court erred in requiring him, during the period of supervised release, to produce evidence that he was filing income tax returns in compliance with law. Typically, we review challenges to conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 235 F.3d 2, 3 (1st Cir.2000). Here, however, the appellant failed to object to the imposition of the special condition in the district court. Consequently, our review is for plain error. <i>See United States</i> <i>v.

The special condition allows the court, through the probation department, to monitor the appellant's earnings and identify any potential disparity between his income and his lifestyle.

Finding his arguments unconvincing, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are sordid, but straightforward. We derive them from the change-of-plea colloquy, the presentence investigation report, and the transcript of the disposition hearing. <i>See United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At all times relevant hereto, the appellant worked as a police officer assigned to the tactical operations division in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He exploited his position to enter into illegal arms trafficking. When he attempted to sell weapons to a potential customer who was in fact a government informant, federal agents surveilled and videotaped several ensuing meetings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 21, 2001, the appellant sold the informant a .22 caliber long rifle for $500. He bragged that he obtained the weapon through a seizure made under the guise of official police business. During this recorded meeting the informant emphasized, and the appellant clearly understood, that drug kingpins with whom he was in contact wanted \"larger\" weapons. Speaking to this point, the appellant described his continuing efforts to locate high-powered firearms, particularly AK47s and AR15s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a follow-up meeting held on March 5, 2001, the appellant sold the informant a .38 caliber revolver for $260. The appellant boasted that he had procured the gun by assaulting a man on the street, striking him over the head with the barrel of his pistol and robbing him. The appellant again assured the informant that his search for deadlier weapons continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third meeting with which we are concerned took place on March 26, 2001. At that time, the appellant sold the informant a .38 caliber revolver for $500. The appellant had acquired this firearm by means of another illegal seizure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a federal grand jury returned a twelve count indictment against the appellant. After some preliminary skirmishing (not relevant here), the appellant pled guilty to five counts of the indictment, namely, (i) interfering with commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951, (ii) possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k), and (iii) three counts of selling stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(j), 924(a)(2). As part of the plea agreement, both sides agreed to recommend a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 70-87 months (offense level 27/criminal history category I). The government reserved the right to argue for the high end of the range and the appellant reserved the right to argue for the low end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court sentenced the appellant to an 80-month incarcerative term, to be followed by three years of supervised release. In addition to the standard conditions of supervised release, the court attached a special condition requiring the appellant to provide the probation department with evidence demonstrating that he was filing income tax returns with the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury as required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This timely appeal followed. In it, the appellant asseverates that the sentencing court erred (i) in choosing a sentence above the low end of the GSR, and (ii) in imposing an impertinent condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the district court's choice of an 80-month term of immurement. In selecting that figure, the court enumerated five considerations. First, the appellant's actions were antithetical to his role as a police officer (a person sworn to guard against the commission of crime). Second, unauthorized arms trafficking is per se illegal. Third, the appellant engaged in the sale of weapons knowing that they were intended for use by drug kingpins. Fourth, one gun sold by the appellant had an obliterated serial number. Fifth, the appellant had displayed a propensity for violent behavior. Despite his failure to object below, the appellant now terms unfounded the district court's inference that the weapons in question were intended for use by drug kingpins and contends that the court violated his right to due process by basing its sentencing determination on that material misstatement of fact. This contention lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court is not required to cite <i>any</i> reason for sentencing a defendant within a properly-constructed GSR that spans no more than 24 months. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). Here, the parties concur both that the GSR itself was properly calculated and that it spanned a period of only 17 months. Because Congress does not require sentencing courts to offer any reason for within-the-range choices in such cases, it would seem odd to say that Congress wants appellate courts to review the sufficiency of each and every reason cited by a district court in support of a within-the-range sentence. Consistent with the statutory structure, we have held, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that when a district court imposes a sentence within the guideline range, the court of appeals ordinarily lacks authority to scrutinize the rationale for that sentence. <i>See United States v.
