William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                         Torruella and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Ese A.

Pro se plaintiff-appellant Ese Aror O'Diah\n\n(\"Ese\") and also purportedly his father Aror Ark O'Diah (\"Aror\")\n\nappeal from the district court's dismissal of Ese's complaint on\n\nstatute of limitations grounds.1            We review the dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint de novo, treating all well-pleaded factual allegations as\n\ntrue and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's\n\nfavor.   Soto-Negron v. Taber Partners I, 339 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). Where, as here, the dismissal is predicated on a statute of\n\nlimitations, we will affirm only if \"the pleader's allegations\n\nleave no doubt that an asserted claim is time-barred.\"              LaChapelle\n\nv. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the parties' briefs and the record, we\n\naffirm the dismissal of the present complaint.             We briefly address\n\nEse's arguments.\n\n             Ese contends that the district court clerk failed to mail\n\na copy of the court's November 21, 2002 ruling to him.             Because Ese\n\ndid not make this complaint below, it is waived.             United States v.\n\nBongiorno,    106   F.3d   1027,   1034    (1st    Cir.   1997)   (noting   that\n\narguments not raised in lower court cannot be advanced on appeal).\n\nThis claim has no merit in any event.             Ese did receive notice of\n\nthe court's November 21, 2002 ruling.             Moreover, the record makes\n\nclear that Ese received the notice in a timely fashion.\n\n\n     1\n       Aror was not a party below. Accordingly, to the extent Aror\nis attempting to assert claims on his own behalf, those claims are\nnot properly before us.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f           Ese next argues that the district court should have\n\nallowed his father Aror to represent him in this case.          This claim\n\nalso has no merit.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1654 (providing, in pertinent\n\npart, that \"[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may\n\nplead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel\")\n\n(emphasis added).    We have interpreted this statute as barring a\n\nnon-lawyer from representing anyone but himself.         Herrera-Venegas\n\nv. Sanchez-Rivera, 681 F.2d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 1982).           Ese's father\n\nconceded at the hearing below that he is not an attorney.         Although\n\nEse asserts that he is incompetent, and, therefore, needs his\n\nfather's   representation,   Ese   has   not    established   that   he    is\n\nincapacitated in any way.    In addition, even assuming that Ese is\n\nincompetent and needed a representative, such as his father, to sue\n\non his behalf, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c), his father would still\n\nneed to be represented by an attorney.         See, e.g., Cheung v. Youth\n\nOrchestra Found. of Buffalo, Inc., 906 F.2d 59, 61-62 (2d Cir.\n\n1990) (holding that non-attorney parent must be represented by\n\ncounsel when bringing an action on behalf of his child).\n\n           Ese also argues that the district court should have\n\napplied New York law, rather than Massachusetts law, with respect\n\nto the statute of limitations governing some of his claims.               Ese\n\ndid not present this choice-of-law issue to the district court.\n\nAccordingly, it is waived.   Arrieta-Gimenez v. Arrieta-Negron, 859\n\nF.2d 1033, 1037 (1st Cir. 1988).     Ese's claim has no merit in any\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fevent. First, as Ese acknowledges, both Massachusetts and New York\n\nprovide for a three-year limitations period.                See Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 260, § 2A; N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214(5).                Therefore, there is no\n\nconflict of law that would have necessitated choosing between the\n\ntwo.     Lambert v. Kysar, 983 F.2d 1110, 1114 (1st Cir. 1993).              In\n\naddition, the district court properly applied Massachusetts law.\n\nSee Cosme v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., 417 Mass. 643, 645, 632\n\nN.E.2d    832,    834   (1994)   (noting    that   Massachusetts      considers\n\nstatutes of limitations as procedural, and, as the forum state,\n\napplies its own law).\n\n            Ese   further    argues    that,   even    if    Massachusetts   law\n\napplies, the district court erred in dismissing his claims as time-\n\nbarred.    This claim also has no merit.           As noted above, Ese does\n\nnot dispute that the applicable limitations period is three years.\n\nHis complaint was filed more than three years after his cause of\n\naction accrued.         The district court properly rejected Ese's two\n\nattempts to render his claims timely.          First, this lawsuit did not\n\n\"relate back\" to a series of lawsuits filed by Ese's father in New\n\nYork federal district court.          Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c), which allows\n\nan amendment of a pleading to relate back to the date of the\n\noriginal pleading under certain circumstances, does not apply to a\n\ncase filed in a different jurisdiction by a different plaintiff.\n\nSecond, Ese has not shown that he is incompetent and was unable to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fbring his claims in a timely fashion.   Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt properly dismissed his claims as time-barred.\n\n          Ese's assertions that the district court judge was biased\n\nare unsubstantiated and do not merit further discussion.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.   See 1st\n\nCir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
