Formica on brief for petitioner.\n     Michael Sady, Assistant United States Attorney and Michael\nJ. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                             August 24, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam.    The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed\n\nthe   denial   of   Robert   Plaka's    applications   for   asylum    and\n\nwithholding of removal and ordered Plaka removed from the United\n\nStates to Albania.     Plaka petitions for review, arguing that the\n\nBoard's order is not supported by substantial evidence.\n\n           Plaka is an Albanian national.      He was a member of the\n\nNational Front Party, which supported the democratic movement in\n\nAlbania against the Communist Party.      In 1991, Plaka helped topple\n\na statue of Albania's communist dictator, Enver Hoxha.           Shortly\n\nafter the incident, Plaka was arrested and detained for three\n\nhours.   During this detention he was hit with a rubber stick.         Upon\n\nrelease, the police instructed Plaka to \"stop breaking the law,\"\n\nand two weeks later Plaka received a letter from two unknown\n\nindividuals urging him to leave his hometown.\n\n           In 1994, the Democratic Party (which was in power at the\n\ntime) organized a rally supporting a proposed constitution.           Plaka\n\nspoke at the rally, and three police officers who were present\n\ncalled Plaka \"the enemy.\" The officers were ejected from the rally\n\nand did not harm Plaka.      Later that day, three unknown civilians\n\nconfronted Plaka about his speech.\n\n           The next incident occurred in 1997.         Plaka testified\n\nthat, while serving as an election observer, he confronted a member\n\nof the Socialist Party who was committing vote fraud. Plaka claims\n\nthat he subsequently was arrested by three masked police officers,\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fheld for three days, and beaten with a rubber stick.                       The final\n\nincidents    took    place   in       2002:   after     Plaka   gave   a   television\n\ninterview accusing the Socialist Party of corruption, several\n\nunidentified individuals robbed Plaka's store, and a Socialist\n\nParty member beat him up.\n\n            After these incidents, Plaka left Albania for Italy.                   In\n\nNovember 2002, he traveled to the United States and tried to enter\n\nthe   country       using    a    false       Italian     passport.        Conceding\n\nremovability, Plaka applied for asylum and withholding of removal\n\non the basis of political persecution.                   At the conclusion of an\n\nevidentiary     hearing,         an    immigration        judge   denied     Plaka's\n\napplications for relief.\n\n            Plaka appealed to the Board, which affirmed the judge's\n\nruling.     The Board found that neither the \"sporadic incidents of\n\nmistreatment that [Plaka] suffered at the hands of Socialist Party\n\nsupporters over a period of several years,\" nor \"the degree of harm\n\nhe experienced while in police custody\" rose to the level of\n\npersecution.    In addition, the Board discounted Plaka's testimony\n\nconcerning the robbing of his store because he failed to establish\n\nthat the incident was politically motivated.                       The Board also\n\nconcluded that Plaka failed to provide objective evidence that he\n\nhad a well-founded fear of future persecution if he were to return\n\nto Albania.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fFinally, the Board rejected Plaka's withholding of removal claim\n\nbecause he had not established that it was more likely than not\n\nthat he would be persecuted if returned to his home country.        Plaka\n\ntimely petitioned this court for review of the Board's decision.\n\n            We focus on Plaka's asylum claim because the standard for\n\nasylum claims is lower than the standard for withholding of removal\n\nclaims.    See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    Thus, if Plaka's asylum claim fails on the merits, so\n\ndoes his claim for withholding of removal.          See id.\n\n            We review the Board's decision to determine if it is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.        See DaSilva v. Ashcroft, 394\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).       In so doing, we accept the Board's\n\nfactual findings and credibility determinations so long as they are\n\nsupported by \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992).    For the Board's fact-based determination that an\n\nasylum applicant does not qualify for relief to be vacated, the\n\nevidence    must   \"point   unerringly   in   the   opposite   direction.\"\n\nLaurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            An asylum applicant must establish that he has suffered\n\npast persecution on one of several protected grounds (including\n\npolitical opinion) or has a well-founded fear of such persecution\n\non account of one of these grounds.       See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387\n\nF.2d 75, 79 (1st Cir. 2004).        To prove a well-founded fear of\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffuture    persecution,    the    applicant's   subjective   fear   must   be\n\nobjectively reasonable.         See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565,\n\n572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Plaka's     argument    concerning     past   persecution     is\n\ncontrolled by Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThere, the Board ruled that an Albanian national had not been\n\npersecuted where he established that, because of his support for\n\nthe Democratic Party, he had been twice arrested and once beaten by\n\nthe police with a chain to the point of unconsciousness over an\n\neight-year period.       We affirmed the Board's ruling.           While we\n\nneither condoned nor minimized the petitioner's treatment, we\n\nconcluded that the infrequency of the events supported the Board's\n\nview that the petitioner had proven only \"a series of isolated\n\nevents\" rather than the \"systematic mistreatment\" that is necessary\n\nto demonstrate past persecution.           Id. at 263; see also Nelson v.\n\nINS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000) (evidence of persecution\n\n\"must    rise   above   unpleasantness,     harassment,   and   even   basic\n\nsuffering\").\n\n            So too here.        Over an eleven-year period, Plaka was\n\narrested twice, hit with a rubber stick twice, beaten once, and\n\nthreatened at infrequent intervals.1         But there were large spans of\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Board was reasonable in not counting the robbing of\nPlaka's store in its calculus. Plaka admitted that he did not know\nwho robbed the store, and there was evidence that economic crime\nwas rampant in Albania.\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftime     during     which    Plaka     was     not   subject    to     harassment.\n\nAccordingly, Plaka's testimony could reasonably be characterized as\n\nrecounting        isolated    events     of     harassment,     not     systematic\n\nmistreatment.       While a reasonable fact finder perhaps could have\n\nfound differently, that is not the standard we apply. The evidence\n\nis not so one-sided that a reasonable factfinder would have to\n\nconclude that Plaka was persecuted on account of his political\n\nopinion, and therefore the Board's ruling must stand.                  See Bocova,\n\n412 F.3d at 264.\n\n            We reach a similar conclusion concerning Plaka's fear of\n\nfuture    persecution       claim.     Plaka    relied   on    the   incidents   of\n\nharassment recounted above to claim a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.        Evidence that is insufficient to constitute past\n\npersecution is, by itself, also insufficient to compel a finding of\n\na well-founded fear of future persecution.                Id.    There was also\n\nevidence before the Board, in the form of a State Department\n\nCountry Report, that there is no ongoing pattern of systematic\n\nmistreatment of Albanian citizens on account of their political\n\nopinion, and Plaka did not dispute this evidence.                    See Waweru v.\n\nGonzales, 437 F.3d 199, 202 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals is entitled to rely on the State Department's\n\ncountry report as proof of country conditions described therein,\n\nalthough it must consider evidence in the record that contradicts\n\nthe    State       Department's        descriptions      and     conclusions.\").\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fAccordingly, the Board was reasonable in concluding that there was\n\ninadequate objective support for Plaka's claim that he feared\n\npersecution if he returned to Albania.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Evidence that is insufficient to constitute past\n\npersecution is, by itself, also insufficient to compel a finding of\n\na well-founded fear of future persecution.                Id.    There was also\n\nevidence before the Board, in the form of a State Department\n\nCountry Report, that there is no ongoing pattern of systematic\n\nmistreatment of Albanian citizens on account of their political\n\nopinion, and Plaka did not dispute this evidence.
