The case underlying this appeal arose in the\n\nwake       of    the    failed     prosecution        of    Nicolás    Nogueras-Cartagena\n\n(Nogueras), a prominent politician who had been indicted on charges\n\nrelating to tax fraud and violations of the Ethics in Government\n\nAct. Following the dismissal of the criminal case, Nogueras sought\n\nto recover money damages against the federal government, the\n\nprosecutors, and the two federal agents who had spearheaded the\n\ninvestigation.               On     January       4,       2000,     Nogueras      filed     an\n\nadministrative claim with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).                                On\n\nJune 21, 2000, he moved forward on that claim, suing the United\n\nStates          and    alleging,    inter      alia,       false   arrest    and   malicious\n\nprosecution under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1346(b),         2671-2680.         In   the    same       action,    he    also   sued    four\n\nindividual federal officers (two prosecutors, an FBI agent, and an\n\nIRS agent),1 alleging constitutional violations under the doctrine\n\nof Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,\n\n403 U.S. 388 (1971).\n\n                  The United States moved for dismissal of all claims\n\nagainst it.            See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6).                  A magistrate\n\njudge recommended the dismissal of most of the claims, Nogueras v.\n\nUnited States, Civ. No. 00-1778 (D.P.R. Sept. 10, 2001), and the\n\n\n\n       1\n      The prosecutors (Guillermo Gil-Bonar and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco) and the FBI agent (John D. Johnson) are parties to this\nappeal. Nogueras has, however, abandoned his claims against the\nIRS agent (José E. González).\n\n                                                -2-\n\fdistrict court adopted that recommendation, Nogueras v. United\n\nStates, 172 F. Supp. 2d 296 (D.P.R. 2001). Nogueras then submitted\n\na further amended complaint.           In due course, a second magistrate\n\njudge, responding to a new round of motions, recommended dismissal\n\nboth of the remaining claims against the government and of the\n\nclaims asserted against the individual defendants.                  Nogueras v.\n\nUnited States, Civ. No. 00-1778 (D.P.R. Sept. 18, 2002).                     The\n\ndistrict      court    adopted   the    magistrate        judge's   report   and\n\nrecommendation and dismissed the action.                   Nogueras v. United\n\nStates, Civ. No. 00-1778 (D.P.R. Nov. 27, 2002).                    This appeal\n\nensued.\n\n              We need not tarry.      We have carefully perused the record\n\nand find no reason to disturb the district court's rulings.                  And\n\nbecause this is a situation in which three judicial officers (two\n\nmagistrate judges and a district judge) have analyzed Nogueras's\n\narguments and written comprehensive, well-reasoned decisions, we\n\nare hesitant to wax longiloquent simply to hear our own words\n\nresonate.      See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989\n\nF.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993) (taking a similar view). Consequently,\n\nwe   affirm    substantially     on    the   basis   of    the   lower   courts'\n\nrescripts, adding only a few brief comments.\n\n              First:   The FTCA claims are completely barred because\n\nNogueras failed to comply with the statutory requirements for\n\nadministrative exhaustion.         An action brought under the FTCA must\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fbe presented to the appropriate federal agency (here, the IRS) in\n\nthe first instance.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a).      The claimant then\n\nmust await a final disposition from that agency (or, in lieu\n\nthereof, the passage of six months without final agency action).\n\nId.   Only then may the claimant sue in federal court.            Id.\n\n           Nogueras did not abide by this timetable, but, rather,\n\nsued in the absence of final agency action and in less than six\n\nmonths after he had filed his administrative claim with the IRS.\n\nThat failure creates an incurable jurisdictional defect.                 See\n\nMcNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993); Gonzalez v.\n\nUnited States, 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002); Attallah v.\n\nUnited States, 955 F.2d 776, 779 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n           Second:      The    Bivens   claims   against    the   individual\n\ndefendants   are     forfeit   because,   despite   clear    and    repeated\n\ndirection from the district court, Nogueras failed to make focused,\n\ntargeted objections to the second magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation. Failure to identify the particular portions of the\n\nreport and recommendation to which objection is being made and to\n\nspecify the basis for each such objection precludes appellate\n\nreview.   See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155 (1985); Henley\n\nDrilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150 (1st Cir. 1994); United\n\nStates v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986); see also\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            Third:        Even had the claims against the individual\n\ndefendants not been forfeited, we would uphold the district court's\n\ndismissal of those claims on the merits.                     As to the prosecutors,\n\nthe record reflects that the actions of which Nogueras complains\n\nwere,    without    exception,       done    in   the       officials'    capacity     as\n\nprosecutors.        Consequently, those actions are shielded by the\n\nabsolute immunity that attaches to exercises of prosecutorial\n\ndiscretion.      Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430 (1976); Reid v.\n\nState of N.H., 56 F.3d 332, 337 (1st Cir. 1995).                        The subjective\n\nintent of the prosecutors is irrelevant, especially in view of the\n\nfact that, here, the indictment provides irrefutable evidence of\n\nthe existence of probable cause.             See Forrester v. White, 484 U.S.\n\n219, 224 (1988).\n\n            As    to    the   FBI    agent   (Johnson),        the     district     court\n\ndismissed   the     Bivens claims       based     on     a    finding    of   qualified\n\nimmunity. With one possible exception, that decision appears to be\n\nunimpugnable.          See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001);\n\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).                         The one exception\n\nrelates    to    malicious     prosecution.            We    must    accept    as   true\n\nNogueras's allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in his\n\nfavor.     See Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(setting    forth       applicable    standard      on       motions     to   dismiss).\n\nNogueras's allegations are pointed and, following the standard\n\npraxis, dismissing the claim of malicious prosecution under the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdoctrine of qualified immunity might be problematic. See generally\n\nRivera Marcano v. Normeat Royal Dane Quality A/S, 998 F.2d 34, 37\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (describing the elements of such a claim under\n\nPuerto Rico law).\n\n            We need not probe this point too deeply, however, as we\n\nare free to uphold the ruling below on any independent ground made\n\nmanifest by the record.       See Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp), 340 F.3d\n\n15, 22 (1st Cir. 2003); Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of\n\nHoulton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999).                    We affirm here\n\nbecause, insofar as the malicious prosecution claim is concerned,\n\nJohnson's actions were shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity.\n\n            The existence of absolute prosecutorial immunity is a\n\nmatter of function; it depends not on the title or position of the\n\nofficial    involved,   but,    rather,     on    the   specific     conduct   in\n\nquestion.    See Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 342 (1983).             In this\n\ninstance,    the   challenged    conduct,    as    described    in   Nogueras's\n\npleadings, was intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\n\ncriminal process.     It was, therefore, essentially prosecutorial in\n\nnature.     See id. at 336.     Hence, immunity attaches.\n\n            We need go no further.         Concluding, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict court correctly dismissed each and all of Nogueras's\n\nclaims, we summarily reject his appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",

As to the prosecutors,\n\nthe record reflects that the actions of which Nogueras complains\n\nwere,    without    exception,       done    in   the       officials'    capacity     as\n\nprosecutors.        Consequently, those actions are shielded by the\n\nabsolute immunity that attaches to exercises of prosecutorial\n\ndiscretion.      Imbler v.

The subjective\n\nintent of the prosecutors is irrelevant, especially in view of the\n\nfact that, here, the indictment provides irrefutable evidence of\n\nthe existence of probable cause.             See Forrester v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111977\"><a href=\"/opinion/111977/forrester-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (1988).\n\n            As    to    the   FBI    agent   (Johnson),        the     district     court\n\ndismissed   the     Bivens claims       based     on     a    finding    of   qualified\n\nimmunity. With one possible exception, that decision appears to be\n\nunimpugnable.          See Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (2001);\n\nMalley v.

The one exception\n\nrelates    to    malicious     prosecution.            We    must    accept    as   true\n\nNogueras's allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in his\n\nfavor.     See Aulson v.

See generally\n\nRivera Marcano v.

See Gannett v. Carp (In re Carp), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200602\"><a href=\"/opinion/200602/gannett-v-carp/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 2003); Houlton Citizens' Coalition v.

We affirm here\n\nbecause, insofar as the malicious prosecution claim is concerned,\n\nJohnson's actions were shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity.\n\n            The existence of absolute prosecutorial immunity is a\n\nmatter of function; it depends not on the title or position of the\n\nofficial    involved,   but,    rather,     on    the   specific     conduct   in\n\nquestion.    See Briscoe v. LaHue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110885\"><a href=\"/opinion/110885/briscoe-v-lahue/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (1983).             In this\n\ninstance,    the   challenged    conduct,    as    described    in   Nogueras's\n\npleadings, was intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\n\ncriminal process.     It was, therefore, essentially prosecutorial in\n\nnature.     See id. at 336.     Hence, immunity attaches.\n\n            We need go no further.         Concluding, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict court correctly dismissed each and all of Nogueras's\n\nclaims, we summarily reject his appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f</pre>",
