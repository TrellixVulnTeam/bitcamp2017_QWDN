Mofor on brief for petitioner.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nChristopher C. Fuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Jonathan F.\nPotter, Trial Attorney, United States Department of Justice, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          March 14, 2006\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge.        The petitioner, Jesuette Tobeth-\n\nTangang, a native of Cameroon, petitions for review of a decision\n\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying her motion to\n\nreopen removal proceedings in order to allow reissuance of its\n\nearlier merits decision.     The petitioner claims that neither she\n\nnor her attorney received a copy of that decision when it was\n\nissued and that, therefore, the BIA abused its discretion in\n\ndenying her motion.    Finding no abuse of discretion, we reject the\n\npetition for review.\n\n          The basic facts are straightforward.             The petitioner\n\nentered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for business on\n\nDecember 17, 1998.    That status allowed her to remain in the United\n\nStates until March 16, 1999, but prohibited her from taking paid\n\nemployment during her stay.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(B).      The\n\npetitioner nonetheless accepted a paid job and overstayed her\n\nprescribed   time.      On   June     16,   1999,   the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service instituted removal proceedings against her\n\nby the issuance of a notice to appear.         See id. § 1229(a).\n\n          The petitioner retained counsel and cross-applied for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and voluntary departure.                She\n\naverred in substance that, if deported to Cameroon, she would be at\n\nrisk because of her prior political affiliation. Her most detailed\n\nallegation was that, as a member of the Social Democratic Front,\n\nshe had been kidnaped, beaten, and interrogated in 1997 by members\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fof the ruling Cameroon People Democratic Movement.       Building on\n\nthat foundation, she suggested that, if she were to return to\n\nCameroon, her political antagonists would kill her.\n\n            The Immigration Judge (IJ) held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nvarious dates.   Finding the petitioner's testimony lacking both in\n\ncredibility and in corroboration, the IJ rejected the full panoply\n\nof the petitioner's requests for relief and ordered her removed to\n\nCameroon.    The IJ filed his decision on May 3, 2000.\n\n            The petitioner, through her attorney, took a timely\n\nappeal to the BIA.    On the same date (May 31, 2000), her counsel\n\nfiled an entry of appearance (Form EOIR-27).    Two weeks later, the\n\npetitioner's counsel filed a brief with the BIA.       The signature\n\nblock contained a different mailing address than the address noted\n\non his entry of appearance.1\n\n            On March 26, 2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ukase.   As\n\nrequired by rule, the BIA mailed a copy of its decision (the\n\nDecision) to the attorney's address of record (i.e., to him at the\n\naddress stated in his entry of appearance form).      See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.1(f).    The attorney had moved, however, so the copy of the\n\nDecision was returned as undeliverable by the postal service.     The\n\npetitioner claims — and for present purposes, we assume arguendo —\n\n\n     1\n      The record shows that the entry of appearance form\nunambiguously listed counsel's address as \"8121 Georgia Avenue\n#102, Silver Spring, MD 20910.\" Inside his brief, counsel listed\nhis address as \"914 Silver Spring Avenue, #112,\" in the same\nmunicipality and state.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthat neither she nor her lawyer knew of the Decision until November\n\n5,   2004,     when    the    petitioner     attended   a   meeting   convened      by\n\nimmigration officials.\n\n               Four days after that meeting, the petitioner, acting\n\nthrough the same counsel, lodged an inquiry with the BIA about the\n\nstatus of her case.           In that inquiry, she asserted that neither she\n\nnor her attorney had received any correspondence from the BIA since\n\nJune 1, 2001.          The BIA responded promptly, sending the lawyer a\n\ncopy of the Decision and informing him that he apparently had moved\n\nhis office without changing the address on file with the BIA.\n\n               On December 11, 2004, the petitioner moved for reissuance\n\nof the Decision.             She implored the BIA to entertain the motion\n\nbecause neither she nor her counsel had contemporaneously received\n\na copy of the Decision.            The BIA denied the motion on April 26,\n\n2005.       Treating it as a motion to reopen,2 the BIA determined that\n\nthere had been no defect in service of the Decision and that the\n\npetitioner's counsel had neglected to file a change of address form\n\nas   required     by    the     applicable    regulation.      See    8    C.F.R.    §\n\n1003.38(e).\n\n               This petition for judicial review followed.                In it, the\n\npetitioner prays that we reverse the BIA's denial of her motion on\n\n\n        2\n      Although the petitioner sought reissuance of the Decision,\nthat relief is not mentioned in the regulations. In all events,\nthe case would have to be reopened before the BIA could grant the\nrequested relief. We therefore follow the BIA's lead and treat the\nmotion as a motion to reopen.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fthe ground that the Decision was never properly served upon her.3\n\n               We review the BIA's decision to grant or deny a motion to\n\nreopen for abuse of discretion.       INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323\n\n(1992).    Within that rubric, we must uphold the BIA's subsidiary\n\nfindings of fact as long as those findings are supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.        Radkov v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 96, 98 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).       However, the BIA's legal conclusions are reviewed de\n\nnovo.    Id.    Any material error of law automatically constitutes an\n\nabuse of discretion.       Id.\n\n               We discern no abuse of discretion here.   The BIA has an\n\naffirmative obligation to mail a copy of its final decision to the\n\nalien.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(f).       Where, as here, the alien is\n\nrepresented by counsel, that duty may be discharged by mailing a\n\ncopy of the decision to the alien's attorney of record.         See id.\n\nIn this case, the petitioner was represented by counsel, so a\n\nproper mailing to the attorney was the legal equivalent of a proper\n\nmailing to the petitioner.       See id. § 292.5(a).\n\n               The mailing here was proper.   The record makes manifest\n\nthat the BIA sent a transmittal letter enclosing the Decision on\n\n\n     3\n      The petitioner also attempts to attack the correctness of the\nDecision. That attack falls outside the scope of our review. See\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1) (requiring that petitions for review be filed\nwithin thirty days of the final administrative decision); see also\nStone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 406 (1995) (holding that a court of\nappeals lacks jurisdiction to review a BIA decision if the petition\nfor review is filed after the statutory deadline). Consequently,\nwe do not address this aspect of the petitioner's asseverational\narray.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fMarch 26, 2003 (the day that it rendered the Decision) to the\n\npetitioner's attorney at the latter's address of record.        The\n\nrecord contains not only a copy of this transmittal letter but also\n\na copy of a second letter sent by the BIA, in November of 2004,\n\nfollowing the petitioner's belated inquiry into the status of her\n\ncase.   In that second letter, the BIA explained that the earlier\n\ntransmittal letter was returned as undeliverable.      Finally, the\n\nsecond letter noted that counsel had not advised the BIA of a\n\nchange in address when he moved his office.\n\n          The BIA accepted these facts as true, and so do we.   The\n\nrecord permits no other conclusion.   The short of it, then, is that\n\nthe BIA mailed the Decision to the petitioner's attorney within the\n\nprescribed time frame and at the address he had specified.\n\n          Given this factual predicate, our decision in Radkov is\n\ncontrolling.   There, on substantially similar facts, we held that:\n\n          The time for filing a review petition begins\n          to run when the BIA complies with the terms of\n          the applicable regulations by mailing its\n          decision to a petitioner's address of record.\n          Even if, as the petitioners contend, the\n          mailing in this case somehow went awry without\n          any fault on the part of the BIA, that\n          circumstance alone would not excuse the\n          failure to file a timeous motion to reopen.\n\nRadkov, 375 F.3d at 99 (citations omitted).     It follows that the\n\nBIA's mailing was properly sent. And since its non-receipt was not\n\ndue to any fault on the part of the BIA, the fact that it was not\n\nreceived does not suffice to excuse the petitioner's failure to\n\n\n                                -6-\n\ffile a timely motion to reopen.              See id.; see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.2(c)(2) (requiring that a motion to reopen be made within\n\nninety days of the final administrative decision in the underlying\n\nproceeding).\n\n           The petitioner argues that the reference to counsel's new\n\naddress in the signature block of the brief should be deemed\n\nsufficient to apprise the BIA of his change of address.                     We find\n\nthis argument unconvincing.            The regulations prescribe a set\n\nprocedure by which aliens and their attorneys must keep the BIA\n\ninformed   of   changes   in   address.        See   8   C.F.R.   §    1003.38(e)\n\n(requiring aliens and their counsel to submit an EOIR-33 form\n\nwithin five business days of any change in address).              The record is\n\ndevoid of any indication that the petitioner's counsel complied\n\nexactly or substantially with this regulation — and, indeed, the\n\npetitioner      does   not     claim    that     her     lawyer       did    so.\n\n           Quasi-judicial proceedings, like judicial proceedings,\n\noperate best when clear rules of procedure are prescribed.                     Once\n\nthat is done, however, litigants must comply with applicable rules,\n\nand the agency, like a court, is entitled to assume that the\n\nparties are compliant. Obedience to the rules is important; unless\n\nthe agency demands such obedience, it cannot command respect.                      It\n\nfollows inexorably that non-observance of the rules should neither\n\nbe indulged nor lightly excused.             Cf. de la Torre v. Cont'l Ins.\n\nCo., 15 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining that a plaintiff\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fwho   fails    to   comply   with    \"clearly      delineated      rules\"   cannot\n\nlegitimately be heard to complain when the court holds fast to\n\nthose rules).\n\n              So it is here.        The BIA was entitled to rely on the\n\naddress on file, and had no duty to hunt through every piece of\n\npaper pertinent to the case in search of indications to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n              We need go no further. Simply put, the BIA satisfied its\n\nlegal obligation by mailing the Decision to the petitioner at the\n\nunrevoked     address   furnished     by     her   counsel    on   the   entry   of\n\nappearance form.     See Radkov, 375 F.3d at 99; Nowak v. INS, 94 F.3d\n\n390, 391-92 (7th Cir. 1996).            Its subsequent adherence to the\n\nregulations governing entries of appearance and changes of address\n\nwas well within the realm of its discretion.                 Consequently, there\n\nis no principled way that we can overturn the BIA's denial of the\n\nmotion to reopen.\n\n\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f",

And since its non-receipt was not due to any fault on the part of the BIA, the fact that it was not received does not suffice to excuse the petitioner's failure to file a timely motion to reopen. <i>See id.; see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(2) (requiring that a motion to reopen be made within ninety days of the final administrative decision in the underlying proceeding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner argues that the reference to counsel's new address in the signature block of the brief should be deemed sufficient to apprise the BIA of his change of address. We find this argument unconvincing. The regulations prescribe a set procedure by which aliens and their attorneys must keep the BIA informed of changes in address. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.38(e) (requiring aliens and their counsel to submit an EOIR-33 form within five business days of any change in address).

Once that is done, however, litigants must comply with applicable rules, and the agency, like a court, is entitled to assume that the parties are compliant. Obedience to the rules is important; unless the agency demands such obedience, it cannot command respect. It follows inexorably that non-observance of the rules should neither be indulged nor lightly excused. <i>Cf. de la Torre v. Cont'l Ins.

The petitioner claims that neither she nor her attorney received a copy of that decision when it was issued and that, therefore, the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion. Finding no abuse of discretion, we reject the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic facts are straightforward. The petitioner entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for business on December 17, 1998. That status allowed her to remain in the United States until March 16, 1999, but prohibited her from taking paid employment during her stay. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(15)(B). The petitioner nonetheless accepted a paid job and overstayed her prescribed time. On June 16, 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted removal proceedings against her by the issuance of a notice to appear. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1229(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner retained counsel and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and voluntary departure. She averred in substance that, if deported to Cameroon, she would be at risk because of her prior political affiliation. Her most detailed allegation was that, as a member of the Social Democratic Front, she had been kidnaped, beaten, and interrogated in 1997 by members of the ruling Cameroon People Democratic Movement. Building on that foundation, she suggested that, if she were to return to Cameroon, her political antagonists would kill her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Immigration Judge (IJ) held an evidentiary hearing on various dates. Finding the petitioner's testimony lacking both in credibility and in corroboration, the IJ rejected the full panoply of the petitioner's requests for relief and ordered her removed to Cameroon. The IJ filed his decision on May 3, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, through her attorney, took a timely appeal to the BIA. On the same date (May 31, 2000), her counsel filed an entry of appearance (Form EOIR-27). Two weeks later, the petitioner's counsel filed a brief with the BIA. The signature block contained a different mailing address than the address noted on his entry of appearance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2003, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ukase. As required by rule, the BIA mailed a copy of its decision (the Decision) to the attorney's address of record (i.e., to him at the address stated in his entry of appearance form). <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(f). The attorney had moved, however, so the copy of the Decision was returned as undeliverable by the postal service. The petitioner claims &#8212; and for present purposes, we assume arguendo &#8212; that neither she nor her lawyer knew of the Decision until November 5, 2004, when the petitioner attended a meeting convened by immigration officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days after that meeting, the petitioner, acting through the same counsel, lodged an inquiry with the BIA about the status of her case. In that inquiry, she asserted that neither she nor her attorney had received any correspondence from the BIA since June 1, 2001. The BIA responded promptly, sending the lawyer a copy of the Decision and informing him that he apparently had moved his office without changing the address on file with the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2004, the petitioner moved for reissuance of the Decision. She implored the BIA to entertain the motion because neither she nor her counsel had contemporaneously received a copy of the Decision. The BIA denied the motion on April 26, 2005. Treating it as a motion to reopen,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the BIA determined that there had been no defect in service of the Decision and that the petitioner's counsel had neglected to file a change of address form as required by the applicable regulation. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.38(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This petition for judicial review followed. In it, the petitioner prays that we reverse the BIA's denial of her motion on the ground that the Decision was never properly served upon her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the BIA's decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <i>INS v. Doherty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 323, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112677\"><a href=\"/opinion/112677/ins-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span> (1992). Within that rubric, we must uphold the BIA's subsidiary findings of fact as long as those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <i>Radkov v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201120\"><a href=\"/opinion/201120/radkov-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir.2004). However, the BIA's legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <i>Id.</i> Any material error of law automatically constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion here. The BIA has an affirmative obligation to mail a copy of its final decision to the alien. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(f). Where, as here, the alien is represented by counsel, that duty may be discharged by mailing a copy of the decision to the alien's attorney of record. <i>See id.</i> In this case, the petitioner was represented by counsel, so a proper mailing to the attorney was the legal equivalent of a proper mailing to the petitioner. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 292.5(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mailing here was proper. The record makes manifest that the BIA sent a transmittal letter enclosing the Decision on March 26, 2003 (the day that it rendered the Decision) to the petitioner's attorney at the latter's address of record. The record contains not only a copy of this transmittal letter but also a copy of a second letter sent by the BIA, in November of 2004, following the petitioner's belated inquiry into the status of her case. In that second letter, the BIA explained that the earlier transmittal letter was returned as undeliverable. Finally, the second letter noted that counsel had not advised the BIA of a change in address when he moved his office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA accepted these facts as true, and so do we. The record permits no other conclusion. The short of it, then, is that the BIA mailed the Decision to the petitioner's attorney within the prescribed time frame and at the address he had specified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this factual predicate, our decision in <i>Radkov</i> is controlling.

Even if, as the petitioners contend, the mailing in this case somehow went awry without any fault on the part of the BIA, that circumstance alone would not excuse the failure to file a timeous motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Radkov,</i> 375 F.3d at 99 (citations omitted). It follows that the BIA's mailing was properly sent. And since its non-receipt was not due to any fault on the part of the BIA, the fact that it was not received does not suffice to excuse the petitioner's failure to file a timely motion to reopen. <i>See id.; see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(c)(2) (requiring that a motion to reopen be made within ninety days of the final administrative decision in the underlying proceeding).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner argues that the reference to counsel's new address in the signature block of the brief should be deemed sufficient to apprise the BIA of his change of address.
