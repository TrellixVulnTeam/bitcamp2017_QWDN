In this petition for review,\n\nSamath Pheak Tum contests the Board of Immigration Appeals' (\"BIA\")\n\ndenials of her requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").               We lack\n\njurisdiction to review the finding that her asylum application was\n\nuntimely and, on her remaining claims, we deny the petition.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             We provide here an overview of the relevant background\n\ninformation, elaborating as necessary in our analysis of the\n\nclaims.      Tum was born on September 19, 1960 in Cambodia.            She is\n\nmarried, but her husband is missing, and her six children all\n\nreside in Cambodia.\n\n             While in Cambodia, Tum was politically active on behalf\n\nof the Sam Rangsi Party.        In March 1998, while she was advocating\n\nfor her party at a market, she testified that soldiers pointed a\n\ngun at her and ordered her to cease her activities or she would be\n\nkilled.      In September 1998, while she was participating in a\n\ndemonstration demanding a recount of the ballots from a recent\n\nnational election, the police hit her in the back with an electric\n\nbaton.    Later that night, several police officers forced their way\n\ninto   her    house,   took   her   to    the   police   station,   pushed   and\n\ninterrogated her, and held her overnight.\n\n             Tum entered the United States on or about July 26, 2000,\n\nas a nonimmigrant with authorization to remain in the United States\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\funtil January 25, 2001.         She stayed beyond that date without\n\nauthorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.              As\n\na result, she was charged under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) and found\n\nremovable   as   charged.     She    filed    an   application   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT, claiming that\n\nshe had a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of her\n\npolitical opinion.\n\n            After a hearing on March 24, 2004, an immigration judge\n\n(“IJ”) denied Tum's claims.      He held that she was not eligible for\n\nasylum because her application was not filed within a year of her\n\nentry into the United States and no extraordinary circumstances\n\nwarranted extending the deadline.             With respect to her other\n\nclaims,   the    IJ   found   that   Tum     was   not   credible   based   on\n\ninconsistencies between her application and her testimony, and\n\nfurthermore found that she had failed to show that it was more\n\nlikely than not that she would be subject to persecution or torture\n\nif she returned to Cambodia.         Subsequently, the BIA adopted and\n\naffirmed the IJ's decision.\n\n                                     II.\n\nA. Application for Asylum\n\n            The BIA denied Tum's application for asylum because it\n\nwas untimely and there was no reason to excuse her from complying\n\nwith the one-year filing deadline.           Although Tum claims that her\n\napplication for asylum was improperly denied, her brief does not\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdirectly address the holding that she failed to meet the required\n\ndeadline.\n\n              It is well established that issues \"adverted to on appeal\n\nin    a   perfunctory        manner,     unaccompanied     by       some     developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\"                    Ryan v. Royal\n\nIns. Co. of Am., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990).                   However, even\n\nif Tum had developed arguments to support her claim that her\n\napplication was improperly denied, we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\nher claim.      An applicant for asylum must \"demonstrate[] by clear\n\nand convincing evidence that the application has been filed within\n\n1 year after the date of the [individual's] arrival in the United\n\nStates.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).          An exception to the one-year\n\nfiling deadline arises if the applicant \"demonstrates to the\n\nsatisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of\n\nchanged    circumstances         which   materially    affect       the    applicant's\n\neligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to\n\nthe   delay    in     filing     an   application.\"      Id.    §    1158(a)(2)(D).\n\nFinally,      \"[n]o    court     shall   have   jurisdiction        to     review    any\n\ndetermination         of   the   Attorney   General\"     regarding         whether   an\n\napplicant for asylum has filed an untimely application or qualifies\n\nfor an exception to the filing requirement.               Id. § 1158(a)(3).\n\n              Here, the IJ and the Board both determined that Tum's\n\nasylum application was not timely filed and that she did not\n\nqualify for an exception to the filing deadline.                      Thus, we lack\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fjurisdiction to review these determinations.        See, e.g., Njenga v.\n\nAshcroft, 386 F.3d 335, 338-39 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nB. Other Claims\n\n            On review of a denial of a claim for withholding of\n\nremoval or protection under the CAT, we will uphold the BIA's\n\ndecision if it was \"'supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\"           INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias,   502   U.S.    478,   481   (1992)(quoting   8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1105a(a)(4)).     Where, as here, the BIA has adopted the IJ's\n\ncredibility determinations, we are bound by those determinations\n\nunless \"a finding that the alien is credible is compelled.\"             Chen\n\nv. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 110, 113-14 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            1. Withholding of Removal\n\n            To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant\n\nmust demonstrate that, \"upon deportation, [she] is more likely than\n\nnot to face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"\n\nSharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 474 (1st Cir. 2005); see also 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).      After a hearing, the IJ found that Tum was\n\nnot credible and enumerated several specific inconsistencies to\n\nsupport this finding. First, Tum offered different accounts of the\n\npolitical    demonstration     in   her   asylum   application    and    her\n\ntestimony. In the application, she claimed that she had joined the\n\nprotesters on September 9, 1998, and was beaten and arrested at her\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhome that day.     In her testimony, however, she indicated that she\n\nparticipated in the demonstration for eighteen days and was beaten\n\nand arrested at the end of that period.            A similar inconsistency\n\narose in her description of the military officers who threatened\n\nher at gunpoint.       In her application, Tum stated that she was\n\nthreatened while leading a group of five campaign workers who were\n\nhanding   out    \"photos   and   flyers\"    in   her   neighborhood;    at   the\n\nhearing, however, she testified that it happened while she was\n\ncampaigning for her party by talking to people and distributing\n\nparty membership cards at a market.         These inconsistencies are not\n\ninconsequential as they \"involve matters important to petitioner's\n\nclaims for relief,\" Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2007), and they provide a reasonable basis for the IJ's credibility\n\ndeterminations; we certainly are not compelled to find otherwise.\n\n           The IJ also found, and the BIA affirmed, that Tum was\n\nunlikely to face persecution if she returned to Cambodia.                    In\n\nparticular, Tum remained in Cambodia for two years following the\n\nevents she described without suffering further harm. Moreover, her\n\nsix   children   currently   reside    in    Cambodia    and   also   have   not\n\nsuffered harm. In light of these findings and the IJ's credibility\n\ndetermination, we conclude that the BIA's determination that Tum\n\nwas not eligible for withholding of removal was supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          2. Convention Against Torture\n\n          Under the CAT, an applicant must establish \"'that it is\n\nmore likely than not that [she] . . . would be tortured if\n\nremoved'\" to the country in question.           Sharari, 407 F.3d at 475\n\n(quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2)).         Torture is defined as the\n\nintentional   infliction   of   severe   pain    or   suffering   for   such\n\npurposes as forcing a confession or intimidating someone; the pain\n\nor suffering must be inflicted by the government, or with its\n\nacquiescence.   Id. (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1)).\n\n          As the discussion of the claim for withholding of removal\n\ndemonstrates, Tum has not met her burden of establishing that it is\n\nmore likely than not that she will be tortured by the government of\n\nCambodia or its agent if she returns.             Moreover, the current\n\ngovernment of Cambodia consists of a coalition that includes Tum's\n\nparty, which further diminishes the likelihood that she will be\n\ntortured upon her return.       We conclude that the BIA's decision\n\ndenying relief to Tum on the basis of the CAT was also supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.*\n\n\n\n\n     *\n       We wish to note that we are troubled by the deficiencies in\nthe brief submitted on behalf of petitioner. The argument portion\nof the brief comprised less than four pages.        There were no\ncitations to the record. Succeeding with a petition for review in\nimmigration cases is sufficiently challenging without the\nadditional burden of poor legal representation. Counsel should not\nundertake representation in the future without a thoughtful and\nthorough effort to present petitioner's claims for relief.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f                             III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                             -8-\n\f",

Subsequently, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>A. Application for Asylum</p>\n<p>The BIA denied Tum's application for asylum because it was untimely and there was no reason to excuse her from complying with the one-year filing deadline. Although Tum claims that her application for asylum was improperly denied, her brief does not directly address the holding that she failed to meet the required deadline.</p>\n<p>It is well established that issues \"adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\" <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990). However, even if Tum had developed arguments to support her claim that her application was improperly denied, we lack jurisdiction to consider her claim. An applicant for asylum must \"demonstrate[ ] by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the [individual's] arrival in the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). An exception to the one-year filing deadline arises if the applicant \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1158(a)(2)(D). Finally, \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\" regarding whether an applicant for asylum has filed an untimely application or qualifies for an exception to the filing requirement. <i>Id.</i> § 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Here, the IJ and the Board both determined that Tum's asylum application was not timely filed and that she did not qualify for an exception to the filing deadline. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> determinations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Njenga v. Ashcroft,</i> 386 F.3d 335, 338-39 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>B. Other Claims</p>\n<p>On review of a denial of a claim for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT, we will uphold the BIA's decision if it was \"`supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>INS v.

Where, as here, the BIA has adopted the IJ's credibility determinations, we are bound by those determinations unless \"a finding that the alien is credible is compelled.\" <i>Chen v.

Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p>To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate that, \"upon deportation, [she] is more likely than not to face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" <i>Sharari v.

Application for Asylum</p>\n<p>The BIA denied Tum's application for asylum because it was untimely and there was no reason to excuse her from complying with the one-year filing deadline. Although Tum claims that her application for asylum was improperly denied, her brief does not directly address the holding that she failed to meet the required deadline.</p>\n<p>It is well established that issues \"adverted to on appeal in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some developed argumentation, are deemed to have been abandoned.\" <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550084\"><a href=\"/opinion/550084/maury-a-ryan-dba-ryan-klimek-ryan-partnership-v-royal-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 734 (1st Cir.1990). However, even if Tum had developed arguments to support her claim that her application was improperly denied, we lack jurisdiction to consider her claim. An applicant for asylum must \"demonstrate[ ] by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the [individual's] arrival in the United States.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). An exception to the one-year filing deadline arises if the applicant \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1158(a)(2)(D). Finally, \"[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General\" regarding whether an applicant for asylum has filed an untimely application or qualifies for an exception to the filing requirement. <i>Id.</i> § 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Here, the IJ and the Board both determined that Tum's asylum application was not timely filed and that she did not qualify for an exception to the filing deadline. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*161</span> determinations. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Njenga v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201296\"><a href=\"/opinion/201296/njenga-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 338-39 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>B. Other Claims</p>\n<p>On review of a denial of a claim for withholding of removal or protection under the CAT, we will uphold the BIA's decision if it was \"`supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 481, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1992)(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)). Where, as here, the BIA has adopted the IJ's credibility determinations, we are bound by those determinations unless \"a finding that the alien is credible is compelled.\" <i>Chen v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201763\"><a href=\"/opinion/201763/chen-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 113-14 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>1. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p>To be eligible for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate that, \"upon deportation, [she] is more likely than not to face persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" <i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 474 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). After a hearing, the IJ found that Tum was not credible and enumerated several specific inconsistencies to support this finding. First, Tum offered different accounts of the political demonstration in her asylum application and her testimony. In the application, she claimed that she had joined the protesters on September 9, 1998, and was beaten and arrested at her home that day. In her testimony, however, she indicated that she participated in the demonstration for eighteen days and was beaten and arrested at the end of that period. A similar inconsistency arose in her description of the military officers who threatened her at gunpoint. In her application, Tum stated that she was threatened while leading a group of five campaign workers who were handing out \"photos and flyers\" in her neighborhood; at the hearing, however, she testified that it happened while she was campaigning for her party by talking to people and distributing party membership cards at a market. These inconsistencies are not inconsequential as they \"involve matters important to petitioner's claims for relief,\" <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2007), and they provide a reasonable basis for the IJ's credibility determinations; we certainly are not compelled to find otherwise.</p>\n<p>The IJ also found, and the BIA affirmed, that Tum was unlikely to face persecution if she returned to Cambodia. In particular, Tum remained in Cambodia for two years following the events she described without suffering further harm. Moreover, her six children currently reside in Cambodia and also have not suffered harm. In light of these findings and the IJ's credibility determination, we conclude that the BIA's determination that Tum was not eligible for withholding of removal was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>2. Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p>Under the CAT, an applicant must establish \"`that it is more likely than not that [she] . . . would be tortured if removed'\" to the country in question. <i>Sharari,</i> 407 F.3d at 475 (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2)). Torture is defined as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering for such purposes as forcing a confession or intimidating someone; the pain or suffering must be inflicted by the government, or with its acquiescence. <i>Id.</i> (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1)).</p>\n<p>As the discussion of the claim for withholding of removal demonstrates, Tum has not met her burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured by the government of Cambodia or its agent if she returns. Moreover, the current government of Cambodia consists <span class=\"star-pagination\">*162</span> of a coalition that includes Tum's party, which further diminishes the likelihood that she will be tortured upon her return. We conclude that the BIA's decision denying relief to Tum on the basis of the CAT was also supported by substantial evidence.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  We wish to note that we are troubled by the deficiencies in the brief submitted on behalf of petitioner. The argument portion of the brief comprised less than four pages. There were no citations to the record. Succeeding with a petition for review in immigration cases is sufficiently challenging without the additional burden of poor legal representation. Counsel should not undertake representation in the future without a thoughtful and thorough effort to present petitioner's claims for relief.</p>\n\n</div>",
