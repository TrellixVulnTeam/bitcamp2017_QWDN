Silsby,\n                                                                 \nSenior Litigation Counsel, were on brief for appellees.\n\n                                         \n\n                        June 30, 1993\n                                         \n\n     BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.   The Holbrooks'  two-and-a-half-\n                          \n\nyear-old son, Daniel Holbrook, sustained severe and permanent\n\ninjuries after  falling through a second-floor  window of the\n\nHolbrooks'  apartment.   Because plaintiff Mark  Holbrook was\n\nemployed  by  the  United States  Navy  at  the  time of  the\n\naccident, the United States  paid 80 percent of the  costs of\n\nDaniel's medical treatment under the Dependent's Medical Care\n\nAct,  10 U.S.C.   1071 (the \"Dependent's Act\").  The Holbooks\n\nthen  sued  Andersen  Corporation,  the  manufacturer of  the\n\nwindow and screen, alleging negligence and product liability.\n\nThe Holbrooks notified the United States of the initiation of\n\nthe suit, but the United States did not intervene.\n\n     Three  days before  trial,  the  Holbrooks and  Andersen\n\nsettled the suit  for $725,000.1   This amount  was far  less\n\nthan  the complaint  had  sought, and  the amount  presumably\n\nreflected the parties' judgment about likelihood  of success;\n\nDaniel Holbrook  had  been unsupervised  at the  time of  the\n\naccident, and there were no witnesses.  The United States was\n\nnot  a  party  to  the  settlement, nor  did  the  settlement\n\nagreement provide that  any money should be paid  by Andersen\n\nto the United States in respect of the medical costs that the\n\ngovernment  had  incurred.    The  settlement  agreement  did\n\n                    \n\n     1Attorneys'  fees and expenses  absorbed a large portion\nof this amount ($391,505.50).  Of the balance,  the Holbrooks\nwere allotted  a portion  ($50,000) for direct  expenses with\nthe remainder to be held in trust for Daniel.\n\n                             -2-\n\nprovide, however, that the Holbrooks would indemnify Andersen\n\nif the latter were held liable to the United States.  \n\n     In  its order  approving  the settlement,  the  district\n\ncourt  sua sponte  ordered  that $139,028  of the  settlement\n                 \n\nproceeds be placed in an  escrow account to satisfy potential\n\nliens of the United States or others.2   Six months later the\n\nUnited States moved to compel disbursement to it of the funds\n\nheld  in escrow,  and  shortly thereafter  the United  States\n\nformally  moved to  intervene  in the  action; the  Holbrooks\n\nopposed  both motions.    The court  ultimately granted  both\n\nmotions and after a  recalculation of the government's actual\n\npayments  ordered   disbursement  to  the  United  States  of\n\n$122,834.   The  balance of  the escrow  was remitted  to the\n\nHolbrooks.     The  Holbrooks   appeal,  arguing   that  this\n\ndisbursement was not authorized by law.\n\n     In  claiming  a right  to  a portion  of  the Holbrooks'\n\nsettlement, the  United States  relies solely on  the Federal\n\nMedical Care  Recovery Act, 42  U.S.C.   2651  (\"the Recovery\n\nAct\").   This  statute grants  to the  government a  right to\n\nrecover from a third-party tortfeasor the reasonable value of\n\nmedical services that the  government has furnished under the\n\n                    \n\n     2Local rules required  court approval of  settlements of\nclaims brought  on behalf  of minor  children.   The  court's\nescrow  order  may  have  been  prompted  by  the  Holbrooks'\nstatement  in   their  motion  for  court   approval  of  the\nsettlement that the Navy  had paid 80 percent of  the medical\nbills  and  that  the  total  medical  expenses  amounted  to\n$139,028.  \n\n                             -3-\n\nDependent's   Act  (or   under   other   similar   statutes).\n\nSpecifically, the Recovery Act provides:\n\n     In  any  action  in  which  the  United  States  is\n     authorized or required by  law to furnish hospital,\n     medical, surgical, or dental care and treatment . .\n     .  to a person who is injured or suffers a disease,\n     after  the   effective  date  of  this  Act,  under\n     circumstances creating a  tort liability upon  some\n     third person  . . .  to pay  damages therefor,  the\n     United States  shall have  a right to  recover from\n     said third person the  reasonable value of the care\n     and treatment  so furnished or to  be furnished and\n     shall, as to this right be subrogated  to any right\n     or  claim that the injured person . . . has against\n     such third  person to the extent  of the reasonable\n     value of the care and  treatment so furnished or to\n     be furnished.\n\n42  U.S.C.   2651(a).  The statute then sets forth procedures\n\nfor the  government's enforcement of this  right of recovery.\n\nThe United States  may \"intervene  or join in  any action  or\n\nproceeding brought by the injured  or diseased person\" or, if\n\nsuch an  action  is  not  commenced within  six  months,  may\n\n\"institute and prosecute legal proceedings against  the third\n\nperson  who  is liable  for the  injury or  disease.\"   Id.  \n                                                          \n\n2651(b).  \n\n     The parties direct their  arguments in this case chiefly\n\nat the procedural component  of the statute, section 2651(b).\n\nThe  Holbrooks  argue  that  the  United  States'  motion  to\n\nintervene came too late, because it was not filed until after\n\nthe   Holbrooks'  suit  against   Andersen  was  resolved  by\n\nsettlement.   The United States responds  by pointing to case\n\nlaw  providing  that  the  procedural devices  set  forth  in\n\n                             -4-\n\nsection  2651(b)  are  not exclusive  and  that  a motion  to\n\nintervene may be  filed \"at  any time,\" even  after entry  of\n\njudgment.  United  States v.  Merrigan, 389 F.2d  21, 25  (3d\n                                      \n\nCir. 1968); see  also United  States v. York,  398 F.2d  582,\n                                            \n\n585-86 (6th Cir. 1968).  We  think that the crucial issue  is\n\nnot  when the government may intervene but rather whom it may\n                                                      \n\nproceed against once it makes an appearance in the case.  \n\n     The statute  grants  to the  United  States a  right  to\n\nrecover \"from [the] third  person\" who is liable in  tort for\n\nthe injury.  It  makes no provision for the  United States to\n\nrecover   against   the   injured   party   or   from   funds\n\nunconditionally paid to the  injured party by the tortfeasor.\n\nMoreover,  the  United States'  right  to  recover under  the\n\nstatute  is contingent  upon \"circumstances  creating a  tort\n\nliability  upon some  third  party.\"   42  U.S.C.    2651(a);\n\nThomas  v.  Shelton,  740  F.2d  478,  481  (7th  Cir.  1984)\n                   \n\n(tortfeasors' \"liability under the Medical Care Recovery  Act\n\ndepends on their being found liable  . . . under the tort law\n\nof the pertinent state\"); United States  v. Trammel, 899 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n1483,  1488 (6th Cir.  1990) (same).  There  has been no such\n\ndetermination in this case.\n\n     \"All  courts  which have  considered  the  question have\n\nagreed  that   the  statute   gives  the  United   States  an\n\nindependent right of recovery against the tortfeasor . . . .\"\n\nUnited  States v.  Housing Authority  of Bremerton,  415 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n                             -5-\n\n239, 241 (9th Cir 1969).  Thus, the government's right is not\n\nextinguished  by the injured  person's settlement and release\n\nwith the tortfeasor.  See,  e.g., United States v. Theriaque,\n                                                            \n\n674 F. Supp. 395  (D. Mass. 1987).  Indeed,  the government's\n\nright against  the tortfeasor under  the Recovery Act  is not\n\ndefeated  even by  certain  restrictions that  might bar  the\n\ninjured  person's own recovery.3   There is thus no necessity\n\nfor  the  United  States  to  look  to  the  injured  party's\n\nsettlement for compensation.\n\n     If the United States  wishes to invoke the  Recovery Act\n\nto recover its medical  payments in this case, we  think that\n\nunder  the plain  language  of the  statute  it must  proceed\n\nagainst  Andersen  and  seek  to  establish  Andersen's  tort\n\nliability.   The language of  the statute does  not authorize\n\nthe government to  collect under  the Recovery Act  out of  a\n\nsettlement negotiated  between  the injured  person  and  the\n\ntortfeasor.  Nor  is there any case  law that permits such  a\n\nrecovery  absent  an express  agreement  designating for  the\n\ngovernment a portion of the settlement.\n\n     This  case  does  not  involve  the  peculiar  facts  of\n\nCockerham  v. Garvin,  768  F.2d 784,  787  (6th Cir.  1985).\n                    \n\n                    \n\n     3See Heusle v. National  Mutual Ins. Co., 628 F.2d  833,\n                                             \n837 (3d Cir. 1980)  (procedural restrictions); United  States\n                                                             \nv. Moore, 469 F.2d 788, 790 (3d Cir. 1972) (state doctrine of\n        \ninterspousal immunity),  cert. denied,  411 U.S.  905 (1973);\n                                     \nUnited  States v. Gera, 409  F.2d 117, 119-20  (3d Cir. 1969)\n                      \n(state statute of limitations).  \n\n                             -6-\n\nThere the  Sixth Circuit  allowed recovery out  of settlement\n\nproceeds   where  \"[t]he  [injured   person]  and  tortfeasor\n\nspecifically agreed that part  of the money paid over  to the\n\n[injured person] would be  held in escrow pending a  claim by\n\nthe [United  States] for specific medical bills . . . .\"  The\n\ncourt   treated  the   escrow   as   giving  the   government\n\n\"beneficiary\" status akin to  that enjoyed by the third-party\n\nbeneficiary of a contract.   See id. at 784.  The  court also\n                                   \n\ndecided  that  on  remand   the  government's  share  of  the\n\nsettlement    should    be    determined     by    \"equitable\n\nconsiderations,\" taking account of any  discounted settlement\n\naccepted by the victim and the litigation costs he had borne.\n\nId. at 787.  The government does not argue that  in this case\n  \n\nthere was  any third-part  beneficiary agreement  between the\n\nHolbrooks and Andersen.\n\n     Rather, the  United States  says that its  present claim\n\nhas  been  misunderstood.    It argues  that  its  attempt to\n\nrecover  from the escrow is not a claim against the Holbrooks\n\nbut  rather,  consistent with  the Recovery  Act, is  a claim\n\nagainst Andersen, which supplied  the funds.  This is  a word\n\ngame  that does  not reflect  the reality  of the  situation:\n\nAndersen has  paid the settlement amount to  the Holbrooks in\n                  \n\nexchange  for  a release  of claims  against  it.   The money\n\nbelongs to the Holbrooks and  their son quite as much  as Mr.\n\n                             -7-\n\nHolbrook's salary paid to him by the Navy belongs  to him and\n\nnot to the Navy which is the source of the funds.\n\n     The  best argument  for the  United States  is based  on\n\npolicy considerations.   Andersen's payment to  the Holbrooks\n\nis not technically  an admission of liability,  Fed. R. Evid.\n\n408, but  in reality the  settlement reflects  a judgment  by\n\nAndersen that there is a risk of liability and that the  case\n\nis worth  that  much  to  settle.   But  to  the  extent  the\n                                                        \n\ntortfeasor  is liable  to  the Holbrooks  under tort  law--an\n\nissue  mooted  by the  settlement--it is  also liable  to the\n\nUnited States for any medical costs paid by the latter.\n\n     Of course the  United States  still has a  right to  sue\n\nindependently and, if it can prove liability, to collect  its\n\nfull  medical expenses  with no  settlement discount  at all.\n\nBut  everyone  knows  that  if  fault  is  debatable and  the\n\ntortfeasor settles  with the  injured party, the  chances for\n\nthe United States to recover may be much reduced.  Any lawyer\n\nwould prefer to try a tort case in which the co-plaintiff  is\n\nan   injured  two-and-a-half-year  old,  especially  where  a\n\nverdict for the child virtually requires an award for the co-\n\nlitigant.\n\n     What is  even more troubling is that  the tortfeasor has\n\nan  incentive in  such  a  case  to  pay  the  injured  party\n\nsomething extra in settlement  precisely in order to uncouple\n\nthe two claims.   Once the United States is  left to litigate\n\n                             -8-\n\non its own, it not only has no sympathetic victim to take the\n\nlead before  the  jury  but  must  bear  its  own  litigation\n\nexpenses.   And, if (as  here) the alleged  tortfeasor has an\n\nindemnity  agreement  with  the  victim,  making  the  latter\n\nresponsible for any award to the United States, the victim or\n\nwitnesses  associated with  the victim  now have  an economic\n\nincentive to minimize the  tortfeasor's fault when the United\n\nStates sues.\n\n     These policy concerns are  not overwhelming:  the United\n\nStates is not without  litigation resources, in this  case it\n\nhas the  benefit  of  much  discovery  already  done  by  the\n\nHolbrooks, and perjury laws  cabin the witnesses'  testimony.\n\nHad  it anticipated  the  problem, Congress  might well  have\n\nprovided  a  legislative  solution  along the  lines  of  the\n\nCockerham case:  The Recovery Act could easily have said that\n         \n\nif the tortfeasor  and victim settle,  the United States  can\n\nclaim for  its  medical costs  an  \"equitable\" share  of  the\n\nsettlement to be determined  by the court.  But  Congress did\n\nnot  to so--it  cannot anticipate  every problem--and  so the\n\nquestion posed  is whether  the courts should  do the  repair\n\nwork themselves.\n\n     The answer here, we think, is  no.  The statute does not\n\nliterally forbid this \"equitable share\" solution, but neither\n\ndo the provisions of this reasonably detailed statute provide\n\nfor any such  recovery against the  victim or the  settlement\n\n                             -9-\n\nfund.   Nor can we  be certain  that Congress  would wish  to\n\nimpose an \"equitable share\" solution; perhaps it might pick a\n\nquite different solution or no solution  at all.  There is no\n\nmagic formula to say when courts should do patch-work repairs\n\nto legislation, but in our view this is not such a  case.  If\n\nCongress wants a  solution, it is best  for it to tailor  its\n\nown.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is reversed.\n                                                   \n\n                             -10-\n",

The Holbrooks'  two-and-a-half-\n                          \n\nyear-old son, Daniel Holbrook, sustained severe and permanent\n\ninjuries after  falling through a second-floor  window of the\n\nHolbrooks'  apartment.   Because plaintiff Mark  Holbrook was\n\nemployed  by  the  United States  Navy  at  the  time of  the\n\naccident, the United States  paid 80 percent of the  costs of\n\nDaniel's medical treatment under the Dependent's Medical Care\n\nAct,  10 U.S.C.   1071 (the \"Dependent's Act\").  The Holbooks\n\nthen  sued  Andersen  Corporation,  the  manufacturer of  the\n\nwindow and screen, alleging negligence and product liability.\n\nThe Holbrooks notified the United States of the initiation of\n\nthe suit, but the United States did not intervene.\n\n     Three  days before  trial,  the  Holbrooks and  Andersen\n\nsettled the suit  for $725,000.1   This amount  was far  less\n\nthan  the complaint  had  sought, and  the amount  presumably\n\nreflected the parties' judgment about likelihood  of success;\n\nDaniel Holbrook  had  been unsupervised  at the  time of  the\n\naccident, and there were no witnesses.  The United States was\n\nnot  a  party  to  the  settlement, nor  did  the  settlement\n\nagreement provide that  any money should be paid  by Andersen\n\nto the United States in respect of the medical costs that the\n\ngovernment  had  incurred.    The  settlement  agreement  did\n\n                    \n\n     1Attorneys'  fees and expenses  absorbed a large portion\nof this amount ($391,505.50).  Of the balance,  the Holbrooks\nwere allotted  a portion  ($50,000) for direct  expenses with\nthe remainder to be held in trust for Daniel.\n\n                             -2-\n\nprovide, however, that the Holbrooks would indemnify Andersen\n\nif the latter were held liable to the United States.  \n\n     In  its order  approving  the settlement,  the  district\n\ncourt  sua sponte  ordered  that $139,028  of the  settlement\n                 \n\nproceeds be placed in an  escrow account to satisfy potential\n\nliens of the United States or others.2   Six months later the\n\nUnited States moved to compel disbursement to it of the funds\n\nheld  in escrow,  and  shortly thereafter  the United  States\n\nformally  moved to  intervene  in the  action; the  Holbrooks\n\nopposed  both motions.    The court  ultimately granted  both\n\nmotions and after a  recalculation of the government's actual\n\npayments  ordered   disbursement  to  the  United  States  of\n\n$122,834.   The  balance of  the escrow  was remitted  to the\n\nHolbrooks.     The  Holbrooks   appeal,  arguing   that  this\n\ndisbursement was not authorized by law.\n\n     In  claiming  a right  to  a portion  of  the Holbrooks'\n\nsettlement, the  United States  relies solely on  the Federal\n\nMedical Care  Recovery Act, 42  U.S.C.   2651  (\"the Recovery\n\nAct\").   This  statute grants  to the  government a  right to\n\nrecover from a third-party tortfeasor the reasonable value of\n\nmedical services that the  government has furnished under the\n\n                    \n\n     2Local rules required  court approval of  settlements of\nclaims brought  on behalf  of minor  children.   The  court's\nescrow  order  may  have  been  prompted  by  the  Holbrooks'\nstatement  in   their  motion  for  court   approval  of  the\nsettlement that the Navy  had paid 80 percent of  the medical\nbills  and  that  the  total  medical  expenses  amounted  to\n$139,028.  \n\n                             -3-\n\nDependent's   Act  (or   under   other   similar   statutes).\n\nSpecifically, the Recovery Act provides:\n\n     In  any  action  in  which  the  United  States  is\n     authorized or required by  law to furnish hospital,\n     medical, surgical, or dental care and treatment . .\n     .  to a person who is injured or suffers a disease,\n     after  the   effective  date  of  this  Act,  under\n     circumstances creating a  tort liability upon  some\n     third person  . . .  to pay  damages therefor,  the\n     United States  shall have  a right to  recover from\n     said third person the  reasonable value of the care\n     and treatment  so furnished or to  be furnished and\n     shall, as to this right be subrogated  to any right\n     or  claim that the injured person . . . has against\n     such third  person to the extent  of the reasonable\n     value of the care and  treatment so furnished or to\n     be furnished.\n\n42  U.S.C.   2651(a).  The statute then sets forth procedures\n\nfor the  government's enforcement of this  right of recovery.\n\nThe United States  may \"intervene  or join in  any action  or\n\nproceeding brought by the injured  or diseased person\" or, if\n\nsuch an  action  is  not  commenced within  six  months,  may\n\n\"institute and prosecute legal proceedings against  the third\n\nperson  who  is liable  for the  injury or  disease.\"   Id.  \n                                                          \n\n2651(b).  \n\n     The parties direct their  arguments in this case chiefly\n\nat the procedural component  of the statute, section 2651(b).\n\nThe  Holbrooks  argue  that  the  United  States'  motion  to\n\nintervene came too late, because it was not filed until after\n\nthe   Holbrooks'  suit  against   Andersen  was  resolved  by\n\nsettlement.   The United States responds  by pointing to case\n\nlaw  providing  that  the  procedural devices  set  forth  in\n\n                             -4-\n\nsection  2651(b)  are  not exclusive  and  that  a motion  to\n\nintervene may be  filed \"at  any time,\" even  after entry  of\n\njudgment.

Indeed,  the government's\n\nright against  the tortfeasor under  the Recovery Act  is not\n\ndefeated  even by  certain  restrictions that  might bar  the\n\ninjured  person's own recovery.3   There is thus no necessity\n\nfor  the  United  States  to  look  to  the  injured  party's\n\nsettlement for compensation.\n\n     If the United States  wishes to invoke the  Recovery Act\n\nto recover its medical  payments in this case, we  think that\n\nunder  the plain  language  of the  statute  it must  proceed\n\nagainst  Andersen  and  seek  to  establish  Andersen's  tort\n\nliability.   The language of  the statute does  not authorize\n\nthe government to  collect under  the Recovery Act  out of  a\n\nsettlement negotiated  between  the injured  person  and  the\n\ntortfeasor.  Nor  is there any case  law that permits such  a\n\nrecovery  absent  an express  agreement  designating for  the\n\ngovernment a portion of the settlement.\n\n     This  case  does  not  involve  the  peculiar  facts  of\n\nCockerham  v.

See id. at 784.  The  court also\n                                   \n\ndecided  that  on  remand   the  government's  share  of  the\n\nsettlement    should    be    determined     by    \"equitable\n\nconsiderations,\" taking account of any  discounted settlement\n\naccepted by the victim and the litigation costs he had borne.\n\nId. at 787.  The government does not argue that  in this case\n  \n\nthere was  any third-part  beneficiary agreement  between the\n\nHolbrooks and Andersen.\n\n     Rather, the  United States  says that its  present claim\n\nhas  been  misunderstood.    It argues  that  its  attempt to\n\nrecover  from the escrow is not a claim against the Holbrooks\n\nbut  rather,  consistent with  the Recovery  Act, is  a claim\n\nagainst Andersen, which supplied  the funds.  This is  a word\n\ngame  that does  not reflect  the reality  of the  situation:\n\nAndersen has  paid the settlement amount to  the Holbrooks in\n                  \n\nexchange  for  a release  of claims  against  it.   The money\n\nbelongs to the Holbrooks and  their son quite as much  as Mr.\n\n                             -7-\n\nHolbrook's salary paid to him by the Navy belongs  to him and\n\nnot to the Navy which is the source of the funds.\n\n     The  best argument  for the  United States  is based  on\n\npolicy considerations.   Andersen's payment to  the Holbrooks\n\nis not technically  an admission of liability,  Fed. R. Evid.\n\n408, but  in reality the  settlement reflects  a judgment  by\n\nAndersen that there is a risk of liability and that the  case\n\nis worth  that  much  to  settle.   But  to  the  extent  the\n                                                        \n\ntortfeasor  is liable  to  the Holbrooks  under tort  law--an\n\nissue  mooted  by the  settlement--it is  also liable  to the\n\nUnited States for any medical costs paid by the latter.\n\n     Of course the  United States  still has a  right to  sue\n\nindependently and, if it can prove liability, to collect  its\n\nfull  medical expenses  with no  settlement discount  at all.\n\nBut  everyone  knows  that  if  fault  is  debatable and  the\n\ntortfeasor settles  with the  injured party, the  chances for\n\nthe United States to recover may be much reduced.  Any lawyer\n\nwould prefer to try a tort case in which the co-plaintiff  is\n\nan   injured  two-and-a-half-year  old,  especially  where  a\n\nverdict for the child virtually requires an award for the co-\n\nlitigant.\n\n     What is  even more troubling is that  the tortfeasor has\n\nan  incentive in  such  a  case  to  pay  the  injured  party\n\nsomething extra in settlement  precisely in order to uncouple\n\nthe two claims.   Once the United States is  left to litigate\n\n                             -8-\n\non its own, it not only has no sympathetic victim to take the\n\nlead before  the  jury  but  must  bear  its  own  litigation\n\nexpenses.   And, if (as  here) the alleged  tortfeasor has an\n\nindemnity  agreement  with  the  victim,  making  the  latter\n\nresponsible for any award to the United States, the victim or\n\nwitnesses  associated with  the victim  now have  an economic\n\nincentive to minimize the  tortfeasor's fault when the United\n\nStates sues.\n\n     These policy concerns are  not overwhelming:  the United\n\nStates is not without  litigation resources, in this  case it\n\nhas the  benefit  of  much  discovery  already  done  by  the\n\nHolbrooks, and perjury laws  cabin the witnesses'  testimony.\n\nHad  it anticipated  the  problem, Congress  might well  have\n\nprovided  a  legislative  solution  along the  lines  of  the\n\nCockerham case:  The Recovery Act could easily have said that\n         \n\nif the tortfeasor  and victim settle,  the United States  can\n\nclaim for  its  medical costs  an  \"equitable\" share  of  the\n\nsettlement to be determined  by the court.  But  Congress did\n\nnot  to so--it  cannot anticipate  every problem--and  so the\n\nquestion posed  is whether  the courts should  do the  repair\n\nwork themselves.\n\n     The answer here, we think, is  no.  The statute does not\n\nliterally forbid this \"equitable share\" solution, but neither\n\ndo the provisions of this reasonably detailed statute provide\n\nfor any such  recovery against the  victim or the  settlement\n\n                             -9-\n\nfund.   Nor can we  be certain  that Congress  would wish  to\n\nimpose an \"equitable share\" solution; perhaps it might pick a\n\nquite different solution or no solution  at all.  There is no\n\nmagic formula to say when courts should do patch-work repairs\n\nto legislation, but in our view this is not such a  case.  If\n\nCongress wants a  solution, it is best  for it to tailor  its\n\nown.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is reversed.\n                                                   \n\n                             -10-\n</pre>",
