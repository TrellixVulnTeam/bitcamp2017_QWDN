George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Susan E. Taylor, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 11, 2008\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. On June 23, 2006, a jury found\n\nRashaun \"Smoke\" Jones guilty of conspiracy to distribute and\n\npossess with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine base.        Before\n\ntrial the district court, on recommendation of the magistrate\n\njudge, denied Jones's motion to suppress certain evidence seized\n\nfrom his hotel suite.     Jones claims error in this denial.           On\n\nOctober 6, 2006, the sentencing court sentenced Jones to 188\n\nmonths' imprisonment. Jones argues that the sentencing court erred\n\nin calculating the drug quantity that went into his Guidelines\n\nsentence calculation, and in finding him eligible for a two-level\n\nupward adjustment to his base offense level for his role as an\n\norganizer or manager of other criminal actors.           Upon thorough\n\nexamination of the record and the parties' arguments, we affirm\n\nJones's conviction and sentence.\n\n                           I.   Background1\n\n          On   December   29,   2005,   Sgt.   John   O'Malley   of   the\n\nScarborough, Maine, Police Department learned from the manager of\n\nthe TownePlace Suites hotel that an individual named Rashaun Jones\n\nhad checked into Room 318; Room 318 was a suite with two bedrooms,\n\na living room, a kitchenette, and a bathroom.          After running a\n\n\n1\n  \"We recite the facts relating to [Jones's] motion to suppress as\nfound by the district court, consistent with record support.\"\nUnited States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57, 61 n.1 (1st Cir. 2007); see\nalso United States v. Jones, No. 05-84-P-S, 2006 WL 763124 (D. Me.\nMar. 24, 2006) (magistrate judge's recommended factual findings);\nUnited States v. Jones, No. 05-84-P-S, 2006 WL 1071893 (D. Me.\nApr. 21, 2006) (adopting magistrate judge's recommendation).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdatabase check on Jones, Sgt. O'Malley discovered that there was a\n\nwarrant out for his arrest on drug charges, and that the U.S.\n\nMarshals Service (\"USMS\") was responsible for the warrant.                The\n\ndatabase indicated that Jones should be considered armed and\n\ndangerous.\n\n            Sgt. O'Malley contacted the USMS, which informed him that\n\nan arrest team would be assembled.          O'Malley also contacted Drug\n\nEnforcement    Administration     (\"DEA\")    task-force    agents    Steven\n\nThibodeau    and   Paul   Wolf.   Agent   Wolf   had   been   part   of   the\n\ninvestigation that led to Jones's arrest warrant, and he asked Sgt.\n\nO'Malley to meet him at the hotel.           Wolf and O'Malley obtained\n\npasskeys to Rooms 317 and 318. Sgt. O'Malley positioned himself in\n\nRoom 317, while Wolf waited in his car in a nearby parking lot for\n\nthe team of U.S. Marshals and DEA agents to arrive.           Sgt. O'Malley\n\nhad a view of Room 318's door through the peephole in the door of\n\nRoom 317.\n\n            At a certain point, Sgt. O'Malley observed a man and a\n\nwoman leave Room 318 and drive away in a car.                 Sgt. O'Malley\n\nradioed Agent Wolf, who followed the car and observed it circle\n\naround a parking lot, without stopping, before returning to the\n\nhotel.   Sgt. O'Malley saw the man emerge from the car and reenter\n\nRoom 318; shortly thereafter, he heard an exuberant male voice\n\nthrough the wall, counting from one to eight.          Agent Wolf and Sgt.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fO'Malley concluded that a drug transaction had likely taken place\n\nduring the short car ride.\n\n           Agent Wolf then joined Sgt. O'Malley in Room 317.          Sgt.\n\nO'Malley again observed a man and woman exit the room and drive\n\naway in a car.    Officers stopped the car in a nearby parking lot\n\nand questioned its occupants.         The man said he had been sent on a\n\nshort trip to the supermarket to buy cigarettes; he admitted that\n\nJones was indeed one of the persons in Room 318, and that Jones and\n\nthe other occupants were waiting for him to return.       The man's cell\n\nphone began to ring and rang every few minutes thereafter; the\n\nofficers did not allow the man to answer the cell phone.\n\n           In the meantime, several officers had assembled in a\n\nparking   lot   adjacent   to   the   hotel.   This   group   of   officers\n\nincluded, among others, task-force agents Gregory Boucher, Stephen\n\nWelsh, and Greg Bunch, and Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal John Cooper.\n\nConcerned that the man's failure to answer his cell phone or return\n\nto the hotel promptly would raise Jones's suspicions, Agent Wolf\n\nand Marshal Cooper decided to enter Room 318.          Using the passkey\n\nprovided by the hotel manager, a six-member team opened Room 318's\n\ndoor without knocking, entered with weapons drawn, and shouted,\n\n\"Police!\" A number of additional officers followed closely behind.\n\n           The officers found four men inside and handcuffed them.\n\nSeveral of the officers also saw marijuana in plain view on a\n\nliving room table, and smelled marijuana smoke in the air.           Agent\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fWelsh detained and handcuffed a man sitting on the living room\n\ncouch who identified himself as Jones.         Jones was then placed into\n\none of the bedrooms with Agents Boucher and Bunch.          Boucher read\n\nJones his Miranda rights from a standard DEA \"rights card,\" pausing\n\nperiodically to ask Jones if he understood. Jones responded in the\n\naffirmative.    Jones did not appear nervous or intoxicated.        Agent\n\nBoucher asked Jones if the officers could search the suite, but did\n\nnot tell him he had the right to refuse consent; Jones responded\n\nthat they could perform the search.\n\n           During this period, Marshal Cooper took one of the other\n\nindividuals from the bathroom, where he had been temporarily\n\ndetained   on   the   floor,   to   the    kitchenette.   Marshal   Cooper\n\ntestified that, before placing the detainee in the kitchenette, he\n\nconducted what he termed a \"security sweep\" to make sure there were\n\nno weapons within the detainee's reach.           While looking inside a\n\nkitchen cabinet, Marshal Cooper discovered a rice box without a\n\nlid.   He looked inside and saw what appeared to be packages\n\ncontaining drugs of some kind.       Marshal Cooper also saw pills in a\n\nbaggie on a shelf in the cabinet, but did not seize these or the\n\ndrugs in the rice box.    Marshal Cooper then decided it would not be\n\na good idea to leave the detainee there, and instead seated him on\n\nthe closed toilet lid in the bathroom.             Sometime later, Agent\n\nWelsh, who had left Room 318 briefly and taken one of the other\n\ndetainees into Room 317 for questioning, returned to Room 318 and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fconducted a search of the kitchenette.      Agent Welsh found and\n\nseized the rice box and the baggie; the baggie contained ecstacy\n\nand the rice box contained heroin.\n\n          A grand jury indicted Jones on one count of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or\n\nmore of a mixture or substance containing heroin, and a mixture or\n\nsubstance containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1) and 846.    Jones moved to suppress the fruits of the\n\nsearch of Room 318, claiming it was illegal because the officers\n\nentered the room without knocking and announcing their presence,\n\nbecause any consent to search given by him was not knowing and\n\nvoluntary, and because Marshal Cooper's search of the kitchen\n\ncabinet was not incident to a lawful arrest or part of a protective\n\nsweep. After a hearing at which several of the officers testified,\n\nthe magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the motion to\n\nsuppress be denied.     He reasoned that (1) exigent circumstances\n\njustified the no-knock entry into Room 318; (2) Jones freely and\n\nvoluntarily consented to the search of Room 318; and (3) Marshal\n\nCooper's discovery of the heroin and ecstacy occurred after Jones\n\nhad given his consent, and was lawful in any event as part of a\n\nprotective sweep.     Over Jones's objection, the district court\n\nadopted the recommendation. Jones again objected at trial when the\n\nitems seized from Room 318 were introduced into evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f           At trial, the Government called a number of witnesses.\n\nAccording to the testimony presented, Jones would acquire heroin,\n\ncocaine, and cocaine base (a.k.a. \"crack\") from a supplier in New\n\nYork.   Evidence was also presented showing that Jones coordinated\n\nthe distribution of these drugs to consumers in southern Maine\n\nthrough a number of sellers, including most importantly Nick Foster\n\nand John Thomas.     On June 23, 2006, the jury convicted Jones as\n\ncharged in the indictment.\n\n           In the Presentence Report (\"PSR\"), the probation officer\n\ncalculated Jones's Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") to be 188 to\n\n235 months.     The PSR took into account the quantum of different\n\ndrugs seized during the search of Room 318 and from Jones's\n\ncoconspirators    and    customers,     and   that     which    coconspirators\n\nadmitted   to   having   distributed     on   behalf    of     the   conspiracy.\n\nUltimately, the PSR attributed to Jones 3,658 grams of heroin, 25.8\n\ngrams of crack cocaine, and 0.8 grams of powder cocaine, for a\n\ntotal of 4,174.16 kilograms of marijuana equivalent.                   This put\n\nJones's base offense level at thirty-four.             See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\n\n(c)(3).    The PSR also determined that Jones had supervised two of\n\nthe   coconspirators     --   Foster    and   Thomas    --     and   accordingly\n\nrecommended a two-level upward adjustment.              See id. § 3B1.1(c).\n\nOver Jones's objection, the sentencing court adopted the PSR's\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\frecommendations.2        After   explaining   its   reasoning,   the   court\n\nsentenced Jones at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range to\n\n188 months' imprisonment.        Jones appealed.\n\n                             II.    Discussion\n\n          A.   The Motion to Suppress\n\n          Jones     argues   that    the   district   court   should   have\n\nsuppressed the fruits of the search of Room 318, raising the same\n\nthree challenges he raised before the magistrate judge.                After\n\nnoting the standard of review, we address these challenges in turn.\n\n                    1.   Standard of Review\n\n          When considering challenges to a district court's denial\n\nof a motion to suppress, we ordinarily review findings of fact for\n\nclear error and conclusions of law de novo.             United States v.\n\nMeada, 408 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2005).          Under clear error review,\n\n\"we may reverse only if the record, read as a whole, gives rise to\n\na 'strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.'\"            C.G.\n\nex rel. A.S. v. Five Town Cmty. Sch. Dist., 513 F.3d 279, 285 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083,\n\n1087 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n                    2.   The No-Knock Entry\n\n          Renters of hotel rooms generally benefit from the same\n\nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and\n\n\n2\n   The sentencing judge was not the same as the judge presiding\nover pretrial and trial proceedings.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fseizures as they would if they were at home.                 See United States v.\n\nRengifo, 858 F.2d 800, 805 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing Stoner v.\n\nCalifornia, 376 U.S. 483, 486-87 (1964)).3                   While police acting\n\npursuant to a warrant must ordinarily knock and announce their\n\npresence before entering a dwelling to which Fourth Amendment\n\nprotections apply, see United States v. Hawkins, 139 F.3d 29, 32\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), a \"no-knock\" entry will be deemed reasonable if\n\nthe   police   \"have     a    reasonable      suspicion      that     knocking   and\n\nannouncing their presence, under the particular circumstances,\n\nwould   be   dangerous       or   futile,   or   that   it    would    inhibit   the\n\neffective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the\n\ndestruction of evidence.\" United States v. Boulanger, 444 F.3d 76,\n\n81 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385,\n\n394 (1997)).\n\n             Importantly, however, the Supreme Court has recently\n\nclarified that even if the police violate the Fourth Amendment by\n\nfailing to knock and announce their presence in circumstances in\n\nwhich a no-knock entry is unwarranted, such violation, standing\n\nalone, will not compel the exclusion of evidence seized as a result\n\nof their entry into the dwelling.           See Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S.\n\n\n3\n  We assume, as did the district court, that Jones was entitled to\nthe protections of the Fourth Amendment while in Room 318. He had\nrented the suite, in his name, for a three-week stay. Moreover,\nthe mere fact that the hotel manager gave the officers a keycard to\nenter Room 318, thereby manifesting her consent for officers to\nenter the suite, did not divest Jones of his reasonable expectation\nof privacy. See Stoner, 376 U.S. at 490.\n\n                                        -9-\n\f586, 594 (2006).     In the wake of Hudson, we have recognized the\n\nabsence of an exclusionary rule for knock-and-announce violations,\n\nprovided the police have a valid arrest warrant or some other valid\n\ngrant of authority to enter the target's residence, and reason to\n\nbelieve the target is inside.   See United States v. Pelletier, 469\n\nF.3d 194, 199 (1st Cir. 2006) (also noting that, \"[g]enerally\n\nspeaking, this principle extends to the target's hotel or motel\n\nroom\").\n\n            The district court's decision denying Jones's motion to\n\nsuppress, which predates both Hudson and Pelletier, addresses the\n\nmerits of Jones's challenge to the no-knock entry, ultimately\n\nfinding the entry justified because of the risk to the officers'\n\nsafety and that drug evidence might be destroyed.        In light of\n\nHudson and Pelletier, we need not go so far.        The remedy Jones\n\nseeks is the suppression of the fruits of the search of Room 318.\n\nHe does not challenge the validity of the arrest warrant against\n\nhim, nor the officers' professed belief that he was in Room 318 at\n\nthe time.    In any event, we find that such belief was objectively\n\nreasonable based on the following evidence credited by the district\n\ncourt:    the hotel manager told officers that Jones had rented Room\n\n318 for a three-week period, and the man detained in the parking\n\nlot told officers that Jones was then inside the suite.   The arrest\n\nwarrant and the reasonable belief Jones was inside Room 318 gave\n\nthe officers the authority to enter.    See id. (citing Payton v. New\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fYork, 445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980)).             Even if they violated the Fourth\n\nAmendment by failing to knock and announce their presence before\n\ngoing in, the motion to suppress was not the appropriate vehicle\n\nfor Jones to obtain the remedy he seeks.                 See Hudson, 547 U.S. at\n\n597-99 (suggesting other avenues of relief).                     We thus proceed to\n\nJones's next assignment of error.\n\n                        3.   The Validity and Scope of Jones's Consent\n\n            It is axiomatic that officers must ordinarily procure a\n\nwarrant    before       searching   a     locale    to   which     Fourth   Amendment\n\nprotections apply.           See Groh v. Ramírez, 540 U.S. 551, 558-59\n\n(2004). Several exceptions to this requirement exist, however, one\n\nof which is valid consent to search by someone having authority to\n\ngive consent.       See United States v. Pérez-Montañez, 202 F.3d 434,\n\n438 (1st Cir. 2000).            In order for consent to be valid, the\n\nGovernment must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nconsenting party gave it freely and voluntarily.                    United States v.\n\nMarshall, 348 F.3d 281, 285-86 (1st Cir. 2003).                    The assessment of\n\nwhether consent is free and voluntary is a question of fact that\n\nrequires an examination of the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding       the    relevant    transaction         between    law-enforcement\n\nauthorities and the consenting party.               Pérez-Montañez, 202 F.3d at\n\n438.      The    district    court's      factual    findings      relating   to   the\n\nvalidity    of    the    consent    are    reviewed      for   clear   error.      See\n\nMarshall, 348 F.3d at 284.\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f              Although the officers in this case had a valid warrant to\n\narrest Jones, they did not have a warrant to search Room 318 when\n\nthey decided to enter the suite.           The district court found the\n\nsearch   of    Room   318   constitutionally   permissible   nonetheless,\n\nbecause Jones had given his consent freely and voluntarily.        Agent\n\nBoucher testified that he advised Jones of his Miranda rights, and\n\nthat Jones acknowledged that he understood them. See United States\n\nv. Kimball, 741 F.2d 471, 474 (1st Cir. 1984) (giving of Miranda\n\nrights a factor to consider in totality of circumstances).         Agent\n\nBoucher also testified that Jones did not appear to be intoxicated,\n\nthat he seemed to understand what was going on, and that neither\n\nAgent Boucher nor any other officer extracted Jones's consent\n\nthrough threats or promises.4      See Pérez-Montañez, 202 F.3d at 438\n\n(threats, intimidation, and coercion are factors to consider in an\n\nanalysis of the totality of the circumstances). The district court\n\nfound this testimony to be a credible account of what actually\n\nhappened.      We see no reason to disagree.\n\n              Jones argues, however, that three additional factors\n\nshould lead us to overturn the district court's finding that his\n\n\n4\n   Agent Wolf, who took over the questioning after Agent Boucher,\nalso testified that Jones was calm and did not seem to be under the\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs.\n\n   We give no weight to Jones's halfhearted intimation that he may\nhave been under the influence of marijuana since the officers, upon\nentering Room 318, discovered evidence of marijuana having recently\nbeen smoked by at least one of the suite's several occupants. See\nUnited States v. Luciano, 329 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fconsent was free and voluntary. First, he claims his consent could\n\nnot have been free or voluntary because neither Agent Boucher nor\n\nany other officer advised him of his right not to cooperate.              This\n\nargument is unavailing.       We have repeatedly held that the failure\n\nto advise a defendant of his right to refuse consent does not\n\nautomatically render such consent invalid.          See id. at 438 (citing\n\nSchneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 234 (1973)); United States\n\nv. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 555 (1st Cir. 1993); see also United\n\nStates v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 206-07 (2002) (no presumption of\n\ninvalidity where person consents without explicit notification of\n\nright to refuse).       In the relatively calm environment of the\n\nbedroom in which Jones had been placed, Agent Boucher read Jones\n\nhis Miranda rights, and Jones acknowledged that he understood each\n\nof them, agreed to cooperate, and was not apparently under the\n\ninfluence.   The district court did not clearly err in finding that\n\nJones appreciated the significance of giving consent despite the\n\nofficers' failure to advise him of his right to withhold such\n\nconsent.\n\n            Second, Jones contends that, while none of the officers\n\napplied    overt   coercion    on   him    to   induce   his   consent,   the\n\ncircumstances should be regarded as inherently coercive:            some ten\n\nto fifteen government agents, guns drawn, entered his hotel suite\n\nwithout knocking, handcuffed him, placed him in a separate room,\n\nand proceeded to interrogate him.           See Barnett, 989 F.2d at 555\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f(one factor to be considered in totality of circumstances is\n\n\"whether permission to search was obtained by coercive means or\n\nunder inherently coercive circumstances\").                         This argument also\n\nfails.       As   we    have   observed,        \"[a]lthough       sensitivity       to    the\n\nheightened        possibility      of     coercion         is    appropriate       when    a\n\ndefendant's consent is obtained during custody, 'custody alone has\n\nnever been enough in itself to demonstrate . . . coerced . . .\n\nconsent to search.'\"            Id. (citation omitted) (second and third\n\nalterations in original) (quoting United States v. Watson, 423 U.S.\n\n411,   424    (1976)).         Upon   the    officers'          entry,    Jones    and    his\n\nassociates surrendered to them without a struggle and no shots were\n\nfired.   Jones was then handcuffed and made to sit on the edge of a\n\nbed.     There     is    no    indication       in   the    record       that    Jones    was\n\nmistreated or placed in an uncomfortable position, or that Agent\n\nBoucher, Agent Bunch, or anyone else brandished a weapon, made\n\nthreatening       gestures,      or     spoke    threatening        words       during    the\n\ninterrogation.          Considering the several countervailing factors\n\noutlined above, we find that the circumstances here were not so\n\ninherently coercive as to render Jones's consent unknowing or\n\ninvoluntary, even when considered together with the officers'\n\nfailure to advise Jones of his right to refuse consent.\n\n             Third, Jones claims that any valid consent he may have\n\ngiven was confined to the bedroom in which he had been placed, and\n\ndid not extend to the kitchenette or the other rooms of the hotel\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fsuite.   A search justified by consent will be deemed reasonable as\n\nlong as it does not exceed the scope of the consent given.             See\n\nUnited States v. Turner, 169 F.3d 84, 87 (1st Cir. 1999).             When\n\ndetermining the scope of consent, we apply a test of objective\n\nreasonableness:    \"'[W]hat would the typical reasonable person have\n\nunderstood by the exchange between the officer and the subject?'\"\n\nUnited States v. Meléndez, 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting\n\nFlorida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991)).                This inquiry\n\nrequires   an   examination   of    the    \"overall   context,\"   including\n\n\"contemporaneous police statements and actions.\"          Turner, 169 F.3d\n\nat 87.   As in past cases, we state no view on whether the scope of\n\na given instance of consent is reviewed de novo or merely for clear\n\nerror, as in the circumstances of the present case we would affirm\n\nunder either standard.        See Marshall, 348 F.3d at 286 (citing\n\nMeléndez, 301 F.3d at 32 (noting the split in our sister circuits\n\non this question)); Turner, 169 F.3d at 87 n.4 (same).\n\n           Agent Boucher testified that he asked Jones for consent\n\nto search the \"motel room.\"        Jones responded with a simple \"yes.\"\n\nAs noted above, Room 318 was actually a suite with two bedrooms, a\n\nkitchenette, a living room, and a bathroom. Although Agent Boucher\n\ndid not specify which of these rooms he was seeking consent to\n\nsearch, Jones did not expressly confine his consent to the bedroom.\n\nThe district court found that Agent Boucher had \"made it reasonably\n\nclear that he sought consent to search the entire suite, not just\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe bedroom.\"    Jones, 2006 WL 763124, at *11 n.11.         We agree.    An\n\nobjective observer of the transaction between Agent Boucher and\n\nJones would have understood the term \"motel room\" to encompass the\n\nwhole of Room 318, and not just the bedroom.            This is especially\n\ntrue considering that the officers had already viewed marijuana on\n\nthe living room table, in close proximity to the couch on which\n\nJones was sitting when they entered, and smelled marijuana smoke in\n\nthe air; it is reasonable to expect that Jones was aware that the\n\nofficers noticed this evidence of recent drug use.                  In this\n\ncontext,   a   reasonable   person    in    Jones's   position   would   have\n\nregarded Agent Boucher as requesting consent to search the whole\n\nsuite for additional drugs.\n\n           As such, the district court did not err in concluding\n\nthat Jones's consent extended to the entire suite, and it was not\n\nunreasonable for Agent Boucher and the other officers to conduct a\n\nsearch of the other rooms for drugs, including the kitchen cabinet.\n\nCf. Meléndez, 301 F.3d at 33 (dismantling and looking inside a\n\nspeaker did not exceed the scope of consent to search a room, as\n\n\"[t]he speaker was located in the area that [the consenting party]\n\nhad allowed the officers to search, and was a place in which the\n\nofficers could have reasonably suspected drugs to be hidden\").\n\nHaving dismissed Jones's challenge to his consent to search, we\n\nturn to his third and final assignment of error with respect to the\n\ndenial of his suppression motion.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f                      4. Marshal Cooper's Search of the Kitchen Cabinet\n\n            Jones argues that Marshal Cooper's search of the kitchen\n\ncabinet,    and     consequent   discovery       of   drugs   therein,    was   not\n\njustified as a protective sweep or under any other exception to the\n\nwarrant requirement.       The district court examined the timeline as\n\nestablished through the testimony of the various officers at the\n\nsuppression hearing, and found that the Government had established\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that Marshal Cooper actually\n\ndiscovered the drugs in the kitchen cabinet after Jones had given\n\nhis consent to Agent Boucher.             We have reviewed the officers'\n\ntestimony     and    conclude    that     this    finding     was   not   clearly\n\nerroneous.5    We briefly explain.\n\n            Agent Welsh and Marshal Cooper each testified that when\n\nthey entered Room 318, they saw marijuana in plain view on the\n\nliving room table.         Agent Welsh testified that he immediately\n\ndetained and handcuffed Jones, who was sitting on the living room\n\ncouch.     Jones was promptly taken into the bedroom, where Agent\n\nBoucher began the process of questioning him; according to Agent\n\nBoucher, the point at which Jones gave his consent was some ten to\n\nfifteen minutes after the officers' initial entry into Room 318.\n\nAgent Boucher then left the room and \"advised a couple of the\n\n\n\n5\n   With respect to the district court's analysis of the timing of\nthe consent, we apply the usual standard of review for factual\nfindings in a decision denying a motion to suppress -- that is,\nclear error review. See Marshall, 348 F.3d at 284.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fagents that we in fact had consent from Mr. Jones to search the\n\nmotel room.\"   Agent Wolf testified that he was one of those whom\n\nAgent Boucher informed.\n\n          According to Marshal Cooper, during this period the other\n\nofficers detained Jones's associates and performed a quick scan of\n\nthe suite to make sure there were no hidden persons.       Marshal\n\nCooper took responsibility for one of the detainees and initially\n\nhad him handcuffed and lying on the bathroom floor. Marshal Cooper\n\ntestified that, at this point, it occurred to him to announce to\n\nthe other officers that he had seen marijuana on the living room\n\ntable, in case they wanted to seek a search warrant.       Marshal\n\nCooper continued:   \"One of the officers told me at that point that\n\nit's okay, they already had consent.\"    Sometime soon thereafter,\n\nwhen Marshal Cooper was satisfied that the suite had been secured,\n\nhe attempted to relocate the detainee to the kitchenette, where he\n\nsearched the cabinet and found what he believed to be drugs.   The\n\ndistrict court credited Marshal Cooper's testimony and found that\n\nthe search occurred after Jones gave his consent.6\n\n          We see nothing in the record that would lead us to\n\nquarrel with this finding, much less to reach a \"strong, unyielding\n\n\n\n6\n   At a later point in Marshal Cooper's testimony, the Government\nasked again whether Marshal Cooper had learned of Jones's consent\nbefore attempting to relocate the detainee to the kitchenette.\nMarshal Cooper responded, \"I'm not sure,\" but immediately clarified\nthat \"I would think it was after.\" The district court obviously\ncredited this clarification. It did not clearly err in doing so.\n\n                               -18-\n\fbelief that a mistake has been made,\" as is required under the\n\napplicable standard of review.     C.G. ex rel. A.S., 513 F.3d at 284\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).       Because Marshal\n\nCooper's search of the kitchen cabinet occurred after Jones gave\n\nconsent and -- as affirmed above -- the scope of the consent\n\nextended to the kitchen cabinet, it was constitutionally valid.\n\nGiven this conclusion, we need not state a view on the district\n\ncourt's alternative ruling that the search was lawful in any event\n\nby virtue of the \"independent source\" doctrine.\n\n            Finding no infirmity in the denial of Jones's suppression\n\nmotion, we proceed to examine the challenges relating to his\n\nsentence.\n\n            B.   Sentencing\n\n            Jones raises two challenges to his sentence.      First, he\n\ncontends that the sentencing court erred in its calculation of the\n\nquantity of drugs attributable to him, which accounted for a base\n\noffense level of thirty-four. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3). Second,\n\nhe argues that the sentencing court erred in applying a further\n\ntwo-level upward adjustment to his base offense level for his role\n\nas   an   organizer,   leader,   manager,   or   supervisor   of   other\n\nparticipants in the drug-selling enterprise.       See id. § 3B1.1(c).\n\nWe again note the applicable standard of review, and then consider\n\nthese two challenges seriatim.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f                   1.    Standard of Review\n\n           A sentencing court's findings of fact -- including its\n\ncalculation of drug quantity -- are reviewed for clear error;\n\nquestions of law involved in sentencing determinations are reviewed\n\nde novo.   United States v. Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d 459, 463 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); United States v. Laboy, 351 F.3d 578, 582, 585 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    \"A question about whether the evidence is sufficient\n\nto support a particular guideline determination is a question of\n\nlaw and, therefore, engenders de novo review.\"       Ramos-Paulino, 488\n\nF.3d at 463.\n\n                   2.    The Drug-Quantity Calculation\n\n           In determining drug quantity for purposes of calculating\n\na   defendant's   base   offense   level   under   the   Guidelines,   the\n\nsentencing court may attribute to the defendant \"all reasonably\n\nforeseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of\n\nthe criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3\n\ncmt. n.2(ii).      \"Thus, a drug dealer who engages in criminal\n\nactivity with others to further their collective interests may be\n\nheld liable for the quantities of drugs sold by his partners, if\n\nthose sales were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the\n\njointly undertaken actions.\"       Laboy, 351 F.3d at 582.        If the\n\nquantity of drugs actually seized does not reflect the full scale\n\nof the offense, the sentencing court may make a reasonable estimate\n\nof the total quantity involved.       See id. at 584 (citing U.S.S.G.\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f§ 2D1.1 cmt. n.12).     The Government must prove drug quantity by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.         Id. at 582.      We will uphold the\n\nsentencing court's estimate as long as it is reasoned and finds\n\nsupport in the record.      See id. at 583-84.\n\n          In adopting the PSR's recommendation, the sentencing\n\ncourt found Jones responsible for 4,174.16 kilograms of marijuana\n\nequivalent.7     This figure included 0.8 grams of powder cocaine\n\n(0.16 kilograms of marijuana equivalent) seized from Room 318, and\n\n25.8 grams of crack cocaine (516 kilograms of marijuana equivalent)\n\nestimated from what coconspirator Thomas told federal agents he had\n\nintroduced     into   the   southern   Maine   market    as   part   of   the\n\nconspiracy.8\n\n          The PSR estimated the remaining amount as 3,658 grams of\n\nheroin (3,658 kilograms of marijuana equivalent).             This quantity\n\n\n7\n    As there are different controlled substances involved, the\nprobation office converted each of the drugs into its \"marijuana\nequivalent,\" added the quantities, and looked up the total in the\ndrug quantity table in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\ncmt. n.10(B).\n8\n  Thomas told agents that, on at least three occasions, he went to\nNew Jersey and brought back \"hundreds\" of vials of crack cocaine to\nMaine. The PSR estimated conservatively that Thomas had made three\ntrips and brought back 100 vials per trip, at an average of 0.086\ngrams of crack cocaine per vial, for a total of 25.8 grams.\n\n    For unknown reasons, the PSR did not recommend that Jones's\nsentence reflect other drugs it determined had been seized from\nFoster, Thomas, customers including a confidential informant, and\nfrom Room 318, as well as a quantity of heroin a customer named\nWilliam Zinn admitted to having purchased from Jones.       These\namounted to 2.909 additional grams of crack cocaine and 15.512\ngrams of heroin.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fwas based mainly on the trial testimony of Foster that he received\n\nheroin from Jones and Thomas and distributed twenty bricks of\n\nheroin per week for twelve weeks from April to June 2005, and sixty\n\nbricks per week for twelve additional weeks from July to September\n\n2005, until Foster was arrested.                  A brick of heroin consists of\n\nfifty bags at 0.059 grams each,                   for a total of 2,832 grams\n\ndistributed     by    Foster.        The    PSR    then    determined     that    Jones\n\ncontinued in the conspiracy after the arrests of Foster and Thomas\n\non September 19, 2005, until Jones's own arrest at the TownePlace\n\nSuites     fourteen    weeks    later      on   December    29,   2005.      The   PSR\n\ncontinued:\n\n             However, as there is no evidence of the\n             quantities distributed during this time frame\n             and the impact . . . the arrest of [Jones's]\n             co-defendant's [sic] had on his ability to\n             continue to distribute large amounts (60\n             bricks a week), the Probation Office has used\n             the conservative amount of 20 bricks a week.\n\nTwenty bricks per week for the fourteen weeks from September 19,\n\n2005, to December 29, 2005, produced a total of 826 grams.                       Added\n\nto   the    estimate    of     the   amount       Foster    distributed     for    the\n\nconspiracy, the total came to 3,658 grams of heroin, or 3,658\n\nkilograms of marijuana equivalent.\n\n             This amount added to the 516.16 kilograms of marijuana\n\nequivalent in crack and powder cocaine produced a grand total of\n\n4,174.16 kilograms of marijuana equivalent.                  The sentencing court\n\nfound the facts presented in the PSR to be credible, and opined\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fthat \"in all likelihood the amounts were probably greater than that\n\nset forth in the [PSR] and I find those quantities.\"            In other\n\nwords, the sentencing court found Jones responsible for 4,174.16\n\nkilograms.\n\n           In challenging this finding, Jones argues that the real\n\nweight   attributable   to   him   should   be   2,176.20   kilograms   of\n\nmarijuana equivalent; he explained how he reached this figure in\n\nhis brief and again at oral argument.       Jones also alleges that the\n\n826 grams the PSR attributed to him for September to December 2005\n\nis \"pure speculation.\"       Jones's estimated quantity -- 2,176.20\n\nkilograms -- would result in a base offense level of thirty-two.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4).\n\n           Yet even if we assume that Jones has provided us and the\n\nsentencing court with a plausible estimate of the drug quantity\n\nattributable to him, he cannot prevail.          This is because we find\n\nthe PSR's estimate also to be generally plausible and that it\n\nenjoys a preponderance of record support primarily in the trial\n\ntestimony of Foster. The sentencing court was therefore within its\n\ndiscretion when it chose the PSR's estimate over Jones's estimate.\n\nSee United States v. Marks, 365 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           We say \"generally\" plausible because we do agree with\n\nJones in one respect.     We are dissatisfied with the PSR's poorly\n\nreasoned conclusion that Jones was responsible for 826 grams of\n\nheroin (826 kilograms of marijuana equivalent) distributed between\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fSeptember and December 2005, a finding for which the PSR conceded\n\n\"there is no evidence\" but that the sentencing court nonetheless\n\nadopted.    Yet we need not decide whether such adoption was clearly\n\nerroneous, because any error that may have occurred was harmless.\n\nThe threshold quantity that triggers a base offense level of\n\nthirty-four -- that which Jones received -- is 3,000 kilograms of\n\nmarijuana   equivalent.     U.S.S.G.    §   2D1.1(c)(3).     Even   if   we\n\nsubtracted 826 from 4,174.16, the total found by the sentencing\n\ncourt, we would still be left with 3,321.16 kilograms, and Jones\n\nwould receive the same base offense level.        Cf. United States v.\n\nHernández, 218 F.3d 58, 71 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding determination\n\nof drug quantity harmless, even if erroneous, as it did not affect\n\ndefendant's sentence).     We move on to Jones's final assignment of\n\nerror.\n\n                   3.   The § 3B1.1(c) Two-Level Increase\n\n            The Guidelines provide for an upward adjustment to a\n\ndefendant's base offense level due to the relative importance of\n\nhis role in the offense.    United States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (en banc) (citing U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c)).         To qualify for\n\na § 3B1.1(c) upward adjustment, the evidence must show that the\n\ndefendant \"exercised control over, organized, or was otherwise\n\nresponsible for superintending the activities of\" at least one\n\nother participant in a criminal activity on at least one occasion.\n\nUnited States v. García-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f(quoting Cruz, 120 F.3d at 3); accord United States v. Voccola, 99\n\nF.3d   37,   44    (1st   Cir.   1996)    (single   directed    transaction   is\n\nenough).     While this showing is not a particularly onerous one to\n\nmake, it is not enough that the defendant merely controlled,\n\norganized,    or    managed      criminal   activities,   but     must   instead\n\ncontrol, organize, or manage criminal actors.             Ramos-Paulino, 488\n\nF.3d at 464.\n\n             After hearing the parties' arguments, the sentencing\n\ncourt found that the Government had satisfied the requirements of\n\n§ 3B1.1(c) by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n             I've taken into account the evidence in this\n             case including the nature of this offense, the\n             fact that [Jones] was directing his runners,\n             the fact that I believe he was given a greater\n             share   of  the   monies   involved  in   this\n             conspiracy, the fact that he was the key\n             planner and organizer of the conspiracy, the\n             others were basically runners for him, and his\n             degree of control and authority and I think\n             the two level enhancement is modest in this\n             case based on my understanding of the evidence\n             . . . .\n\nJones takes issue with this determination.             He argues that, while\n\nhe supplied his alleged accomplices with drugs to sell, there was\n\nno evidence presented at trial to show that he recruited any of\n\nthem, that he collected a disproportionate share of the proceeds of\n\nthe drug-selling venture, or that he exercised any control or\n\nauthority over the accomplices' activities.                    Instead, a drug\n\nsupplier in New York oversaw the venture.\n\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\f            This argument is unavailing.     There is an abundance of\n\nevidence in the record -- including in the trial testimony of\n\nFoster and several federal agents -- to support the sentencing\n\ncourt's finding that Jones coordinated the actions of a number of\n\ndrug sellers including, most importantly, Thomas and Foster. Jones\n\nessentially controlled the supply of the drugs to these persons,\n\nand determined to a considerable extent when and where they would\n\nmake deliveries.        This is more than sufficient to satisfy the\n\nGovernment's modest burden under § 3B1.1(c).      In spite of Jones's\n\nassertions to the contrary, § 3B1.1(c) does not require a showing\n\nthat he recruited accomplices or received a disproportionate share\n\nof the proceeds. The sentencing court therefore committed no error\n\nin finding Jones to be an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\n\nof at least one other criminal actor, and the two-level enhancement\n\nwas justified.    Jones's sentence stands.\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n            For these reasons, we affirm Jones's conviction and\n\nsentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f",

On June 23, 2006, a jury found\n\nRashaun \"Smoke\" Jones guilty of conspiracy to distribute and\n\npossess with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine base.        Before\n\ntrial the district court, on recommendation of the magistrate\n\njudge, denied Jones's motion to suppress certain evidence seized\n\nfrom his hotel suite.     Jones claims error in this denial.           On\n\nOctober 6, 2006, the sentencing court sentenced Jones to 188\n\nmonths' imprisonment. Jones argues that the sentencing court erred\n\nin calculating the drug quantity that went into his Guidelines\n\nsentence calculation, and in finding him eligible for a two-level\n\nupward adjustment to his base offense level for his role as an\n\norganizer or manager of other criminal actors.

O'Malley discovered that there was a\n\nwarrant out for his arrest on drug charges, and that the U.S.\n\nMarshals Service (\"USMS\") was responsible for the warrant.                The\n\ndatabase indicated that Jones should be considered armed and\n\ndangerous.\n\n            Sgt. O'Malley contacted the USMS, which informed him that\n\nan arrest team would be assembled.          O'Malley also contacted Drug\n\nEnforcement    Administration     (\"DEA\")    task-force    agents    Steven\n\nThibodeau    and   Paul   Wolf.   Agent   Wolf   had   been   part   of   the\n\ninvestigation that led to Jones's arrest warrant, and he asked Sgt.\n\nO'Malley to meet him at the hotel.           Wolf and O'Malley obtained\n\npasskeys to Rooms 317 and 318. Sgt. O'Malley positioned himself in\n\nRoom 317, while Wolf waited in his car in a nearby parking lot for\n\nthe team of U.S. Marshals and DEA agents to arrive.           Sgt. O'Malley\n\nhad a view of Room 318's door through the peephole in the door of\n\nRoom 317.\n\n            At a certain point, Sgt. O'Malley observed a man and a\n\nwoman leave Room 318 and drive away in a car.                 Sgt. O'Malley\n\nradioed Agent Wolf, who followed the car and observed it circle\n\naround a parking lot, without stopping, before returning to the\n\nhotel.   Sgt. O'Malley saw the man emerge from the car and reenter\n\nRoom 318; shortly thereafter, he heard an exuberant male voice\n\nthrough the wall, counting from one to eight.          Agent Wolf and Sgt.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fO'Malley concluded that a drug transaction had likely taken place\n\nduring the short car ride.\n\n           Agent Wolf then joined Sgt. O'Malley in Room 317.          Sgt.\n\nO'Malley again observed a man and woman exit the room and drive\n\naway in a car.    Officers stopped the car in a nearby parking lot\n\nand questioned its occupants.         The man said he had been sent on a\n\nshort trip to the supermarket to buy cigarettes; he admitted that\n\nJones was indeed one of the persons in Room 318, and that Jones and\n\nthe other occupants were waiting for him to return.       The man's cell\n\nphone began to ring and rang every few minutes thereafter; the\n\nofficers did not allow the man to answer the cell phone.\n\n           In the meantime, several officers had assembled in a\n\nparking   lot   adjacent   to   the   hotel.   This   group   of   officers\n\nincluded, among others, task-force agents Gregory Boucher, Stephen\n\nWelsh, and Greg Bunch, and Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal John Cooper.\n\nConcerned that the man's failure to answer his cell phone or return\n\nto the hotel promptly would raise Jones's suspicions, Agent Wolf\n\nand Marshal Cooper decided to enter Room 318.          Using the passkey\n\nprovided by the hotel manager, a six-member team opened Room 318's\n\ndoor without knocking, entered with weapons drawn, and shouted,\n\n\"Police!\" A number of additional officers followed closely behind.\n\n           The officers found four men inside and handcuffed them.\n\nSeveral of the officers also saw marijuana in plain view on a\n\nliving room table, and smelled marijuana smoke in the air.           Agent\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fWelsh detained and handcuffed a man sitting on the living room\n\ncouch who identified himself as Jones.         Jones was then placed into\n\none of the bedrooms with Agents Boucher and Bunch.          Boucher read\n\nJones his Miranda rights from a standard DEA \"rights card,\" pausing\n\nperiodically to ask Jones if he understood. Jones responded in the\n\naffirmative.    Jones did not appear nervous or intoxicated.        Agent\n\nBoucher asked Jones if the officers could search the suite, but did\n\nnot tell him he had the right to refuse consent; Jones responded\n\nthat they could perform the search.\n\n           During this period, Marshal Cooper took one of the other\n\nindividuals from the bathroom, where he had been temporarily\n\ndetained   on   the   floor,   to   the    kitchenette.   Marshal   Cooper\n\ntestified that, before placing the detainee in the kitchenette, he\n\nconducted what he termed a \"security sweep\" to make sure there were\n\nno weapons within the detainee's reach.           While looking inside a\n\nkitchen cabinet, Marshal Cooper discovered a rice box without a\n\nlid.   He looked inside and saw what appeared to be packages\n\ncontaining drugs of some kind.       Marshal Cooper also saw pills in a\n\nbaggie on a shelf in the cabinet, but did not seize these or the\n\ndrugs in the rice box.    Marshal Cooper then decided it would not be\n\na good idea to leave the detainee there, and instead seated him on\n\nthe closed toilet lid in the bathroom.             Sometime later, Agent\n\nWelsh, who had left Room 318 briefly and taken one of the other\n\ndetainees into Room 317 for questioning, returned to Room 318 and\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fconducted a search of the kitchenette.      Agent Welsh found and\n\nseized the rice box and the baggie; the baggie contained ecstacy\n\nand the rice box contained heroin.\n\n          A grand jury indicted Jones on one count of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or\n\nmore of a mixture or substance containing heroin, and a mixture or\n\nsubstance containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1) and 846.    Jones moved to suppress the fruits of the\n\nsearch of Room 318, claiming it was illegal because the officers\n\nentered the room without knocking and announcing their presence,\n\nbecause any consent to search given by him was not knowing and\n\nvoluntary, and because Marshal Cooper's search of the kitchen\n\ncabinet was not incident to a lawful arrest or part of a protective\n\nsweep. After a hearing at which several of the officers testified,\n\nthe magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the motion to\n\nsuppress be denied.     He reasoned that (1) exigent circumstances\n\njustified the no-knock entry into Room 318; (2) Jones freely and\n\nvoluntarily consented to the search of Room 318; and (3) Marshal\n\nCooper's discovery of the heroin and ecstacy occurred after Jones\n\nhad given his consent, and was lawful in any event as part of a\n\nprotective sweep.     Over Jones's objection, the district court\n\nadopted the recommendation. Jones again objected at trial when the\n\nitems seized from Room 318 were introduced into evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f           At trial, the Government called a number of witnesses.\n\nAccording to the testimony presented, Jones would acquire heroin,\n\ncocaine, and cocaine base (a.k.a. \"crack\") from a supplier in New\n\nYork.   Evidence was also presented showing that Jones coordinated\n\nthe distribution of these drugs to consumers in southern Maine\n\nthrough a number of sellers, including most importantly Nick Foster\n\nand John Thomas.     On June 23, 2006, the jury convicted Jones as\n\ncharged in the indictment.\n\n           In the Presentence Report (\"PSR\"), the probation officer\n\ncalculated Jones's Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") to be 188 to\n\n235 months.     The PSR took into account the quantum of different\n\ndrugs seized during the search of Room 318 and from Jones's\n\ncoconspirators    and    customers,     and   that     which    coconspirators\n\nadmitted   to   having   distributed     on   behalf    of     the   conspiracy.\n\nUltimately, the PSR attributed to Jones 3,658 grams of heroin, 25.8\n\ngrams of crack cocaine, and 0.8 grams of powder cocaine, for a\n\ntotal of 4,174.16 kilograms of marijuana equivalent.                   This put\n\nJones's base offense level at thirty-four.             See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\n\n(c)(3).    The PSR also determined that Jones had supervised two of\n\nthe   coconspirators     --   Foster    and   Thomas    --     and   accordingly\n\nrecommended a two-level upward adjustment.              See id. § 3B1.1(c).\n\nOver Jones's objection, the sentencing court adopted the PSR's\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\frecommendations.2        After   explaining   its   reasoning,   the   court\n\nsentenced Jones at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range to\n\n188 months' imprisonment.        Jones appealed.\n\n                             II.    Discussion\n\n          A.   The Motion to Suppress\n\n          Jones     argues   that    the   district   court   should   have\n\nsuppressed the fruits of the search of Room 318, raising the same\n\nthree challenges he raised before the magistrate judge.                After\n\nnoting the standard of review, we address these challenges in turn.\n\n                    1.

Michigan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"page\">3</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n  We assume, as did the district court, that Jones was entitled to\nthe protections of the Fourth Amendment while in Room 318. He had\nrented the suite, in his name, for a three-week stay. Moreover,\nthe mere fact that the hotel manager gave the officers a keycard to\nenter Room 318, thereby manifesting her consent for officers to\nenter the suite, did not divest Jones of his reasonable expectation\nof privacy. See Stoner, 376 U.S. at 490.\n\n                                        -9-\n\f586, 594 (2006).     In the wake of Hudson, we have recognized the\n\nabsence of an exclusionary rule for knock-and-announce violations,\n\nprovided the police have a valid arrest warrant or some other valid\n\ngrant of authority to enter the target's residence, and reason to\n\nbelieve the target is inside.   See United States v. Pelletier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796023\"><a href=\"/opinion/796023/united-states-v-joseph-pellether/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (1st Cir. 2006) (also noting that, \"[g]enerally\n\nspeaking, this principle extends to the target's hotel or motel\n\nroom\").\n\n            The district court's decision denying Jones's motion to\n\nsuppress, which predates both Hudson and Pelletier, addresses the\n\nmerits of Jones's challenge to the no-knock entry, ultimately\n\nfinding the entry justified because of the risk to the officers'\n\nsafety and that drug evidence might be destroyed.        In light of\n\nHudson and Pelletier, we need not go so far.        The remedy Jones\n\nseeks is the suppression of the fruits of the search of Room 318.\n\nHe does not challenge the validity of the arrest warrant against\n\nhim, nor the officers' professed belief that he was in Room 318 at\n\nthe time.    In any event, we find that such belief was objectively\n\nreasonable based on the following evidence credited by the district\n\ncourt:    the hotel manager told officers that Jones had rented Room\n\n318 for a three-week period, and the man detained in the parking\n\nlot told officers that Jones was then inside the suite.   The arrest\n\nwarrant and the reasonable belief Jones was inside Room 318 gave\n\nthe officers the authority to enter.    See id. (citing Payton v. New\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fYork, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110235\"><a href=\"/opinion/110235/payton-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (1980)).             Even if they violated the Fourth\n\nAmendment by failing to knock and announce their presence before\n\ngoing in, the motion to suppress was not the appropriate vehicle\n\nfor Jones to obtain the remedy he seeks.                 See Hudson, 547 U.S. at\n\n597-99 (suggesting other avenues of relief).                     We thus proceed to\n\nJones's next assignment of error.\n\n                        3.   The Validity and Scope of Jones's Consent\n\n            It is axiomatic that officers must ordinarily procure a\n\nwarrant    before       searching   a     locale    to   which     Fourth   Amendment\n\nprotections apply.           See Groh v. Ramírez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131161\"><a href=\"/opinion/131161/groh-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 558-59\n\n(2004). Several exceptions to this requirement exist, however, one\n\nof which is valid consent to search by someone having authority to\n\ngive consent.       See United States v. Pérez-Montañez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198807\"><a href=\"/opinion/198807/united-states-v-perez-montanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n438 (1st Cir. 2000).            In order for consent to be valid, the\n\nGovernment must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nconsenting party gave it freely and voluntarily.

The assessment of\n\nwhether consent is free and voluntary is a question of fact that\n\nrequires an examination of the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding       the    relevant    transaction         between    law-enforcement\n\nauthorities and the consenting party.

The    district    court's      factual    findings      relating   to   the\n\nvalidity    of    the    consent    are    reviewed      for   clear   error.

The district court found the\n\nsearch   of    Room   318   constitutionally   permissible   nonetheless,\n\nbecause Jones had given his consent freely and voluntarily.        Agent\n\nBoucher testified that he advised Jones of his Miranda rights, and\n\nthat Jones acknowledged that he understood them. See United States\n\nv.

Agent\n\nBoucher also testified that Jones did not appear to be intoxicated,\n\nthat he seemed to understand what was going on, and that neither\n\nAgent Boucher nor any other officer extracted Jones's consent\n\nthrough threats or promises.4      See Pérez-Montañez, 202 F.3d at 438\n\n(threats, intimidation, and coercion are factors to consider in an\n\nanalysis of the totality of the circumstances). The district court\n\nfound this testimony to be a credible account of what actually\n\nhappened.      We see no reason to disagree.\n\n              Jones argues, however, that three additional factors\n\nshould lead us to overturn the district court's finding that his\n\n\n4\n   Agent Wolf, who took over the questioning after Agent Boucher,\nalso testified that Jones was calm and did not seem to be under the\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs.\n\n   We give no weight to Jones's halfhearted intimation that he may\nhave been under the influence of marijuana since the officers, upon\nentering Room 318, discovered evidence of marijuana having recently\nbeen smoked by at least one of the suite's several occupants.

First, he claims his consent could\n\nnot have been free or voluntary because neither Agent Boucher nor\n\nany other officer advised him of his right not to cooperate.              This\n\nargument is unavailing.       We have repeatedly held that the failure\n\nto advise a defendant of his right to refuse consent does not\n\nautomatically render such consent invalid.

In the relatively calm environment of the\n\nbedroom in which Jones had been placed, Agent Boucher read Jones\n\nhis Miranda rights, and Jones acknowledged that he understood each\n\nof them, agreed to cooperate, and was not apparently under the\n\ninfluence.   The district court did not clearly err in finding that\n\nJones appreciated the significance of giving consent despite the\n\nofficers' failure to advise him of his right to withhold such\n\nconsent.\n\n            Second, Jones contends that, while none of the officers\n\napplied    overt   coercion    on   him    to   induce   his   consent,   the\n\ncircumstances should be regarded as inherently coercive:            some ten\n\nto fifteen government agents, guns drawn, entered his hotel suite\n\nwithout knocking, handcuffed him, placed him in a separate room,\n\nand proceeded to interrogate him.

This argument also\n\nfails.       As   we    have   observed,        \"[a]lthough       sensitivity       to    the\n\nheightened        possibility      of     coercion         is    appropriate       when    a\n\ndefendant's consent is obtained during custody, 'custody alone has\n\nnever been enough in itself to demonstrate . . . coerced . . .\n\nconsent to search.'\"            Id.

Upon   the    officers'          entry,    Jones    and    his\n\nassociates surrendered to them without a struggle and no shots were\n\nfired.   Jones was then handcuffed and made to sit on the edge of a\n\nbed.     There     is    no    indication       in   the    record       that    Jones    was\n\nmistreated or placed in an uncomfortable position, or that Agent\n\nBoucher, Agent Bunch, or anyone else brandished a weapon, made\n\nthreatening       gestures,      or     spoke    threatening        words       during    the\n\ninterrogation.          Considering the several countervailing factors\n\noutlined above, we find that the circumstances here were not so\n\ninherently coercive as to render Jones's consent unknowing or\n\ninvoluntary, even when considered together with the officers'\n\nfailure to advise Jones of his right to refuse consent.\n\n             Third, Jones claims that any valid consent he may have\n\ngiven was confined to the bedroom in which he had been placed, and\n\ndid not extend to the kitchenette or the other rooms of the hotel\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\fsuite.

As in past cases, we state no view on whether the scope of\n\na given instance of consent is reviewed de novo or merely for clear\n\nerror, as in the circumstances of the present case we would affirm\n\nunder either standard.        See Marshall, 348 F.3d at 286 (citing\n\nMeléndez, 301 F.3d at 32 (noting the split in our sister circuits\n\non this question)); Turner, 169 F.3d at 87 n.4 (same).\n\n           Agent Boucher testified that he asked Jones for consent\n\nto search the \"motel room.\"        Jones responded with a simple \"yes.\"\n\nAs noted above, Room 318 was actually a suite with two bedrooms, a\n\nkitchenette, a living room, and a bathroom. Although Agent Boucher\n\ndid not specify which of these rooms he was seeking consent to\n\nsearch, Jones did not expressly confine his consent to the bedroom.\n\nThe district court found that Agent Boucher had \"made it reasonably\n\nclear that he sought consent to search the entire suite, not just\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fthe bedroom.\"    Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">763124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 n.11.         We agree.    An\n\nobjective observer of the transaction between Agent Boucher and\n\nJones would have understood the term \"motel room\" to encompass the\n\nwhole of Room 318, and not just the bedroom.            This is especially\n\ntrue considering that the officers had already viewed marijuana on\n\nthe living room table, in close proximity to the couch on which\n\nJones was sitting when they entered, and smelled marijuana smoke in\n\nthe air; it is reasonable to expect that Jones was aware that the\n\nofficers noticed this evidence of recent drug use.                  In this\n\ncontext,   a   reasonable   person    in    Jones's   position   would   have\n\nregarded Agent Boucher as requesting consent to search the whole\n\nsuite for additional drugs.\n\n           As such, the district court did not err in concluding\n\nthat Jones's consent extended to the entire suite, and it was not\n\nunreasonable for Agent Boucher and the other officers to conduct a\n\nsearch of the other rooms for drugs, including the kitchen cabinet.\n\nCf. Meléndez, 301 F.3d at 33 (dismantling and looking inside a\n\nspeaker did not exceed the scope of consent to search a room, as\n\n\"[t]he speaker was located in the area that [the consenting party]\n\nhad allowed the officers to search, and was a place in which the\n\nofficers could have reasonably suspected drugs to be hidden\").\n\nHaving dismissed Jones's challenge to his consent to search, we\n\nturn to his third and final assignment of error with respect to the\n\ndenial of his suppression motion.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f                      4. Marshal Cooper's Search of the Kitchen Cabinet\n\n            Jones argues that Marshal Cooper's search of the kitchen\n\ncabinet,    and     consequent   discovery       of   drugs   therein,    was   not\n\njustified as a protective sweep or under any other exception to the\n\nwarrant requirement.       The district court examined the timeline as\n\nestablished through the testimony of the various officers at the\n\nsuppression hearing, and found that the Government had established\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that Marshal Cooper actually\n\ndiscovered the drugs in the kitchen cabinet after Jones had given\n\nhis consent to Agent Boucher.             We have reviewed the officers'\n\ntestimony     and    conclude    that     this    finding     was   not   clearly\n\nerroneous.5    We briefly explain.\n\n            Agent Welsh and Marshal Cooper each testified that when\n\nthey entered Room 318, they saw marijuana in plain view on the\n\nliving room table.         Agent Welsh testified that he immediately\n\ndetained and handcuffed Jones, who was sitting on the living room\n\ncouch.     Jones was promptly taken into the bedroom, where Agent\n\nBoucher began the process of questioning him; according to Agent\n\nBoucher, the point at which Jones gave his consent was some ten to\n\nfifteen minutes after the officers' initial entry into Room 318.\n\nAgent Boucher then left the room and \"advised a couple of the\n\n\n\n5\n   With respect to the district court's analysis of the timing of\nthe consent, we apply the usual standard of review for factual\nfindings in a decision denying a motion to suppress -- that is,\nclear error review. See Marshall, 348 F.3d at 284.\n\n                                        -17-\n\fagents that we in fact had consent from Mr. Jones to search the\n\nmotel room.\"   Agent Wolf testified that he was one of those whom\n\nAgent Boucher informed.\n\n          According to Marshal Cooper, during this period the other\n\nofficers detained Jones's associates and performed a quick scan of\n\nthe suite to make sure there were no hidden persons.       Marshal\n\nCooper took responsibility for one of the detainees and initially\n\nhad him handcuffed and lying on the bathroom floor. Marshal Cooper\n\ntestified that, at this point, it occurred to him to announce to\n\nthe other officers that he had seen marijuana on the living room\n\ntable, in case they wanted to seek a search warrant.       Marshal\n\nCooper continued:   \"One of the officers told me at that point that\n\nit's okay, they already had consent.\"    Sometime soon thereafter,\n\nwhen Marshal Cooper was satisfied that the suite had been secured,\n\nhe attempted to relocate the detainee to the kitchenette, where he\n\nsearched the cabinet and found what he believed to be drugs.   The\n\ndistrict court credited Marshal Cooper's testimony and found that\n\nthe search occurred after Jones gave his consent.6\n\n          We see nothing in the record that would lead us to\n\nquarrel with this finding, much less to reach a \"strong, unyielding\n\n\n\n6\n   At a later point in Marshal Cooper's testimony, the Government\nasked again whether Marshal Cooper had learned of Jones's consent\nbefore attempting to relocate the detainee to the kitchenette.\nMarshal Cooper responded, \"I'm not sure,\" but immediately clarified\nthat \"I would think it was after.\" The district court obviously\ncredited this clarification. It did not clearly err in doing so.\n\n                               -18-\n\fbelief that a mistake has been made,\" as is required under the\n\napplicable standard of review.     C.G. ex rel. A.S., 513 F.3d at 284\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).       Because Marshal\n\nCooper's search of the kitchen cabinet occurred after Jones gave\n\nconsent and -- as affirmed above -- the scope of the consent\n\nextended to the kitchen cabinet, it was constitutionally valid.\n\nGiven this conclusion, we need not state a view on the district\n\ncourt's alternative ruling that the search was lawful in any event\n\nby virtue of the \"independent source\" doctrine.\n\n            Finding no infirmity in the denial of Jones's suppression\n\nmotion, we proceed to examine the challenges relating to his\n\nsentence.\n\n            B.   Sentencing\n\n            Jones raises two challenges to his sentence.      First, he\n\ncontends that the sentencing court erred in its calculation of the\n\nquantity of drugs attributable to him, which accounted for a base\n\noffense level of thirty-four. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3). Second,\n\nhe argues that the sentencing court erred in applying a further\n\ntwo-level upward adjustment to his base offense level for his role\n\nas   an   organizer,   leader,   manager,   or   supervisor   of   other\n\nparticipants in the drug-selling enterprise.       See id. § 3B1.1(c).\n\nWe again note the applicable standard of review, and then consider\n\nthese two challenges seriatim.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f                   1.    Standard of Review\n\n           A sentencing court's findings of fact -- including its\n\ncalculation of drug quantity -- are reviewed for clear error;\n\nquestions of law involved in sentencing determinations are reviewed\n\nde novo.

The Drug-Quantity Calculation\n\n           In determining drug quantity for purposes of calculating\n\na   defendant's   base   offense   level   under   the   Guidelines,   the\n\nsentencing court may attribute to the defendant \"all reasonably\n\nforeseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of\n\nthe criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3\n\ncmt. n.2(ii).      \"Thus, a drug dealer who engages in criminal\n\nactivity with others to further their collective interests may be\n\nheld liable for the quantities of drugs sold by his partners, if\n\nthose sales were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the\n\njointly undertaken actions.\"       Laboy, 351 F.3d at 582.        If the\n\nquantity of drugs actually seized does not reflect the full scale\n\nof the offense, the sentencing court may make a reasonable estimate\n\nof the total quantity involved.       See id. at 584 (citing U.S.S.G.\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f§ 2D1.1 cmt. n.12).     The Government must prove drug quantity by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.         Id. at 582.      We will uphold the\n\nsentencing court's estimate as long as it is reasoned and finds\n\nsupport in the record.      See id. at 583-84.\n\n          In adopting the PSR's recommendation, the sentencing\n\ncourt found Jones responsible for 4,174.16 kilograms of marijuana\n\nequivalent.7     This figure included 0.8 grams of powder cocaine\n\n(0.16 kilograms of marijuana equivalent) seized from Room 318, and\n\n25.8 grams of crack cocaine (516 kilograms of marijuana equivalent)\n\nestimated from what coconspirator Thomas told federal agents he had\n\nintroduced     into   the   southern   Maine   market    as   part   of   the\n\nconspiracy.8\n\n          The PSR estimated the remaining amount as 3,658 grams of\n\nheroin (3,658 kilograms of marijuana equivalent).             This quantity\n\n\n7\n    As there are different controlled substances involved, the\nprobation office converted each of the drugs into its \"marijuana\nequivalent,\" added the quantities, and looked up the total in the\ndrug quantity table in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\ncmt. n.10(B).\n8\n  Thomas told agents that, on at least three occasions, he went to\nNew Jersey and brought back \"hundreds\" of vials of crack cocaine to\nMaine. The PSR estimated conservatively that Thomas had made three\ntrips and brought back 100 vials per trip, at an average of 0.086\ngrams of crack cocaine per vial, for a total of 25.8 grams.\n\n    For unknown reasons, the PSR did not recommend that Jones's\nsentence reflect other drugs it determined had been seized from\nFoster, Thomas, customers including a confidential informant, and\nfrom Room 318, as well as a quantity of heroin a customer named\nWilliam Zinn admitted to having purchased from Jones.       These\namounted to 2.909 additional grams of crack cocaine and 15.512\ngrams of heroin.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fwas based mainly on the trial testimony of Foster that he received\n\nheroin from Jones and Thomas and distributed twenty bricks of\n\nheroin per week for twelve weeks from April to June 2005, and sixty\n\nbricks per week for twelve additional weeks from July to September\n\n2005, until Foster was arrested.                  A brick of heroin consists of\n\nfifty bags at 0.059 grams each,                   for a total of 2,832 grams\n\ndistributed     by    Foster.        The    PSR    then    determined     that    Jones\n\ncontinued in the conspiracy after the arrests of Foster and Thomas\n\non September 19, 2005, until Jones's own arrest at the TownePlace\n\nSuites     fourteen    weeks    later      on   December    29,   2005.      The   PSR\n\ncontinued:\n\n             However, as there is no evidence of the\n             quantities distributed during this time frame\n             and the impact . . . the arrest of [Jones's]\n             co-defendant's [sic] had on his ability to\n             continue to distribute large amounts (60\n             bricks a week), the Probation Office has used\n             the conservative amount of 20 bricks a week.\n\nTwenty bricks per week for the fourteen weeks from September 19,\n\n2005, to December 29, 2005, produced a total of 826 grams.                       Added\n\nto   the    estimate    of     the   amount       Foster    distributed     for    the\n\nconspiracy, the total came to 3,658 grams of heroin, or 3,658\n\nkilograms of marijuana equivalent.\n\n             This amount added to the 516.16 kilograms of marijuana\n\nequivalent in crack and powder cocaine produced a grand total of\n\n4,174.16 kilograms of marijuana equivalent.                  The sentencing court\n\nfound the facts presented in the PSR to be credible, and opined\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fthat \"in all likelihood the amounts were probably greater than that\n\nset forth in the [PSR] and I find those quantities.\"            In other\n\nwords, the sentencing court found Jones responsible for 4,174.16\n\nkilograms.\n\n           In challenging this finding, Jones argues that the real\n\nweight   attributable   to   him   should   be   2,176.20   kilograms   of\n\nmarijuana equivalent; he explained how he reached this figure in\n\nhis brief and again at oral argument.       Jones also alleges that the\n\n826 grams the PSR attributed to him for September to December 2005\n\nis \"pure speculation.\"       Jones's estimated quantity -- 2,176.20\n\nkilograms -- would result in a base offense level of thirty-two.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4).\n\n           Yet even if we assume that Jones has provided us and the\n\nsentencing court with a plausible estimate of the drug quantity\n\nattributable to him, he cannot prevail.          This is because we find\n\nthe PSR's estimate also to be generally plausible and that it\n\nenjoys a preponderance of record support primarily in the trial\n\ntestimony of Foster. The sentencing court was therefore within its\n\ndiscretion when it chose the PSR's estimate over Jones's estimate.\n\nSee United States v. Marks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200982\"><a href=\"/opinion/200982/united-states-v-marks/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           We say \"generally\" plausible because we do agree with\n\nJones in one respect.     We are dissatisfied with the PSR's poorly\n\nreasoned conclusion that Jones was responsible for 826 grams of\n\nheroin (826 kilograms of marijuana equivalent) distributed between\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fSeptember and December 2005, a finding for which the PSR conceded\n\n\"there is no evidence\" but that the sentencing court nonetheless\n\nadopted.    Yet we need not decide whether such adoption was clearly\n\nerroneous, because any error that may have occurred was harmless.\n\nThe threshold quantity that triggers a base offense level of\n\nthirty-four -- that which Jones received -- is 3,000 kilograms of\n\nmarijuana   equivalent.     U.S.S.G.    §   2D1.1(c)(3).     Even   if   we\n\nsubtracted 826 from 4,174.16, the total found by the sentencing\n\ncourt, we would still be left with 3,321.16 kilograms, and Jones\n\nwould receive the same base offense level.

The § 3B1.1(c) Two-Level Increase\n\n            The Guidelines provide for an upward adjustment to a\n\ndefendant's base offense level due to the relative importance of\n\nhis role in the offense.

While this showing is not a particularly onerous one to\n\nmake, it is not enough that the defendant merely controlled,\n\norganized,    or    managed      criminal   activities,   but     must   instead\n\ncontrol, organize, or manage criminal actors.             Ramos-Paulino, 488\n\nF.3d at 464.\n\n             After hearing the parties' arguments, the sentencing\n\ncourt found that the Government had satisfied the requirements of\n\n§ 3B1.1(c) by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n             I've taken into account the evidence in this\n             case including the nature of this offense, the\n             fact that [Jones] was directing his runners,\n             the fact that I believe he was given a greater\n             share   of  the   monies   involved  in   this\n             conspiracy, the fact that he was the key\n             planner and organizer of the conspiracy, the\n             others were basically runners for him, and his\n             degree of control and authority and I think\n             the two level enhancement is modest in this\n             case based on my understanding of the evidence\n             . . . .\n\nJones takes issue with this determination.             He argues that, while\n\nhe supplied his alleged accomplices with drugs to sell, there was\n\nno evidence presented at trial to show that he recruited any of\n\nthem, that he collected a disproportionate share of the proceeds of\n\nthe drug-selling venture, or that he exercised any control or\n\nauthority over the accomplices' activities.                    Instead, a drug\n\nsupplier in New York oversaw the venture.\n\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\f            This argument is unavailing.     There is an abundance of\n\nevidence in the record -- including in the trial testimony of\n\nFoster and several federal agents -- to support the sentencing\n\ncourt's finding that Jones coordinated the actions of a number of\n\ndrug sellers including, most importantly, Thomas and Foster. Jones\n\nessentially controlled the supply of the drugs to these persons,\n\nand determined to a considerable extent when and where they would\n\nmake deliveries.        This is more than sufficient to satisfy the\n\nGovernment's modest burden under § 3B1.1(c).      In spite of Jones's\n\nassertions to the contrary, § 3B1.1(c) does not require a showing\n\nthat he recruited accomplices or received a disproportionate share\n\nof the proceeds. The sentencing court therefore committed no error\n\nin finding Jones to be an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\n\nof at least one other criminal actor, and the two-level enhancement\n\nwas justified.    Jones's sentence stands.\n\n                            III.   Conclusion\n\n            For these reasons, we affirm Jones's conviction and\n\nsentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\f</pre>",
